        "review_detailed_main": "India's official entry to the Oscars - Barfi! might as well have been an acronym for: Breathtaking (cinematography), Astounding (acting), Ruthless (breaking of stereotypes about the disabled), Fantastic (music), and Invigorating (feeling in your heart as you leave the theater).\n\nThis is essentially a love triangle between Barfi (played endearingly by Ranbir Kapoor), a hearing and speech impaired son of a poor chauffeur, Jhilmil (played brilliantly by Priyanka Chopra), an autistic girl almost abandoned by her rich parents, and Shruti the narrator of the tale of love (played convincingly by debutante Illeana De Cruz), the soon to be married tourist visiting Darjeeling along with her parents.\n\nThe writer and director - Anurag Basu uses non linear storytelling to traverse between 1972, 1978, and 2012 Darjeeling, Calcutta, and little known places of Bengal as they three protagonists try and grapple with Love and its various heart rendering implications to their lives. For a film with hardly any dialogs, 'Barfi!' amazingly manages to say a lot, using a combination of sign language, facial expressions, first person narration, and sometimes simply stunning silences to convey a gamut of emotions.\n\nSeveral sequences stand out for their sheer brilliance, be it Barfi's reaction at Shruti's choice of her fianc\u00e9 (Jishu Sengupta in a small but significant role), Shruti and her mother's (played beautifully by the veteran Roopa Ganguly) exchanges on certain choices in Love, Barfi and Jhilmil's night in the forest illuminated by fireflies, Barfi's cutting off of the lamp posts to test the loyalty of his friends, Jhilmil's fantasy about getting married as she watches a 'Chau Dance' in a village, Daju's (Haradhan in a superb supporting role) tear stricken face as he finally accepts Jhilmil's fate and let's her go, the unfolding of the photograph's at Shruti's house to finally reveal the truth about her entire life, and lastly, the finale. All these, and many more, are sure to be etched as a memory, not in your mind, but rather in your heart.\n\nThis film shows how one can find happiness in the small things in life, and how disabilities, be in financial, mental, or physical can never really appear as a handicap to an otherwise soaring spirit that does not know how to give up on life. This film reminds us that falling in Love is natural, while staying in Love a decision that must be taken with the heart, rather than the mind. And finally, this is a film that tries, without trying too hard, to help you understand that the language of Love does not necessarily require the wisdom of words.\n\nOne might argue that certain portions of the film are 'inspired' from other films. For example, certain dialogs between Shruti and her mother might remind you of the Notebook, certain mannerisms of Barfi as he tries his best to escape the bungling cop (played aptly by Saurabh Shukla) cause you to recollect sequences from the films of Charlie Chaplin, while the way Barfi tries to entertain Jhilmil & Shruti remind you of Singing in The Rain and Mr Bean. Yet, Barfi manages to stand on its own for the way it interprets these classic scenes and the logicality of their inclusion in the proceedings.\n\nThe Hair and Makeup department, however, especially when it tries to show the same actors playing aged characters, is the only one that takes a slight dent. Yet almost everything else manages to come together in unison to more than compensate for this slight glitch. And it does so, at numerous places managing to make you think, smile, cry, and sigh, sometimes all at the same time, and in quick succession.\n\nWatch it for the performances (especially that of Ranbir and Priyanka), the vision of the director Anurag Basu and cinematographer Ravi Varman, the terrific score of the music director Pritam Chakravarty, and last but not the least for the innumerable ways in which Love has been expressed between the characters. Trust me - this is the perfect example of art that can forever stay in your heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was not actually very keen to watch Barfi. The trailers intrigued me enough to go for it but till the last time I was unsure if it would be any good. And then on a boring Friday I found myself waiting in queue for a 3.05PM show. And I do not regret my decision.\n\nStory/Theme: I'm not sure how to tell the story without giving anything. Let me then take the help of IMDb here.\n\nThree young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by society's norms of normal and abnormal\n\nActually, giving any more would spoil the movie for you.\n\nCharacter Development:Once in a while there comes a movie which consists of characters not stars. But, it takes a master to make his puppets grow in the short span of 2hrs and 33mins and make people feel the change. Barfi is such a movie where you could observe the characters changing with time, maturing, being tolerant to each other with passing time. Though Barfi is the central character of the movie still, Jhilmil, Shruti and Inspector are well crafted and given ample scope to go through changes. Anurag basu gets full marks from me here.\n\nDirection: Day by day directors are understanding the value of freedom and Anurag Basu once again proved that. Even though having powerful stars and big banner for his last movie Kites various restrictions took away the artistic freedom from him and we got a flop movie. This time he showed what a master director he is. Look at the character of Barfi. How beautifully its crafted. His mannerisms, gestures, postures all are shot with utmost care. Then take Jhilmil's character. An autistic girl. Who gets tangled in the Barfi's life. They fall in love and discover love in their own way. It had the risk of being a \"Koshish\" anyday. A lucrative trap for making a tearjerker, emotional serious drama but Anurag Basu took the risk of walking on rope here. He subtly showed the pain of the characters through comedy. And there he wins hands down. Then there is Shruti and confused normal person. Who gets lost in the world of few 'abnormal' persons and never survived fully. And, hats off for choosing Saurav Shukla as Inspector. He's a revelation in this movie. Other supporting casts are also good but coming out of theater I bet you would remember only these. And, the subtle touch of live background score...an intelligent touch :)\n\nScreenplay: The movie narration does not go in linear motion. We get jump cuts, flashback within flashbacks and stories from different key characters. I don't know if many would appreciate such story telling. Screenplay is neat, dialogs are few and far between. Silence plays a bigger role in this movie.\n\nActing: I'm speechless here. Every actor seemed to be acted in this movie considering this is their last chance to prove themselves. Ranbir proved his level in Rockstar already...but Priyanaka just took reinvented herself. A very strong but sidelined character she played here. The focus was never on her but whenever she got scope she just marveled it. Kudos to her and Kudos to Anurag Basu to show us what Priyanka could do. Barfi for Priyanka is going to be what \"Jab we Met\" is to Kareena. Then, the next gem of the movie is Saurabh Shukla. Another brilliant performance. Ileana as Shruti also did well.\n\nCinematography: The movie is a visual poetry. Every frame is such beautiful that reminded me \"Raavan\" by Santosh Shivan. After a few searches I found out the man behind this poetry and he is Mr. Ravi Varman. Just remember this name. Because if you watch the movie you are obvious to search who was the man behind camera.\n\nSongs and background score: Songs are good, specially \"Main Kaya Karoon\". And, nice melodic background score. Best thing is the story does not stop when the songs happen. The songs just help enrich the moment on-screen.\n\nEditing: In theater few were complaining about the length of the movie. I on the other hand think its the way it was meant to be. Such movies are best told in slowly, like a poetry. Such that every scene, every dialog leaves mark in your mind.\n\nVerdict: Reading this far it might seem its nothing but a romance between two invalids and Anurag Basu emotionally blackmailed you in the movie to love it. But what I've not told you is how much laugh riot it is, how this is even a thriller or how beautiful this movie is. All in all, a movie that gives the pleasure of listening a complete story. A movie to watch with your family. A movie where if you take your girlfriend does not stop saying \"how cute!\"\n\nGo, watch Barfi!. Watch the best movie of 2012."

        "review_detailed_main": "Love needs expressions not language, it requires feelings no boundaries, it's beyond oceans beyond limits- Free and Beautiful but only few know how to live it. Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color \u2013Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family.\n\nBarfi ! Essentially is a chapter of life which has numerable good moments to recall, laugh and to love with. Every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music, performances, direction and screenplay.\n\nAnurag Basu- the director has done extraordinary work in terms of narrating the story. Like 'Inception' his narrative style takes you in flashback and a flashback within a flashback to narrate a simple story in its most impactful form without creating confusions to audience. Every story has been woven perfectly till climax. Despite the destiny of characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments, cheer, laughs, true love and sacrifice. Each and every prank on screen gives you a bucketful humor and feel good factor whether it's Barfi-cop chase or Barfi's effort to impress Jhilmil and Shruti throughout the movie.\n\nRanbir Kapoor- Well this guy has redefined himself, and the only commercial cinema star of recent time who knows how to act dances and laugh with perfection. Whether it was 'wake up sid', 'Raajneeti'or 'Rockstar' with every movie he has successfully set benchmark for himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even for so called Khans and Roshans. The beauty of his character is despite being deaf and dump in the movie not a single moment you will realize that he even require to speak. His expressions are heartwarming and simply outstanding.\n\nPriyanka Chopra \u2013 Luckily we have a pool of talented actress these days and Priyanka Chopra with this movie will give a tough challenge to her peers. Her expressions as an autism child are natural and clean. Her feelings for Ranbir as a lady could be easily readable and this is undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career.\n\nIleana D'Cruz \u2013 She is one of the best debut of this year. Extremely good looking and charming, she never gives the feeling of a debutant. She does her job perfectly as a narrator and as an actor.\n\nBarfi is a way of life, it has potential to make you laugh without getting dirty, it has power to make you cry without getting dramatic and it has energy to teach you love for all without being a documentary. Barfi is perfect in all sense. And for those who could ask why I have written an inch away from Masterpiece ,well being a critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as the wedding bells rings in the end it was obvious that Barfi has crossed that inch of perfection\u0085 It's a Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.\n\nThanks & Regards Yours AVA For Complete Review Please VISIT www.thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome"

Ranbir, Priyanka and Illena were spot on. Though a lot of credit to be given to anurag basu. Most of the gags were new.\n\nSeriously I didn't expected the story to be so twisted in the middle but again credit to Mr Basu, the way he streamlined at the end.\n\nFantastic.\n\nPeople this is definitely one of the bestest movie released in bollywood. Lot of intelligent directors are doing great job, kashyap, basu etc.\n\nMust watch 10/10"

        "review_title": "Thoroughly enjoyable fable, light & bubbly...",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is a fable, a beautifully shot, light, airy, bubbly fable. It will make you laugh. A lot. And cry, or mist up, a little. If you're still not a fan of Ranbir, you will walk away as one. And the background songs just don't stop playing in your head.\n\nThere are some deeper layers, as well. Why is it in India that we cannot take care of our disabled children ? Why do we get threatened by them, so scared of social approbation that we are willing to abandon our own flesh and blood, despite having the means to look after them ? Why is it that playing safe seems to be ingrained in our blood ? In love, 9 times out of 10, we will choose the guy who is rich and doesn't make us cry to the guy who is poor but makes us laugh ?\n\nRanbir, a deaf, mute, has never let this inhibit him. He is always happy and always upto something, not all if it legal, much to the chagrin of the local cop, Saurabh Shukla, who blames him singlehandedly for reducing his waist size from a respectable 52 to a mundane 42. He falls in love with the elite, gorgeous girl, visiting Darjeeling, Ileana. She is engaged to be married to Jishu, a prize catch, the dream of every girl in college. But she has never encountered anyone as free spirited as Ranbir.\n\nRanbir, though, is the son of a lowly driver. Who works for another elite, powerful family. Who have an autistic daughter, Priyanka. Who has been left in an old age home, Muskaan, run by the gentle, ageing, Haradhan Bandhopadhyay. When Priyanka's nana, the man who runs the house with an iron fist, but has a soft corner for his grand daughter, decides to bring her back due to his ill health, the lives of all the characters get affected and change\u0085\n\nThe photography and the music is so good that I'm out of superlatives here. Am sure tourist traffic to Darjeeling is going to increase and the music of this film will be played many years from now, a rarity in todays world, where songs struggle for a shelf life beyond three months. Am not so sure about the editing. The flashbacks, the talking heads. Not sure they were needed in a story which was reasonably fast paced and as entertaining as this. Its almost become a fad now, to not tell a story linearly\u0085\n\nRanbir is amazing. Gets every expression just right. Whether his happy face, the ridiculous expressions he uses to make others laugh, his angry 'speech', or his bewildered look when things go wrong, as they have a tendency to do with him. Ileana is stunning in western dresses, early on in the film. She is nice as the adarsh Bengali nari later on, but didn't think much of her older avatar. Undeniably a great actress. Priyanka proves her acting chops once again, conveying her battles with her inner demons appropriately\n\nSpecial praise for Saurabh Shukla. The film would've been flat without his Hardy to Ranbir's Laurel. Or Bhola Raja Sapkota, Ranbir's comrade in arms and translator in chief. Or Rupa Ganguly, Ilena's mother, who understands her daughter's predicament and does what she thinks is best for her.\n\nAmongst the moments of the film are the opening credits (set to the song 'Film shuru), the comic chase sequences between Saurabh and Ranbir. The Darjeeling scenes between Ranbir and Ileana \u2013 on the train, or cycle or even the horse. And the scene when Haradhan bawls his eyes out, when the apple of his eye, Priyanka leaves the ashram, is just touching beyond belief.\n\nAfter a long time, a film which doesn't just show perfect, rich, urban people. But people who, despite their imperfections, seem determined to be happy. There is a lesson in there for all of us. More at ww.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi is that gem which has the capacity of making blood in your heart rush just like children rush through the school gates at the ring of bell. All you have to do is to open yourself and let it do the magic.\n\nIt offers everything that is there to take from a pure cinematic experience: real characters, genuine relationships, a simple yet poignant story and a soulful score. It offers much more th an this if you can indulge yourself into it a little more. It has acting that connects you straight with the characters and makes you feel for/with them; each frame is a lyrical composition not only by the presence of colors but through their absence as well, the screenplay is such that it either allows the emotions to be overwhelming or would take you out of the scene (completely depends on the viewer).\n\nI can only wish to visit the Darjeeling of 70's as portrayed in the movie and I am sure Basu would not have had any problems filming the Kolkata part of the movie as it is the only city which has majority of its elements from that period still intact (No pun intended). Basu has always been good at using earthly elements in his scenes and he reinforces that here too. The manner in which rain, texture of clouds, stones, bright sun have been used to complement various moods in scenes is just exemplary.\n\nWhat makes this movie a winner is the unending list of scenes which will make you laugh, cry and sometimes do both at the same time. Dialogue through expression and enactment has been integrated so beautifully in the movie that you sometimes forget that you are watching a movie where two of the protagonists are incapable of communicating conventionally. It's a movie which celebrates one of the most prized feelings of each human being: the joy of being loved, through a story of people who could have easily decided not to embrace it. Priyanka is at her uninhibited best and Ileana plays her bit to the tee. Needless to say that no other present day actor could have done justice to the role of Barf!\n\nVisit http://imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in/ for more filmy experiences!"

Basu's Screenplay is a terrific mix of romance, slap-stick comedy & suspense. Basu's Screenplay never falters & appeals all through. Basu's Direction, on the other-hand, is proficient. Cinematography is outstanding. Editing is sharp. Music by Pritam is brilliant. Amongst the musician's best soundtracks to date. Art Design is proper.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Ranbir Kapoor is a fearless actor & he presents Barfi superbly. The versatile actor lives the utterly lovable protagonist to the fullest. Amongst Ranbir's Best Performances! Priyanka Chopra is another topper. She plays the easy to love autistic character matchlessly. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Saurabh Shukla is mesmerizing in a strong supporting role. Shukla hasn't been this good in a long, long time! Ashish Vidyarthi does well. Others lend perfect support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Barfi!' is a Must See."

        "review_title": "Sorry, for me its more a Priyanka's masterpiece than a Ranbir's triumph.",
        "review_detailed_main": "There were two main reasons why I wished to see BARFI after watching his promotional trailers. One it was the Raj Kapoor kind of a silent Chaplin act perfectly done by his talented grandson Ranbir Kapoor and two, the gorgeous Ileana D'Cruz making her debut in a Hindi film posing as a Bengali girl. Hence I entered the theater with these limited expectation of mine and then came out largely satisfied with a pleasant surprise which was not at all expected, quite honestly.\n\nThe delightful surprise was that contrary to all the praises being showered upon Ranbir Kapoor in so many high star reviews in the media, for me the film was more a milestone achievement of Priyanka Chopra than the over-publicized classy triumph of Ranbir. Undoubtedly Ranbir is there with one of his career best performances as the dumb and deaf boy who falls in love with an autistic girl. But truly speaking, I found the depth missing in his written character throughout the film which resurfaces and touches you deep inside only in the last 20 minutes and not before that.\n\nNow basic reason behind this perception of mine is that first of all BARFI has a confusing and less focused script which keeps wandering between comedy and sympathy in an imbalanced manner. Plus the story has many more avoidable angles of greed, murder and mystery which take the focus out of its main theme and you feel distracted. In other words, both before and after intermission it is more like a collage of different comic scenes which get the complete support from its actors, cinematography and background score. So you do enjoy them till they last on the screen but still don't get a collective major impact of the movie in the end as always seen in such ventures having a lovingly emotional conclusion.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film has been widely appreciated both by the reviewers and listeners. But here too I found the lyrical beauty of the songs much ahead than their melody part, which could have taken them to a different height altogether. So for that matter, it isn't a METRO and I personally feel that one might enjoy the lyrics as mere poetry much more than the songs recorded for some special situations. However I did enjoy the title track and the ghazal on the screen as it made a better impact together in the script.\n\nTaking up the most talked about feature of this movie i.e. its performances; I strongly feel that it is a wrongly publicized project giving all the emphasis to only its one lead character, taking the limelight away from all the other deserved candidates in the film. May be its a strategy planned by the makers to sell it as a Ranbir Kapoor movie (which is sure going to get them sure shot buyers and viewers), but for me BARFI is arguably a Priyanka movie much more than a Ranbir Kapoor film. In fact Priyanka surprised me as a shock since I was never expecting such an authentic and touching portrayal of an autistically challenged girl by the lady who has come a long way from an International beauty contest winner model turning into an actress. Her performance in BARFI is undoubtedly her career best till date and I would even like to rate it a step above than Ranbir too because of a basic reason.\n\nRanbir Kapoor in BARFI, as revealed in its promos is simply exceptional and there is no second opinion about that. The boy reminds you of two great masters of their art, Raj Kapoor and Charlie Chaplin with his single act. But his outstanding performance is mainly dependent upon all the comic sequences with which he regularly provides the much needed laughter in the film based on such challenging characters. The viewers enjoy watching him mostly because he is more or less entertaining them with his novel face making techniques, innocent gestures and Chaplin- like sequences. But Priyanka doesn't get that kind of comfort zone in her character and that's what gives her an edge over the more likable act of Ranbir posing as Barfi.\n\nCompleting the triangle there is another extremely talented girl from the South, Ileana D'Cruz, who straight away announces that she is much ahead than many reputed Hindi film actresses both in the terms of beauty and talent. Supporting the three, there is Saurabh Shukla in his famous form, Rupa Ganguly with her sensitive approach to life and other actors who add their own sparkles to the film with their small but notable acts.\n\nDirector Anurag Basu once again shows his regained abilities which were simply not there in his KITES. With BARFI he has bounced back strongly hitting a big score but still it cannot be called a clear century from the veteran in my opinion. Continuing with his trademark musicians visible in several scenes, the director has extracted some milestones performances from his lead actors and has made a largely satisfying project which is sure to get appreciation from all corners. However personally I found Anurag at his best only when Ranbir, Priyanka and Illeana get together in the film till its final sequence, which actually is the most impactful part of the movie as I felt.\n\nTo conclude, BARFI is indisputably one of those few films which do have some exceptional, career best performances given under a fine direction. But it still somehow fails to generate a collective impact on the viewer in the end, missing the target with only a small margin.\n\nYet, there is one message which I always take back home after watching movies made on such differently abled characters\u0085\u0085\u0085and that's giving \"A BIG THANKS\" to the Almighty above, for blessing us with a sound mind existing in a sound complete body. So do watch it and remember to give your own thanks to the One Above as the end credits start rolling."

It's now a money grabbing fight for those hundered of crores. So why does 'Anurag Basu comes up with a movie like 'BARFI' where his lead actor or actress does not get to have any dialogues or lines to speak where they can get those hooting and the whistles from the public (like the usual 'one liners' which are religiously followed in Bollywood). Well, to tell you, it does not matter one bit because 'BARFI' beautifully manages to hold you despite being more of a 'Silent Cinema'.\n\nBARFI is the story of a deaf and mute boy played by Ranbir Kapoor, through which Anurag Basu tries to gives us a message that, we all are surrounded with happinness all around us, it's just that we are strangled up so much in our daily life of artificial complexities that we don't recognize the little any tiny things that are capable of giving us immense happinness, peace and comfort. Priyanka Chopra's character too is one which is suffering from a disease known as 'Autism'. It's a disorder of one's neural system. Priyanka plays the character of the disabled girl with absolute brilliance where we can really feel for her. She easily manages to hold the audiences at their perfect nerve.\n\nBARFI is mostly a 'Silent film, where almost the entire movie is in narrative, but, this really does not even slightly affects it in any bad way and therefore hats off to Anurag, Ranbir, Priyanka and Pritam (Music Director) for that. The movie has got arguably the most soulful music of 2012. A movie in which you don't have any verbal connection among the lead actors, the music does that part in a very justified manner. The bond of Ranbir and Priyanka gets strengthenend inside the minds of the audiences mainly because of the soulful music which sounds abolutely soothing to the ear.\n\nBarfi may be a movie not for everyone. The movie has its certain drawbacks. There are quite a few moments in the film which tends to bore the audience at more than one instances. That said, it is certainly not a movie to miss out. There are a number of sequences where you will laugh your hearts out.\n\nTalking about Ranbir Kapoor, his acting skills has polished up so vividly that its so much fascinating to see. Ever since 'Rocket Singh' his skill as an actor has improved a lot. Ranbir who was just awesome in 'Rockstar' , plays this deaf and mute character surprisingly with so much ease and charm. This is among the best performances given by both Ranbir as well as Priyanka recently. As far as Illeana D'Cruz, I really did'nt find her connecting with the plot of the film at any stage. Although, the screen presence of Illeana may be more than that of Priyanka but Priyanka easily takes you away with her innocence. There are times when you want to see more of Ranbir and Priyanka moments rather than with Illeana.\n\nBarfi really could have been a great film but what kills it is its runtime. Its too long, which adds up the boredom and enables the audiences to yawn a bit too.\n\nWell , Otherwise Barfi is certainly a must watch. You will not hate it ,though its not guaranteed that you will really love it. Decide for yourself, I liked it. Its a sincere effort from Anurag Basu and his team to present to the public one of the most pure and innocent film for 2012. Watch it for Ranbir and Priyanka."

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi , well its a movie which I had been waiting for long. I perceive Barfi as an academy award winner as it brings out the cinematic excellence and emanates the highest attributes of human creativity. It speaks though its silent. Barfi is effortless , it flows smoothly from overture to crescendo. The comedy is so subtle and full of sweet subterfuges. Its an epitome of innocence. I will not reveal anything about the plot but the plot is superb with very miniature flaws that I would not like to notice in the purview of such momentous acting, editing, background scores and mellifluous songs. The narration in the movie is intriguing and funny as well in a sense that keeps the viewer hooked. Songs are well in place, situational comedy is more than appropriate , nothing seems imposed , every scene seems to have taken its own natural course. The movie is set in Darjeeling way back 1970. Ranbir has exuded his panache with excellent acting. Priyanka actually has evolved with this movie and she is all set to move to next level. The screenplay of the movie is amazing, the events are well woven , the movie flip-flops between past and present and the narration makes it very clear, there is no place where events confuse the viewer. Well as a final verdict I would say that I felt cathartic after watching the movie , I expunged all maturity and I found solace in craziness, the movie exposed me to simplicity of life and helped me to appreciate who I am. Must Watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi - CATCH IT (A-) Barfi, an unlikely love triangle of a normal girl, mute boy and autism girl. This is an unlikely combination, which Doesn't seems like to work in Indian Cinema but things have been changed and great success of Barfi proves that even if the hero and heroine are not stereotypical a good story can lead to utmost success. Barfi is not a perfect movie, it was too long and becomes complicated as we travel back and forth between 1976, 1979 and 2012. Besides that life being so easy and cheerful for a mute boy and autism girl is hard to accept, there is a time they live alone for 6 months in big Calcutta city, he can't talk and she doesn't understand but apparently they are happier than ever, how they communicate with world is not explained. Anyways I know it's a movie and i should not go onto that much dept. So, kudos to Anurag Basu for making and attempting a brave subject matter. Ranbir Kapoor is great as always, though his performance is almost the same as in a movie \"Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani\" with Katrina Kaif \"where he tries to get her affection\". This time he was only mute. Priyanka Chopra did a fine job and looked the part. Ileana D'Cruz is a fresh faced beautiful girl. Standing next to too famous young actors and still getting noticed is a huge achievement. In the end, Barfi maybe long but it's fresh, beautiful and heartening."

It is entertaining, genuine, bringing a fresh and worthwhile love story to life in a very Unique way that many others have tried and failed. You will laugh till u cry n cry , till u laugh again.\n\nBarfi simplicity is delightfully misleading- the script is a masterpiece of most sensible comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central trio is magical. Ranvir kapor comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty, sensitivity and vulnerability that make you fall in love with his character.\n\nThis is one of the most unique, and beautiful film which will make you laugh, It will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile. Never seen any film so so sensitive yet so comic.\n\nI rated Barfi 10 out of 10 because I feel that it has really accomplished what movies like this should accomplish."

This was RK's best performance till date..Priyanka Chopra portrayed her part brilliantly but it was pleasantly shocking to see a south girl doing so good..Ileana was the soothing factor amidst the madness of Barfi n Jhilmil!Good to see Saurabh Shukla back.. Pritam comes back with a bang..all his songs are good to the ears n suit the movie as well.. last but not the least we talk about Anurag Basu..after Kites's disaster i thought he might be lost..he just nails this one..\n\nSpecial mention:Cinematographer Ravi Varman.."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Barfi!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Ranbir Kapoor's career is about 5 years old, but he has in recent years been extremely selective about his roles. And this meticulousness perhaps stemmed from his modest Saawariya debut which didn't garner as much acclaim as, say the rest of Bollywood's stars in his generation such as Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, and Ranvir SinghXXX. So while his career may not have started off with a bang, his roles to date have always been roles that make you sit up and take notice. Other than Anjaana Anjaani which also co-starred Priyanka Chopra, his scheming politician in Raajneeti, his bearded salesman in Rocket Singh, and of course, his Rockstar turn, have all been powerhouses, and goes to show he's tops amongst his peers in the industry in constantly reinventing himself and breathing life to the characters he plays.\n\nIn Barfi!, he challenges himself with the role of a deaf mute, as the titular character whom his parents named after the Murphy Radio set, but for his condition, he only managed something like the title when asked of his name. But he endears himself to the townsfolk with his antics, which has shades of being Tati-esque and Chaplin-ish, and Ranbir does what would be his best impressions and homage to those two great comic greats with his role. But in true Bollywood fashion, writer-director Anurag Basu, like his previous film Kites, are never just steeped in one genre, and Barfi! actually contained two extraordinary romances, with all round great performances undoubtedly with Ranbir stepping up his act. The physical comedy gets balanced with rich emotions, and similar to Rockstar in certain shades, Barfi starts off in very sprightly fashion, before darker emotions come into play. And without the use of his voice, Ranbir has to very much exercise his facial muscles and physical presence, to bring the character to life.\n\nAnd also stepping up is Priyanka Chopra, who is a much better actress than most people would give her credit for. She had shown her versatility in 2 films, playing 12 characters in What's Your Rashee, and up to 7 more challenging ones in 7 Khoon Maaf, but nothing she had done had ever prepare her for this role as Jhilmil, the autistic child in a rich landowning family in Darjeeling. Dropping her usual glamorous self, she tones it really down to play a woman- child afflicted of the condition, and yet making it endearing and very much her own, without going overboard in her portrayal. It's as vividly true as can be, and becomes the fulcrum in which the story revolves around. The role called for some wide-eyed innocence, vulnerability and some fearlessness rolled into one, and she conquered this role quite effortlessly. Her initial pairing with Ranbir Kapoor in Anjaana Anjaani didn't produce the necessary sparks given that both were playing very tired modern roles, but here, both showed why they are currently at the top of their game.\n\nAnd added to the fray as narrator, Barfi's first love and third cog in the Barfi-Jhimil relationship is Bollywood newcomer Ileana D'cruz as Shruti. The first half of the film centered upon Barfi's love for this beauty who had just arrived in town, but lo and behold, in this 70s era, she's already betrothed to someone else, and in Darjeeling to enter into marriage. For what it's worth, societal norms had dictated she see through an arranged marriage rather than to accept Barfi's advances, but bookending this film, is how Fate decided to constantly put them in each other's paths, with fairly different outcomes. But Ileana is not flower vase here, and as if challenged by the other two leads, also had to up the ante in her delivery, making it quite a memorable debut\n\nAnurag Basu's story took on more complex proportions to tell a simple tale of romance, and the narrative at points also became like a docu-drama, where key characters in Barfi's life gets interviewed, and forms the narrative when it flashes back to key incidents, told in non- linear style. This works very well, especially when wrapped within, there's a crime mystery that centers around a kidnapping, with three ransoms, and a cliffhanger of sorts that would leave you guessing. It allowed all characters to have screen time to show what they can do, and most would been tickled pink with Barfi's delivery of amusement and fun for the girl of his dreams, before events start to really go south for the titular character. The quality in the production values show, especially with the 70s era that blended CG and production sets quite seamlessly.\n\nThis heartwarming tale is set to move and touch, because it deals with the notion of choices in life, and how sometimes these choices would have varying repercussions that we will not know their impact, until much later. I can't harp enough on all the actor's delivery, because they are what made Barfi! very much what it was - cute, touching and romantic, all at the same time, with tinges of sadness that depicts what's life. I guarantee the final few scenes in the film will make one's heart ache, because it bordered on selfishness and magnanimity, and surely you wouldn't want to be in anyone's shoes when faced with such a decision.\n\nAnurag Basu has a winner in his hands, and that's without resorting to sex or violence, but a healthy dose of charm instead. And Barfi! will charm your socks off. A definite contender amongst the best this year has to offer!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It does not revolutionize Bollywood in any way nor is it an example of superlative cinematic brilliance. There are flaws, and lots of them. But, at the same time it's a lesson in the long-lost art of simple filmmaking without being pretentious. The effort is so genuinely heartwarming that it comes out through the characters in the film. I've been extremely critical of Ranbir Kapoor in the past. Maybe he is dumb, but he can surely act! In Junior Kapoor, we do see glimpses of his grandfather. His goofiness is so bloody infectious. He does not play the sympathy-card, he just lets the film carry him along instead of trying what Bollywood heroes desperately try to do - to carry the film on their shoulders. The character is central, not the hero. One of the very few Hindi films I've seen where the audience connects with the character, and not the hero. Ileana is effortlessly sweet and quite unexpectedly brilliant. Saurabh Shukla delivers a standout and stellar performance. The strength of the film lies in the characterisation - so under-toned, and pitch-perfect to counter-balance the trappings of melodrama. The cinematography is breathtaking and so is the music. The visual imagery adds to the emotional quotient of the film. The earnestness of Anurag Basu does suffer a blow because of the predictability of the plot since the temptation of repetitiveness unwittingly underwhelms the magic created in the first half, and, of course, the disappointing performance of Priyanka Chopra. Instead of under-emoting, she overdoes it. Somehow she goes retard trying to portray an autistic girl. Don't judge this film through the prism of cerebral dissection and critical analysis. For once, listen to your heart, not the critics."

Ileana D'\u00e7ruz made a mark with her Hindi debut and will go places!!!\n\nAnother reason to watch Barfi is its fabulous cinematography and mesmerizing music!! Two thumbs-up for that!!\n\nStoryline was however a weakling over here with unnecessary addition of \"murder mystery\" plot to it which is not as interesting as meant to be.(-1 there)\n\nNonetheless Do watch this movie which will touch your heart and will make you fall in love with life and change your perspective about it!!!\n\nRanbir and Ileana excellent but barfi is priyanka's film all the way!!"

But as the movie goes on you are gripped in the plot and bang!!!! there comes a suspense (wont reveal anything more). As the story progresses you will be gripped.\n\nDirection (10/10) - People might say that some scenes are taken from Notebook, background score from Amelie, in different points of the movie there are 3 musicians appearing in the movie which resembles 3 owls of Rango :) (that's the first thing came into my mind) But you like the direction when it is effective.. and yes Anurag has made many scenes memorable. Simple scenes.. pauses... transitions(moving story to different time and coming back to the scene shown before and continue in other time) are used perfectly. For example there is a scene where all 3 characters are shown in a tram.. pretty normal.. but anurag keeps the frame..still.. and after 30 secs in the same scene you realize what all of them are feeling.\n\nScreenplay (9/10) - The transitions as I mentioned before are awesome. It would not have been effective if the story was shown in a progressive time frame. The benefit you get is.. the audience never gets bored. Though there was scope of improvement.\n\nCinematography (11/10) - Kolkata and Darjeeling shown so beautifully that you will get mesmerized. The USP of direction was transitions and USP here is lights. Lights are used so very effectively that it reminded me of Titanic. As a cinematographer or photographer if you want to know how lights can effect the scene go ahead and learn from this movie\n\nActing (10/10) - I am speechless.... all characters are equally important and share adequate screen space. Ranbir has reached a new height which is very difficult for others to reach. Ileana is a bolloywood debutant but an experienced actor down south and she doesnot disappoint. Without Saurabh Shukla this story would have been incomplete, he is very experienced and gave one of his best performances. And here is one person which stands out... Priyanka... you will not believe that this girl was Miss World.... it was the best performance I have seen after Tom Hanks in Forrest gump (yes you need to see it to believe it)\n\nMusic (11/10) - One of the finest music tracks... all songs are apt to the situation and so melodious that you will feel the song to continue forever. Pritam at his very best.\n\nOverall (10/10) - This is the only movie for which I gave 10/10 because it deserves it. Love is the most abstract thing in the world, it knows no boundary, no rules and that's what this movie is all about. Kudos Anurag!!! to keep alive an hope.. an hope that stories do exist in bolloywood :)\n\nDon't miss this"

It would be more enjoyable had middle toward end is more concise.\n\nIt was a delightful experience nonetheless."

Two things are there in this movie - depiction of physically challenged to make you sad and some stuff 'inspired' from the Charlie Chaplin movies to make you happy. The director was unable to handle rest. The movie in unnecessarily lengthy. The background music is absolutely horrible. In absence of a vital plot the director just keeps dragging the story. This is certainly better than Sanjay Leela Bhansali's cheap creation 'Black', but this is also more or less on the same lines. I went to see the movie after reading misleading reviews. Now a days it has become a trend where huge amounts are spent on promotions, that are used to fool people. This is no good cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi is a simple story, tells some very simple lessons and in a very simple way. The simplicity of the story of some not so simple characters is what makes Barfi extraordinary. Barfi says that despite being considered abnormal by society; even the disabled have the normal issues of normal people. They're feelings are normal, they love, they hate and yes, they do laugh.\n\nIt's present day and the deaf-mute Murphy aka Barfi is breathing his last breaths. There are a few people to see him off including his first love, his current love and a crazy cop who was always after him. Why is this man so important? How did he manage to change lives? That's the story of Barfi.\n\nAnurag Basu's film mesmerizes you into Barfi's world from the word go. The initial reels have you glued mainly due to Barfi's entertaining tactics. Not to forget that the screenplay starts on a unique note.\n\nThere are a number of well executed sequences in the movie. Barfi's intro, the scene's between Barfi and Shruti and between Barfi and Jilmil. A brilliant scene being the scene with Barfi explaining to Shruti on how he realizes they cannot be together and why. A brilliantly directed and enacted sequence.\n\nThere are minuses. The second half does drag in parts and not to forget the screenplay may confuse a few a bit. The whole murder mystery part also could have been better written.\n\nOne does have to give it up to Pritam who comes up with a brilliant score. Main Kya Karoon, Aashayein, Phir Le Aaya Dil are soothing and addictive to listen to. Kudos to Anurag Basu for placing the songs so well into the screenplay.\n\nAnurag Basu's direction is first rate. He's made a couple of good films in my opinion - Gangster and Life..In a Metro. It was surprising to me that he would make a lighter film. Having said that, this is his best work yet.\n\nPriyanka Chopra is excellent here. It's a tough role and she gives an excellent performance. There was much scope for her to over-act but she keeps her act subtle yet effective. Illieana D'Cruz is brilliant. Her role is strong and requires strong talent. She surely leaves her presence felt. Surab Shukla is in form after a long time. The rest of the supporting cast is adequate.\n\nBarfi belongs to Ranbir Kapoor. Not a single word was uttered by his character yet you feel he said so much in the movie. Ranbir proves why he's the best actor of his generation and his contemporaries such as Shahid, John, Imran etc need to step their game up if they want to compete with this phenomenal talent. Terrific! Overall, it's a nice sweet film that one won't mind watching again. Highly Recommended!"

I'd like to start of with Ranbir Kapoor. I'd say the best among the young lot, this guy manages to do something extra-ordinary in his every movie. A difficult role to pull off, he has managed it with ease. Effortless expressions, top notch acting. Illeana D'Cruz - Debut film and a pretty confident start. Looks pretty on the big screen. And then finally Priyanka Chopra - Whoaa!! what a performance simply fabulous. The best among the lot. One of her best performance till date. Coming to the technical part, with Mr. Basu taking part of story, screenplay and direction it has been done to perfection. Darjeeling has been captured beautifully. And even though the music has similarities to Amelie(2001) it has been pretty good. Music has a very important role in this movie since its more of a silent movie and Pritam has done a decent job. If you're into out of box stuff, go for Barfi ASAP."

The performances of Ranbir, Priyanka and Ileana are worth mentioning..Ranbir is going to a different level with each of his movie and the diversity that he is bringing up with every role is just adding on to his immense talent..Even Saurabh Shukla has given a performance that would not be forgotten and will always be remembered whenever Barfi's name comes up..\n\nIts a must watch and one the best movies of this year."

All this unites to give you some magical moments to cherish.\n\nDirector/writer Anurag Basu has to be mentioned specifically. It is rarely seen in Bollywood that a film is made with such care and passion. It was as if he thought out each and every shot before filming it and the execution was top notch, resulting in a magnificently polished film. Ya, the plot may not have been the most novel but Basu showed that inspired works can stand out on their own. You might not shine at the Oscars Basu but you definitely opened a new path for the Box-office hungry Bollywood.\n\nThe cast was amazing; Ileana's performance was superb as the Bengali Bou (wife) and looked stunning too ;). Supporting casts like the sub- inspector brought much life to the film. There's not much too say about Ranbir and Priyanka but Awesome!\n\nOn the whole, if you're looking for a Salman or Ajay no-brainer, then you might end up sleeping half way through Barfi!. But if you went to the hall or put in the DVD or turn your TV on for some majestic experience, Barfi will have something up his sleeve to keep you entertained for many days to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had the pleasure of watching this film after a year of its release. I was eager to watch it seeing its promos and thought it would be somewhat like Kamal Hassan's \"Sadma\" which is considered an undeserved flop at the box office. Well, in this film too the heroine is portrayed mentally retard, suffering from autism and the hero has hearing and speaking impairment. The story is much complex and emotional, and once the mood sets the film becomes gripping and sweet.\n\nThe film is commendable for its portrayal of physically disabled people as a part of our society, who can feel and fall in love. Well, the film does borrow much from Charlie Chaplin or a background music from Amelie; but the story-wise the film somewhat works. At the beginning, the narrative is a bit confusing and slow at times. Perhaps after the intermission, the story gets interesting with layers of comical situations, emotions, and laughter. The collage of colors, music, and background set in Darjeeling gives beauty to the film. Ranbir Kapoor as Barfi appears in the screen for most of the time and captivates your attention. But I felt Priyanka's performance as Jhilmil steals the show. If you can forgive its length or a clumsy narrative at times, there is much to enjoy in this film.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 4"

Barfi once fell in love with Sruti,bus as she leaves him heartbroken,he finds love in an abnormal girl Jhilmil.It is choice of sruti who leaves her husband for him,whether to unite Barfi and Jhilmil.\n\nThe songs are soul of the movie. Priyanka's as Jhilmil was mesmerising with her childish looks and cuteness.\n\nAlthough the movie has a slow screenplay(reminding me of aushtosh gowariker lenghty movies) but whenever you were about to feel letting down,the touch of Barfi's humour(inspired by chaplin and Mr.bean) lifts you back.\n\nSruti and Jhilmil complete Barfi.\n\nI don't want to give up many plots about the story. Just leave your tensions aside, try to be crazy,be chalu,be in love. Be Barfi."

Others: The painter scene of Shruti. Jhilmil trying the Saree. The (three) lamp-post scenes.\n\nI will not reveal the story, just that, it's a love triangle with lots of smileys, hearts and the specially-able people involved\n\nPriyanka (Jhilmill) had the character, did her best, but had something missing (direction flaw). D'Cruz (Shruti) was a delight, did things right in the nutshell that was given to her. Ranbir (Burrrfeee), I am a fan and will be, was exaggerative, but took it through, even to his death bed, so made the audience believe in him."

Positioning of the movie in the director's mind is not very clear. Whether he wanted it to be a good blend of comedy and drama , he has failed to do that.\n\n2. As a viewer, \"Barfi\" failed to grab my consistent attention during the whole 2.5 hours. There were several missed opportunities during the movie by the director. This could've been a good blend of comedy and emotions but the emotion part was missed out on several occasions. For example, the character of Jhilmil had lots of potential and so has Priyanka however director failed to provide opportunities to both.\n\n3. The background music is monotone throughout the movie irrespective of the demand of the scene. As a result there is quite a cheerful music even on sad occasions.\n\n4. The character of Barfi was partially inspired by the great Charlie Chaplin. some of the \"creative\" scenes in the movie are 100% copy from Charlie Chaplin movies.\n\nfew good points of the movie are the character of \"Shruti\" played beautifully by Ileana in 3 different life stages and some creativity including the way Barfi used to throw his shoes for Jhilmil and shadow play on the wall by Jhilmil and Barfi.\n\nIf you are planning to watch \"Barfi\" and expecting an extraordinary excellent direction, story, comedy and drama like \"Munna Bhai MBBS\" you will be disappointed. However, I must say, its a good time-pass movie. NOTHING MORE!"

Set in the early 70's the film revolves around three young people who finally realise that all the events in life can't be approached with pre planned conventional attitude....sometimes you really need to listen to your heart's call. The story of the film is very good, but the thing which makes it even better is the narration. The film just flows with ease as if it was real. Other notable things in the film are -acting, direction and its songs. This is undoubtedly the best performance of both ranbir and priyanka. Iliena made a great debut of this magnitude. The songs in the film are all perfectly placed and the lyrics are simply awesome. Anurag basu again proved that he is presently the best director in bollywood. The only drawback i could feel was the length of the movie which could have been shortened. But again after watching a movie like this ,these kind of things can easily be ignored. Do watch it.

After the movie, you do not remember story or scenes, only characters emotions. Every character is a portrayal of emotions, from Barfi to policeman. You do not realize the disability of lead pair, you only feel love for each other. For sure you will watch climax again and again.\n\nThough movie stands as a respectable film, some scenes were lifted from famous Charlie Chaplin comedies (Police door sliding scene, see-saw with ladder on wall, Barfi wakes up on inaugural statue scene). Invest a bit of patience, you will be paid with a powerful emotion of happiness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi!, directed by Anurag Basu is undoubtedly one of the best and intelligent films to be churned out in a long time. Accepting oneself with all shortcomings, loving each other and smiling your way all the way up to the finish line - this is how one can describe Barfi! It's a sweet, charming, but complex tale told simply and smartly. It's a story coming straight from the heart and goes straight to the heart.\n\nRising to the challenge are the three lead players, Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Ileana D'Cruz.\n\nWith Barfi! Ranbir elevates himself to the status of a seasoned actor slipping effortlessly into the skin of the character and giving a performance that simply leaves one stunned. Without a single dialogue (if you don't count 'Barfi!' as a dialogue), Ranbir masterfully smiles through his pain, gives cops a chase through town and frets over his lovers.\n\nPriyanka Chopra as Jhilmil needs a standing ovation too! In a short span, Priyanka has proved her mettle as an actress. She moves one step further this time with her convulsive, erratic body language and a highly expressive face.\n\nIleana D'Cruz has already proved her acting abilities in the South. In Barfi!, Ileana looks beautiful,confident and comfortable in her own space. She enacts her part with utmost conviction. She portrays a girl who can't follow her heart, and when she learns to, it's too late.\n\nSaurabh Shukla as police sub-inspector with his witty dialogues, Ashish Vidyarthi as Jhilmil's father, Rupa Ganguly as Shruti's mother and Jishu Sengupta are also very good.\n\nAs for Basu, in his earlier films 'Gangster - A Love Story' and 'Life... In A Metro', he proved himself a maestro of the inner life. 'Barfi!' too is shot on location within the hearts of the characters. It's difficult to have two disabled characters and not portray their stereotype or make the audience feel pity for them. But Anurag Basu does it skillfully with the script and story. He builds the characters so finely that you come to love each and every one of them by the end of the movie. Filled with positivity, Barfi hails the 'never-say-die' spirit of human beings and show us the ray of hope through the dark clouds. Barfi! takes to a non linear story-telling oscillating between the past and present, unfurling through series of evocative flashbacks. The major strength of the film comes with its narrative. It doesn't give away the entire plot in one go and unfurls the story little by little keeping you glued to the proceedings. It does take you a few initial minutes to get used to the poetic pace of the story and once you get settled you are taken on a magical ride. It's a movie which celebrates one of the most prized feelings of each human being: the joy of being loved, through a story of people who could have easily decided not to embrace it. This movie will remain a gem etched in the history of Indian Cinema. Music by Pritam is brilliant and so is the cinematography by Ravi Varman. The scenic beauty of Darjeeling is captured beautifully and you become a part of their world.\n\nTo sum it up, Barfi is an emotionally stirring yet joyous ride that will make you fall in love with love and life. It is a cinematic tour-de-force one shouldn't miss, as Barfi! celebrates life. A must watch for one and all!"

Overall i was very much impressed with the performances that is done in the movie by the three.\n\nThe next thing that should be spoken in this movie is the locations,music and camera work which gave a fresh and crispy look to the movie all over.\n\nNow coming to the few negative points that this movie got i personally felt that the story line could have been a little stronger and the some parts of second half seems little dragging ,,,otherwise the movie is good in other aspects"

        "review_detailed_main": "If I give a rating of 7 to a film, it is by no means a classic film but it is an entertaining watch. And if you have bought this film it is by no means a bad purchase.\n\nThe film centers on a deaf-mute whose mother died shortly after his birth by an accidental electrocution while switching on a radio. Actually his mother named him after the very radio that took her life. Very ironic indeed! Barfi is also a sweet confectionery from the Indian subcontinent. This parallels with the central character of the film who is sweet and child-like innocent at heart. Barfi's(Ranbir Kapoor) life revolves in getting into one scrape after another with the local police officer Sudhanshu Dutta (Saurabh Shukla).\n\nOne day he spies the ravishing Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'Cruz), who has just arrived in Darjeeling. He immediately and boldly professes his love to her. She explains that she is engaged to Ranjit Sengupta (Jisshu Sengupta), and is due to get married in three months.\n\nShruti also falls in love with Barfi but her mother dissuades her from pursuing him because he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti takes her mother's advice, gets married, and moves to Kolkata, breaking all contact with Barfi.\n\nWill Barfi ever see Shruti again? It is for you to watch and find out.\n\nVerdict: this film is a mixture of some Charlie Chaplin comedy and seriousness. The character in this film is of a compulsive nature and actually never gave up on anything in his life - except for Shruti. After Shruti's marriage Barfi's life will be forever changed. The songs in the film are good as well as the photography and overall direction. I just felt that the movie suffered in the fact that a totally useless character - that of Jhilmil(Priyanka Chopra) was added to the film which lets the whole film down. But in any case the film is saved by Ranbir Kapoor's character."

        "review_detailed_main": "BARFI (3.5 stars): Brilliant performances and great content with respect to script,screenplay and cinematography, makes BARFI sweet. A movie which critics will overrate and masses will underrate :-). Though for each MOVIE lover its pure good cinema!\n\nA Barfi which will definitely give you sweet-mushy feeling and will melt with full aroma as soon as (IF) it enters your heart!\n\nRanbir Kapoor just rises few more steps up, WOW, what a amazing body of work he has in a very short time. The comical-Charlie style scenes were stellar in every way. He is a complete actor PERIOD. Priyanka deserves a SALUTE for this performance, surely a growth and showcase of her ability to groom acting talent. Also Illeana made a very impressive debut in Hindi cinema, she delivers completely what the character required, commendable. Without doubt, Extra sweetness was provided by veteran and class apart actor \u2013 Sourabh Shukla. Much like Anu Kapoor in Vicky donor, after a long time seen Mr Shukla in a great role!!!! The half star is just for the tinkling nuances provided by Sourabh-Ranveer comic scene.\n\nAnurag Basu is the master of the ship and great to have him up in the list of amazing directors, like Anurag Kashyap, Imtiaz Ali, Dibankar etc....\n\nIn essence it is a story of love's free-flowing nature and its true spirit \u2013 non-judgmental compassion, woven greatly in two well intermingled love stories garnished with a strong thrilling Tadka. The statement of the movie for me was - \"People with different abilities should be seen as normal people, lets not stereotype\" as well as - \"Love is a beautiful place to be in and it can only remain magical till the time both have pure compassion without question.\" - \"Love is kept never controlled.\"\n\nMust praise the way disabilities are marginalized. Only other movie i could recollect was \"Koshish\" which had amazing performances by Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bahaduri. (It really annoy me at times when the moment leads characters are noticed with disabilities, people start generalizing. I heard, OH this is no where near BLACK, come on, 1st of all, no two movie are comparable. and in this case the entire dimension and zone of movie was different.) It's not about TRIUMPH over ones disability but just sheer portrayal of phenomena - LOVE.\n\nSomething which deserves mention is that, how maturely, magically and in unabashed way, today's directors are bringing such freshness and newness to AGELESS zone of LOVE STORIES.\n\nPersonally, I reiterated the question to self, Does this love exist and if yes, Kahin Dikta Kyun Nahin.\n\nBest line and kind of extract of the movie could be \"Usne Pyar Karne Se Pehle Bhi Nahin Socha AUR Pyar Hone Ke Badd Bhi.\" (something like this.)\n\nYes the movie has some shortcoming, one very noticeable is the pace and extra length especially in the 2nd half. Still, nothing criminal against cinema :-)."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie took off in a novel fashion, and certainly brought smiles to the faces of audience, which they kept wearing till the end. Very rarely, do you see a movie, which ends with an applause, a round of cheer by almost everyone present (Not the, Sunny Deol or Salman Khan types). Barfi!, for one, is a part of that privileged genre. Yes, he is deaf and dumb, she is autistic, but the equation they share is unparalleled. Already enough has been said and written about the classic roles essayed by versatile Ranbir, gutsy Priyanka and beautiful Ileana (I loved her Bong Bahu look!), and of course the vision of craft master Anurag Basu (Yes, the same guy who made Kites), but I can't help writing even more. There are moments which leave you smiling, which leaves your eyes moist, but in the end this movie makes you happy!How a person riddled with so many troubles manages to stay happy and give away his signature smile even in the worst of circumstances, makes you forget your miseries. I know, it might sound a bit cheesy, but yes, that's the effect it has! They deserve all the accolades and the appreciation they are getting, and the audience are loving it. What I hope is, this movie goes on to be a mega hit, just like the Singhams' and Ek Tha Tigers' and the BodyGuards',(in fact it deserves to be much bigger than those), but as I write this I know this is not going to be. If it does, it will certainly motivate the directors, and more importantly the producers to invest in such scripts, the 'hatke' one's, not the so called mainstream cinema. Although there has been a lot of such films making waves (along with money) in the recent past, the likes of Kahaani, Vicky Donor, Wasseypur topping the list. Succinctly I would say this is impeccable cinema, completely Hollywood material. (May be I am overrating it, but then that's what I feel!)Barfi might give away some traces of Charlie Chaplin, Mr. Beans, or Raj Kapoor but then what matters is, it's simplicity and silence subtly manages to tickle you and touch 'that' corner in your heart! P.S: Darjeeling is my favorite hill station, and the Chhau Dance sequence was terrific. And yes, I hoped to see the 'Fatafati' number in the end, but alas!"

Originality: Many of the scenes are copied from various movies. So, the great sequences are not original \u2013 rather they are picked and stitched in the movie (very well stitched though).\n\nScenes copied from:\n\ni. Charlie Chaplin - The Adventurer\n\nii. Charlie Chaplin - City Lights\n\niii. The Notebook\n\niv. Singin' in the Rain\n\nv. Buster Keaton's Cops\n\nMusic is also inspired from Amelie.\n\n2. Perfection: There are many technical issues as well in the movie which should have been avoided. For example, the age proportions of different characters were different in different times. If you take the police officer \u2013 he was not so old in last age but Barfi was too old. The makeup of Shruti in old age was not that good. There are many other technical faults as well."

Through some of the scenes, director seem to be paying homage to some great works of cinema, e.g., 'City Lights'.\n\nIleana couldn't have wished for a better launch pad in Bollywood (I believe it is her first). Priyanka Chopra's research/effort for portraying the character of an autistic is quite evident in her body language. And, best of them all is indeed Ranbir Kapoor with his Chaplinesque antics! First half is fantastic imparting loads of vitality and energy, but second half seemed a bit dragging with slight overdose of music and abstract shots. The length of the film and little too much melodrama, for my liking, will keep me from a re-watch. All in all, a must watch experience.\n\n7.5/10"

And With Barfi, I think the prayer was answered. As we have already read multiple reviews about it Barfi, lot of good and couple of average, hence I would be just brief about my thoughts here. 1. Many lump-in-throat moments. Not detailing where all to not to spoil for others who have not yet seen . But I was feeling so good every time a tear came in my eyes or my throat formed a lump. Long time since I got moved with a scene from Bollywood. 2. Ranbir can easily be crowned the typical romantic hero of these times who can deliver the innocence of selfless lover to the T (APKGK, Rockstar, Barfi) and you can't but help comparing this ordinary boyish charm with his ancestors Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapur. And boy, he looks dishy in many scenes when he falls in love with EDC. 3. Priyanka lived her character of a \"Pure as a Dew Drop Jhilmil\" to perfection. Her eyes, gestures, whole personality oozed of innocence and uncorrupted waif. Hats off and serious competition to VB at Awards nights! 4. Ileana couldn't choose a better movie to debut in Bollywood and hopefully goes on to make it big. Coming to few things that I read in reviews and my thoughts on that: \u0095 Length of movie- Many ppl said it shud have been short by 30-40 mints or 1 hour, but I am not complaining. If people can sit through the likes of Joker, Ready, Body Guard, Jism 2 etc no one shall complain about a good movie being long which is nothing short of fresh air. I can understand director's dilemma here, when the movie is made with too much love and is about small slice of life moments, it's very difficult to cut any part of it without regrets. Even Life is Beautiful and Forrest Gump were 2+ hours instead of usual 1.5 hours of Hollywood standards and no complaints. \u0095 Songs and Cinematography \u2013 The look and sound of music took me back to the era of 1942-a Love Story and Kareeb. The same magical scenic surroundings and music that just swept you away on a long ride to dreamy romance and beauty of normal innocence of life. Full Marks to both. \u0095 Make up- While the 70s make up was great, the present day Elderly characters' get up left lot to be desired. Wish more effort could be put on that department. I would have no complaints if some other Senior Citizen actors would have played elderly Barfi/Jhilmil/Shruti. But this drawback is forgotten and forgiven quickly keeping in mind what good stuff you observed just now."

The movie is so smartly made that one does not feel that the void of its main protagonist being a mute. The movie is shot beautifully in Darjeeling and Kolkata. A visual treat.\n\nThe acting by Ranbir is outstanding. Talking with his expressions throughout the movie. Priyanka's role as an autistic girl is a revelation. she deserves rich praise as well. Ileana is a surprise package, looking so stunningly beautiful in Bengali attire with bright cotton saris.\n\nPritam's music in the movie is also very fresh and apt for the script. Songs are simple but effective.\n\nThe only drawback, if you nitpick, might be the fact that Anurag Basu tried too hard to make it into a suspense thriller, with story moving back and forth in time.\n\nOverall an excellent movie for people who dare to watch good cinema."

It's an emotionally crafted beautiful love triangle between a deafndumb, autistic person and a rich married girl in beautiful hill-station.\n\nThis movie reminds me of watching Charlie Chaplin except that it's in color n has Ranbir who gave a decent performance. Priyanka was again at her best and Illeana with her cute smile in black dress won many hearts n her performance shows why she is one of the top tollywood actor.\n\nPritam's music compliments the movie which has not many words in it. Anurag Basu made the funny scenes look funnier n emotional scenes touchy. On the whole the movie is a national award puller n hope it gives new direction to Bollywood industry."

The best part of the movie is the characters which have been played brilliantly.\n\nRanbir Kapoor has once again showed how great actor he is in modern era. Whenever he said \"Burfii\"(the only word he can say), something tickled from inside. The one thing with \"Burfii\" the character is that, he never cries, never regrets and he holds positive attitude about life. I also liked the way he tests person faith in him. But, Priyanka Chopra with her fragility takes all the sympathy and love. It doesn't seem that you are actually seeing the glamorous Priyanka Chopra. Instead, you are completely involved with \"jhilmil\", the innocent girl. And something tickled again when she said \"Burfiiii\".\n\nThe newcomer Illeana has done fabulous job as she portrays a character of confused beautiful woman in love. It would be unfair to Saurabh Shukla if I don't mention his name. He has played the character superbly and showed his class.\n\nBut all the credit goes to Anurag Basu for creating and making such a beautiful story. The story telling is class and you can say this by seeing the first scene itself where an old man lifts himself, clicks his photograph and fell, simply beautiful.\n\nMust watch for cinema lovers who watch movies for acting and story telling. Thumbs up for Barfi! team."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rather than the thoughtless degraded comedy that Bollywood comes up with nowadays, 'Barfi!' is a slapstick story of small town 'mute and deaf' boy who comes of age and his innocence with which he views his world and the people around with a (kind of Woody Allen genre but not so perfect) blend of mystery. Barfi will not only steal your heart away but keep you wanting more by which time its starts drawing out in the latter half.\n\nThe movie gets off as characters surrounding Barfi narrates his time line unfolding in an otherwise sleepy, misty town in Darjeeling. Barfi's antics invigorates the town and its people even if its not entirely in favor of protagonist.\n\nRanbir Kapoor excels the dumb and deaf, cute, Barfi to perfection, and it would have hardly mattered to the audience that the whole movie was cut into pieces and shuffled together (director was trying to be innovative?Yikes!), as the audience goes into raptures of heartfelt laughter. Ranbir's youthful energy is infused into the story realm.\n\nWithout Barfi's playful antics instilling the town with a soul of its own, she would be overwhelmed by the greed its people would go to any lengths for. Adding to the coziness of the viewer, the town ages into the present world along with Barfi. The audience is witnessed to the hippie, playfully shy town represented in the 1970's 'Murphy' radio billboard adverts giving way to present day underwear advertisements in shamelessly larger view of arriving city tourists.\n\nAlmost equally well played, Priyanka Chopra leaves behind her flashy 'Fashion' wardrobe untouched this time as she plays a mentally retarded (by credits I realize she was playing an autistic kid), Jhilmil, who yearns for care and love after she's plucked from her institutional home to fulfill her Grandpa's last dying wish. After grandpa's death Jhilmil finds it hard to fit in her home and finds solace and unconditional love in an unassuming Barfi.\n\nThe moments between Priyanka and Ranbir will melt the hearts of lady folk but don't quite stick by the end of the movie.\n\nForget that you are reminded of Charlie Chaplin's antics (it should be taken as tribute rather.. to the King of Comedy) or you would do well not watch the copies from which Barfi is allegedly and ruthlessly taken from - Not seen for a long time in Bollywood, Barfi! will fill you with a heart-full of warmth and happiness and leave you smiling all the way home.\n\nGo watch 'Barfi!'...Be Barfi for a while."

Despite its fresh looks it lacks originality. it's heavily inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies and many of the scenes are directly copied from his movies. But I could not have a laugh at it although kids might find them comic. Movie is shot at descent locations in Indian hills in matching weather conditions. But the plot has many incidents which try to add humor quotient but fail miserably. With same story, one could have made a dramatic masterpiece with lot of emotions but writer and director chose otherwise. Coming to performances, Ranbir Kapoor has done justice to his character with descent performance, but at times it has too much caricature. Ileana looks pretty and acts well. the best performance however comes from Priyanka Chopra, she plays mentally challenged dumb girl. Her expressions are perfect for such a character and she has made it look unbelievably simple. I could not stop myself comparing her performance to Rani Mukherji's in Black, although Rani is one of my all time favorite, I have to say, Priyanka beats her hands down here. Overall Barfi is one time watch with boring first half which shapes up in second half. you can definitely watch it for Priyanka."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a cold Turkey! Whatever it was a chaplinesque comedy? Poetic romance? Love between physically disabled couple? Or as itself declared in the movie \"ek bakwaas jasoosi novel!\" Doesn't Move, doesn't Engage, doesn't Entertain! Frankly it does nothing in its never-ending running time.\n\nWhy do they make such films? Who story-boards them? Who and why mounts them, sanction them? Why do production houses back it? Why do actors get super-excited about these futile exercises to exhibit their acting skills? It's a woeful waste of great resources \u2013 the cast and crew included- in such self-indulgent exercises. Just pencilling in a couple of physically disabled characters doesn't really qualify for great cinema. Barfi! for most part of it comes across as a contrived and manipulative effort, trying too hard to be too cute.\n\nDear Ranbir Kapoor, we have seen enough of your range as a powerhouse performer. Wake Up Sid, Rajneeti, Rocket Singh, Rockstar, Barfi!...phew! Yes, my friend, you are an actor par excellence, the new kid on the block, the most promising newcomer\u0085and all that jazz! But it's time we move beyond this audition show-reel of yours and get into some real movies. It's time you emerge from the 'most-promising' category and actually deliver on those promises. Some real seeti-maar and in your Rockstar-lingo, some real palang-tod entertainment! The larger than life Khan-Akki-Devgn stuff. Or if that's too much to ask for, at least some frothy breezy romance of the Saif variety.\n\nOK, fair enough. Even if we take off the entertainment bit and start looking at Barfi! as an artistic-beautiful work, it doesn't really cut much ice (much Barf in this case). The direction is too flawed, and fails miserably in trying to be too intellectual, too layered. The director Anurag Basu continues to suffer from the 'Kites' hangover and assumes a back-and-forth narrative to be a great technique for great movies. It didn't work for Kites. And it most definitely won't for Barfi! either.\n\nThe thriller bit doesn't work. The physical disability of the lead couple appears to be too force-fitted. And finally, the end-product is a confused exercise that seems to be based out of a neverland. It goes from nowhere to nowhere. All the characters and situations come across as cardboard cut-outs, caricaturish. As if everyone out there was trying to impress (look I can act, look I can direct) rather than express.\n\nSorry, I can't be a pseudo-intellectual and praise this so-called masterpiece, when I was dozing off throughout this yawn-inducing Barfi! Three thumbs down for this torture \u2013 for the movie, for the director and for myself for listening to fake glowing reviews! The only redeeming feature \u2013 a superb 'Picchar shuru!' song at the start of the movie."

On the other hand though, Ileana Dcruz's performance was frankly overshadowed by the other two.\n\nThe second part seemed a little stretched out after the highly entertaining first half. Where is it written that Hindi movies should have the sentimental crap to become a hit? For me the last half an hour was a let down after a hell of a roller coaster ride.\n\nGo for Barfi! I assure you it would be a hell lot of fun to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a strong critic of Bollywood Cinema, Barfi! strikes me like a wave of refreshment. A very positive attitude, while crafting this kind of cinematic experience, is required, and the team of Barfi did it in its own unique flair. Aside from the effortless performances by all the actors, Anurag Basu has shown his true qualities: the notion of freedom in creating cinematic art. He, at this time perhaps, didn't aim at commercialization and produced a movie of this status. I believe when you go inside the theater expecting some art, all other crass movies but Burfi disappoint you. It is therefore, the success of Barfi lies in redefining the true meaning of Cinema and the experience associated with it.\n\nI grew up listening to people surrounding me that the old-age cinema used to be better than we happen to see today. I think I got the reason behind the saying earlier, and now Burfi marked its stamp on this legitimate reasoning. At that period of time, filmmakers believed in Cinema, not in money. They drew passion, motivation from the art itself. After all, art should be preserved in its true form, and with the likes of Barfi Anurag Basu, in my opinion, pays due homage to Cinematic art. There are references to the vintage movies of the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Italian Cinema which is light hearted in its core. Moreover, the movie didn't lake Bollywood taste, yet it tried to be indifferent towards the same--perhaps a positive aspect for it.\n\nEvery scene in this movie craved for perfection; the team of barfi tried their best to keep it near perfect. Well, there is also scope of improvement in every thing, hence the case goes with Burfi too. It's length might be one area: if it had been shorter by 10-15 minutes, the movie would have been better than the present form. On the other hand, music was superb. Pritam shined and filled the movie with 70's aura.\n\nOverall, one should watch it for the love of cinematic art. Ranbir Kapoor seemed to have an eclectic taste and surely he reminds us of The Showman, Mr. Raj Kapoor. Priyanka Chopra did her part without having her noticed in this movie. You see only the characters in the movie. Illiana was truly amazing in her portrayal of Bengali housewife. Rest of the cast delivered what was required: neither more nor less."

Ranbir's acting is ok but his character's behaviour does not make sense. Poor Shruti might fall in love with him as requested by the plot.

The movie proves that you do not need constant blabbering to make a statement, sometimes silence is what is all required. The movie is inspired by Chaplinesque cinematography, and is better executed then any other Bollywood movie till date. What I really loved was the cinematography, the beautiful locales, and simplicity in the story.\n\nIts one those refreshingly \"feel good\" movie, which moves at leisurely pace. However, I do think that another 15 minutes of edition, would make it far more crisper.

This is a movie made with pure heart.Written and directed by Anurag Basu , he takes you across various roller coaster chases and emotions , watch the sequence at railway station in second half in which Ileana displays her confusion of choosing between heart and mind , Love and Society.Basu manages to convey through his supremely talented artists that sometimes how difficult it is to choose between a right and very right path . Of course the film drags in most of its parts especially the suspense plot which is stretched unnecessarily adding to the length of the film but still Burfi has a heart at its place . Ranbhir shines as the protagonist, He truly defines modern day Raj kapoor. Ileana makes a charming debut. Burfi is priyanka's best performance after fashion ,Saurab Shukla is terrific, and not to forget Pritam's superior tracks. I would not call Burfi as a classic but definitely the one that will remain in your mind for the days to come . Not to miss :-)"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are few positives in this movie. There is good acting. It has two very beautiful actresses. I really liked photography & shooting locations.\n\nHowever it is too long & extremely slow. Story could have been compressed to 1 hour max. Story telling style is quite convoluted - with too many time jumps. Plot line is also somewhat unbelievable at few places. For example, how could this deaf and mute hero of this movie have taken care of himself & his ward during their travels. He didn't have money for medical expenses of his father. Where did he get money to survive for 5-6 months?\n\nOverall, it was a disappointment. This movie could have been much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "What will you remember the year 2012 for? I shall ever remember it for some of the greatest movies our quality deprived Indian Cinema produced. Seems like all the film-makers have suddenly realized that all good work requires nothing but self-revelation. And they are working on it - producing results which the human race would have never expected of. They have suddenly realized that experience can let you experiment and that if it turns out to be successful, can lead you to a perfect evolution. Time's evolving. Yes the process has been little slow, but look what its fetching you. For those who used to believe in the power of cinema must be feeling very relieved, so am I.\n\nIt would be very derogatory for me to talk anything about Barfi. If I start talking about it, may be I run out of words, because doing so is simply a gargantuan task. Someone once said - \"There are two types of films: those that employ the resources of the theater (actors, direction, etc...) and use the camera in order to reproduce; those that employ the resources of cinematography and use the camera to create\". I say there exits a third category which involves the both in an appropriate proportion and produces something miraculous, something beyond imagination. Barfi is a combined effort of an immaculate direction, a great script and some never seen before acting. Gone are those days when it used to take a cheapo to cry in a direction-less movie and get applauds from the lost souls. You now need to have a proper substance and then only you can leave an indelible imprint on the million minds.\n\nWhen it comes to portray disability on the celluloid, it takes something more than humanitarian efforts for the entire crew. The characters have to speak with their eyes, their movements must speak. The direction has to be impeccable. Not a single emotion should escape the mind of the audience - immersive - so should be the power of expression. An autistic person's role has to be the most difficult and needs a sorcerer's touch. I am simply reminded of Dustin Hoffman's role in Rain Man and Priyanka Chopra played it no less exceptional - one of the most touching performances I have ever seen. Ranbir Kapoor has properly fit himself in any kind of role he has ever been assigned. He is mute yet so expressive, funny yet so touching. And the love-story of these two disables has been so wonderfully and subtly knitted that once you are entangled you have no escape.\n\nBurfi opens to you doors to an ethereal world created through a poetic imagination. With all these excellence the team might have fetched themselves numerous awards already and yet again set examples for all the aspiring actors and directors. All it takes for them to align to the same trend. Its the time we can see cinema riding the path of Resurrection. We were never out of talent but the ideas were just lacking. Movies like Kahaani, Paan Singh Tomar, Barfi and others have shown to the world how much potential we carry. With a sudden out-pour of fresh new ideas for last few months, the faith in cinema has certainly been restored. We can expect more and more stunners in coming times to blow and boggle our minds."

Ileana D'Cruz gives a narration that would sound almost of an elderly person.\n\nIt's a treat to watch and teaches everyone to take risk in life, because without taking risks, there is no meaning of life."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of my all time favorites I can watch over and over again. I love this story and it is so well told. Both Ranbir (as Barfi) and Priyanka (as Jhilmil) show off their best performances yet and do so without hardly uttering a single word. Upcoming Illena D'Cruz plays her part very well and is destined for a great future. Every detail of this movie is very well done from the lighting (including glare from the sunlight in certain scenes) to each and every expression on the actors/actresses faces. Pay close attention to each and every move because just about anything that seems random at the time will be important later. The music score is outstanding and really lends itself well to the scenes which is applied. The filming locations are beautiful.\n\nA few folks accuse of blatant ripoffs of other movies and it does seem to borrow a lot of elements of other movies, but not enough from any that the whole movie seems a remake of another. It stands well on it's own and pays tribute to the best parts of other movies. Many scenes involve tribute scenes to silent film stars like Charlie Chaplain and Buster Keaton which I feel is great since Barfi cannot speak and it adds a comical sense to his character. It lends a new take to a group of new movie goers of the magic of silent films of past. Others seem to say that Priyanka does not represent someone with autism well. It would be hard for anyone to play that part and I didn't feel that was the case. Her actions are believable to get the point across. I applaud her for taking this tough role and doing so beautifully. It was also refreshing to see her in a role that didn't play on her beauty for once.\n\nMy only gripe is the movie jumps around eras a bit too much and too soon. Make sure to catch the dates shown so you keep up with the details. It all pans out in the end. I found the second time I watched it, this was no longer an issue.\n\nI highly recommend you watch this movie again and again and soak yourself in the beauty of it. I also recommend this for anyone wanting to get into watching foreign films with subtitles as it is a little easier to get into since Barfi and Jhilmil do not need as many subtitles for their parts. Just enjoy their acting prowess."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Barfi!\" is a heartwarming and whimsical tale directed by Anurag Basu, released in 2012, that unfolds against the scenic backdrop of Darjeeling. This romantic comedy-drama transcends conventional storytelling with its endearing characters and evocative narrative.\n\nPlot and Execution:\n\nSet in the 1970s, \"Barfi!\" revolves around the titular character Murphy \"Barfi\" Johnson (Ranbir Kapoor), a charming and mischievous deaf-mute young man. The story weaves together multiple timelines, chronicling Barfi's playful escapades, his endearing bond with two women - the autistic Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra) and the compassionate Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'Cruz).\n\nStrengths:\n\nRanbir Kapoor's Performance:\n\nRanbir Kapoor delivers a tour de force performance as Barfi, capturing the nuances of his character's emotions and expressions through physicality and gestures. Despite his inability to speak, Kapoor's portrayal is rich in charisma, humor, and depth, making Barfi a memorable and lovable protagonist.\n\nKapoor effortlessly transitions between comedic sequences and poignant moments, creating a character that tugs at the heartstrings while showcasing resilience and optimism in the face of adversity.\n\nAnurag Basu's Direction:\n\nAnurag Basu displays his directorial finesse in \"Barfi!\" by infusing the narrative with whimsy, nostalgia, and a touch of magical realism. The film's non-linear storytelling enhances its charm, inviting viewers into a world where emotions speak louder than words.\n\nBasu's attention to detail in capturing the essence of Darjeeling's picturesque landscapes and the era's ambiance adds depth to the storytelling, creating a visually captivating experience.\n\nMusic and Cinematography:\n\nThe film's music, composed by Pritam, complements the narrative beautifully with soulful melodies and evocative lyrics. Songs like \"Phir Le Aya Dil\" and \"Ala Barfi\" resonate with the film's themes of love, longing, and resilience, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes.\n\nRavi Varman's cinematography captures the essence of Darjeeling's serene landscapes and vibrant streets, serving as a backdrop that mirrors the characters' emotional journeys and enhancing the film's visual appeal.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPacing and Length:\n\nWhile \"Barfi!\" charms with its storytelling, some viewers may find the film's pacing leisurely, particularly in the first half. The non-linear narrative, while engaging, may require patience to connect the dots between past and present timelines.\n\nCharacter Depth:\n\nWhile Barfi, Jhilmil, and Shruti are portrayed with depth and complexity, some supporting characters could benefit from more development to enrich the overall narrative and relationships.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"Barfi!\" is a cinematic gem that transcends genres with its heartfelt storytelling, stellar performances, and evocative direction. Ranbir Kapoor's magnetic portrayal of Barfi, coupled with Anurag Basu's visionary direction and a soul-stirring soundtrack, makes this film a must-watch for cinephiles and romantics alike.\n\nThe film's ability to evoke laughter, tears, and introspection through its endearing characters and poignant moments cements its place as a timeless classic in Indian cinema. \"Barfi!\" celebrates love, life's imperfections, and the beauty of human connections, leaving a lasting impression that lingers in the hearts of its audience long after the credits roll.\n\nOverall, \"Barfi!\" is not just a film; it's an emotional journey that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the power of love in its purest forms."

The art of plagiarism is so deeply embedded in the movie that it over- shadows the director's effort to tell a sensible, feel-good and meaningful love story.\n\nTo a certain extent it can be accepted that AB's story had some new to offer for typical Indian audience. But for movie-lovers, who have seen the famous Tramp's movies, it is hardly surprising to notice that AB had put very little effort and time to create something new.\n\nAnd it is not only limited to humour, it is the story plot, camera angles, music (almost all key elements) has just been sucked out from 'n' number of movies and pasted together.\n\nMy point of writing on IMDb is to express my feeling of dissatisfaction and to a certain extent a feeling of humiliation for the matter of fact that Barfi has been India's best film nomination to Oscars.\n\nNow imagine those guys on panel laughing their heart out when they review this film. If AB had gone for Oxford style reference system and applied that for every clip/frame/soundtrack/camera angle that he had used to make this film, I bet he would've needed two A4 size pages to list the references, and that is not a good report."

        "review_detailed_main": "Woof! Where did that come from? That was my initial reaction upon watching this movie. Its a welcome reprieve from the typical bollywood movie overflowing with bemusing action scenes and a distorted bedtime story for a storyline. It is not quite as rebellious as many other offbeat movies which seem to be as critical of the society as they are of the film industry. This movie however follows a milder, more artistic approach if you like in portraying its satire. From what I could observe, it seems to have taken inspirations from a lot of sources, some pretty famous ones as well; Charlie Chaplin's movies, mute movies and old Hindi cinema to name a few, but instead of aping them like tonnes of Indian movies have over the years, this movie builds its own story using them, and does quite a commendable job of it, which is fine by me for it maintains its originality while doing so. I've seen some of Charlie Chaplin's works and Amelie as well, and I don't think its blatant copying or plagiarism.\n\nIts a story essentially of love that knows no limitations, something that everybody fascinates of and also regret of failing to draw the courage to take the all important life changing decision, something we are all familiar of. Therefore most people can readily identify with the story and be encouraged in their endeavours by the way the central character Barfi stays unflinchingly upbeat despite all odds and hardships at hand and struggles through them to make a right fist of his life. Backdrop, screenplay and acting, everything fits the bill.\n\nThough some might argue there are a lot of extraordinary situations for a movie that intends to stay practical, the overall story is still conceivable in my opinion. The humour is subtle and clever and considering the subject of the movie, most of it goes around in gestures, so the viewers might need to apply themselves a little bit more than your normal rom-com thing to pick up all of the jokes, which if you don't might end up spoiling your experience a tad, hence the complaints from few quarters of the movie being stretched or boring. Overall, if you don't go in there expecting melodramatic romance or vile humour you won't be disappointed by the touching, refreshing and immensely entertaining treat on show."

Barfi puts on a big smile on your face with an imaginative song put on before the movie starts itself and there onwards there is no looking back. Set in beautiful hill station Dargeeling, the story revolves around the world of deaf-mute, happy go lucky boy-man Murphy (called as Barfi) effortlessly played by Ranbir Kapoor who makes you dumbstruck in every frame he is in. Barfi falls for soon to be married Shruti played by southern superstar Ileana D Cruz. Ileana looks pretty throughout and impresses you especially in her Bengali avatar. The first half is all about Barfi while second half belongs to autistic Jhilmil played by Priyanka Chopra. Priyanka Chopra makes her character unbelievably believable and in fact she almost steals the limelight from Ranbir Kapoor when the movie is over. Her performance will be remembered as we remember Rani Mukerjee for Black. But actually, behind all these stellar performances lies the sheer brilliance and imagination of writer-director Anurag Basu who keeps the movie evenly paced and mixes the funny and emotional moments with ease. Although Anurag Basu let the movie go a bit lengthy by introducing an unnecessary suspense sub-plot but fortunately it's over before it spoils your fun. This is a movie which asks you to watch it again and again so that you can live those countless beautiful moments. You will find yourself running out of adjectives when appreciating the performances delivered."

Ranbir Kapoor plays Barfi, a deaf, mute and clumsy individual, who nonetheless is highly expressive, articulate and creative by means of gestures and actions. He struggles to win the affection of the lady of his dreams, though his advances are rebuffed, and soon he finds his life inexorably tangled with that of an autistic girl named Jhilmil(Priyanka Chopra). This is the first Priyanka Chopra movie that I have seen, and I instantly fell in love with her. You do not see an ounce of the glamor, sex appeal and charisma associated with a beauty queen, just a plain, mentally challenged, autistic individual who is limited in her ability to emote and express, and yet touches your heart so profoundly that you will have tears in your eyes by the end. How these two unusual characters come together and hit it off is the stuff this movie is made off. Very entertaining, touching and poignant movie! I can relate completely to it since I am a teacher, and deal with many children/adults who are extremely intelligent and creative, yet suffer from relationship and social problems because they are wired differently and express their emotions in unusual ways. Do watch it!!"

There is almost no scope for dialogues so everything has to be conveyed through visuals. Script writer Mr. Anurag Basu did a very good job in screenplay. When Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'cruz) leaves Darjeeling second time and Burfi follows her on bicycle. He collides with an electric pole and fells down but the front tyre of his bicycle follows the train at some distance. This is a masterpiece scene of film. It is a sweet film but I was expecting more sweetness. Film starts very well but slows down before interval and after interval but again catches it pace very soon. Dialogues by Mr. Sanjeev Datta are very good. Performance wise Priyanka Chopda is amazing. She has delivered a mind boggling performance. Simply wow. It is hard to believe that Jhilmil is a fictitious character. In look, body language, she portrayed it so well. Ranveer Kapoor is good. Ileana is also good. Music by Mr. Pritam is fine. After all, it is just above of an average film."

Ranbir has a screen presence like his predecessors of Kapoor clan. Priyanka Chopra as jhilmil was simply amazing. Bravo PC! Ileana D'cruz looks nice, acting was not bad.\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful and so are the locations of Darjeeling and Kolkata. Anurag Basu's direction is OK though better than his last movie Kites. Music by Pritam is a treat . In newspapers there was an article of 3 major scenes of Barfi being copied from Hollywood classics. Wonder how they chose it for Oscar! Even keeping this flaw aside, I found the screenplay to be very tedious. Slow enough to make me yawn thrice. Barfi amused me in parts, especially the first half. For me its a one time watch. Watch it for the good performances."

What the director wants to tell the viewers nobody knows.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Barfi!,\" from directing to cinematography to editing, is well put together, especially for an Indian movie. I really enjoy how the film tends to focus on the positive as opposed to all the melodrama. Yes, it does get melodramatic, but not for too long. We get some beautiful shots of the scenery, but what would a technically sound film be without a script? This film has top notch writing with interesting characters and a sweet story that will melt the coldest of hearts. The story is pretty simple, but it is done in a unique way. There is minimal dialogue and most of it is conveyed through action, sort of like classic movies of the past. It's cute and adds to the overall charm of the film. However, the story is over complicated by some contrived plot points. One in particular happens towards the end of the film, but for the most part it doesn't take away much from the film. Another issue would be with how the story is told, at times it gets confusing because it jumps from brief moments of three different time periods. Even with some of these issues the film manages to come through with a sweet, touching, and charming story.\n\nActing is top tier for the most part. Ranbir Kapoor proves yet again that he is the new leading man in Indian cinema. His performance of Barfi is touching yet subtle. He has a sense of charm and charisma that bleeds onto the screen. No matter what the character is doing, you can't help, but love him. Priyanka Chopra gives a career transforming performance. She's usually known as the beauty queen, but here she shows a lot of depth and understanding for her autistic character. I couldn't believe that this is the same person. The rest of the cast is good, but the one to look out for is Ileana D'Cruz, who made her Bollywood debut. Her character is emotionally disturbed and indecisive. She's likable and we can root for her.\n\nThe score and songs for this film are great as well. The score has a upbeat style to it that at the same time feels whimsical. It brings you back to an era of your own youth. The songs are equally as good. They are fun and super catchy. They drive their respective scene along and it helps glide over some of the melodramatic moments.\n\nOverall \"Barfi!\" is a fun and entertaining flick with a lot of heart. The story is well told and fairly original. The cast of characters are colorful and their respective actors do justice to their complex roles. Music is a driving force for this film and aids in each scene. While the movie can get confusing and the third act feels a bit contrived, the film's charm and sweetness more than makes up for it. I give it 4/5, There's enough entertainment and lovable moments to overlook any missteps."

Hats off to Director Basu for giving this Gem Of A Movie :)\n\nUntil I watched this movie, I really thought that Telugu Movie Eega will go through Oscar's screening, but now I feel this is undoubtedly best film to be selected due to its universal appeal.\n\nDirector of Eega (Rajamouli and other nominated films) should be very proud that their film has competed and lost against such a brilliant movie.\n\nRanbir : Wow!! Excellent performance. Tell me any other actor who could pull this off? His antics with his charismatic persona has perfectly suited this character. Lots of shades of his Grand Father(Raj Kapoor)\n\nPriyanka : Standing ovation :) Now I need to watch 'What's your Rashi' and '7 Khoon Maaf'.\n\nIleana : Never saw her so beautiful.(No not even in Telugu Movies Pokiri and Kick) Yes, her eyes speaks more than her. Perfectly used by Basu. Thankgod, she used her own voice at least in this movie.\n\nPritam : Superb Background score.\n\nBasu : Mind-blowing Screenplay. If you carefully observe, the entire story can be narrated in a linear fashion. But he cleverly used spaced, flashback(within flashback) style to generate interest in the audience. We saw this kind of screenplay in his 'Life In a Metro'\n\nSpecial Scenes for me: 1) Entire scenes in first half where Ranbir tries to impress Ileana. 2) Ranbir showing anger on Ileana for encouraging him to advance in their relationship even after engaged to other person 3) Entire journey between Ranbir and Priyanka 4) Introducing Priyanka to Ileana 5) Ileana accepting their true love 6) Ileana leaving her boundaries and traveling with Ranbir 7) Ranbir's anguish and finding Priyanka again 8) Ranbir's acting after knowing(from Ileana) that she is in Muskaan 9) Priyanka showing her possessiveness towards Ranbir to Ileana\n\nSpecial Mention : Cinematography by Ravi Varma"

And what a movie he has made! It is filled with enough moments to make you burst out in laughter, and a couple of truly tear-jerking ones as well.\n\n\"Barfi\" stands as a prime example of how far Indian movies have come. This movie will touch everyone with a heart. After all, who needs a language, when you have the language of the heart? Go watch this one. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a movie you CANNOT hate. A movie where the protagonists are handicapped comes with a risk of unnecessary melodrama. Barfi! steers clear of this path and Basu manages to entertain the audience with really engaging scenes.\n\nThe story is more or less a look back on the life of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) by Shruti (Illeana D'Cruz) and a Sub-Inspector (Saurabh Shukla). Barfi's relationship with Shruti and Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra) is looked into and it also has an crime investigation flavor to it (which makes it a wee bit more interesting). How Barfi goes through his life from 1972 to 1978 (Darjeeling - Kolkata) is pretty much the movie. It has twists which are quite subtle.\n\nAnurag Basu has been very true to the movie. He has put a lot of heart to each of the scenes. Sometimes he has been really over-indulgent which drags the movie, especially in the first half. The movie is at least 20 minutes too long. Some cruelty with the scissors would have made the movie crisper and more enjoyable.\n\nThe biggest positive to me was the utterly stunning camera-work (S. Ravi Varman). The landscape shots and the clever use of focus was fabulous. Really loved the feel of the small town and the countryside. The background score was fantastic as well - never intrusive yet always adding to the situation. Must give credit to Pritam (assuming it is not lifted)\n\nRanbir Kapoor has put in an excellent performance. There are some solo acts within the movie where he really proves his mettle. You cannot help but feel what he is trying to make the character in the movie feel. Priyanka Chopra is also very good in her role; you do pity her character. This is a seriously courageous performance from both. Very few leading actors would embarrass themselves for their characters. Respect!\n\nIleana D'Cruz and Saurabh Shukla play regular people but do put up very competent performances. Illeana showcases a range of emotions in the movie very well, but it will surely be overshadowed by Ranbir and Priyanka purely because of the nature of their characters. The rest of the cast do their job quite well.\n\nAll in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It doesn't make much of a point, though I doubt if that was the intention anyway. I suggest you watch this movie when you are in a fairly relaxed and patient mood. Bollywood producing cinema of this quality is rare.\n\nEDIT: Since the review, I have learnt that fair number of scenes were copied and so was the background score. I have cut a point for that. That however should not make the movie any less watchable."

        "review_detailed_main": "BARFI! is about following your heart, a crime caper and, most importantly, a love story between two handicapped people.\n\nThe final part is something that's hardly shown in movies, and the fact that it is depicted realistically, with all the couple's problems, make it even more endearing. So, full credit goes to writer-director Anurag Basu for developing this sweet and humorous flick.\n\nRanbir Kapoor plays the titular character who is deaf and mute, but gets along with people and shines in every scene with his Chaplin-like antics and honesty.\n\nSet in the Unesco World Heritage Site of Darjeeling, famous for its tea industry and Himalayan Railway, the movie shows how Barfi meets Shruti (dazzling newcomer Ileana D'cruz), who initially is resistant to his charms and his wary of his handicap, but his persistence and charm wear her down and they eventually hit it off.\n\nHowever, Shruti's mother isn't too keen on her going out with a handicapped person, so she takes her to watch a woodcutter from a distance. The mum says she once loved that man, but now thinks of what would have happened to her had she taken a different path.\n\nShruti, of course, has been promised to a rich guy with all his physical senses intact, so it seems like a no-brainer for her.\n\nBut, as I said before, Barfi is, if not, terribly persistent. Even after accepting Shruti's mum's gentle rebuff of him, he explodes at Shruti, not in words, but through his flailing arms and cold eyes, accusing her of sacrificing love for wealth. His hurt and despair are there for all to see.\n\nThe movie may confuse viewers through its use of non-linear narrative structure. It starts in the present day but then moves between 1972, 1978 and the 1980s with fluidity. I can assure viewers, however, that their patience is well rewarded.\n\nAt the start, we see Barfi running away from a cop from the rooftop of a house. We're not told why, but we're sucked into the movie as Barfi evades the cop using a rickety ladder to balance himself on a wall, and even employs the use of a mirror in an ingenuous way to outwit the latter.\n\nThis, dear readers, is the chase scene that should have replaced that in Salman Khan's Ek Tha Tiger.\n\nPriyanka Chopra is not known for her gravitas, but she puts in a performance that is subtle and shimmering. Her autistic character, Jhimil Singh, can be said to resemble that of Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man.\n\nThat is true, but Prinyanka's gestures and eye movement are a delight to observe. Watch what her Jhimil thinks of the threat of Shruti, and becomes possessive of Barfi, after the two are reconciled after being apart for a long time.\n\nIn the meantime, Shruti is now married to the rich guy but there's a spark missing between them.\n\nShe mulls over the fact that she and her husband are 'perfect' but yet imperfect in their love, but for Barfi and Jhimil, while they may be imperfect, their love transcends everything else. She admires that, and is even jealous of it.\n\nLater on, she finally takes the road not taken to be with Barfi, but our dear hero's heart and mind are with Jhimil.\n\nThe songs in the movie are another delight, too. There are no subtitles for them but that in no way hinders our enjoyment of them.\n\nwww.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Thanks to multiple rave reviews in this space, elsewhere I finally caught up with \"Barfi\" today.\n\nStraight off, the film is an hour too long (yes that's right 60 minutes extra in the era of Attention deficiencies), way too convoluted and seems like a by product of a scatter brain Director/Story writer. And lo and behold in this case the Director and the Writer is one and the same - Anurag Basu.\n\nThis Basu chap has a none too impressive track record consisting of eminently forgettable stuff like \"Kites\", \"Gangster\", \"Tumsa nahin dekha\", \"Saaya\", \"Kucch to hai\" etc. In \"Barfi\" he lives up to his disastrous track record. Also Anurag Basu is no Chris Nolan to narrate a non linear story spanning multiple time frames with flash backs and flash forwards. He just ends up creating a non elegant maze.\n\nMany reviewers have already pointed out the shameless copying Basu has done from movies such as \"The Note Book\", \"Singing in the rain\", \"Cops\", \"Kikujiro\" and of course many Charlie Chaplin movies (most notably \"The Adventurer\" and \"City Lights\"). With so much of mish mash the end result is that an hour and half into the film you feel like you are sitting in a boring and meaningless lecture in your college and clock hands on your watch are refusing to move forward. So when the movie ends you shoot out of the movie theater like a bat out of hell all the while making a mental note to never ever watch any more of Basu's offerings.\n\nA word about the acting performances. Ranbir Kapoor puts in a competent performance for sure. Going by the current dismal acting standards of Bollywood, his performance seems award winning (atleast the Filmfare variety). Kapoor's character is set in 70's in small town Darjeeling but his mannerisms and body language are all reminiscent of 90's Bollywood films. Ranbir Kapoor should have borrowed a leaf or two from his grand uncle Shashi Kapoor's 1965 film \"Jab Jab Phool Khile\" where Shashi played the role of a poor boat man in Kashmir who falls for a rich tourist girl, Nanda. Ranbir does not get even 50% of his grand uncle's charisma, innocence and authenticity.\n\nIleana D' Cruz has a stock of 3-4 expressions which she puts on depending upon the severity of the situation.\n\nPriyanka Chopra in the role of an autist thinks that performances are all about make up, costume and hair pieces. There is no depth and little subtlety in her performance (spare us the repeated slow blink of eyes please). Chopra is no Sean Penn (\"I am Sam\") or Dustin Hoffman (\"Rainman\").\n\nNeither is Ranbir Kapoor, Tom Hanks (\"Forrest Gump\") or even Sanjeev Kumar (Koshish).\n\nAnurag Basu has cast some acclaimed actors such as Akash Khurana, Ashish Vidyarthi and Roopa Ganguly in supporting roles but their roles are so minuscule and uni- dimensional that they fail to add any heft to the finished product.\n\nI am going with 1.5 stars out of 5 for Barfi.\n\nAnd these 1.5 stars are for: not having shot the movie in any exotic overseas location, not featuring any rich NRI characters, not having any item number, no offensive toilet humor, no 6 pack abs flaunting hero, no noise masquerading as music. In fact, to be sure there are a couple of songs which stay with you for an hour or two after you are done and dusted with \"Barfi\".\n\nAll in all, this \"Barfi\" is a stale, rotten sweet from a dubious Halwai which has gone horribly rancid. Take a bite only if you are craving food poisoning."

It could easily have lapsed into a tear-jerking melodrama but has managed to remain a refreshing story of living life to the hilt. I think the similarity lies in the absolute positivity in their outlook and the lack of needless drama. The story revolves around three characters, two of whom are differently abled. And the beauty of the film lies entirely in the fact that it is NOT about the sadness in their lives. It is about acceptance, love, friendship and that there are no boundaries and no challenges when we connect with a person. Not preachy, not \"holier-than-thou\", it makes you realise that relationships don't always need words. And it is humorous. Ranbir Kapoor emotes effortlessly without words yet touches everyone. An adorable prankster, it is impossible not to fall in love with him. Definitely a huge chunk (not just a chip) of the various old blocks in his lineage. Ileana is beautiful and has managed to hold her own. Priyanka is exceptional as Jhilmil \u2013especially when she portrays her possessiveness for Barfi.\n\nThe film is special for its joie-de-vivre and poignancy."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK. The on going trend in movies: gravity-zero kung-fu fist fights, idiotic flawed stories. In the end one thought \"Oh God! I wasted my hardly earned bucks on these movies\". Although, I hate watching the trendy copied albeit flawed Bollywood flicks and its been a long time when I saw a Hindi movie. But then, \"barfi\" arrives. The dominion of Ranbir Kapoor is still on. Although, he is no \"khan\" but that's a boon for him. I entered the Theater with a trauma of \"Ek Tha Tiger\", thinking that this movie might lead the expectations. Hall is jam-packed, people whispering their own reviews, girls starving for Ranbir, boys hooting for Ileana and between this hustle and bustle, movie begins. And it takes you away from the very first appearance of that song \"Picture Shuru\". The story never leaves you. Although you keep on guessing what will happen next, but you're proved wrong in the end. People compared Ranbir's performance with Chaplin and his Grand father, Raj Kapoor, but let me clear out, Ranbir is a part of their clan now. Kudos! The songs leaves you with smiley tears, Ranbir-Ileana-Priyanka's performances leaves you speechless, stunned, numb. The bitter-sweet relationships of these three beautiful young characters, Murphi aka Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor), Shruti (Ileana D'cruz) and Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra) will not bore you out. You won't ask for an Intermission too. It will force you to say \"What a brilliantly fantabulous piece of work\". A movie for all. Even if this movie had no dialogs, a silent film, it would have been the same touchy flick.\n\nWarning: Not for the people who does not respect art."

Every movement seems like a glide over ice, the visual so calm and fresh, the music so breezy and trans like more like in french films.\n\nThe accordion is used so breathtakingly well. Pritam has shown what he is actually capable of, he should stick to doing so rather than make cast-copies from other languages.\n\nCinematography is just stunning, frames with such love and crispness. I have been wanting to go to Bengal for sometime, and now moreso after seeing the beautiful canvas shown in the movie.\n\nThe Acting by Ranbir is nothing short of brilliant. So is Priyanka's who plays an autistic child, with such conviction that you would wonder was she actually a fashion queen before? All other characters involved in the movie have been played very well to the character's requirements. It may have its cartoon type moments, but the characters involved are such that it is entitled to be so.\n\nNot often are you lucky enough to have seen such movies in your lifetime, so if you get a chance to watch it, please go and do so.\n\nDirector: Anurag Basu\n\nMusic: Pritam\n\nCinematographer: S Ravi Varman\n\nTrailer:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZxrao3zou4"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie begins with a leg-pulling jingle advising audience to settle down properly. Then begins a flashback story, there are two flashbacks actually. One by Shruti (Ileana D'cruz) and other by inspector (Saurabh Shukla). Story is set in Locales of Darjeeling and Kolkatta.\n\nThe unconventional story of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) is told with a conventional panache. The tellers spell out his characteristic of enjoying every moment of life and living it to the maximum, despite of his shortcomings of not being able to speak or hear. The name \"Barfi\" was originally christened as \"Murphy\" after the radio-sets (carrying image of a cute baby) people used to have in 70s. But as Barfi himself could not speak his name, it sounded more like Barfi, the sweet.\n\nJhilmil Singh (Priyanka Chopra) enters little late in the movie as a girl growing up with Autism and facing backlash from society.\n\nStory revolves around three youngsters who realise that love as a feeling cant be ignored or modified. No matter how they try to avoid Love, it comes back to them. How story steps out of ordinary is the harsh reality of the much touted 'second chance' people get in life. Story supports the second chance concept, however also emphasizes on the 'time' when you take/get it.\n\nThere is a point towards the end when Shruti spells out her illusive dream of a love story where she ( epitomising her grandmother) will find Mr. Right and grow old with him. She compares her stand about Mr. Barfi with Jhilmil who unlike her did not put brain while getting involved with Barfi and continues to do so for the rest of her life.\n\nRanbir and Priyanka have given their best performances ever. They seem to sink into the characters so well, especially Priyanka when she makes audiences forget what model actress she is. The supporting cast by Saurabh Shukla and Ashish Vidyarthi are stupendous. We wonder why Priyanka is virtually missing out in publicity posters, its definitely an Oscar performance by her as well as Ranbir. Ileana works her way out with the stills pretty well. All in all a very fulfilling experience. Full bang for the buck."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Barfi' is a very rare Bollywood film. It needed a very passionate director and an extremely committed cast and scored on both fronts. The script is outstanding and it would be criminal to not say so. The humor and the dialogues are so well fitting and prepares you for the joyride.\n\n'Barfi' is the name of a deaf mute boy living in Darjeeling and also the story of his 'sunny side up' view of life. It chose to primarily treat differently abled people as regular people and weave a beautiful tale with some outstanding moments. Their 'disability' is NOT the story but the story will make you forget their vulnerability and appreciate the characters they are. Its treads very far from the clich\u00e9d view of differently abled people.\n\nRanbir's Charlie Chaplin influenced 'Barfi' is the core of film. He's tugging at the foot of destiny with such a performance that will remind you of Raj Kapoor. The Kapoor clan can be proud. Priyanka Chopra left me bewildered and I still am gripping to terms with her performance. I dare not say its bad, it was way good but maybe it was so different from the PC that we all know and if that's the case, then its full points to her as an actor. Ileana was refreshing and just right; what a debut to have? The cast was outstanding. Each performing just right and Anurag Basu deserves some beautiful bouquets just for that. I'd specially mention the effortless performance of Saurabh Shukhla as the policeman.\n\nWhen you have your lead being a deaf mute, you tend to heavily rely on music to showcase the story and Pritam has beaten himself to give life to this movie. What really works for 'Barfi' is the excellent background score. I wished it were a tone lighter but it has held the weave and tugs at your heart strings.\n\nRavi Varman's visuals were very fresh and crisp. You get to see beautiful and stunning views of Darjeeling and also Kolkata. The sets were equally impressive.\n\nThere's something about 'Barfi' which leaves you speechless and that seems a small problem when you happened to write a review. Anurag Basu, take a bow!"

The movie follows the adventures of Barfi ( Ranbir Kapoor) through his ups and downs in life filled with moments of laughter and sadness and more importantly ,love and romance.The movie is filled with such depth that each and every scene has a story to tell of itself and the movie altogether felt like many movies sewn together with its numerous flashbacks. The movie gives a wonderful message that love doesn't need to fit in the society's views of whats normal and whats abnormal. The locations are wonderful, the songs heart touching and the acting is fantabulous.Ranbir Kapoor plays the role of Barfi with finesse, He is surely the future of bollywood. His antics similar to the legendary Charlie Chaplin is sure to amuse the audience.Priyanka Chopra who appears sans making is just amazing to watch.She plays her role as the autistic Jhilmil with flawless perfection and kudos to Illeana D'cruz who is a telugu actress who played the role of Shruthi very well. Barfi is a modern masterpiece and should not be missed at all.Its a movie Bollywood should be proud of. A movie which tries something out of the tried and tested Bollywood formula. This one feels you leaving happy and warm.. why its almost like enjoying your home made barfi."

        "review_detailed_main": "Drawing inspiration from Charlie Chaplin, 'The Notebook' and a few others, the director of movies such as 'Gangster' and 'Life in a Metro', Anurag Basu has also drawn much slack. However, if you choose to look beyond those few scenes, Barfi has a real, heart-warming story to tell and Basu was quite capable of portraying it with the talents of Ranbir Kapoor and surprisingly, Priyanka Chopra. Unlike his past works, Basu turns poetic in his manner of story telling and therefore, the going is slower. Yet, the result is more artful and pleasing as one can better relate to each character and like them. The film teaches us a simple lesson about love that it is unbiased, selfless and inspiring. With a talented cast, outstanding cinematography, sweet melodies by Pritam and equal amounts of every emotion, Barfi is among the best entertainers of recent times and in the age when we are looking down south for remakes, it is all the more cherishable.\n\nIn the tranquil hills of Darjeeling, the loudest noise and ruckus is created by one who is mute and deaf. Such is Barfi's mischievous charm that irks the local Police and his father but tempts the friendship and love of Shruti (Ileana). Theirs is such a petulant relationship of old school flirting and romance which is based on Barfi's good heart rather than his flaws and other virtues. Then there is Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra), Barfi's childhood friend whose autism is no barrier for Barfi's kindness. Societal pressure, its norms and orthodox values takes the definitive course of this triangle which only brings Jhilmil and Barfi closer.\n\nRanbir Kapoor's performance is simply exemplary. His versatility is proved yet again and with a challenging role like this, he easily becomes the character and sketches himself in our memory. As long as he continues to go against the norm, pursuing scripts with strong characters, he is on his way to being the best of our generation. Ileana looks beautiful in every scene and although her role wasn't a challenge, her expressions were suited to every scene. Saurabh Shukla was hilarious and very natural as the cop who is always chasing Barfi. But the real surprise is Priyanka Chopra as Jhilmil. One cannot imagine that she was also capable of pulling this off. She lets go of her glamorous self completely and adorns this autistic girl's role with good understanding. One can sit back in disbelief that this is the actress who hams her way through several movies while being pretentious in the others.\n\nDirector Anurag Basu has kept things simple and used Pritam's music to suit Barfi's nature and Darjeeling's serene beauty that is captured in such a spectacular manner by S. Ravi Verman. The background score is extremely important when your lead actors do not speak at all and there too, the film impresses. Mohit Chauhan's Aala Barfi once again proves that he's the best around while Nikhil Paul George in Main Kya Karoon and Aashiyan is brilliant. Then of course you have Papon's magic in Kyon which makes this soundtrack a melody you can sing along and smile to.\n\nBasu's story telling is immersive and he manages to keep you entertained with frequent comic scenes involving Barfi, Jhilmil and the Police. Even after an emotionally strong scene, Barfi will manage to make you smile because he moves on to embrace life in every moment rather than sulking in one. Barfi is uncomplicated, unpretentious and just like his heart, is pure at the core. He might occasionally step into Chaplin's shoes but when you look beyond that, it is Ranbir Kapoor showcasing a talent that is worthy of a loud applause."

It's also the only film to have gotten a STANDING OVATION at the theater, and i saw all of them at the theater.\n\nThe film is a gem of all types be it the the unique intro, or the first frame whose tenderness sets you up for the ride. A love story at its core, the movie is unique in that it showcases each person's love story on its own strength, separately yet intertwined and does so fantastically. It also holds out the promise of finding new love after losing while conceding that some memories will always be looked back upon with regret.\n\nRanbir is brilliant, his performance the most heart moving since that of Aamir Khan and Darsheel in Taare Zameen Par. The extent to which he embodies Barfi, is a lifetime performance. Be it the spurned love,goofball and slapstick genius, or a man limited by his disability in two especially heart-wrenching scenes. His performances is truly worthy of being called a tribute to Charlie Chaplin and is really well supported by the music of this film which is pitch perfect in capturing the essence of this film. Ileana D'Cruz is the embodiment of what any Indian man would want his wife to look like, yet the way her character ends leaves you with a knot in your throat.\n\nAnd Priyanka. She absolutely steals the show all the way here. Each and every frame of hers is brilliant that it leaves you wondering why she's not mentioned along with Vidya Balan and Kareena more often in the list of female leads who can act and outperform anyone. To say anything else is to do injustice .\n\nFinally to Anurag Basu, you surely deserve an Oscar nomination for this work and for coming the way you did after Kites. Thank you for giving us a film which we kept returning to long after leaving the theater...\n\nso if you're feeling down or depressed or even if you aren't go for this. Or else you might just be left regretting.\n\nGo Barfi!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometime around 2 months back when I first caught glimpse of Ranbir Kapoor starrer Barfi, I was captivated and overwhelmed by the colours and feel that 3 minute video exuded. Albeit harbouring obvious cautious about the movie, I was convinced of it's uniqueness and message. I never considered Anurag basu a ordinary director, hoping onto any big budget movies with high on the payroll scale star cast. Even when Kites made it to the theatres I was pleasantly pleased by it's outcome. For me his movies put forth the more distinct human relationship to the fore.\n\nBarfi involves 3 primary lead characters namely Barfi \u2013 a mute chap going about life like there's no tomorrow, Shruti \u2013 as a Bengali girl who falls in love with Barfi but her relevance on her mother weighs over her aptness in making decision related to heart, Jhillmil \u2013 autistic, insecure girl and compatriot to Barfi for most part of the movie. One can sense the ubiquitous vividness when any two of these makes their presence together on screen. At first it all seems surreal with the mannerisms and the look of it, but then the charm of Barfi starts to evolve with the Chaplin-sque ways, with the smiles and with the heartbreaks. The humour in the movie is intelligent although not original. The scene where Barfi first sees Shruti, the proposal letter to Shruti's parents scene, robbery scene, lamp post cutting etc are some of the scenes where one is left overwhelmed. The intermittent flashbacks and flash forwards are very well incorporated and ones gets the feeling of travelling through an era. Although the movie is complete package of fun, drama and superb acting, it overplays some aspects of movie-making. Like the music which I enjoyed swooning too, gets played every second scene making it repetitive and monotonous. Also the length of the movie is quite a worry for director who had squeezed a movie like Life in a Metro in under 2 hours. Frankly speaking I prayed the movie stopped after 2h20m because it was stretching too far. Sometimes the pranks and the antics of Barfi seem overplayed evidently contributing to length factor.\n\nThe setting of the movie in Darjeeling and Kolkata helps amply in getting the correct feel of the plot and what the makers had to convey. Not to mention the toy train seeing after a long time (Parineeta I guess).\n\nRanbir Kapoor seem to cross every string of imagination every time he takes a movie project. Most of his films start from the same pole, a quirky guy who's chasing girls, blowing kisses in air, he drinks and then the characters start to develop taking their own paths. It's in this movies that he excels in doing what he does best, not be a stereotype like others. Ranbir instils such life and charm into the character that it is difficult to imagine any other actor doing it. Being an admirer of Ileana D'cruz for talents other than acting, I have been quite satisfied with the way she played Shruti. She carried the role with grace and without stealing from the books of Hema Malini or Sharmila Tagore. Priyanka Chopra playing Jhillmil is the icing on the cake, her well played mannerisms of autistic girl and far more convincing, and her rapport with RK is truly a plus for the movie. She has the most impressive list of female oriented movies in recent years and that I the prime reason she played the part more proficiently. Saurabh Shukla playing the grouchy yet funny Police officer is a treat to enjoy.\n\nSuch movie are very rare to come by and even if they do you wouldn't get to admire the skills and humour with which it is handled. It's a must catch from me."

Kudos to Ranbir.The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless,as non-acting He sinks his teeth into the part of the determined barfi and comes up with such a terrific performance. It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well."

        "review_detailed_main": "In midst of urban city life where everyone is tied to theirs jobs, family ,responsibilities etc. one always tends to forget living their life to the fullest. Barfi, a message-oriented film, inspires to enjoy every second of your life as you will never get another chance to live. It is a feel-good film that sends out a signal \u2013 \"Don't Worry, everything is going to be alright\"\n\nBarfi is a character played by Ranbir Kapoor, a feel-free young clad who can neither speak nor listen , but always is ready with prank up to his shoulder. He is the talk of town and quite mischievous as well. His life turns upside down when he meets two beautiful ladies in his life, Shruti Ghosh (played by Illeana D' Cruz) and Jhilmill Chatterjee (played by Priyanka Chopra).\n\nAnurag Basu ( Murder , Life in a Metro , Kites) has surely been inspired from Charlie Chaplin's antic to put in more fun-loving character of Barfi. But more than that, Basu has created a different scenario in the Indian Cinema by capturing the nature's beauty at its best. He is not only a proficient story-teller but also has good sense of photography as well. The film also dwells on childhood fantasy like creating reflection of light on the wall with glass, sailing paper boat on the water during rainy season, playing with firefly in the night. It will take you a world of fantasy and imagination and create an aura of its own. Hats off to Anurag Basu to make a film on differently-abled people, who has live more glorious and eventful than us. The screenplay is tight holding viewer's attention to the core. Art direction is gorgeous. Camera-work by Ravi Varman needs special mention here. He has truly captured the beautiful locales of Bengal in his camera which audiences will definitely love it. Since both Ranbir and Priyanka do not have many dialogues , it is background score which emblems with the scenes here. Music by Pritam is soulful. Few minutes of trimming in the second half would have helped little more. Coming to the performances, it is Ranbir's show all the way. He is a gifted actor like his parent and takes his family name to one level next. The versatile actor emotes so accurately through his facial expression that is difficult to imagine anyone else in this character. He is funny, witty, and impressive with perfect timing of his body language. I am sure he is going to win an award for his brave performance. Priyanka Chopra was a complete surprise portraying the role of mentally challenged girl with ease. She gets into the character completely and gives an electrifying performance. Illeana does a fantastic job as new-comer. She gives a full-fledged support to the movie and will be loved by audience for her supporting role.\n\nBarfi is film which inspires and teaches you to appreciate and celebrate life. We always crib about everything in life we don't have but we never enjoy the things that is always there for us. Go and indulge yourself in BARFI to respect and enjoy the moments in LIFE. Strongly recommended"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched Barfi relatively late, after its nomination as the Indian entry for the Oscars has been declared. Now accusations are being levied on this movie for having a good dose of plagiarism, lifting the original idea from Benny & Joon (1993) and several scenes and pieces from various Hollywood movies.\n\nAfter watching this brilliant movie which generates both laughs and tears, I can say that the accusers are forgetting the real inspiration for Anurag Basu, the director and Ranbir Kapoor, the actor. And that real inspiration is Raj Kapoor. Interestingly, the first part of Raj Kapoor's full name is Ranbir only (complete name is Ranbir Raj Kapoor) and his son, Rishi Kapoor christened his son after the name of his legendary father only. This way Ranbir Kapoor got his name. While watching it in the theatre, the complete movie seemed to me like a tribute to the on-screen personality and several movies of Raj Kapoor, especially Mera Naam Joker (1970). Raj Kapoor himself was inspired by Charlie Chaplin, hence no wonder, this movie as well as Ranbir's character is Chaplinisque. He is a natural actor and the shoes of his legendary grandfather, the greatest showman of Bollywood, seem to be fitting him perfectly in this movie.\n\nKisi Ki Mustarahaton Pe Ho Nisaar, Kisi Ka Dard Mil Sake To Le Udhaar, Kisi Ke Vaaste Ho Tere Dil Mein Pyaar, Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai. Remember Raj Kapoor ? Find the same message being conveyed by deaf and mute Barfi in this movie.\n\nBarfi is the love-triangle of a deaf-mute boy, an autistic girl and a normal Bengali girl who pass through different tests of life to discover that love is something to feel. It can't be defined or tested on the norms of the society who strive to clip its wings. The thing I feel that the abnormal characters of this movie knew it beforehand and the discovery was only for the normal girl who sacrificed the most and gained proportionately very less. But the thing is that getting the love of the person you love is not that easy because it depends upon that person or the other external factors but loving someone from your side is always easy because it is in your hands and nobody can stop you from that or imprison your sentiments. However, it emerges naturally in your heart and you cannot deliberately love some particular person to suit the practical situation of life (like marriage). That Shruti (Ileana D' Cruz) learns by loving Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) who does not love her but an autistic girl, Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra). Frankly speaking, the base of this story is Barfi, the male but the character which puts all the threads of this story together is Shruti, the losing girl who is satisfied by loving only, letting go the desire to get the love of the man she loves.\n\nThe personality of Ranbir (and also many incidents taking place with him) reminded me of Mera Naam Joker, the zenith as well as the Waterloo of Raj Kapoor. However the love-triangle has conspicuous resemblance with a very old classic movie - Goonj Uthi Shehnaai (1959). In Goonj Uthi Shehnaai also, there is the character of Raamkali (akin to that of Shruti in Barfi)who selflessly loves the hero, Kishan (Rajendra Kumar), making a lot of sacrifices for him but without expecting any reciprocation or return. She knows that Kishan actually loves Gopi (Ameeta) but she becomes their accomplice and tries to help them in getting united. The way, Jhilmil is autistic in this movie, the same way, Gopi becomes insentient in that black and white classic movie. And the death comes for both the lovers simultaneously in both the movies with the third angle remaining alive to narrate the story to the world. Well, these similarities (intentional or unintentional) appear to be intriguing. But the thing that I liked in Goonj Uthi Shehnaai is that though Kishan does not love Raamkali (because he loves Gopi), he acknowledges the love of Raamkali for him and feels grateful to her for the sacrifices made by her for his sake. In Barfi, the protagonist is selfish from this angle that he is never shown to feel the abundant love and the great sacrifices of Shruti, leave aside acknowledging them. Shruti's love is great from this viewpoint and scores over the love of Barfi for Jhilmil.\n\nRanbir Kapoor seems to have been born with acting in his genes. I have never seen him acting bad. In this movie, despite showing shadows of his late grandfather, he has demonstrated a peculiar originality at the same time. Priyanka Chopra has done marvellously in the difficult role and nobody seems to have noticed the less footage given to her role in the movie. However, the surprise package of this movie is debutante Ileana D' Cruz. Fresh ! Charming ! Impressive. Her role renders expansion to the roles of the other protagonists and she is simply superb in her performance. All others also fit their bill without any deficiency on anybody's part.\n\nPreetam's music and Swanand Kirkire's lyrics both are highly admirable. Preetam has kept the melody intact which is a great feat for a Hindi film composer of today.\n\nThe art director has brought both Darjeeling and Kolkata alive on the screen. The cinematographer has also done so excellently that several scenes of this movie appear to be like beautiful paintings. It's a visual treat and hence can be enjoyed better on the big screen.\n\nDialogs of the movie are very impressive and touching. The editor has used his scissors with such finesse that the movie moves quite fast in the first half and at a relatively slow pace in the second half which is completely in sync with the mood of the screenplay in both the halves.\n\nBarfi is imperfect, yet excellent. Will be considered a classic in the times to come."

The music, the screenplay and the expressions by the actors, especially Ranbhir, are enough to keep you engaged for the whole 3 hours. You will find yourself laughing at his silly-sweet antics, smiling at Priyanka's innocence and silently admiring the sheer beauty of the director's caliber of story-telling. And don't be surprised to find a tear trickle down your cheeks every now and then.\n\nAnd though there could have other better movies to send for the Oscar, this one's definitely worth a watch, maybe even two! :)"

All the credit goes to Lead Actors Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra and Director Anurag Basu for making this film a 100-crore blockbuster. This film will definitely make you laugh, cry, feel free and much more. Moreover, this is a type of movie which you can watch with family, friends and anyone. Since this is a romantic movie so couples can also enjoy watching it. Believe me, if you watch this movie only once, you will definitely watch it 3-4 times more and each time you will laugh and cry and believe that this movie is really the best movie. I have also watched it 10-11 times and I am not going to get bored of this. Barfi did also get official entry in the Oscar Awards 2013, so it is quite obvious that this movie can't get even 8/10 but much more than it. So go for it."

The predictability of the story adds to the aura of innocence created by the director which makes you leave the movie hall with an experience that you can call as heart purifying.\n\nAt the end of the movie you just feel a part of the whole experience as a bystander and will feel that butterfly or two in your stomach.\n\nThe movie makes you laugh with gay abandon without worrying what the guy sitting next to you will think about you (because he is also laughing the same) and will make you cry your heart out and by the end of the movie it will leave your heart with an incredible lightness.\n\n100% guaranteed to make you forget all your worries. This is what movies should be all about.\n\nNo wonder the director is an artist in his own class. The real hero of this movie is not the people who have acted in this film but the guy who realized their potential to give this kind of a performance.\n\nIlleana d'cruz will be proud of this role of hers for all time to come, Priyanka chopra - I forgive you for agneepath and all the commercial trash before this you are added to my watchable actors list (temporary of course and subject to future performances).

It was a perfect combination of humour, romance and drama. It's the kind of movie that gets to you. It teaches us that some feelings need not be about perfection in others, it is their imperfections that we should embrace and cherish. If we keep looking for 'a perfect' other, if we give up what we have for what we might have, we may end alone; that's what happened to Shruti. As for Barfi and Jhilmil, you just cannot escape the 'beauty' of how it all came to be. Barfi went from the person who hits his head against the wall for being stuck with Jhilmil, to the one who would do anything to have her back. She was as disabled as he was, as imperfect as he was, yet it never stopped from sharing what she has with him; she taught him how to write his name, he taught her to spit melon seeds on the window and they had such much fun doing it. It was Jhilmil, not the beautiful Shruti, not his best friend, who was still standing there by his side when he gave his 'fidelity test'... It hit him that moment, as it hit us too: This is all that matters!\n\nPeople just need to learn how to enjoy things, and see the perfection that lies beyond the imperfections!"

Basu's Screenplay never falters & appeals all through. Basu's Direction, on the other-hand, is proficient. Cinematography is outstanding. Editing is sharp. Music by Pritam is brilliant. Amongst the musician's best soundtracks to date. Art Design is proper.\n\nLove needs expressions not language, it requires feelings no boundaries, it's beyond oceans beyond limits- Free and Beautiful but only few know how to live it. Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color \u2013Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family. Performance-Wise: Ranbir Kapoor is a fearless actor & he presents Barfi superbly. The versatile actor lives the utterly lovable protagonist to the fullest. Amongst Ranbir's Best Performances! Priyanka Chopra is another topper. She plays the easy to love autistic character matchlessly. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Saurabh Shukla is mesmerizing in a strong supporting role. Shukla hasn't been this good in a long, long time! Ashish Vidyarthi does well. Others lend perfect support. This movie is perfect from all sides"

As for example, DHOOM 3: still more original than Barfi.\n\nThose 2-2.5 hrs spent in the theater will never come back, lost in oblivion. The movie scenes were copied so blatantly from all over the world that I did not bother to pay attention to the story. To add insult to injury , this movie was the official submission from India for Academy awards. Now the whole world knows our best movies are copied. I could name the movies from which scenes have been copied , but i will not do for two reasons. First, that information is easily available, second, this movie doesn't deserve that much of my time.\n\nThis movie is just a number of good scenes taken from other movies, stitched together, poorly. It was slow as hell. And the director of the movie claimed originality. The arrogance! The insult to people's intelligence! But the people liked it. So there. As long as we keep praising movies like this, nothing good and original will happen in India in any field. This movie stands for everything which is wrong with Indian education system, awareness, lack of original research, politics and many other things."

OR may be enjoying those troubles as well.. The hero of movie, Murphy (or Barfi) truly dances with life.. throughout his life..\n\nLove and marriage generally seen in the present society (which may be for good or bad??) is beautifully projected. And the best projection of a TRUE LOVE where only heart matters and mind in the long run only servers the heart to manage all other life needs.\n\nThank you Anurag Basu.."

        "review_detailed_main": "The major reason that the film is good is that it has the awesome acting by Ranbeer Kapoor. The story is good but is not the reason why one should see the film. The film revolves around a deaf and dumb Guy named \u2013 \"Barfi\". His nature, way of tackling things and thoughts are what forms the major part of the story. The good thing is that the film presents the world of disabled and autistic people beautifully. You will not cry in the end because you are watching their disability but because of the emotions that develop gradually till the end.\n\nPROS:\n\nIt is right to say that the film has copied scenes in many instances but you should not keep that in mind and watch the film, or you will not see and understand the true purpose of the film. The film is important in today's times. It invokes laughter and at the same time teaches you things which are very important in life. Now if we use some of the things from previous artists, just to make the film more interesting, then where is the problem? The important thing is that films should do what they are required to do. Among its many purposes it invokes people (though for a little time) to think rationally before doing anything and most of all tells that it is good to follow your heart and take risks. Priyanka Chopra too has done a wonderful job. Good thing is that the characters are not much and there is plenty of time to develop them. The music too was good (again somewhat copied.\uf04a).\n\nCONS:\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the length of the film. At some point of time, I was fed up with the idiosyncrasies of barfi. They started showing it way too many times and way too much. The ending of the film wasn't that charming.\n\nMESSAGE: \"The only risk in life is not to take risks.\"\n\nVERDICT: \"A recommended watch.\""

Great to see stories like this being picked up in bollywood although I know for a fact that some of the gags were picked up directly from the old and classic Charlie Chaplin movies. Some great acting by all the three characters, Ranbir Ileana and Priyanka. Anurag basu did one hell of a job of making a complex story being told with such ease. It's the kinda movie that makes you believe in yourself and regardless of how people and society perceives you, very inspirational indeed. The standout scene was the sad proposal cum heartbreak of Barfi at Shruti's home. 5 minutes of pure brilliance both acting and screenplay wise. Reminded me of the outstanding performance by Nana Patekar in Khamoshi, the musical. Now that's some benchmark to match and Ranbir Kapoor did do it in that particular scene. 9.5/10. Worth a watch for all believers who are waiting for love to come and find them. :)"

At a time when we have shows like American Horror Story, Make It or Break It, and the Secret Life of American Teenager that feature characters with Down Syndrome or a physical disability, it's high time we have more films from all cultures that feature people from ALL walks of life in mainstream media.\n\nThe timing couldn't be greater; more young people are being exposed to stories like this that reaffirms that we all may be different in some ways, but we seek love and acceptance all the same. I've always been a fan of Bollywood films...this one in particular made me laugh and cry and encourage me to further my studies in Sign Language. I personally want to educate myself in the multiple ways we can communicate with one another...and this film showcases how the spoken language is not the only form we can communicate love, desire, understanding, and compassion. It also does a good job of showing how we can preserver from all kinds of obstacles and still find life full of joy and adventure.\n\nThe cinematography is breathtaking. It is beautifully styled and edited. And not enough could be said about the musical score that pairs so well with the art direction of the film. The actors who played their respective roles do so with a lot of heart that can be easily be seen and appreciated. When I did my research to see what others have said on the film, I was surprised by what the naysayers had to say. They nit-picked on the most obscure points...Yes, the director stated that this film is inspired by Keaton & Chaplin and other...how is that a negative?? So many films out there are inspired by others...and so many films are UNINSPIRED, poorly acted, edited, and so on...Whatever his inspirations were, this film is original to me...\n\nSo lastly I want to say, do give this film a viewing. Like the rest of us, you'll surely be touched by this precious film. I enjoyed viewing it alone, but I think this film is best viewed with friends and family."

It is nice to see new ideas explored, rather than dance routines and over-the top drama. The tired Bollywood formulae is becoming an absolute bore to watch, as I have seen it plenty of times. Barfi is a fresh breath of air. It is a charming and delighful piece of film-making\n\nThe storyline takes us on the journey to the 1970s India. The costumes, background and fashion are in line with the 70s decade. The director has done a great job in direction and cinemagraphy. I like the peaceful settings. As suggested by the title, Barfi is the main character. He is a young man who cannot speak or hear. I found the character engaging. He is always in trouble with the law, as he is up to some mischief. The comedy elements between the police and Barfi features as few of the scenes throughout the film. There is a bit of the old slapstick comedy in those moments. Barfi is a cheerful person and likes to have a good laugh. There is always pressure and high expectation to live up to the name and reputation of a legendary actor (Rishi Kapoor). He is a well established actor in the industry. Acting is in genes of the Kapoor family, as Ranbir displays a wonderful performance. He has really got into the mindset of the character. I admire Ranbir modesty about his success and he deserves an award for an excellent performance as Barfi. Priyanka Chopra's character as Jhilmil is well sketched, as an autistic childhood friend of Barfi. Priyanka is a much improved actress since earlier films I have watched featuring the star. There is romance blossoming between the two. It is really sweet to admire. Bollywood newcomer IIeana plasy her part beautifully as Barfi's first love on sight.\n\nI think the characters steal the show. There is a sweet tale in the story. The films convey an important message about life. I thoroughly enjoyed Barfi. I cannot fault the film at all. I did not want the film to end at any point. It is absorbing, engaging and filled with joy. Bollywood needs to keep it up in delivering quality films like this."

And the third character and the narrator (Shruti) also created ample space for her.This movie is a real tribute to Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin.\n\nN.B. : There are some loopholes in the story, It would be better if the sequence where shruti's mother tells about her first love were not copied from \"The notebook\"."

A commercial hit as well as a critical one, the movie has a lot of insights to offer to even an average cinema-goer apart from making you smile and cry all the way.\n\nThe movie set in the 1970s, is a shown from a perspective of a deaf guy,Barfi (who is very mischievous and childlike) who tumbles through the various realities of life and manages to find true love. The movie stars Ranbir Kapoor as the deaf guy, Priyanka Chopra as an autistic girl, and the south Indian actress Illeana D'Cruz as a normal girl who falls for the lead character and is the epitome of sanity in the movie. The movie is not short on gags and has a excellent story line to dwell upon.\n\nOverall, a fantastic movie particularly one of the Bollywood's best ever, India's official nomination to the Oscars, and a subtle meaning to take away with you. Two and half hours worth of treat for the eyes."

After a long time some one from Kapoor family has rock the bollywood. Barfi is a film you can watch and enjoy with family and friends.

        "review_detailed_main": "Lifted from a quote \"Sholay jaisi movie banati nahi, bas ban jaati hai\" (Movies like \"Sholay\" are not planned but are accidentally made). Undoubtedly, I can say the same for Barfi. I considered 50 First Dates as the best romantic movie till date. But it all got changed in this movie night. Barfi is certainly in its own league.\n\nThe story is of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor), a deaf & mute youth from Darjeeling, and his journey to find his true love.\n\nThe hero of the movie is its editing. Several cropped scenes, paltry storytelling, nicely stitched at the end. Only then you connect the dots & draw the wholesome picture. I do not recall a better editing in the recent past. Ranbir Kapoor has slipped in the Charlin Chaplinsque character with aplomb. His antics are not silly, they are innocent. You feel for him when he sees Ileana's fianc\u00e9 for the first time. Ranbir is a superb dancer. No movie has yet exploited his dancing skills. Ileana looks stunning. She is there from first frame of the movie till the last. She could not have got a better platform for a Bollywood debut. And someone said there is Priyanka Chopra also. Well, she is not. There is only a character called Jhilmil, an autistic girl, a completely de-glam avatar of PC. The bonding between Barfi & Jhilmil is what eternal love stores, like Siri-Farhad/Laila-Majnu, are made of.\n\nDarjeeling has been captured with utmost beauty. It would certainly go as a favored tourist destination, all thanks to Barfi. Some scenes are shot with a lot of cinematic precision. Like the one where a person collapses due to liver failure and the other person is seen deep sleeping in the same frame, the clock tower scene is innovative; surely this is something which wannabe lover boys would like to try.\n\nA school teacher, once, asked in a class IV, the definition of love. One girl stood up & replied that \"when her mom prepares tea for her dad, she takes a sip, to get the taste, before giving the tea to her dad. That is love.\" Read this somewhere \"The best conversations are the ones where he hears all what she does not speak.\" Is love so simple to define? Yes it is. You need to watch Barfi to believe it.\n\nSome movies are better left beyond star ratings & categorization. Brilliant is mere a word which cannot do justice to the heartfelt emotions depicted in the movie. I would use the word \"simple\" as no other adjective would suit it better. A must see J.\n\n(Author - Hariom Pandey, Hyderabad, Qualcomm)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ten minutes into the movie, I thought it was a movie with an identity crisis. It didn't know whether to be serious or slapstick. It had Chaplinesque chase sequences, but melodrama in places.\n\nBut just a few minutes later, I realized that yes, it was a mix of extremes - it was a no holds barred slapstick, but it dealt with serious issues like death and murder, but it worked surprisingly well. It talks about the adventures/ mishaps surrounding the life of Barfi, a happy-go- lucky guy who lives in Darjeeling, trying to live a pleasant and cheerful life despite being handicapped from birth (he is a deaf mute); how he faces love, financial problems, and being chased around by bungling cops for an assortment of crimes.\n\nClear inspirations from Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton (with some sequences directly taken from the classic oldies). I also recognized some work from Jackie Chan, but since Jackie himself was always inspired by the early Hollywood comedies, I guess overall, the tribute was to the black and white movie era.\n\nThey have also used the recurring gag of actual musicians in key scenes playing the movie's background score from 'There's something about Mary'.\n\nIt was a silent era movie set in the modern times, like Kamal Hassan's old 'Pushpak'. While 'Pushpak' offered no reason for the silence it projected, 'Barfi!' stays largely silent because the central character is a deaf mute, which is integral to the plot and most of the comedy sequences.\n\nPriyanka Chopra stars as the autistic girl from a rich family who gets tangled in Barfi's life. The first few minutes of her appearance, I felt she was trying out a bad imitation of Dustin Hoffman's 'Rain Man'. Unsuccessfully. (Of course, unsuccessfully. Rain Man remains untouchable) But later on, her sequences were better, and felt more natural.\n\nThe key to the movie's success is Ranbir Kapoor. I always pegged him for a decent actor, but with this movie, he has proved himself to be among the best. The way he handled conversations in the movie was truly astounding. He didn't use the standard deaf mute sign language, but preferred to communicate via gestures that anybody could understand. And he did it in such a way that I don't think there's a single sentence or sentiment that could have been missed by the audience throughout the movie. Also, his unspoken dialogs were done in the right pace; conversations did not seem belabored, stretched, delayed or out of place. He even managed to bring in the right tone of the dialogs throughout the movie. It was masterfully done.\n\nAll things considered, I would give the movie 9 out of 10 stars."

The acting, songs, direction..everything! The movie is realistic, funny and emotional. Ranbir, Ileana and Priyanka were all very good. They portrayed their characters perfectly! It is touching to see that even invalids can have a life. They can fall in love and maintain it too! I liked the idea of couples \"dying\" together. It's very classic and the love story is not like the modern day definition of \"love\".\n\nOne small drawback that I found is that the movie is very sluggish and slow. It is not a problem as enjoying the movie is more important!\n\nVery good movie! If you can't watch it in a theater, watch it on your computer at least! ;)"

My God..she surprised me...in the whole movie i was asking myself \"Is she priyanka??\". No more words for her...just Hats off.\n\nRanbir kapoor: The young man from the family of kapoor. Acting is in his blood. his Performances are improved from Rajneeti,Rockstar and now Barfi. Master piece performance. Excellent.\n\nAbout movie: Direction is so nice. Presentation of the movie in parts,is so nice. Even the suspense through the whole movie \"who killed jhimil?\" was nice. The love.The devotion. The purity of love. Regret of love,sacrifice...in short you can see every color of love in this movie. Even the comedy tickles you very much.

Talk about Ranbeer Kapoor, he has grown so much within past few year that no can say that this boy has his debut in 2008, watching him doing comedy is like watching a motion pictures of Charlie Chaplin, he has performed so well that every performance is impossible to carry without his. other character who left a mark are Saurabh Shukla(Inspector) & Priyanka Chopra(Jhilmil) These two character never went under the cloud of Ranbeer, This movie had few mistakes and there are few scenes taken exactly from some movies, like the whole character of mother is taken from The Notebook, Her every scene is a part of that movie and is been played in same way no modifications had been done. The death scene in the end was also from the Notebook. few comic scenes are taken from Chaplin's earlier movies like Modern Times. thus have to give it 9 stars out of ten, but this movie is worth watching."

Although some scene seems to be copied from notebook, mr bean and charlie Chaplin but this movie is the first of it's kind in Bollywood and it's lot's better than that BS rowdy type movie. So this type of movie should be welcomed because they have tried something different and good.\n\nSo for those who think that this movie has a bad plot or bad direction i disagree them. The plot was awesome music was splendid. And the movie has the two side funny and sad. At the end people will hate irrespective of how good movie is if they are jealous of ranvir :).\n\nThe conclusion is that the movie is about a man who spreads love and happiness.Ranvir and priyanka did a very stunning acting. Shruti didn't do a convincing job and she's done a OK type job and sometimes very poor acting."

I was surprised by the performance of Priyanka chopra. My God, it was extra ordinary, I felt like she is really abnormal. It would be very bad if she didn't get a national award for this performance.

When you walk into a cinema, you are looking to be entertained and that's what Barfi does surprisingly though you can walk in with all your good senses in tact (for a Bollywood movie yes!) as Barfi invites you to explore life , learn it's lessons, feel the pain and then know how to move on. You are shown how to laugh or to express love or sorrow or hurt in the face of cold indifference. The performances are brilliant, the cinematography is masterful and the directing lies at the heart of it all.No character is bigger than the movie and that's where Anurag Basu shines through. His craft ensures that the audience grasps the sheer irony of life which is expressed through performances yes, but also through depiction of sheer poverty, helplessness, losses and survival. No where in the movie do you realize that the movie is tethering you towards it's own conclusions. You don't realize that it's speaking to your subconscious mind and bringing to you beauty lost with images,sights,sounds,speech,experiences, which you take for granted may be a million times in a day. As the story unfolds, you indulge in a lost world of expressions and fearlessness and start to appreciate the many joys you choose to ignore on an everyday basis.\n\nI know I could find one tiny loose-end in one of the scenes but the movie is so hauntingly beautiful that it'd be a crime to even linger on \"finding flaws\". I do not think Barfi! could be outclassed in a few years to come. It stands chest-to-chest with some of the cinematic giants from the 80's and before, It is from the league of Aamir Khan and all those who'd be compared with Barfi! would deem it the highest privilege.\n\nPlease watch it."

Pity that the starting song was not included in the music release.Barfi, from the very beginning, has every mark of a film well made. A rare combination of art and entertainment sans skin show item songs and cheap laughter, Anurag Basus Barfi takes Hindi cinema miles ahead from where it stands. Thankfully, Barfi is not just about acting. Director Basu provides us with one of the most flawless portrayals of handicaps. He makes the film work without a voice over or a sign language (a device Black used to beautiful effect). His story telling radiates the warmth and glow of a life well lived. Going away from the norm of commercial cinema, life in Barfi is not all hunky dory- the sad parts are not miraculously glossed over- and a message of hope is put across even in the bleakest of moments. Reminiscent of greats of the silent era like Buster Keaton, Basu infuses his narrative with surreal images- be it the three musicians transitioning the to and fro in time, or the boisterous rural drama scene- Basu seamlessly blends the magical with the real. Ultimate direction from Anurag Basu. Wonderful acting by Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra. Ileana D'Cruz looked wonderful :). Movie binds you from starting to the ending. In end you wish that the movie should continue. Oscar nomination for Barfi! is like icing on cake."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Picture shuru, huyi picture shuru\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085' Even before the film started, 'Barfi!' gave a reason to smile. In the divine settings of Darjeeling, in its narrow streets and alleyways, the ubiquitous rail lines circuiting all over the beautiful hill station and in the hearts of the simple minded residents (lucky them!), this movie had a feel good quality that leaves our heart warm and mellow. Plus, I must say, what use is a beauty if not properly captured on a photographic film? Great job done by the cinematographers!! But hadn't it been due to the stellar performances of Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, this movie, inspite of the picturesque settings, might have been bland and lackluster. A poignant portrayal of an autistic girl by Priyanka Chopra, I must say kudos to her acting acumen because no other actress worthy of her salt might have succeeded in doing what she had achieved. Ranbir (\"Barfi!\") Kapoor a.k.a. Raj Kapoor, a.k.a. Mr. Bean, achieves through his silence what the gun toting, expletive spewing and loudly guffawing protagonists (be it Salman Kan or Akshay Kumar) of Southern Replicas could not achieve - merit in their performance. Even the newbie Ileana D' Cruz fits in the shoes of Shruti Sengupta quite naturally. She is here to stay in Bollywood. But everything hinges on the shoulders of the puppeteer to see through the successful execution of the act, and to use the banal phrase, Anurag Basu (Director/Writer) is a dab hand at it! Revolving around three different timelines, Anurag Basu has succeeded in making this story seamless, which if not handled properly might have seen troubles sprouting out from every nook and cranny. Well, I won't reveal the storyline. I even hope that you won't open Wikipedia to check out the story. Because as Alfred Hitchcock said, \"There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\" Of course, he meant it for spine chillers, but the message remains validated. Though slowing down a wee bit in the second half, this movie is indeed a success, as according to me it has succeeded what it has endeavored to portray, that 'Love is unadulterated, 100% pure.'"

The story keeps to guessing on what going to happen next - there are plenty of twist and turns to keep you entertained till the end.\n\nThe characters played by Ranbir, Priyanka, Ileana and the Muskaan's caretaker Haradhan Bannerjee are full of life and will move you with their innocence.\n\nParts of the screenplay takes inspiration from classics like Singing in the rain and Charlie Chaplin. Some of the comic scenes are so unpredictable that you will be in for a pleasant surprise! Years from now we are gonna look back and say that Barfi! was a real MASTERPIECE of our generation. Wish they made more movies like this!"

One of the few young stars who do not rely on his muscles but sheer acting to keep us entertained throughout the movie. His acting keeps us laughing and also picks our emotional chord in some scenes. * Priyanka too acts really well, with her expressions and her body language conveys a thousand words when shown as a person with autism.

As Priyanka and Ranbir will take away all the credits, she will not be mentioned that much. But she was also mesmerizing. Anurag Basu, the director, showd some guts to draw his dream picture and let it not go away to be a lush bollywoody flick. Kudos to him.

Its not good because the director includes too many random funny scenes which don't really advance the story. And its certainly not good when the few good scenes are actually copied(please don't even try to argue by saying \"inspired\") from several films.\n\nIts good because of the acting and an actual plot. Whatever \"plot\" was there it was so weak and felt like Anuruag just added it as an extra. I thought this movie would be emotional and about how handicapped people are treated and their struggles. Initially it felt like a comedy,then an adventure story, then a love story and towards the end a mystery. At times I even wondered if this film was aimed at children. I believe the director himself had no clear idea what his film was supposed to be about. Now to the acting. Illeana and Ranbir were great.Priyanka's acting however seemed as if she was trying too hard and was not very comfortable in her role. Her constant blinking and eye twitching were just annoying,and it did not seem at all natural.\n\nI never felt emotional at any of the scenes nor connected with any of the characters. The movie as a whole was extremely boring and annoying. Forget about saving your money on movie tickets, don't even watch it on DVD or online for free."

How he grows, how and why he commits a crime, gets out of it and finally falls in love.\n\nBarfi was chosen entry for Oscars in the year 2013 from India. The decision to send Barfi to Oscar was not welcomed by many. It came to notice that people who liked movie also criticized it for the only reason that some scenes were copied from other Hollywood movies. In my opinion this was wrong. As mentioned the decision to send Barfi to Oscars was wrong, but the negativity which came along was too much wrong. I myself totally support the idea of getting inspired and providing audience with something fresh, and by Fresh I mean fresh to particular audience is also fine. I personally enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it.\n\nRating: 9.0/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi! is a beautiful film and will take viewers on a certain roller-coaster of emotion: it's a story of true love, yet with bittersweet heartrending moments, interspersed with almost ridiculously simple gags that nevertheless don't ever quite feel too out of place, so plenty of genuine laugh-out-loud moments.\n\nThe three lead actors are fantastic, Ranbir Kapoor in the title role, playing a deaf- mute, gets you right onside from the start, and the beautiful Ileana D'Cruz proves she is more than just eye candy, as she authentically expresses every emotion perfectly. Priyanka Chopra has you truly believe in her autistic character Jhilmil, yet plays her so well that despite her spoken dialog being little more than Barfi's, the viewer is never in doubt as to what she's thinking.\n\nThe film is wonderfully directed too; the viewer feels the mood, and gets the sense of scene without intruding. Barfi! (both movie and character) starts off a bit \"Charlie Chaplin\" - undoubtedly deliberately - but the pace changes to suit the act. The soundtrack is yet another element that was selected and executed perfectly; with some lighthearted inclusion of the three-piece band frequently popping up in the picture.\n\nIn all, a charming film and though I probably have neglected Bollywood romcoms in the past, I won't be likely to overlook them in the future! I'm just so glad I took a gamble and watched it."

        "review_detailed_main": "It speaks though its silent. Barfi is effortless , it flows smoothly from overture to crescendo. The comedy is so subtle and full of sweet subterfuges. Its an epitome of innocence. I will not reveal anything about the plot but the plot is superb with very miniature flaws that I would not like to notice in the purview of such momentous acting, editing, background scores and mellifluous songs. The narration in the movie is intriguing and funny as well in a sense that keeps the viewer hooked. Songs are well in place, situational comedy is more than appropriate , nothing seems imposed , every scene seems to have taken its own natural course. The movie is set in Darjeeling way back 1970. Ranbir has exuded his panache with excellent acting. Priyanka actually has evolved with this movie and she is all set to move to next level. The screenplay of the movie is amazing, the events are well woven , the movie flip-flops between past and present and the narration makes it very clear, there is no place where events confuse the viewer. Well as a final verdict I would say that I felt cathartic after watching the movie , I expunged all maturity and I found solace in craziness, the movie exposed me to simplicity of life and helped me to appreciate who I am. Must Watch."

While Shruti is shown as mature character who comes all the way from Calcutta to the snow town and finds her escape in Barfi's unusual yet boo boo tricks. And Jhilmil, my favorite character is played very well by Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Jhilmil is an autistic girl residing in cottage like hostel Muskaan and his Bengali father wants her to be with him in order to con out money from his family through her. Arijit Singh has played a tuneful song Phir Le Aya Dil in which three of the characters has been shown together enjoying their life. Happily. A perfect song of successful love triangle. Overall good film. Barfi is a milk sweet but Barfi with exclamation mark is a whole new experience, sweeter than the uncoded Barfi ;)."

The music is still roaming around in my playlist. There should be scientific research on the tune of \"Sawali Si Raat\". It really can heal your depression and anxiety.\n\nPriyanka, Ranbir, Saurav Shukla, Ashish Vidyarthi, Haradhan Bandopadhyay, Roopa Ganguly, Jishu Sengupta every of them are gem.\n\nI still remember when I first saw this movie, I was going through an emotional roller coaster ride.

This one was a real simple and enjoyable movie with additional emotional scenes and engaging story. Apart from some actors and actresses, main roles are performed beyond good! I really amazed by the acting of priyanka chopra, she killed it! I give 8/10 to this movie and it is worth to watch it more than one time."

But the camera angle makes it look like Ranbir Kapoor is sticking out his penis just before Priyanka grabs it. In another scene a fat guy is gesturing to Ranbir Kapoor to go for his lower body part. Ranbir Kapoor obliges and reaches out for the fat guys lower body only to pick up a newspaper. Enough said, this is garbage."

The story is simple and sweet, but the pacing can get glitchy at times. Barfi keeps you guessing when the climax will hit, and what it actually is. This feature maybe exciting for some but can get tiring for many. However, this flaw is negligible, since the final ending is heartwarming. A must watch for Bollywood lovers."

The outstanding acting by all the actors, especially Ranbir Kapoor, brings the characters to life in an unforgettable way. The tears that flow in the ending moments speak volumes about the emotional depth of the film. Pritam's outstanding music adds an enchanting layer to the narrative, further enhancing the movie's impact. Director Anurag Basu has truly crafted a work of art that keeps you in a mood-filled zone long after the credits roll. \"Barfi\" is a must-watch that leaves you in awe of its brilliance. One of the greatest movie in indian cinema till I saw."

I also wanna know what camera you used to record this movie , you can record much better with cell phone cameras these days. next time you wanna make a movie , spend money on it. and please don't rate your own movie 9 from 10 , let people do that for you! 2. OK, I read the existing reviews of this movie, and thought what the hell, I'll give it a try. That was a BIG mistake as this film is truly terrible. Bad direction, camera work, lighting, sound, acting and script. Sometimes you really have to wonder how these things get made when there are so many talented people trying to make it in the industry. This movie is an insult to from start to finish, and you have to question whether some of the other reviewers are involved with the movie in some way. Don't get me wrong, I love a low budget movie as much as the next guy, but it has to be good and this definitely is not. With so many other movies out there I'd give this a wide berth.\n\nOh and please don't rate your own movie 9 from 10 , let people do that for you!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Barfi seems to have taken a page out of the copycat handbook, with a plot that feels like a mishmash of Hollywood classics and a soundtrack that's a blatant rip-off from a French film. Directed by Anurag Basu, this Bollywood flick might have charmed audiences with its picturesque setting and endearing characters, but scratch beneath the surface, and you'll find a lackluster attempt at storytelling and musical creativity.\n\nThe plot follows the misadventures of a mute and deaf protagonist named Barfi, whose antics seem eerily reminiscent of characters from Hollywood hits like Cops, The Adventurer, and Benny & Joon. It's like watching a watered-down version of slapstick comedy with none of the originality or charm. Even the romantic subplot feels like a poor imitation of The Notebook, minus the emotional depth and chemistry between the leads.\n\nThe music in Barfi feels like a lazy cut-and-paste job, with music director Pritam shamelessly lifting background scores from Am\u00e9lie. It's like listening to a cover band butcher your favorite song - sure, the melody might sound familiar, but there's none of the soul or creativity that made the original so enchanting.\n\nIn the end, it feels less like a heartfelt tribute to classic cinema and more like a half-hearted attempt at recreating the magic of classic films. It's a shameless copycat that fails to capture the essence of the films it tries so desperately to emulate, leaving audiences with a sense of disappointment and a nagging feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu."
