        "review_detailed_main": "The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.\n\nMovie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.\n\nI still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - \"Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.\""

The realisation here is chilling.\n\nThe film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.\n\nWhat has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.\n\nThe Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.\n\nNo wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.\n\nIt's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.\n\nA jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.\n\n10/10."

I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.\n\nScores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.\n\nCinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that.

When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me.

Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save \"his\" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.\n\nThis is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."

        "review_title": "Schindler's List, or How I Learned to Stop Profiteering and Love the Jews",
        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being \"deeply moved\" or \"touched.\"\n\nUltimately, the film is a shallow failure.\n\nA good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?\n\nAnd what about Amon G\u00f6th, the representative Nazi? A \"grotesque caricature\" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why G\u00f6th hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.\n\nThe attempt to add depth to G\u00f6th's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?\n\nThis shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's \"banality of evil\". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?\n\nNeedless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.\n\nAnother peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.\n\nOne of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.\n\nWhen Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out \"I could have saved one more\", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.\n\nWhat does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:\n\n* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.\n\nBrilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.\n\nAll of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...\n\nLike most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.\n\nStick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth."

Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.\n\nThe film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.\n\nYes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.\n\nEveryone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."

The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.\n\nSpielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!\n\nThis film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...\n\nI know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, \"Schindler's List\" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, \"Never Again\", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved \"one more\" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by \"It's A Wonderful Life\", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for us or at our disposal."

        "review_title": "The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism.\n\nThe main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) \"Holocaust is bad, we already knew it\" (and this is an almost exact quote);\n\n1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.\n\n2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch \"A Christmas Carol\". As for \"bad Nazis\", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the \"superior\" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of \"Novecento\", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called \"Onore e Lealt\u00e0\", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying \"good\" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth.\n\n3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films.\n\n4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it \"blood money\". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.\n\n5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary.\n\nConclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that."

He had an accountant who was Jewish but Oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. Schindler is unlike the other Germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.\n\nBefore the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of \"following orders\" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.\n\nSpielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement."

The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music).

Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.\n\nThe film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.\n\nIt doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work."

Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both. In neither case does he succeed. One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!"

After that I made it a point to see some of his other films. A friend had told me about the filming of the shower scene and how hard it was to do it. I imagine the train scene was also very difficult as actors as well as all the crew behind the camera. I wish for this film to be shown in high schools because I never knew of this movement in WWII.

        "review_title": "Schindler's List\" Review = Perfection.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Perfection.\n\nThere are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. In fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. Sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as \"Titanic\" and \"LOTR\" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. These are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. Finally, there are films such as \"Schindler's List.\" Films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. \"Schindler's List\" is, indeed, an icon of American cinema.\n\nSteven Spielberg's 1993 story of Oskar Schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the Nazi Holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and I dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. It is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. Only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it.\n\nThere are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. They are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. \"Schindler's List\" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one.\n\nVirtually every aspect of \"Schindler's List\" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. It would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection.\n\nAs Oskar Schindler, Liam Neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. Neeson offers a Schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. What makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...So often, in these humanity films we get a \"superhero\" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into Mr. Wonderful. Schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. It's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical \"tour de force.\"\n\nWhile Neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including Ben Kingsley as accountant Itzhak Stern, a man who works with Schindler yet remains wary of him and the Nazi's. Ralph Fiennes offers, perhaps, the \"tour de force\" performance as Amon Goeth, a sadistic Nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to Schindler.\n\nThe list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. The score of John Williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness.\n\nThe film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design.\n\nYet, in many ways, watching \"Schindler's List\" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. This film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...It is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. Yes, it truly is that grand.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. It is, in my opinion, Spielberg's finest work and one I doubt he will ever top. \"Schindler's List\" is more than a film...it is a life experience of such depth and beauty and greatness that I think it almost calls out for an 11th Commandment...Thou Shalt See \"Schindler's List.\""

I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen. It ties with Saving Private Ryan as Steven Spielberg's best work. It is also one of the best movies from 1990's. It is a great movie."

It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centered around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again.\n\nHave fun with the movie alex_der_bert"

        "review_title": "Can we criticize this movie now?",
        "review_detailed_main": "I mean, has enough time passed? Or has the release of *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?\n\nSpielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama. I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie. Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable. Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject: Francesco Rosi's *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras' *Amen\". Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama. (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.) For that matter, Polanski's *The Pianist* gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with: a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who, despite all the war-profiteering (read: \"initiative\"), turns out to have a heart of gold. Or marshmallow mush. Please don't bother pointing out that this is a \"true story\": those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for \"dramatic license\". The biggest example of this is the \"villain\" of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance). The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning: he's crazy as a loon. So much for the \"banality of evil\": instead, we get, via Fiennes' Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity. Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite \"Hath not a Jew eyes\" speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes. Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard \"Lifetime Channel\" movie about an abusive husband.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time: even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in *Schindler's List* are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving \"Schindler Jews\" appear (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them. They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave. Moving stuff. Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention. And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question: this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed. The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz: it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.\n\nBut, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre. It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders: \"Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today.\" Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance? You decide."

Every decision from the black and white to the stones hits hard and hits well. Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.\n\nActing: 9/10\n\nLiam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time. The rest of the cast offers more nuanced performances that really provide the viewer with a subdued approach to such horrors, allowing the audience to feel disconnected from the tragedy, yet thrust into its dark world.\n\nCinematography: 10/10\n\nRed, red, red. Visually perfect.\n\nEditing 10/10\n\nEditing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\nWilliams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.\n\nVisual Effects: 8/10\n\nThe shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.\n\nWriting: 8/10\n\nThe writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.\n\nProduction Design 9/10\n\nSuperb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.\n\nCostume Design 9/10\n\nAuthentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.\n\nMake-up/Hairstyle 9/10\n\nSeveral hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white."

To all those who had the luck of watching this masterpiece before - DON'T WAIT. GO and BUY a CD or a DVD whatever you get your hands on and enjoy this movie for your lifetime. 2. To those who haven't yet watched IT - DON'T WAIT, GO and RENT IT / watch IT in a theatre on the very first chance you get. And now PLEASE don't complaint of not having enough money to buy or even rent it. SELL YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE. Needless to say, I rate this masterpiece a 10 out of 10."

I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. \"Schindler's List\" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be. Aside from all the details, the story is one of few that really got to me, and in the end that is why I must say it is the greatest movie of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Steven Spielberg is a known director. Most of his works focus on adventures, genre movies, be it with children, explorers or Extra- Terrestrial beings. So, when Spielberg decides to focus on historical dramas, usually based on true events, we can see the full array of his abilities and capacities.\n\nSchindler's List is a movie that occurs during the holocaust, and this time period serves as background for characters study. Spielberg was smart enough to realize that such a theme could not be tackled head on. Instead, the focus is on the humans of the time. Why they did what they did, how could they and, specially, how they endured it.\n\nThe narrative focus on the actions of \"entrepreneur\" Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). How he dealt with the holocaust and how he was touched by the Jews situation after seeing their torment and suffering. He had to take care to not have such a feeling be discovered by any of his many Nazi friends, such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).\n\nBeing a Jew himself, Spielberg finds the fine line between homage to those who died and survived without falling in any melodrama. Spielberg is, above all, a director. And a director has only one obligation: to make a good film. Even though directors are human beings, Spielberg is professional enough to know how much he really must use of his emotion, sensibility and identification with the victims of the holocaust.\n\nIt's safe to say that this is one of the best Spielberg films. For many, like me, his best. A historical piece with much to add in the discussion of mankind tragedies."

Yes, this is a near perfect movie.\n\nStorytelling of the movie itself constantly shuttling from deep to solid. The writing definitely gives Neeson to dig his character fastidiously. While the antagony delivers dogmatic and deleterious performance, the protagony also delivers benevolent and empathetic character. Well, i should say Spielberg seldomly made a real serious movie here, but when he did, it was terrific.\n\nInspirational, this movie keeps deliver a solid writing, tough performance, and precious cinematography.

        "review_detailed_main": "It was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and Spielberg knew it. This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.\n\nWhile Schindler and Goth battle it out miles above the Jews like New Gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the Jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. It is Itzhak Stern ( Ben Kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified Stern is a Jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the Nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to.\n\nIt is through Stern that we see the transformation in Schindler, as first Stern will not even take a drink with Schindler by the end Stern looks at Schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people.\n\nWe see the slow transformation of Schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the Polish countryside, it is here that Schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by Hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for Schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. Her life snuffed out like a candle. This is the moment when Schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting.\n\nFrom that moment on Schindler is relentless in protecting his Jews, the Schindler Jews, he overcomes every obstacle the Nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. But not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. The Nazi's were relentless in their thirst for Jewish blood and Schindler had to be just as relentless.\n\nA masterpiece and a historical look at Mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the Nazis thought their Reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. Thankfully there were men like Schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.\n\nLiam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.\n\nSchindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.\n\nThe film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.\n\nSchindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon G\u00f6th (Fiennes), G\u00f6th additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, G\u00f6th is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. G\u00f6th arrives on the scene, a Krak\u00f3w suburb called P\u0142asz\u00f3w, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work \u2013 construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, G\u00f6th himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as G\u00f6th is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational \"tonight is history\" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out."

And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.\n\nWhat possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.\n\nOnly someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime."

This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.\n\nThe cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope.\n\nThe atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, \"Schindler's List\" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer."

Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making.\n\nEven if you are among the more \"experienced\" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.\n\nSchindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events.\n\nSteven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was \"mature\" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust.\n\nEarlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.)\n\nSchindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars.\n\nI'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.\n\nSteven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)\n\n9.4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by IMDb comments: either they label it \"masterpiece\" or \"a sappy, manipulative banalization of the Holocaust\". Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.\n\nUnfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? And then \"La Amistad\", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).\n\nAnd then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. In Schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. \"What can we do\" \"If I were you, I wouldn't go East. They don't like you there. Neither I would go west\". Next scene: we see all the survivors in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS. In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT dumb?"

I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone faces for their respective parts.\n\nThe film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated all the same. Because... such an immoderate amount of praise has been heaped upon it. True, Spielberg's story about human kindness in adversity is a sweet and all-American story. But it doesn't have much to do with the black-in-black disaster that was the Holocaust."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.\"\n\n'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.'\n\nSteven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.\n\nThe acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.\n\nThe Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!\n\nSchindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema."

What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art.

Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people.

After seeing it, I am convinced of the fact that he was really so. The fact that 6 million Jews were massacred during the world war-2 just because they were Jews is a shame on the entire humanity.\n\nThe movie gives an account of the polish Jews during the Second World War and how the protagonist, Oscar Schindler saves 1200 Jews from being gassed. The cinematography is simply brilliant. It gives a sense of timelessness to the movie. Also, not to forget some wonderful performances. All factors make the movie very realistic.

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List\n\nWhen we think of the holocaust we think of Hitler, Jews, and for some, Oskar Schindler. Steven Spielberg took an absolute horror and showed us how there was still good in man. The movie is an excellent tear jerker and at some times send shivers down your back due to the gruesome inhumanity that was shone. The movie was fantastically crafted to show us the horrors of the holocaust and really toy with our emotions.\n\nFor instance, Spielberg's use of color during a black and white film was fantastic and brilliantly thought out. For example, the scene of the of the little girl with the red coat was so incredibly sad and shows us how utterly atrocious it really was that they would have killed a little girl as such. Spielberg had such a way with making the viewer feel a certain way in the film with his use of all special effects, it was fantastic! When it comes to the acting side of the film I have nothing bad to say what so ever. Liam Neeson, usually portrayed as a killer in his other films, found his soft side and acted as Schindler brilliantly. His voice change and overall talent throughout the film made it such a better film. Not to mention all of the supporting roles such as Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) who was an S.S. soldier and how ruthless and emotionless he had to be in some scenes when he killed in order to really get Spielberg's point across. After this film was released in 1993 the world not only remembers how many lives were lost, but how Oskar Schindler risked everything to save twelve hundred Jews and his only regret was that he couldn't save more. \"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.\" (Oskar Schindler)"

Despite this formulaic style, Neeson is very good playing Oskar Schindler, a decadent member of the Nazi party who nevertheless was a reluctant savior to some 1,100 Jews during WWII when he employed them in his factory, saving them from certain death in Hitler's concentration camps. Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film, and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi commandant. Some of the human terror depicted is frighteningly real, and even though the last act smacks of Hollywood grand-standing, the movie has unlimited power. Winner of seven Oscars in all, including Best Picture. *** from ****"

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.\n\nThe film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.\n\nThis film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an \"A+\" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10..."

Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List.\n\nI'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.\n\nAs with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.\n\nI've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.\n\nActing was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.\n\nHaving seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed."

        "review_title": "Arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film ever.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rocked\u0085), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThe story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.\n\nAs he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. The time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film.\n\nSpielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people \u0096 the descendents of those that he saved during the war \u0096 walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting.\n\nWith Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List, the Best Picture of the year, as well as Jurassic Park, which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Hook, the Indiana Jones films, and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as Amistad, Saving Private Ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, Schindler's List."

I couldn't think of anyone better than than Liam Neeson to play this role.\n\nRalph Fiennes.. wow. He FREAKED me out in this movie as a SS officer/commander. He playes the part extremely well - I couldn't recognize his voice here. He really captured the personality of his role. Wow.\n\n.. I mean wow.\n\nI wasn't surprised when I saw that Steven Spielberg directed this. And I'm not surprised that Schindlers List won 7 Oscars (deserved more!)

I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.\n\nThe cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change."

What a copout! Jews in this film are only shown as rambling ethnicities in tableau shots.\n\nSpeilberg would rather take a German Gentile, ficitonalize his story (that speech he gives at the end as Schindler is about to leave and Stein gives him the ring was made up, it is historically incorrect and totally made up) and make a movie about the Holocaust from that point of view. My grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivior, walked out in tears from the theatre claiming his film was all lies.\n\nSpielberg makes lovely shots, just beautifully photographed, of violence. This is suppose to make us feel the pain, to feel the irony and all it really does is fetishize violence. We don't learn anything about the jews in this film so it doesn't even hurt that much.\n\nHistorically incorrect, Speilberg has the nerve to send the Jews to Auschwitz until Schindler can fix the mistake. UM excuse me by the time Schindler had a list, Auschwitz was practically empty and was no longer gassing bodies. If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the surviovors. Don't watch Schindlers List because all you will get is a redemption story, designed to make us feel as if we too, like Schindler, would save the Jews. It's embarrassing and inaccurate. How dare Spielberg bastardize the pain my heritage, my family, and other Jewish families went through, make it historically inaccurate and then give it to schools around the country? Yep, thats cool."

I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan."

Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)? Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)? What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself. I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before. Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long. The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better."

I find the subject of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in. Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in the movie came across as wooden figures to me.\n\nNow comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.\n\nI can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part."

The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander. Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever. Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made."

Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.\n\nIn German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.\n\nSteven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: \"I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.\"\n\nLiam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.\n\nThe decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.\n\nJohn Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.\n\nVerdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.\n\nSchindler's List \u2013 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (8/10)"

The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.\n\nThis film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an \"A+\" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10..."

It is completely set in Black & White, except for the Red Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time period it was portrayed in.\n\nThe Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra seemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles, especially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon Goeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with it. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the best thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people throughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.\n\nIt's a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent Film!"

It stirs up numerous emotions inside me when ever I see it. Spielberg- being a jew himself- has in a remarkable way, managed to re-tell the story of the destiny of the WWII jews. One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.\n\nSchindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors, Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today. No one can disagree there I think. Make sure you all see this one soon, I promise you a movie so strong, you'll remember it for a long time to come."

Unfortunately, his undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Schindler's List, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. It will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. It will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life.\n\nThe movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits Krakow Jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. He keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous S.S. officer Amon Goeth with the help of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.\n\nShot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect: When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.\n\nHeadlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress \"I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word\" and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.\n\nMarked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics."

        "review_detailed_main": "World War II is raging. Sleazy socialite and entrepreneur Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrive in Poland and create his own kitchen equipment fabric with an army contract. His competitive plan? Use Jews from the ghetto: they cost less than Poles or Germans. What begins as a profitable business venture will soon suck Schindler into a dark world of madness and genocide, as he discovers not only his true nature, but also, to his horror, the full implications of the nature of his government.\n\nSpielberg had amused and thrilled crowds with a long line of blockbusters before this (few human beings with eyes don't know of E.T., Jaws or Indiana Jones), and had mostly disappointed when trying his hand at more serious material: Color Purple was fair, and Empire of the Sun felt oddly shallow. Being as they weren't really his stories to tell in any case, these films can be excused as mere experiments to prepare Spielberg for this tale which he had held close to his heart for a long time.\n\nWhat amazes about the story is that, in typical Spielberg fashion, it wastes no time. Each scene has a point, a place, and is maximized, and given the film's length and the nature of its story, the result is positively harrowing. Schindler grows considerably throughout the ordeal: the first cynical and opportunistic businessman starts playing a dangerous psychological game with the commanding Nazi officers, namely Amon Goethe (Fiennes). Seldom has human evil found such a frighteningly real incarnation than Fiennes's horrific officer, whose unpredictable fits of depression or violence keep the viewer constantly unbalanced. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish book-keeper then confidant gives the film a beautiful heart, and the overall acting is universally excellent. Spielberg never lets his actors down, but Steven Zaillian's screenplay truly is a miracle of character development.\n\nShot in staggering Black and White, Schindler's List feels like re-living History. it is brutal, intense and heart-wrenching. Spielberg has returned to oppression and war since (in Amistad and Saving Private Ryan) but has never topped this, nor ave most great films in existence.\n\nFor one of those rare times, a film is worthy of all the huge praise and hype surrounding it... and then some."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Gawd bless you mister Schindler\", is one of the few phrases not to appear in Schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a Frank Capra film. Well, to be fair, the phrase \"Shoot her now, on my authority\" isn't in It's a Wonderful Life either.\n\nSchindler's List - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand Jews from Krakow Ghetto during WWII - is one of the Sacred Cows of modern cinema. This is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of Stephen - ooh what a long film I'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - Spielberg.\n\nSchindler's List is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. Kingsley reprises his role as Gandhi and Fiennes and Neeson look fab in black and white. There is also nice mutual tension and understanding between Schindler and Goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable.\n\nHaving said all that, the film can be really infuriating.\n\nWhy, for instance, does Spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? Does the film really need this kind of \"legitimacy\" for audiences to take it seriously?\n\nAnd where are the Jewish characters? I can almost hear Spielberg with his screenwriters... \"Woody, hi, I'd like you to do Schindler and Goeth\". \"Ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! But what about the Jews huh - I think I could do really good job with some of the Jewish Characters\" Woody Allen replies. \"Yeah, hear what you say Woody, but I've promised that to my old buddy George Lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the Yellow Peril, or the Phantom Menace or something\". One review of Schindler's List describes Stern as \"Schindler's conscience\" and that's just about it. Spielberg has outsourced his casting for Jewish characters to Jimny Cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity.\n\nIn fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see Spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. You get the sophisticated monster clich\u00e9, with the Stormtrooper playing Mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto. You get the violent guard cooing over a Jewish baby \"Ein kind, ein kind!\" You get the Goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. And, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where Schindler makes his final transition to Avatar of the Almighty.\n\nThen there's the death. Young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - I wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. But, you know, I struggle to remember any adult Jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. Did these deaths not count? David Irving would be delighted.\n\nHowever the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in European history. It deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. Tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, Spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us ET and Close Encounters. Surely the point about Schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. The danger of this film is that the MTV generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction \u0096 there'll always be a saint like Oscar Schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10."

This film is dark. This film's hero starts as a shallow man intent on making money and not caring about how it happened. He is changed into something great and worthy by how he behaves when he becomes aware of the reality of circumstances around him.\n\nIts gritty. It should be compulsory viewing. It's a wonderful film. But it really not going to cheer most people up."

He did a really good job with casting too,I think the people he chose were perfect for the parts.It's a very touching story, it defiantly touched my heart. I'm not the type of person to watch these kind of films but I got told so much that it was such a good film I watched it and I do not regret it. in the future I will watch more of his films for sure. Not only was it a really sad (and true) story it had a bit of mystery - For example through the whole thing I kept wondering who the girl in the red coat was, that's also what kept me watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Few Films on this planet can meet the feeling you get from watching this film. An amazing amount of emotions run through your veins and its through this emotions we are manipulated into seeing through the eyes of Steven Spielberg's amazing vision. After seeing this film for first time I cannot tell you the amount respect I felt for Jews and my fellow person. This film makes you realise who you are and what we need to become to put our petty differences aside. Liam Neeson is magnificent, his portrayal of his character is perfect and he shows a softness and a love for people throughout the film and Liam Neeson portrays this perfectly, his character is a womaniser yet he is very aware of his faults and to the viewer its remarkable how much you can understand from him. Through the actors Steven Spielberg brings this epic to life. Ralph Fiennes one of Britain's amazing exports shows how a character can be consumed with hate and be able to survive with the things he has done. The acting in this film is creative and very very believable. Ralph represents the element of fear. As his character develops and matures we see that his character can change yet he doesn't want to. here is a amazing amount of subliminal messages which are put in this film and the viewer can identify with this everytime. Ben Kingsley is absolutely perfectly cast as he plays his role with an amazing amount of power and strength eventhough his role is supposed a very fragile person. he portrays this person perfectly, but allows the viewer to see the hope and the hate in others. This is how Spielberg not only has made the perfect film but he manipulates our fears and our truths and shows we can change, he does this in amazing fashion. 3 hours plus this film is short and its short because you cannot feel it, if you are prepared to give this film the chance it deserves. Its beautifully set and the black and white colour of the film portrays a meaning that only a viewer can interpret, Ill leave that to you."

Especially Ben Kingsley's act of Stern is fantastic.\n\nBut is not a movie that you can watch, relax and forget it. You have to think about it for a long time and it can you make very sad. But otherwise shows you the film that there is always a small hope. So it's an optimistic film as well."

I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg.

Watching it in a theatre for the for first time, the audience was completely silent as the credits rolled at the end with only a few leaving.

My father who was older than my mother, grew up, in part, in a Japanese prison camp and was stamped (he went away when I was 10). So while you'd think I'd know more about my heritage and all my family killed in Poland by the Germans, I do not. I only heard bits and pieces. So when I saw it come together in a way that only Stephen Spielberg can do, it hit me--hard. My family endured this and only a few survived. I believe regardless of heritage, that everyone should see this film to know what could happen in the future-again. The fact is, it is happening today in North Korea where daily acts of unspeakable cruelty happen. It's a must see film for the acting, the authenticity and the truth. NEVER FORGET!"

I must admit that I don't always pay attention to these details, but what was done in Schindler's List, captures your attention and is hard to ignore any detail. The performances are also pretty amazing, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler is perfectly interpreted. Every expression builds a man, who starts as an ambitious business owner, and eventually, turns into a compassionate man. Yet, my favorite performance was Ralph Fiennes as the cruel Nazi officer, Amon Goeth; twisted, cruel and believable. He creates a perfect villain. Great movie, shocking and heart-shifting."

The fact that the film had the ability to share a message was fantastic. Yet it was also able to provide a different perspective to the war. The cinematics in the film was extraordinary.

Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling. John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the depths and heights to which we all can reach."

That would be Ben Kingsley....ok, I guess that's it.\n\nFirst of all, there's the obvious fact that Spielberg was gunning for the Oscar on this one. He picked an issue that was popular in the politically correct world of Oscar voters, one that nobody can remedy or do anything about but they all like to discuss to show how much they care, and ran with it. The full weight of the concentration camp massacres can only really be seen in that French documentary (the name eludes me.) And if you want to get a feel for life in Nazi Germany, you might as well watch the propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will,\" giving the viewer a chilling glimpse at the culture of national socialism.\n\nSpielberg's attempts to be \"artsie\" are incredibly phony, particularly the \"red dress girl\"'s presence in a B&W film. An Liam Neeson simply does not pull off his part. At the film's end, you REALLY want to sympathize with Schindler when he laments that he could have saved \"one more,\" but Neeson's performance in that critical scene is unconvincing. He plays the cold and reserved parts of Schindler's character so strongly that the character development leading to that emotional climax is lost.\n\nPeople rate this film highly because they feel that they're supposed to. Don't take their word. The film (with Kingsley as the exception) is poorly acted, drawn out, and pretentious. If you've been fortunate enough to miss this film so far, keep up the good work."

Schindler is entrepreneur, capitalist and a good negotiator, he has good relationships with military, and military enjoy your source of guns and material to support the war. A well established relation, Schindler keep low cost using prisoner as cheap labor to his factors, a smart but not decent idea.\n\nAlthough his well wealthy business, Schindler decide he can change the world. This is the main point of the movie, and how he star to achieve a bigger goal instead the quarterly balance sheet profits. Schindler decide all system is not correctly, and he understand a change is need.\n\nThe lesson in this film is the status quo isn't a law, it can be changed by the humans. When oppression is the law, kill is normal, when human are properties have a act to change all it is the right decision. Schindler is what all we need in the moderns day, a break point in the society, a hero doing the obvious, a man whit heart and ambition to change the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "(please ignore my previous comment as it contained some errors)\n\nLet me begin by saying that the thousands of you out there who worship \"Saving Private Ryan\" should think twice about labeling it 'the best Spielberg film of all time'.\n\nSchindler's list is by definition a masterpiece and in my opinion Spielberg's finest work to date. Unlike SPR, it focuses on true events and not only uses true locations and dates. SPR has a group of men risking their own life to save one whereas SL has one man trying to \"save the world entire\". Which one is far fetched though? Both, you would say unless you are historically inclined and know that Oscar Schindler(Neeson) did in fact exist and save more than 1100 people during the holocaust. Miller and his team, although loosely based on true characters do not depict an accurate incident in the chapter of world war 2.Thus we find Schindler's List more gratifying to watch as a film but also absorb as a historical guide.\n\nThe acting mind you, is exceptional in both cases and hadn't there been charming old Bennigni hopping and bouncing on the chairs of the Academy - Hanks would have certainly taken Oscar (forgive the pun) home to meet his other two brothers.\n\nSchindler's list is deeply moving, and in every scene you get the feeling that you are there living in that misery and thanking your lucky stars that you have pulled through another day. What is most disturbing (and equally ingenious of Spielberg) is the way the Jews are killed. Sometimes they are lined up and shot at to save bullets, other times they are wounded and then shot in the head to make up for the 'mistake' (the scene where the woman dies in the hands of her husband spraying her blood all over him after the shot, is one of the strongest in the film). But Spielberg's genius does not emerge through the portrayal of gratuitous violence. It emerges through the way he shows what HAS to be shown. At times he creates tension by NOT showing an actual death (like the scene of the boy who couldn't clean the stains out of Goeth's bath and then gets killed by his sniper rifle) or else when you think someone is going to die - and they don't (the rabbi ) such subtleties always leave us uncertain as to what is going to take place next and always leaves us on edge.\n\nThe girl is the red dress contrary to what many think, is also a stroke of genius. Spielberg includes her for two reasons :\n\n1) We are taken on a journey through which we can relate and through which we can feel what is happening around 'us'. Because she is marked her in red, we can easily follow her through the streets of the ghetto and not get lost in the violence which takes place around her.\n\n2) She becomes a symbol of lost innocence when later in the film she is seen in a pile of corpses. Had she not been in red ( a very empathic colour) we might have not recognized her, or we would not have focused on the tragedy of her murder.\n\nWhen the flames later on in the film are lit to celebrate the Sabbath (notice they to are coloured) we get the impression that hope is re-emerging and good will triumph in the end.\n\nI particularly admire the scene where a German plays Mozart on a piano to the rhythm of stuttering guns being fired around him. This not only creates a macabre atmosphere but it also shows how cold blooded some Germans where (\"is that Bach? No Mozart\").It is not surprising however that the film is praised in Germany today because most German's disassociate themselves rightly with the atrocities their ancestors committed against the six million Jews murdered.(one must notice the scene where the German soldiers decide to \"go home as men rather than murderers\", showing that not all Nazis where NAZIS, if you know what I mean.)\n\nThe portion in colour at the end then, always sends goose bumps down my back. Probably because we are seeing real people (the actors and actual characters still alive today (well 1993) like {amazingly enough} the girl Schindler kisses at his birthday party!) The very last scene then, where the road built from gravestones is panned on and \"Directed by Steven Spielberg\" appears, has me sighing and thinking \"wow\".\n\nAdd to all this a great character analysis (the typewriter's audition scene is amusing because we learn more about Schindler's character, and the scene where Fiennes says 'I forgive you' to the mirror shows us how hatable he really is) and development throughout as well as a heart pounding score by John Williams and what you've got is a film which I would surely beat myself to death for not rating it: ***** (Excellent) so I will (rate it 5 stars that is)."

Here he very wisely avoids sentimentality letting the story tell itself.\n\nThe unusual choice of black and white film helps here -- the film would not have had the same atmosphere shot in colour.\n\nThe protagonists in this story are all depicted as being thoroughly human, a fact which not only underlines the horror of the Nazi regime -- these were real people, not comic-book villains -- but also underlines the film's ultimately optimistic message. Even when humanity is acting at its most beastly, some people will find it within themselves to resist this and help others escape the worst of it. As the case of Schindler shows (he started out simply exploiting the situation for his own gain) this may sometimes spring from unexpected quarters."

But lately, we see Oskar change his mind, and secretly, saving the most people as he can.

It SHOULD be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust.\n\nThere's little plot and as much as I like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression.\n\nIt's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. Then there are incongruously lyrical monologues.\n\nIt's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding.\n\nAlso, this is in English and that's not OK. Why go to such depths to recreate a particular time and place but then ruin that illusion in such an obvious way? Doesn't the German language convey the tone so much better?\n\nDon't get your hopes up...regarding the IMDB ratings it is, for me, the most over-rated movie."

Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do more. I like when a drama still has enough suspense combined with plot, character development, that it pulls at you from several angles. This is well- thought out and remains at the top of my list today."

The attention to details has contributed to this very successful portrayal of the great pain, degradation and global disaster that took place 50 years ago. Details such as the nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that is scary. The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very well presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad.

It is a very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting, memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of the greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more than just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.\n\nMany will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about the way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful antisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know any better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber scene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called \"shower room\" would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself as a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all. To sum it off - If you didn't see this movie, go see it.\n\nBut don't stop there, find some real live accounts of holocaust survivors."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's list tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson)who is a Nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' Jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS. When Schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general Amon Goeth (Fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how Goeth and his men are treating them, Schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible.\n\nIf I was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. I also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the Holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. I also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. Finally we come to the acting and for me it was Fiennes that shone as the evil General Amon Goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. Neeson and Kingsley were great too, but for me Fiennes put on the best performance.\n\nSo having said all that, you might be wondering why I'm only rating this 7/10? Well for me, it is technically perfect, but Schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). The first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. It was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. I personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous.\n\nHaving said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. It's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. As a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments I've ever experienced when watching a film. Great film - but a tad too long in my opinion."

Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end. It's all quite tedious to watch.\n\nIt took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it. Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions. Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.\n\nLiam Neeson did give a good performance. His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes. Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character. Still, I rooted for him until the end.\n\nIf I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel. Jaws, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg touch, doing what he does best.\n\n3/10"

He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.\n\nHe has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg."

This classic film is an emotionally charged historical drama; based on true story.

I have a VHS collector's copy of the film."

The thing is every scene is interesting but is kind of like a paper you have to write for uni or school and it has a word count you can't exceed even if everything you have written is relevant some of it still needs to be cut out, and the same goes for this movie, some scenes should be cut out even though there was no one scene that stood out as unnecessary.\n\nSo 9/10, one thing I must say is that when checking actual reviews here I'm surprised it has the 8.9/10 rating since the majority has been 1/10 reviews."

I was hoping to watch a GOOD movie without any need to show women's bodies in a sexual manner. Besides that, it is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves a heartbreaking yet eye-opening movie. Please don't get angry with me for being an arrogant feminist who \"doesn't understand the moral\", because I certainly do. It just made me uncomfortable. Although not extremely gruesome, the violence is unforgettable and shocking at times. Still an excellent film."

Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one ."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a wonderful educational film for kids, I mean the youth between 12-18, to inform them about the horrors of Nazism and the Holocaust, but for adult Viewer who knows a lot about the Fascism and Concentration Camps this film will seem too straightforward and even tasteless. It is not enough to use a serious theme and a black and white film to make a good picture. And I definitely do not understand the viewers who behave as if they haven't seen any of anti-fascist films of much higher quality.\n\nIt is true -Mr. Spielberg is a great Master, Master of Manipulation and a great specialist of Exploitation Cinema. This is what exactly he does here - he exploits the Important and Painful topic of Holocaust (or it can be slavery, terrorism, etc) being perfectly aware that many would praise the film not for its artistic merits but for the STORY and the MESSAGE, and if one dares to say that the film is lousy - he/she will be immediately accused of being a revisionist, indifferent to peoples suffering, holocaust denier and almost Neo-Nazi.\n\nLet me put this straight - I am none of these and still I think that Spielberg film is not good. It is not good as a piece of art but it might be good as an awareness raising reel - for those who had no or very little idea about Nazism and holocaust, but for those of us who don't need a gaudy movie from a Hollywood hack to know basics of history - there is nothing of interest here - I can name two or three dozens of feature films of documentaries that dealt with Holocaust much better, I suspect many of admirers of this film simply have not seen any of those.\n\nUneven script and even worse direction is camouflaged with the important messages and arty shell of BW photography. What comes tomy mind is another film about Nazism - somewhere in mid 70-ies Art-Porn maker Tinto Brass (of Caligula fame) took Nazim as a background for his film Salon Kitty. He invited famous art house stars Tulin and Berger who had previously acted in very highly regarded anti-fascist film of great Lucino Visconti and made own film about fascism. The result? Despite the sets, the stars, the important issues - the film still ended up being Art-Porn - as this was the only thing Mr. Brass could do. The same is problem with Spielberg - he might be really willing to make an important picture but still ended up with what he is best at making \u0096 exploitation movie.\n\nAs to the rain of Oscars \u0096 well, didn't \"Around the world in 80 days\" once get an Oscar?"

It shows the depths to which humanity can sink without God. I recommend this movie, but with warnings. It contains penury; shows violence of nature; and the subject matter is about one of the most hideous times in recent history. However, it is all in the telling of this true story; a story that should be told. Exactly, not a film for children.\n\nThis an elegant film and an accurate description of the Holocaust. You cannot change the Holocaust around to make it a happy. The Holocaust was a sad, dark event. The scenes of violence and nudity were relevant to this film. The brilliant director, Steven Spielberg, chose to show mild scenes from the Holocaust. I have seen a lot worse things. And the reason the film didn't show any of the other groups tortured was because Oskar Schindler saved Jews, so it was probably unnecessary to show or mention the other groups. And also because the fact that Jews were the main group targeted. The penury was important, too. In the scene of the selection in the concentration camp, the penury was necessary to make an accurate definition and the sexual scenes were there to show that Schindler was a womanizer. This film is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and everyone should watch it.\n\nWhile it's a movie for mature audiences, the viewer shouldn't fast forward through any scene. They'll miss something if they do. Spielberg's best movie and one of the best films ever made. To many Holocaust films shy from the truth. That is sad, because it is one of the most important events in the 20th century. Watch this movie, watch it carefully, and see what you learn from it\u2014the nudity has a part in this film."

This man's talents in portraying a \"baddie\" are truly spectacular. Fiennes manages to show the evil inside Amon Goeth,he is a cold hearted killer who has no mercy.\n\nThe black and white filter is also a nice touch, I'm not exactly sure what it represents but it may be to represent the fact that war is pointless.\n\nLast of all I have to mention the music score. John Williams managed to create a score that fit the film perfectly. The music is sad and almost makes you want to cry. The idea to play iton a violin was smart and added to the sadness. John Williams truly deserved the Oscar and always will.\n\nSchindlers list is truly a classic,directed by the great Steven Spielberg it manages to portray the horrors of war, how one man can make a difference but most important of all it showed hope."

Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film \" Schinder's List \", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****"

All these parts inside the film made me as an audience member feel as though i was really there experiencing these tragedies. The use of black and white was very powerful and showed how dreadful these things were, the end had a very dense and intense core and I loved it, highly recommended for any fan of this genre."

The movie has been directed in an awesome way by the epic director Steven Spielberg.

Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!"

        "review_title": "Transformed by the white light",
        "review_detailed_main": "What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying \"If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?\". But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says \" Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this\". He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as \"Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it\". Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic \"bath tub stain\" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him \" No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good\". One can easily substitute the word \"heaven\" for \"haven\" and \"God\" for \"good\". In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him."

And felt as though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the Nazi's were just the jury. I also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't have to tell you that \"Schindler's List\" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with \"Jurassic Park\" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.\n\nI saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of \"Schindler's List\" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out.\n\nRarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the \"dude\" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.\n\nWeeks later, art imitated life on an episode of \"Seinfeld\" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.\n\nBack to our friend \"Howdy Doody\", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.\n\nI did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what \"Buckaroo\" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate."

        "review_detailed_main": "No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though, if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no \"other\" unnecessary characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.\n\nI do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the imprisoned actually was. Please watch documentaries on the Holocaust, research more through books and legitimate media, if you want the true facts."

That's not as much of a compliment as you might think, because the majority of them have been embarrassingly awful.\n\nStevie learned a long time ago that there is big money in mawkish sentimentality and set out to capitalize on it. There is a substantial, guaranteed segment of the cinema-going public that will accept schmaltz as art. They simply do not know the difference.\n\nSo, while I will accept that this is a good movie, there is no way it belongs in the top 250. Or even in the top 2500. There are too many historical inaccuracies, too many factual liberties, too many scenes overdone for deliberate shock value. The whole thing is fake. It is only vaguely based on what actually happened. Yet it is presented as a factual historical drama and has been widely accepted as such.\n\nThe excesses of Hitler's Germany can never be forgotten or swept under the rug, but embellishing them and making gaudy parodies of the real thing does not well serve the memory of those who suffered through it.\n\n\"The Pianist\" was not a perfect film, either, but it is a lot better than this one."

For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene."

Spielberg infused his camera-work with urgency and attention to detail and he never strays away from horrific images, and then he films them just enough so they make an impact, never over the top... This is a rare movie which genuinely made me feel sad, happy, anxious and horrified in one afternoon, I can't think of an able counterpart... Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people... It's incredible just how he pulls it off; In my opinion he made the movie, it wouldn't have worked with some other random actor.And not to say that I'm trying to justify Nazi movement, on the contrary, I'm only saying these people need to be understood and their actions put in a greater context, maybe Amon is a bad example, but a lot of those foot soldiers were just following orders. We can't just tag them as evil, as that's not enough, don't forget- they were able to seduce a complete nation, you can't do that just by playing evil, other factors come into play.It is exhausting movie to sit through, but in a good way, I would urge everyone ,as I have my complete family, to watch this milestone in cinema, such is its cultural impact... Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves... Only by including this film into mandatory school viewing can we only prevent that horrible event from happening ever again. People must understand, it's the only way to go about it..."

Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend.\n\nI gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length.\n\nFinally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses.\n\nAfter watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length.\n\nThe complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes.\n\nI was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc.\n\nAfter watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass.\n\nA movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one.\n\nSome scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind.\n\nI will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these.\n\nThis will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again.\n\nA full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect"

        "review_detailed_main": "Holocaust stories aren't watched for entertainment. They are more for documentation, more for knowledge. So it is no wonder this film clocks in at over 3 hours long, because like most holocaust stories, Schindler's List was made to be evidence to those not born in the time of that tragic and horrific event, not for a jaunty, fun watch. Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see."

His one scene with him talking about how he could do more reaches out and truly touches people, more than just the Jews hugging him in the scene.\n\nSchindler's List is the idea of a perfect Film.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a good movie indeed, one of those which make you think. The simple fact of being a Spielberg film warned me not to take it too seriously, after all he's always that dream embodier we all knew in his classics... touching little aliens, dire tough sharks, smart dinosaurs brought back to life and so on. Even here we have a stunning portrait of the evil (R.Fiennes really deserved the oscar he didn't get) but the real Amon Goeth had not a home on a hill as we can see, and he was arrested in September 44 by SS, then captured by americans and executed on Sept 46. All in this movie is clearly intended to make you feel dizzy and touched, this is of course not shifty, everyone knows this is a tear-jerker but what everyone seems to ignore is that you need some subterfuges when you aim to involve deeply someone in a story, and Spielberg knows how to do it, he knows it well, he is a master. So, here are the expected germans, shown as either monsters or homicidal robots; a bunch of events of which only the grotesque aspect is fully portrayed and most of all a movie that openly focalize only on jews, giving the impression (the same we get at school) that they are the greatest (or more important) victims of that period, think about people of the former USSR before answering \"well...isn't it?\". I said it makes you think, personally i had to think when i saw all the comments here in the IMDb about this film, seems people simply accept it without any reservation and with tears in their eyes... the power of being Steven Spielberg! And, most of all, the power of talking about Holocaust! I'm not a negationist, even though i don't accept blindly the classic version of history, and i'm definitely not a nazi-sympathizing, but i don't like hypocrisy and all forms of mass-conditioning, \"books say...\" \"Spielberg says...\" and everytime an hysterical and irrational commotion. That was a complicate period, you can't understand it reading a single book or watching a movie, anyway, everyone plays the wiseacre and gives his sentence. After all, i give a good 9/10 for film making, good acting, good directing, good soundtrack, good all; and 5/10 for pretentious politically correct intentions, a nice arithmetical 7/10 and life goes on."

        "review_detailed_main": "How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.\n\nI didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me).\n\nI saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make (including many many Israelis) is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel \"Yad Va Shem\" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. When over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.\n\nThe movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a Jew/Gypsy/Black/Homosexual/Deformed/Handicaped/Left-Handed/Communist, etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.\n\nAlthough I think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 (over The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption) it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day, and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10."

I could repeat what has already been said on this list about the brilliant acting, direction and cinematography. But you already know all that stuff. What makes the film great for me, though, is the way it shows humans at their truest, improvising and scrounging to survive. This is what life is all about: trying to stay alive no matter what the circumstances around us.\n\nThe film is amazing in its restraint and subtlety. It would have been so easy for the movie to step on a soapbox and tell us all about the negative factors that led to the Holocaust. Instead it simply depicts one little corner of that massive evil, and shows how a few people outsmarted it, and did survive. The film trusts our own intelligence, and lets us draw our own conclusions about why Schindler changed, and also what the Nazis were like. Another thing I loved about the film is that Spielberg resisted the temptation to paint the Nazis as mindless villains. Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is seen as having the same passions and mannerisms as Schindler himself. But somewhere along the line Goeth strayed from the path of good, and from that we can see that the line between good and evil is a fine one.\n\nThis is a masterful film. Fantastic acting, superb pacing by Spielberg, beautiful lighting and photography, great music, and extremely intelligent and profound insights into human nature. What more could you ask?"

        "review_detailed_main": "In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.\n\nIntrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the Nineties.\n\nSchindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast - especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of release.\n\n`I remember Steven saying \u0091Don't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'\n\nIt goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way.\n\nSo, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career.\n\nHe had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own Jewishness as a subject.\n\nFollowing his more \u0091human' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level.\n\nAfter offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.\n\nHaving successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.\n\nSo keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start filming.\n\nOld friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.\n\nBoth films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.\n\nSchindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.\n\nTackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.\n\nIndeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.\n\nFor his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.\n\nNeedless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release."

Just a Hollywood war film along the same lines as The Alamo or other inaccurate historical plots made to order on silver screen.\n\nDisgusting that it was taken to schools and pupils allowed to view as true history."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the greatest films ever made. It will stand the test of time and ensure that one of the greatest tragedies in human history will never be forgotten.\n\nSchindler's List is crafted with care and precision. The cinematography is subtle and haunting and the film is beautifully shot in black and white, symbolising the duality of tyranny and hope. The acting is utterly flawless, especially Ralph Fiennes as the embodiment of Nazi oppression. However Liam Neeson is also fantastic as Schindler himself, bringing a dominant screen presence and an emotional strength.\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of the film is the realism that is consistent throughout. It is as if the audience have been propelled back in time to witness the horror. The 3 hour running time allows the viewer to reflect on the 6 years, which leads to an incredibly powerful emotional climax. But as the film unfolds it's Schindler's transformation from self-serving Nazi to compassionate protector which bears the most emotional resonance. For me, this was the most striking aspect of the film, that despite the scale of the monumental atrocities, the capacity for human goodness remained."

        "review_detailed_main": "Known to all audiences as one of the greatest movies ever made, \"Schindler's List\" is biographical drama of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jews during the Holocaust, and employing them in his factories. This could affect the lives of many Jews during this terrible event in history. With a 3-hour running time, a marvelous script, and a breathtaking directing duty from the legendary Steven Spielberg, \"Schindler's List\" is one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. Liam Neeson delivers his best performance as Oskar Schindler, and this guy really brings truth and charm to his character, and it lets you see that he has transformed into this iconic figure. Ralph Fiennes portrays a scene-stealing performance as SS-officer Amon Goth, with a cruel villainy to his character that is just awesome to watch on screen. Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and Caroline Goodall round up the supporting cast, and they all create a powerful casting ensemble. Director Steven Spielberg succeeds once again, directing such a fine masterpiece, that led him to two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. This film may be lacking for the first couple of hours, but it does not change the fact that this movie is a sensational piece of work. Some moments make you furious, some moments make you cry, and this is the type of movie that you are going to feel bad about, but you'll still enjoy it. The art direction is sensational, the editing is superb, the cinematography is just masterful, and John Williams' score is completely breathtaking. But it's Spielberg himself that guides this movie. His directing has made a big impact on the face of cinema, and he improves once again, making one of the greatest films he has ever made. This movie is dramatic and heartbreaking, but this also a challenging and emotionally moving motion picture, and Spielberg never disappoints. \"Schindler's List\", in my review, \"an epic and heartbreaking Spielberg masterpiece\"."

But this, I just feel I HAD to do it.\n\nThis film is not just a film, it's an experience. Each time I watch it, I feel like I'm actually there. Something about the film does that, the use of black and white works perfectly. Not only does it bring out the horrors of the holocaust and make it scarier, but the soundtrack fits perfectly too. The film is probably the most accurate depiction of the holocaust, ever to grace the silver-screen.\n\nThe acting is superb, there is no over-acting at all. The first 30 minutes are perhaps slow, but as the movie progresses you feel the pain of the Jews. The soundtrack at times it haunting, but also hopeful.\n\nThe film is inspiring and carries a message of hope and redemption. It sure did make me cry.\n\nSchindler's List is a master of story-telling, with strong narrative and a beautiful soundtrack, it never get's old. To this day, 20 years later it still remains one of the greatest films of all time, but also Steven Spielberg's finest work."

Months of seeing human beings being brutalized and getting to know them (his factory used the Jews as cheap labor) as individuals, made Nazi Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) change dramatically. This is not the usual Steven Spielberg fare. He directs this with a deft touch. The holocaust should NEVER be forgotten...and man should have learned from it. Unfortunately since this catastrophic human disaster there have been more cases of \"ethnic cleansing\". \"When will we ever learn ?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Out of all the movies I've seen in my lifetime, Schindler's List will always be a staple in my mind. The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.\n\nThis movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.\n\nLiam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.\n\nSome may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian. Not to mention Steven Spielberg's direction on this is flawless. He pieces everything perfectly together, wraps it up in a bundle, and gives us an absolute masterpiece of a film.\n\nSchindler's List is my favorite film. There has not been a single film that compares to my experience watching it. There has not been a single movie that has moved me and left me speechless like this movie has. The only movie that has come close to impacting me like this was Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men, and even that by comparison doesn't add up to how Schindler's List impacted me. I know some people will say \"You need a movie that you can watch over and over again that is fun and enjoyable. How can you have something so depressing as your favorite movie?\" Some will even say it's too obvious a choice. Well, you know what? It is an obvious choice, because it is obvious that this is a powerful, beautiful, and incredible film experience that excels in pretty much everything it has to offer. It's an incredible achievement and I can't wait to watch it again. Well done, Spielberg."

The last scene (the one in color) was exceptionally powerful, deserving to be on the greatest scenes list of all time.\n\nNow for the bad.\n\nSchindler's List is a holocaust movie made without a fundamental understanding of the Holocaust. Yes, they get the bare bones facts right enough, but the movie is two dimensional at best. Everyone in the movie fits into a different category, with very little variation in characters within a given category. Either they are Jewish or they are non Jewish, and if they are non Jewish, they are either evil anti Semites or reformed heroes. If they are Jewish, they all act the same. Their reaction is uniformly \"if only I could do something, I would, but I can't, so the only thing left is to live and die honorably, which means being silent when things happen.\" There is one Jew who can do something, but other than that, they are all like cardboard cutouts. For me, the impact of a movie comes from seeing people react to different situations, even painful ones, but from seeing REALISTIC and THREE DIMENSIONAL people reacting to situations. Schindler's List totally lacked that, so, to me, even though the movie is about something I am very interested in, the movie was exceptionally dull and uninteresting. It was not powerful at all. In addition, the historical accuracy was marginal."

After watching it again, I must say it's a remarkable film which comes once in a while. Based on the true events of the holocaust, the film is like a well written book which can serve as a quality time to anyone striving for a brilliant work of art.\n\nWell, many nice films have been made on Jews concentration camps like \"Life Is Beautiful,\" \"The Pianist,\" or the most recent \"The Boys on Striped Pyjamas.\" Indeed all the movies were brilliant, but they saw holocaust through individual character. But \"Schindler's List\" gives a holistic account of the history for which the film stretches for over 3 hours and uses monochromatic colors to give the periodic feel. Despite the over-length, every scene of the film remains compulsively watchable till the end credits. Every scene presents a cinematic excellence in depicting the story of a greedy industrialist who saves over 1100 Jews from the concentration camps. His uplift of the spirit from greed to human compassion, seeing the atrocities of Nazis, is brilliantly realized.\n\nThe bloodshed in the film starts with a single execution which slowly shifts to mass killings during the liquidation of ghettos showing the brutality done to humankind, which just leaves you horrified. The grit and the depressing environment the film creates is pretty touching and many moments of the film raises the feelings of humanity for which the film becomes a well felt heart touching saga. For focusing the story. the film keeps a low profile with much unknown cast and avoids sentimentality and gloss till the very end. Overall, the film remains a landmark for the ages to come; and it deserves to be archived as one of the immortal film makings of all time.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 4"

It is depressing as you see what people had to go through in the concentration camps.\n\nTwo other excellent elements of the film are the fact that it has the best on screen hero ever, and one of the best on screen villains ever. The best on screen hero is Oscar Schindler because of how he sacrifices profitable business to save innocent people from the wrath of Hitler. One of the best on screen villain ever is Ralph Fiennes character. Ralph Fiennes character is one of the Nazis who has no heart and kills for sport. The key to having a good villain is having them be as heartless and horrible as possible. That's definitely what this character succeeds at.\n\nThis film is excellent and will have an impact on you unlike any other. If you haven't seen it, see it now."

        "review_detailed_main": "Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.\n\nOskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.\n\nSchindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense."

The movie, based on a novel by Thomas Keneally, shows how Oscar Schindler, a member of Nazi party, saved the life of thousands of Jews during the World War II. This film was shot is black and white, it is because of some reasons such as black and white (duality) stands for sorrow - influencing the feelings of the viewer in addition by using this method, spectator can feel this is about history, sorrowful history of course. Despite its long time, the movie is not even a little bit tedious. I wonder how the movie impressed me, in other words how the movie stunned me is adorable. While watching the movie, I was not in my room but I was completely in another world. You can find lessons of life, generosity, self-sacrifice and many other things in this film. \"Oskar Schindler: One more person. A person, Stern.\"(Oskar regret why he cannot survive more people) My mind was engaged with the word \"A person\", do not look the number, here I realized the worth of humanity. \"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.\" on the other side savagery and cruelty are shown as well. In most cases, films based on novels cannot be as well as the novels so as soon as I finished the film, I purchased the book. Do not miss it. Overall thanks to the cast. The cinema must proud to itself because of such movies."

Perhaps one of the most famous among them, even after almost 30 years after its release, remains \"Schindler's List\".\n\nI can assume that many people start watching this film because of director Steven Spielberg, but they watch it to the end for the sake of the story. In a good way, such a movie should be shown to teenagers at class hours dedicated to humanism and moral education. After all, insight can overtake even the most \"black\" soul, and you should always strive for this.\n\nNot paying attention to the fact that the film is quite old and black and white, I would like to focus on the plot. The Holocaust is a difficult and painful topic even for those who have nothing to do with Jews. Therefore, those inhuman conditions and chaotic tortures that were shown in the \"Schindler's List\" do not cause anything but disgust and silent tears.\n\nAt the same time, introducing us to the main character Oskar Schindler, the creators present him to us in the form of a money-hungry man who sees prisoners as only a source of income. It probably was, but because of this there is a certain feeling of \"failure\". We are not shown at what specific moment Oscar's attitude changes... the true reason remains vague.\n\nIt's hard to believe that before that fatal massacre of Jews, which turned his life upside down, he had never watched their suffering and torment, albeit in some other form. But in any case, what happened happened. And even if his motives remain not completely clear to us, because we are used to comparing the Germans of that time exclusively with immorality and \"universal evil\", thanks to his decision more than a thousand lives were saved.\n\nAt the same time, he does not act impulsively. Oscar understands perfectly well that it is impossible to save so many people, guided solely by emotions and nobility. That is why he purposefully yanks in front of his superiors and bribes the \"right\" people.\n\nDespite the fact that \"Schindler's List\" is a feature film, it feels like a documentary. It is not surprising, since the plot is based on real events, but a significant role in this was played by a black-and-white picture without unnecessary sounds and anguish. It's like you're watching archival recordings, for example, of the siege of Leningrad. I had a similar feeling, for which the director has a special respect.\n\n10 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the Academy put him at the top of their \"A\" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort, E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for \"his\" Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as Schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. The real-life Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.\n\nAlso quietly impressive is that Gandhi guy, Ben Kingsley, as Itzhak, a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the Schindler empire. Newcomer Ralph Fiennes has also copped some Best Supporting Actor awards for his nasty Nazi, Amon Goeth, who heads up the Plaszow forced labor camp. When bored, Goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. Chilling. The rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen, the script is intelligent, the music is sweeping, and that cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a knockout. The complaints about Schindler's List are mostly minor. At one point Spielberg feels compelled to use a special-effects trick. It looks like a cheap cut-and-paste job. Couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? The protracted finale also got on my nerves. After the movie climaxes, the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. Mr. Spielberg, your manipulation is showing."

I have the disagreeable feeling that in Germany - maybe elsewhere, too - the message of movie is: \"Yes, there *were* Germans opposing nazism, but now lets no longer talk about this topic. Period.\"\n\nHowever, as long as the causes for fascist thought persist, history has got to be told!\n\nSpielberg does tell an impressing story, but unfortunately the wrong one; which is not to say that Schindler didn't take the right decision, rather that it would have been wiser to make a movie about a non-nazi antifascist."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Schindler's List\" can best be described as something more than a movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the Holocaust. But don't cheat the film aspect either: this film is brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful, smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.\n\nThe story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.\n\nLiam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn't seem all too warm and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest character.\n\nFrom the technical aspect, John Williams' score is beautiful. The theme is both tragic and hopeful and it's incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and thoroughly conceived.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Revisiting Schindler's List in the context of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict offers a different insight. All literary and artistic works with a historical narrative have a distinct cultural standpoint and perspective. Schindler's List is a historical narrative from the standpoint and perspective of the Jewish people. We were shocked and moved at the beginning because even with a distinct cultural standpoint and perspective, the film has a respect for life and a call for peace beyond the standpoint. Now, in the context of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that call for love and peace is ironic. What about saving one life, saving the whole world? I began to gradually understand that narrative is a kind of power, who controls the narrative, who controls the power. History goes undiscovered at the time of its occurrence and has been reorganized at the time of its discovery. The chroniclers of history, no matter how objective they claim to be, describe history with their own cultural standpoint, and history is reconstructed in the description and interpretation time and time again. Even if the historical truth is narrated, through cutting, the reorganization of successive events, it can make history very different, not to mention, there are spring and autumn writing methods, small words. Like the Jewish construction of their own history and experience, it is a powerful power. Although limited by various factors, the rise of we-media is to some extent a snatch and reconstruction of the right of discourse of traditional media, at least it enables us to view the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from a different perspective. If we do not occupy the position of culture and public opinion, the enemy will occupy it. Make a good master of the two powerful historical narrative tools of film and short video. Support Palestine."

        "review_title": "Mediocre and overrated",
        "review_detailed_main": "The story is about the efforts that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a World War II profiteer, put out in order to save the Jews from Plaszow concentration camp. Let us make it very clear: from the starting point, Schindler has no interest in saving the Jews. His sole interest, at first, was to make money. How was this man converted from being an opportunistic businessman into a courageous human soul who was willing to save thousands of lives? He even appeared initially unaffected when SS-Lieutenant Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennce) blissfully murdered innocent Jews. How, then, could this man break down at the end of the film because he could not save just one more life is baffling. Agreed that he was surrounded by good Jews, but the probable reason for his transition (encountering a dead Jews who thanked him) was utterly self-congratulatory. Was he even terrified by the murders that were going on (if he was, he never showed it on screen any way)? Perhaps, only the extraordinary Schindler himself could help Spielberg realize it. Or did Spielberg care about strong characterizations, at all? There was no complexity here.\n\nHowever, Liam Neeson's Schindler was given pretty decent treatment when you consider the other elements in Schindler's List. Particularly was, the vicious monster of the story, Lieutenant Amon Goth. Was he the only one who killed (or loved killing) Jews throughout this whole affair? I had this question on my mind when the film exclusively focused on him insanely shooting random Jews from his bedroom. Giving a mad figure the special treatment of being the leading culprit of this mass murder is a laughably simplistic way to make sense of the Holocaust. And it fits into the general audience's banal understanding of the event. The key to Holocaust is the diffusion of responsibility among the persecutors and the lack of moral convictions on the very part of the human race. Those complex concepts were given no treatment in Schindler's List. Instead, everything is reduced to insanity. The very possibility of the Holocaust, therefore, remains alien to a whole audience, who, perhaps, come to see the film just to feel a sense of grandness and liberal guilt. Raplh Fience was terrific in his performance. However, his role, sadly, served as a springboard for the audience to blindly put their blame on. How revealing!\n\nIn short, the treatment of both Schindler and Goth shed no light on the ambiguity of human nature. Schindler suddenly became \"good\" while Goth was inherently \"bad\" (This only makes the visual comparisons between the two men all the more exploitative). Everything seems pretty common sense, and obviously very digestible. However, if there is a most deplorable injustice being done here, it was the presentation of the Jewish community. Perhaps, everyone who has watched this film can recall the scene of a little girl splashed in red that Schindler spotted during the liquidation of the concentration camp. Anyone could have been fooled by this imagery, whether a film amateur or a veteran film fan. However, if you sit back to think about it, the image is pretty fortuitous. What does this present exactly? Hope? Love? Future? Or even blood? This middle-browned attempt to convey some visual meanings does not succeed in any meaningful way. Worse still, it is an exploitation of the bathos of childhood innocence, which does not make sense in this circumstance. We are dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, not some selective individuals that were singled out from this whole in order for us to dwell on 'sophisticated' feelings of loss and hope. If there is a lesson that is unforgettable about the Holocaust, it is the unjustified prejudice and hatred inflicted upon the Jewish community as a race, not just the brutality and violence that any particular Jew experienced (if you want to know about brutality and trauma, you can ask the 20 million Russians who were dead also). Why not color every Jew red then? Any selective visual presentation in this case is misguiding; and manipulative. Even the sequence that precedes it, a moral struggle between mother, daughter and childhood friend during evacuation does not feel like a climax. It is so trite, so predictable that one might just allow himself to rumble with all the emotions that Spielberg has designed for him. It feels as if, the audience is told what they already know, and all they need to do is sit there, ruminating like an act.\n\nThe saddest thing is that at the end, when the credit rolls \"In memory of the 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust\", I wonder what the whole film has to do with those 6 million deaths. If you are inattentive and easy-going, you would freely accept it as an earnest tribute to them. But really? Telling the clich\u00e9 story of a thousand who were alive is the tribute to the 6 million who were dead? What does this film have to do with the dead anyway? The desperation, the horror, the pain, the shame and the doubt of those who went dead were not adequately conveyed. Oh, just tell the marvelous story of saving lives to make the audience open their mouths and wonder. And we can forget about those who were dead. What a lovely tribute that Spielberg made!\n\nThe real story is extraordinary. But there must be a way of telling it without this pretentious sense of self-importance that makes it so easily consumed by an uninformed audience. At no point in this film, do I feel a sense of desperation, that sense of \"needing to get out of this horrible nightmare\". It was just like watching a prodigious show that make you feel \"wowed\" (and admire, and cry?). But remember that grandness cannot replace substance. Indeed, Holocaust is a very difficult subject matter. It needs to be approached first with intelligence. But Spielberg evidently failed to do so."

You feel guilty about sitting on your comfortable sofa munching on your big tub of popcorn, watching so many people suffer.\n\nThe effect of the black and white picture is that it makes it even more real as most of the footage from the holocaust is in black and white, it also allows you to pick up a few small but vital details.\n\nIt the soundtrack is moving and deserves all the praise and awards it got.\n\nRecommended; to people who take an interest in the holocaust or spielberg films in general\n\nNot recommended; to people who don't like films that are sad or make you cry, this is definitely not going to be your scene.\n\nWatch this if you liked; the diary of anne frank"

I have loved most of his movies, but Schindler's List trumps them all for one very important reason: it's a true story that not only tears at the heart strings of any human being with a heart, but it captures a piece of history that is personal to Spielberg himself. I am a major defender of the nation of Israel and a lover of her people. The idea that any man could glean pleasure from destroying any human life is a concept way beyond my grasp, but to feel a race of people is so superior to another that the other is deemed unworthy to live is beyond reason.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Schindler's List is about the Holocaust. Spielberg brings the stories of a relatively small group of Jewish families who were caught in the middle of the world's greatest tragedy right to your living room. What makes this movie so different from most other Holocaust movies is that you get a first-hand look into what a real life hero is made of. Heroism is not all muscles and brawn. Sometimes all it takes is a broken heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oskar Schindler was not a good person in the strictest sense of the word. A member of the Nazi Party, he drank like a fish, gambled, conducted dealings on the black market and cheated on his wife innumerable times. Yet he found salvation by doing something so great even he could not comprehend its greatness: he changed himself for the greater good, saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews employed in his munitions factory from the hatred of the Nazi regime.\n\n1993 was arguably the greatest year of Steven Spielberg's life. First he made the rip-roaring Jurassic Park, a still technologically astounding movie that revolutionized special effects and paid for his kids' educations for the next thirty years. But later, he presented us with Schindler's List, a film as remarkable as Schindler's achievement that beat nearly all other '90s historical dramas into submission and finally bagged him the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for which he had long been unfairly passed over. And if he still hadn't won it would have probably spawned conspiracy theories.\n\nSpielberg has said that the filming of Schindler's List \"was the most satisfying experience of my professional career,\" claiming it is the best film he has ever made. Even if I do say so myself, he's absolutely right. Working from Steven Zaillian's masterfully constructed adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's Ark, he elicits an outstanding performance from Liam Neeson as Schindler (who justifiably lost at the Oscars to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia), and Ralph Fiennes pulls off what is easily one of the scariest performances in cinema history as Amon Goeth, the SS commandant and director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau labor camp whose favourite pastime was using Jews for target practice.\n\nHowever, this is unquestionably Spielberg's greatest directing job. Utilizing grainy black-and-white cinematography, Spielberg cleverly uses lots of wide panning shots and hand-held cameras to evoke just the right amount of shock and sympathy for Holocaust victims in each scene. Also, he seems to have realized that in order to completely nail a film of such depth and importance as this, you shouldn't even attempt to glamourize the Holocaust or answer the questions it has left in modern society. All you have to do is assess what happened and get the facts right.\n\nIn the production notes in the Schindler's List DVD, Spielberg writes: \"No one can do anything to fix the past - that's already happened. But a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must never happen again.\" Now I know the chances of you reading this are devastatingly low, but if you are, Mr. Spielberg, you need not worry because as a result of this powerhouse masterpiece you have single-handedly re-awakened awareness of the Holocaust, ensuring that it (hopefully) will never be repeated or forgotten. You are a god among giants, sir."

I knew it would end at 3, but I didn't care because I had wanted to see this so called \"amazing\" film. I wasn't disappointed.\n\nSpielberg managed to create one of the most beautiful films ever. Even though the subject matter itself is depressing and morbid, the way humanity springs from such a destructive environment is beautiful. Oskar Schindler's transformation from a war profiteer to a humanitarian is subtle and realistic. Schindler is human, and feels it too, thanks to great writing and Liam Neeson's wonderful performance.\n\nSpielberg's direction has never been better. The executions of the Jews are brutal because there are no cuts; almost every slaying is done in one shot. This adds to the realism and the sheer bestial nature of the Holocaust. The cinematography is amazing in black and white, creating a sense of melancholy in a stark world.\n\nWhat else is there to say? I could go on about the acting and the writing. I didn't even mention John William's morose, but poignant score, which provides much of the emotion that stems from the film. However, all I can say is that Schindler's List is moving, touching, and altogether brilliant. The final scene almost made me cry, but I didn't because I'm an unemotional robot. But as an unemotional robot, I was still deeply moved by Spielberg's sentimental tribute to those who died in one of history's saddest periods."

It's Spielberg's message to his critics that he can be serious, but honestly, three and a half hours of black and white is trying just a bit hard, and the little red girl is just totally over the top. The worst part about it is the manipulative subject matter, the Holy Cow of the holocaust. Spielberg tries to tie up the seriousness of the plight of the Jews in World War II with the seriousness of his film making, and it turns out totally faux-arte. Give me a break."

Easily the best film he ever made, Spielberg showed that he is also able to direct serious stuff besides escapist adventure films. I would put this film among my top 50 favorite films.\n\nThis film is technically flawless and shows how sophisticated Hollywood filmaking had become by the early 1990's. Though I would question the use of black and white in the film: color is good and the Pianist showed it can be used in a WW2 tragedy film. However, this film is not the best WW2 film ever made either, Grave of the Fireflies, by Isao Takahata, a film detailing the suffering of two children to survive in Japan in the final months of WW2, is easily superior to this one and if you think this film is sad, thy watching Takahata's masterpiece."

I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because it time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history.

        "review_detailed_main": "After the release of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a \"war\" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in WWI and WWII. Spielberg's purpose in 'Schindler's List' which he made five years before 'SPR' is much the same. With calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. A third World War may not have the Nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the Nazis were to the Jews. I've seen war films before(the series 'Escape from Sobibor' which I think was the most vivid), but Spielberg manages to show war in 'Schindler's List' with such a menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. The story of Oskar Schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. But this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. Liam Neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of Schindler. His facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the Nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make Schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. Liam Neeson deserved an Academy Award that year as much as Tom Hanks for 'Philadelphia' did. Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the Oscar and give the Award to both! Because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like Neeson playing so complex a character as Oskar Schindler... Ralph Fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'The English Patient'), also gives a charged performance as Amon Goeth. His feelings for Helen, the Jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively.\n\nThis movie leaves you with images, you remember the camera tracking behind Neeson and into the bar, you remember him looking at the destruction of a whole town watching from a hilltop, the Nazi soldier playing Piano as people are getting killed, the doctors and nurses mercy-killing their patients so that they'd be dead before being shot by the Nazis, the little boy who saves the life of his fellow prisoners by his clever repartee to Goeth, the beautiful scene between Helen and Schindler in the wine basement, the boy running and hiding in a sewery, the girl in red escaping and hiding under her bed...images that linger long after they are seen. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is awe-inspiring! He treats us to a visual poetry in black and white, the way he did two years later in color in 'How to Make An American Quilt'. Spielberg's decision to use black and white is laudable, it suits the subject perfectly. Even where he has used color - showing the little girl's red dress, the yellow tones of the candle burning when the rabbi is chanting in Yiddish - the effect is poignant and symbolic.\n\nTo say that 'Schindler's List' is a memorable film would be to understate its majesty. It is an altogether breathtaking cinematic experience!"

I usually can separate myself from the fictional events of a movie, but not during the last ten minutes. I was appalled at the scenes included in this movie, and they were both cold and moving at the same time. This is the best movie I have ever seen. If I had been in a room with a hundred of my peers, swearing to laugh and taunt me for life if I cried I would have still wept. Two of the starring actors' performances were definitely grade 'A'. Liam Neeson puts on a flawless performance in my opinion, as does Ben Kingsley. However, the performance of Embeth Davidtz (cast as the maid, Helen Hirsch) left me disappointed, as did Raplh Fiennes'. As far as story goes, this is a moving and powerful one, that ought not to be forgotten. I wish I could touch on the specific parts of the movie that moved me most without spoiling any of the ending. I also wish I could personally invite the entire Nazi regime over for \"special coffee\" laced with strychnine; especially Goeth, if he was a real person, and definitely Hitler if he were alive."

For me, the B & W made it less intense (I'm nearly sure, that wasn't the main M.O.; probably done because Steven \"saw\" the past in B & W) & I was glad. I do wish to single out Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes for electrifying performances.\n\nCan not be overly praised."

I could expound forever on this film but just want to share my reactions. At the end of this film, the pain I felt could only be compared to the similar emotional exhaustion I felt when I was going through a divorce that involved losing my children.

At the end of the film, I was an emotional wreck, both amazed and horrified at the extremes of human behavior.\n\nYes, it is a film based on historical events. But it does not attempt to paint its characters as pure. Liam Neeson delivers as Schindler, while Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes--hell, the entire cast--turn in some truly powerful performances.\n\nThe criticism of this movie astonishes me. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out some people in this world. Let me put it another way--if you are not moved even a little by this film, or if you use snarky, cynical reasons to bash it, you're not even human. You don't even have a soul. You don't care.\n\nThis film will resonate long after we are gone, as well as it should. The Holocaust did happen. And yes, millions of other people besides Jews were slaughtered. But SCHINDLER'S LIST reminds us to never forget the holocausts of history. Never forget--never again."

Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler's List. This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.\n\nSet in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.\n\nThe images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.\n\nYet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not \"just following orders\" like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der F\u00fchrer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.\n\nSteven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about: the fight against bigotry and injustice."

I was in a way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and the fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to me. But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly intrigued by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.\n\nI have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn. If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were treated and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an excellent film. Too bad Speilberg doesnt make films like this these days...now we're given A.I and Minority Report...such a shame"

The difference between these two stories is that the last one is true. Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave. Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot. I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if he's not looking away."

Steven Spielberg made no attempt at separating his \"serious\", \"grown up\" film from this \"entertainments.\" The Nazis in 'Schindler's List' are like the Nazis in the Indiana Jones movies\n\n2. For such a harrowing subject, he uses some fantastic showmanship. The cinematography is a wonder, a joy to look at. There's even a tantalizing nipple shot, seriously, in a movie that's supposed to seriously look at the Holocaust?\n\n3. The cruel joke/ thriller element to the old man who is nearly executed but is saved by the sheer chance that a gun jams twice! The scene had the same potential to keep an audience on its seat as say, an actual thriller!\n\n4. The overly simplistic view of the Nazis as completely evil. This one I can understand. I wouldn't expect any Jewish person to even attempt to see Nazis as nothing more than aberrations of humanity.\n\n5. An incredibly manipulative collection of closing scenes; first the \"I could have done more\" speech that Schindler gives as he's inundated by those he saved is tailor made for emotional assault, as he's praised like a strangely Christ-like figure.\n\n6. Final shot of the actual Schindler Jews paying tribute to his grave. What about the other six million?\n\n7. And finally, the worst of the worst - the girl in the red coat. In order to fully grasp that the Holocaust is bad, really bad - because otherwise Jews and gentile alike would not be able to grasp this - he displays a girl in a washed out red coat and then shows her red coat on a cart of dead bodies. If that isn't cheap, exploitation, then honestly tell me what is.\n\nIn the end the movie is typically well made - excellent cinematography, seamless editing, strong acting, entertainingly fast paced - in other words a Hollywood movie. Should that be the definitive way to represent the Hollocaust?"

To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which will captivate you until the very end.

Not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies (although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which I had never seen before.\n\nOskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.\n\nQuite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.\n\nOn a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.\n\nOverall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.\n\nMy rating: 8/10\n\nRated R for war violence and language."

I don't care if it did win Best Picture (I don't really give a damn about the Oscars in general), and I don't care if it did rank #9 on the AFI 100 list. For me, it's too recent to be rated number nine when there are many films better than it and more deserving to be placed higher than it, such as Raging Bull and Dr. Strangelove.\n\nSchindler's List did not create any new styles in film making that I have seen, or have any real memorable moments in it the way other movies do. It was just Spielberg making something that he knew people wouldn't degrade because of fear. Fear of standing outside the crowd and speaking what is on their mind. Fear of being attacked for their beliefs, which is ironic considering what the movie is about.\n\nI have had to hear about the Holocaust almost every year I was in school, watching the same documentaries and reading the same books. It gets very boring very fast when you have the same thing crammed down your throat year after year. How can you expect one to remain shocked and appalled when you desensitize them by showing it to them all the time?\n\nOverrated to say the least.

It left me longing for the days of \"Forbidden Games.\" Meanwhile, having succeeded in dumbing down American moviemaking-as-entertainment in the 80s to the level of \"The Goonies\" and \"Batteries Not Included,\" he proceeds to dumb down the Holocaust with the introduction of fake art-house effects and fairy tale symbolism. In interviews following the film's release he said that the making of the film had so opened his eyes to the horrors of the Holocaust that he regretted having used the Nazis as villains in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"; apparently he literally needs a picture drawn for him -- a moving one -- and assumes that we do, too. It made me wonder if he would go back to \"Raiders\" if he could and digitize all the fun away."

He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men.

Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must see! 10/10 stars!\n\nJay Addison"

        "review_detailed_main": "I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen on the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must see movie for all people interested in history."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. Oskar Schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires Jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. But, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. Liam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But, the portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the Jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing and hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the Jewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the Jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air.\n\nAn unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where the protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people really adore him. This can be defended by accepting that the real Oskar Schindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the rest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience. All in all, the movie stands today as a masterpiece made once in a lifetime."

Ben Kingsley, one of the great actors of ANY era, is magnificent as Stern, the accountant who helps Oskar and at the same time stays under everyone's radar while helping his people during their incarceration.\n\nI could go on and on but that basically describes it.

The movie takes a turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation comes out of his mouth automatically.\n\nRegarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and appreciable. The film is better, in my view, that The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which, in IMDb, is the top rated movie. A must watch!!!"

We both thought it was the best film by Steven Spielberg by far and easily one of the best movies ever made.\n\nAll the performances were top notch and it tells an important part of our history which many people do not even know about. It is brutal, it shows people getting executed, huge piles of bodies being burnt and much much more. It made me as well as my roommate tear up several times and it became harder and harder to hold the tears back as we both would have sobbed without being able to stop.\n\nThe end is also very emotional when Liam Neeson's character, Schindler, realizes he could have saved many more lives if he had not spent so much of his money. The film ends with the actual survivors visiting Oskar Schindler's grave and paying tribute to his unforgettable achievements once again.\n\nUnfortunately I can only give this masterpiece only 10 out of 10 points. There are not enough stars to give to this movie."

        "review_title": "Is The Holocaust really a suitable subject for a Hollywood movie?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold \"Surgical Rubberware\".Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies of \"The History of Torture\", \"The Kiss of the Whip\",\"L'Erotisme au Cinema\" \"Health and Efficiency\" and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown handwritten sign promising \"Trusses fitted here\",\"The Scourge of the Swastika\". As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of 1962,Mosley's rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off Colin Jordan,the British Nazis' new Messiah in a bloody battle near Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their grandparents' lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase for virtuoso acting. It's a horrific reminder of a period in recent history when all the vilest parts of man's nature were allowed and even encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours'flying time from London and don't let anybody kid you it couldn't happen again. However sober it might be I have a problem with \"Schindler's List\" inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific an event to be reduced to a \"Hollywood Movie\" status no matter how well intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie with star names and marketing it as \"Entertainment\" risks rousing the interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants."

        "review_title": "How this film has received so much praise, I may never know",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Schindler's List\" isn't by any means a bad film, but it's not particularly good either (a decent way of describing Spielberg's entire career). Some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall mediocre work that certainly doesn't deserve the high praise it has gotten (much of which is because of Spielberg's treatment of the film itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high schools around the country, etc.).\n\nThe film's issues begin with its main character, who begins the film as a complex, interesting character who seems to possess a moral flexibility that would have been a great asset in such a changing society as his and then is reduced to a simple man with a conscience despite his surroundings. The transformation is unwelcome and not at all credible, since it seems to be precipitated by absolutely nothing (The holocaust has already begun around him, so that cannot be the precipitating event.) The change is made all the more ridiculous by the epilogue of Schindler's later life, which makes it clear that the first version of his character is more accurate. Liam Neeson performs very capably in the role, especially in the vastly more interesting opening scenes, but his performance is not enough to save such a ridiculous character arc.\n\nThere is also a terrible lack of focus in the film, as it spends such a large amount of time dealing with its villain, Amon Goeth, as to take away from Schindler's presence in the film. Goerth is also a more exciting character than the second Schindler and performed with such an incredible menace and dark intelligence by Ralph Feinnes that the viewer can easily long to see more of Goeth and less of Schindler, which is not a good thing for a film with such moral certainty.\n\nBeyond these problems, there is the visual style of the film, which is a blatant rip-off of Alain Resnais's \"Night and Fog.\" The black and white past with color present footage, intended to connect the past to the present, is clumsily done, as the subject of the holocaust's connection to the present is never once broached within the film. The colorization of the red swastika and girl's jacket also adds absolutely nothing to the film. It's pointless and smacks of Spielberg trying to prove his own depth.\n\nHowever, \"Schindler's List\" does have its fine points. The film is still quite pretty to look at, including an incredibly beautiful, depressing image of Jewish graves as a Nazi road, and a number of other truly beautiful images that capture the sorrow of the Holocaust extraordinarily well. The acting is also truly excellent, highlighted by Ralph Feinnes in a tragically under-noticed turn as Amon Goerth. Finally, John Williams's score is hauntingly beautiful and has an understatement the film would have done well to mimic. These are cosmetic elements, perhaps, and they certainly don't make up for the film's major flaws, but they certainly improve the film from the train wreck it might otherwise have been.\n\nOverall, \"Schindler's List\" is an overrated, average film. The performances and score are top-notch, but its message is not sent as vividly as it is by some other films about the same subject (most notably the aforementioned \"Night and Fog\") and its characterization of its protagonist leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a waste of time, but films such as \"Night and Fog,\" Sidney Lumet's \"The Pawnbroker,\" Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" and Roberto Benigni's \"Life is Beautiful\" explore the Holocaust much more poignantly with far less fanfare."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've read a lot of the comments on this movie and while everyone is entitled to their opinion, it pained me to see that many people missed the point of the movie altogether. Many people have labeled this as a horrible movie simply because it was made by Spielberg. Others criticize the way he used Black and White film (with the exception of the Girl in the red coat) and still others claim that there was no Schindler.\n\nJust because a movie is made by Spielberg, doesn't mean it's going to be trash. This has to be the first movie of his I've seen that I actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the world a better place. Maybe that seems stupid to some people, but knowing what Schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day I can help someone too.\n\nAs for the black and white film, I think it fit beautifully. In the 30's and 40's there really wasn't a lot of color film used, especially for Journalism and the news. It fit with the time period very well. Also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental touch. There actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day of the Karkow Liquidation that caught Schindler's eye and it completely disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a child. What happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the millions of people (Jewish, Gypsies, Homosexuals, etc.) and the fact that no one was standing up for them. The little girl and seeing her running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up Schindler's eyes in the movie.\n\nMany people here have claimed that the character of Oskar Schindler was completely fabricated so that Sielberg could get some money. Fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real Schindler and he really did help them. He wasn't the best of men and he certainly had his faults. He drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he supported slave labor, and he was a member of the Nazi party. . . but despite all that, he still did something good for other people. Oh, and contrary to what some people have claimed, while Schindler did in fact make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save the Jewish workers. He lost everything he had gained during the war to save them.\n\nLiam Neeson, I felt, did a great job portraying Schindler and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth. Fiennes in particular was rather frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the Nazi party.\n\nThere is a lot of nudity in the movie. Some people complain about that, but honestly, what do you expect? Do you really think that the Nazis told them that they'd turn away while they got changed? No. The nudity in the film (as portrayed by the Jewish and other victims) was necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor people had to endure.\n\nIn closing, don't listen to all the negative reviewers out there claiming it's bad because of nudity, Spielberg, or any other number of things. This is truly a movie that you can't judge until you've seen it for yourself."

(Please note the jokingly tone in that sentence:) It's not the script or the theme that carries this movie forward, it's the brilliant performance of the actors/actresses and the unique atmosphere in the black and white world on the screen that rips your heart out and steps on it. The glances, the body language, the tension between the actors... I can't point out exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the director did a great job. It's not boring. It doesn't seem like a documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this film is reality. And that, ladies and gents, is definitely a good thing. Ten out of ten stars from me."

        "review_detailed_main": "I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.\n\nThis film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.\n\nThe 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.\n\nThe DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.\n\nThis is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!\n\nThis haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!"

To walk away from this film dry-eyed is to not be human. Many 'Best Picture' winners are actually overrated... Chicago?... A Beautiful Mind??... The English Patient???... to name a few recent ones. Yet Schindler's List is not overblown, and for all its praise, is still underrated, for it deserves better than the best recognition. This is not just a film... not just three hours to while away your time. This is a lesson in humanity. Schools everywhere should make this part of their curriculum for High School, to teach the future leaders of the world what mankind is capable of. It's not what we could do. It's what mankind DID.\n\nSome say the number of Jews murdered -- Six Million -- is overblown... but I say, be it six million or two million, or even just one single person, what happened was horrible and inexcusable. I myself am a descendent of a Nazi, and for their crimes, I say to all... LEARN from history, and never forget it.\n\nSteven Spielberg, my hat's off to you."

The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is a reflection on how great this director is. His 3-hour painting of Oskar Schindler and his forever changing view on the Nazi rampage against the innocent Jews is simply the greatest film achievement since the simple secret of Citizen Kane is finally revealed in a magnificent, grand and intelligent way. The final scene in which a marching group of 11,000 or so saved Jews morph into real survivors (an in color vision) and the ceremonial funeral of Oskar Schindler showing the several survivors of the Schindler factory is a real marvel and a sign that box office king Steven Spielberg doesn't work just for money. Spielberg should be knighted or something for this movie, just like Schindler saved the Jews Spielberg let the Jews' pain and suffering be recognised and World War II be looked at beyond the view of the British and American army."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is yet another example of how Spielberg can kill an otherwise passable movie. The movie contains some genuinely good, subtle moments like the shooting of one hiding Jew fading into a phrenetic piano solo during a pogrom or a close-in shot of bodies being burned that fades out to a view of smouldering bodies that looks like a gigantic landfill. But, in general, the movie contains far too many scenes meant to tug at our hearts that end up demeaning one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind. The sole use of color for the little girl in the pink jacket wandering through the streets is meant to be poignant. Instead, it is cloying and heavy-handed at best. The scene of Kingsley and Neeson typing up the list of people to be saved is classic Spielberg garbage. Neeson emotes to his best to keep exhorting Kingsley that they can save \"more.\" Come on - going into the operation, they clearly would have known to a fairly good certainty how many could finally be saved. This movie takes melodrama to exciting new heights.\n\nThe ending scene showing real-life grievers of the now-dead Oskar Schindler is some of the most exploitive, unnecessary filmmaking you'll ever see."

How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?\" My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the \"boredom fest\" aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into \"necessary story development/build-up\" At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. \"What if we were in his shoes?\" not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a \"WW2 feel.\" If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie."

That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I see why Seinfeld decided to make out in the theater instead of paying close attention to this movie. It's way too long, sometimes boring, and visually confusing.\n\nOf course, the subject matter here is about one of the most important events in human history, yet I think it's a big flaw to give a piece of art high marks just because it deals with an important topic. It must also be judged on its artistic value.\n\nThis is basically two stories in one. On the one hand we have a sadistic military commander who's rude, crude, emotionally unstable, and bloodthirsty. This part is like an exploitation movie - calculated to shock the audience. However, given that these scenes are most likely close to the truth of an actual situation, it's appropriate.\n\nThe other part concerns the evolution of the character of Schindler from a practical businessman to a humanitarian who gives up all of his fortune for the sake of the Jews in the film. It's a beautiful story, and the ending is touching, but the evolution is, in my opinion, a little too subtle. I don't feel Schindler fundamentally displayed any big change throughout the film. Seems like he was always a rather decent guy.\n\nThe use of music throughout is a unique and brilliant touch. The whole thing seems to move in sync with a rhythm.\n\nThat being said, this film is way too long and some parts are boring. The first third, especially rolls along at a snail's pace.\n\nAlso filming this movie in a tenebrous black and white just to use the girl in the red sweater as a symbol was not only vulgar symbolism cramming, but made the movie hard to watch. Also why did they cast Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in the leading roles? They look like twins. I sometimes wondered why Schindler was committing all of the atrocities only to discover that it was actually a different character. Along with the darkness, made it harder to watch.\n\nIt's a good movie from a technical standpoint. Creative, impactful, and well-directed, but I wouldn't blame you if you made out while it was playing in the theater.\n\nHonourable Mentions: Jurassic Park (1993). Short, fast-paced, good effects, IN COLOR... In my opinion, Spielberg's best work."

With a screenplay by Steven Zaillian which earn him an Oscar for his in-depth accuracy and depictions. With a wonderful array of art and set direction done by Allan Starski and Ewa Braun provides the perfect tones to the screenplay. John Williams harrowing original score garnered him an Oscar also, while Michael Kahn whose previous collaboration with Spielberg on 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' will also carry him home an Oscar for Best Editing. It was the flawless cinematography though by Janusz Kaminski that stands out, his first of two Oscars was well appreciated to this master, who took his game to a higher level when he won his second Oscar for his collaboration with Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. With a great performing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley just help attributes the films well rounded orchestrated extravagance. Schindler's List is the only movie from the 90's that made the top ten list by the American Film Institute"

What is unfortunate for a movie that attempted to elucidate the amount of human suffering clear from any politics, is that a blatant political statement was made at the end. the line by the Russian officer, 'Don't go east, that's for sure. They hate you there. I wouldn't go west either, if I were you' when the Jews are freed is a clear attempt at a justification for a Jewish state. the entrance of politics could overshadow the othewise far-reaching message of the film, which is a human one. other then that, the movie was impressive at arousing a feeling of human sympathy and compassion."

It is simply too well crafted for that, most of the actors are excellently cast and Spielberg is too clever a fox to miss the chance to present a hot Oscar contender here in overlength, to get away from the image of the eternal big kid and to present a serious topic in an appropriately serious manner. First of all, I don't ask myself who this Oskar Schindler really was, because a film is a film and not a documentary. For me, Liam Neeson doesn't really manage to give this character more than one or two dimensions, his closing monologue is almost embarrassing and unpleasant, because next to such greats as Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley, who both do an excellent job here, Neeson takes a bath. Why was he cast is the first question I asked myself in the first hour of the film. The second question came right after that and was confirmed throughout the film. Why is the world so consistently and at the same time superficially divided into two camps in \"Schindler's List\"? Here the sadistic Germans, portrayed in relentless consistency as maniacs and desperate by Ralph Fiennes, then there the Jews, all lovable people, clearly, without exception. Schindler's List is not a pedagogical film, why doesn't Spielberg allow us to see the dark sides as well as the bright spots on both sides? Schindler is a kind of border crosser, but Neeson is unable to credibly transform the cynical businessman into a philanthropist. Add to that the length of the film, which got on my nerves a bit, because constant headshots and pseudo-documentary long scenes don't give me any more information than that I find the Nazis and their actions completely repugnant anyway. One shot is enough for that, I don't need 100. And the final sequence with a crying Schindler is just embarrassing for me. Nevertheless, I scored 7 full points, because I really can't complain about the craftsmanship here. A tighter and bolder script might have worked wonders."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.\n\nAnyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.\n\nA man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.\n\nHe makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.\n\nThis movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.\n\nIt's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.\n\nIt might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well."

I have seen A LOT of great movies. Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is (as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images. I you haven't seen this amazing movie, bring some tissues and be prepared for great acting and disturbing images and scenes. It is very moving and very powerful."

That movie helps me to understand the helplessness of the Jews in the Nazi regime. It is a monument for my grandpa. And for all good people in Germany. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg. This movie is a clear view to the inhumanity of the \"Third Empire\". The colors black and white stay for the death in the Nazi regime. The color red for example is exclusive for life in form of the red dress of the little girl. The atmosphere mirrors the darkest time in German history. The cinema was full of depressing silence after that movie. This is the best a movie maker can earn."

That might be fine for a TV-series or soap opera, but is pretty poor for a movie of that caliber.\n\nNot that I really expected anything but a streamlined feel-good movie by that director, but I find it very offensive to use such a subject just to finally get the Oscar.

This movie is very significant because of its relevancy even in today's world.\n\nSteven Spielberg has proved from this movie that he has the greatest cinematic mind. Disguised awakening in Oskar Schindler's character could have been the most difficult part to picturize in this movie. Hats off to Mr. Spielberg.\n\nLiam Neeson and Ben Kingsly provide the acting pillars to this movie.

It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.\n\nThat's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.\n\nSo I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save millions of lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!"

The last time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full.\n\nOf course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows.\n\nI was mesmerised by the performances of Liam \"I'm Retired\" Neeson and Ralph Fienes.\n\nEven Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce. His motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror.\n\nFienes is such a complex character it's untrue. Spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites. They are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot. This brotherhood means that Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think. At times he appears to take on board Schindler's advice and passificity. He doesn't really hate the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill. At one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel. At heart he is a vulnerable coward.\n\nThe various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces.\n\nSpielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's and is much more powerful. It is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'SL'.\n\nThis really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on.\n\n8/10"

And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me. Schindler's List is extremely well made, with excellent performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter, old tone.\n\nThis is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential, moving film.\n\nOne a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things.

        "review_title": "Sears itself into the memory - both emotionally flooring and undeniably uplifting",
        "review_detailed_main": "Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clich\u00e9d anti-war lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler's List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind.\n\nDispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and Schindler's List is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours.\n\nThe historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. And while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. And despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and clich\u00e9 (Schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this.\n\nLiam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler's factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler's neglected wife, and Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth.\n\nThroughout the years, Schindler's List has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out there, Schindler's List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated.\n\n-10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oskar Schindler represented a snippet of hope and optimism for an otherwise beleaguered people. The fact that one man could be responsible for saving well over 1000 people is astonishing in itself. The story Schindler's List tells magnifies our astonishment. How a man who seems so self-absorbed and moneygrubbing could end up sacrificing his fortune and risking his own life to save others, is what the film principally deals with. This interesting subject, shown in the midst of the Holocaust, and combined with other interesting subplots, makes for a stirring movie experience.\n\nOne detail quite noticeable and frequently discussed is the occasional use of color in this black and white picture. The most obvious of these being a small girl in red coat. We see the girl and follow her path for a short time in the film. This is symbolic on many different levels. I see her mostly as a glimmer of hope in a tenebrous world for the Jews. Later, her red coat looms on top of a pile of dead bodies. Here, we see her singled out among the dead to remind us that while 6 million died, each individual's death mattered.\n\nThe cast is wonderful. Liam Neeson plays Schindler subtly but with the right emotion at the right time. Ralph Fiennes plays a pertinacious German officer with zest and complexity. The rest of the cast, especially Ben Kingsley as an intelligent Jewish accountant who starts out helping Schindler but finds a way to help his people, too, all play their roles accordingly. Certainly, anyone who enjoys film should add this to their collection."

Ten graduating classes have experienced it. Spielberg has never been better. His one-two punch with this film and 1998's Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing. I was vindicated this summer when the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List #3 in its latest Top 100 film series, Most Inspiring Films. Over the years my students have agreed with me...this film about mankind's darkest hour and the horrors of the Holocaust ends on a most beautiful and hopeful note. Spielberg's use of color in a black and white film, though simply done, is the most powerful thing I have ever seen in film-making."

However, since the purpose of the film is to be some kind of document on what happened in the camps in Germany and Poland during the nazi-period, I find the fact that Spielberg is making up things in the movie, such as the shooting of innocent jews from the balcony of a residence, somehow takes away much of its value as a document over history. My opinion is that there is no need for making up things and making them worse than they actually were in order to make a good movie about this era. Things were bas enough as they were; there is no need for making things up, especially things that couldn't even have happened (the location of the villa makes it impossible to shoot jews from the balcony).\n\nTo conclude: I find this to be a movie, well worth seing! However, it is not to be seen as a documentation of what really happened, which in my opinion is very unfortunate since that would have given this movie yet another dimension. In my eyes, this dimension would compensated for the loss of some of the more dramatic scenes in the movie. I guess my historian background somehow blew it for me."

Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do more.

        "review_detailed_main": "the director's point of view shown in the film is something more than that of the Jews. Rather his point includes that of the Germans at the same time by focusing mainly on the storyline of the German hero 'Oscar Schindler'. This whole plot clarifies his intention to make the film hold a balanced view of two sides. Thus, It escapes from a dichotomy which the Jewish people as the victim may easily fall into; beautification of the Jews and demonization of the Germans.\n\nIn this sense the director somewhat exceeds the limitation of the nationality. In addition, his viewpoint puts an emphasis more on the individual level than on the national one. There is actually a wide spectrum even among German people in the film; merciless Nazi 'Goeth', merciful Nazi 'Oscar' and most people who sit back and watch uncritically.\n\nIt's exactly the individual traits which make the result different. In specific \"Shindler's List\" especially focuses on the motives and acts of such kinds of people as Oscar who gave up his profits in order to save others. Therefore the movie is basically a further study about those who have a great soul which rebels against the atrocities and pursues the idea of 'Humanity'."

I watched the film without distraction and now admit my initial feelings for it openly and ashamedly, and I both regret and rejoice in my decision to watch it again. Schindler's List is a masterpiece, a brutally honest portrait of the darkest and most despicable chapter of human history that seizes the heart with a black hand and shatters it as each crack of gunfire cuts off the life of another innocent man, woman, or child. I cannot ever watch it again, unless I am showing it to someone who has never seen it. It is the tale of one man who saved hundreds from the undeserved wrath of the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was and forever will be a hero, and this testament to his courage captures every aspect of it, great and terrible. I hate to clich\u00e9 such a work of art, but out of ten, I give Schindler's List eleven."

The existence of this film won't make a toss of difference when the next crackpot decides to kill whichever race he has a grudge against, and it won't activate his acquiescing public. Spielberg obviously set out to enlighten us on the holocaust, but for me it made it more distant. We barely got to know any Jewish character that was immediately under threat, and the only character that was explored with any depth was Schindler, the hero - the most audience-friendly element. To film in black and white was a ridiculous decision - tantamount to Spielberg just saying, 'Yes, I know that this is a serious subject, but I'm going to deflect your attention and make the whole experience less real.'. Such is the way of cinema."

I felt after what I could watch of this movie (I couldn't stomach a full viewing) that I was manipulated and coerced into my emotions about the content of the film. This movie is one of the least intelligent meant-to-be-intelligent movies. Insulting. One should view \"The Pianist\" for about as perfect a movie re-enacting a Holocaust experience. Not once do you feel as though your being 'forced' to empathize or sympathize with the character, that happens naturally in the context of the film. Any person of Jewish faith should be embarrassed and ashamed of this movie; it actually does a dis-service to the Holocaust. I think it's best summed up by an episode of Sienfield -- sleep worthy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List Film Review\n\nAfter viewing Schindler's List, there is only word to describe the film-Powerful. Steven Spielberg is able to take history, make it a gripping story, and bring it to the camera. The movie showcases the forgotten horrors of the Holocaust in such a dark way, at times, it can be hard to watch. However, this is one of those films that truly everyone should view at some point in life. Yes, from a filmmaking standpoint the movie is very good but the message proclaimed is even better. The story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes Schindler's List a simply incredible tale. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an up-and-coming businessman in Krakow, Germany planning to make a fortune at the start of WWII. Over time, he gains power and respect within the Nazi regime. He buys a factory and begins to mass-produce products the German military needs, hiring Jews from the local ghetto to make him a profit. Business begins to thrive until one day, the Nazi SS clears out the ghetto and sends all of the Jews to concentration camps. At first, Schindler attempts to get his workers back as he is only focused on making money for himself. However, as he witnesses the horrors occurring in the Krakow concentration camp, Schindler must make the decision to put his life-earnings second and make the lives of his innocent Jewish employees first, one life at a time. Steven Spielberg's goal was to make Schindler's List as simply as possible from a technological standpoint. There were no cranes, zoom lenses, or steadicam at all used in the film and the entire thing is in black and white. Spielberg's choice to make a black and white Holocaust film in a time when color film was the norm stands out and also enhances the movie. It creates a sense of horror and pure darkness that victims of the Holocaust actually faced while also making the movie gritty and brutal. For several hours, it took the emphasis away from the filmmaking industry and put it solely on the story. Every film is a product of its time and this is exactly what Spielberg was trying to accomplish. Historical accuracy cannot be the only thing that makes a movie special. It also takes quality actors that can give superb performances and Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are able to do exactly that. The two men are foils in the film, Neeson being the symbol of morality and Fiennes, the epitome of pure evil. In his performance, Neeson is able to embrace everything the real Oskar Schindler stood for. His character is believable, dynamic, and someone that an entire audience can feel for. Viewers can see how emotionally torn Schindler is. It is very impressive when an actor can become a man hated by so many. The task is certainly not easy. But Fiennes embraces his role as Amon Goeth, the despised Nazi in charge of the camp in Krakow. He becomes the man that killed so many and excels at doing it. The special effects are another element of the film that excels. Spielberg and his effects crew make each gunshot and fatal wound seem so real that it seems like each one is happening in real life right in front of the viewer. The scenes of death and violence provide realism that gruesomely hit hard. All of these elements allow Schindler's List to thrive both as a film and as an educatory device on the Holocaust. Some people were outraged by the movie saying it exposed women due to the amount of nudity on camera. Others stated that Spielberg made all of the Jews supporting characters with no real background instead of the main characters of the movie. Although these are among a few of many complaints, the movie truly has no flaws and is extremely well made. Unfortunately, this film cannot and should not be watched by some simply because of the pure evil and brutality depicted. Despite this, its importance in historical film is evident and needs to be seen so something incredibly evil can be learned from and therefore, never repeated. Steven Spielberg is considered one of the best directors ever and Schindler's List proves why. The film is worthy of a 10 out of 10."

The characters in this make the movie so much more realistic (I've heard they were in talks for Mel Gibson or Kevin Costner to lead) every bit of acting is great even the children that are only on screen for several seconds how they get fear in their eyes.

Their children will, with varying degrees of passion and understanding, repeat stories long told or wonder about experiences barely hinted at. Then that generation too will be gone and the dense record will largely interest those committed to studying history, a minority.\n\nFilm can have much to say about the world that not so very long ago convulsed with the agony of a war that included among its terrors unprecedented state-directed genocide committed with, for its time, cruelly efficient technology. Steven Spielberg produced a masterpiece with 1993's \"Schindler's List\" and it will remain a painful, at times agonizing, recreation of a very special craziness.\n\nWinner of many awards including the Oscar for Best Picture, the cast brings to life an enigmatic and, probably, not very likable man, German small-time industrialist Oskar Schindler. Schindler profited from the war and he was a skirt-chaser of extraordinarily ravenous tastes. What set him apart was his rescue of some 1100 Jews from the jaws of the Nazi extermination apparatus. Compared to the tally of the murdered this seems a small number but every life is precious and Schindler did what he could.\n\nWhy did he set about rescuing people destined for the gas chambers or death through individual murder or, simply, by overwork? No one really knows including the survivors themselves. One has been quoted as saying that everytime he asked Schindler about his motives during postwar encounters he got a different and incomplete answer.\n\nPerhaps Schindler himself never knew. But results are more important than reasons.\n\nThere have been some notable films about Nazis, concentration camps and genocide. Some like \"Life is Beautiful\" reflect too much development of a star and seem almost obscenely clean, even with the killings. \"The Pianist\", a recent fine example, shows the suffering of a gifted and wounded man against a supporting backdrop of horror.\n\nIn \"Schindler's List,\" the hopelessness of the victims stretches from frame to frame and the first senseless killings seamlessly lead to a growing orgy of dehumanization. Liam Neeson is extraordinary as the German factory owner and Ralph Fiennes as the SS concentration camp commander is both repulsive and fascinating as a warped man whose violence ebbs and flows without any rational inciting events.\n\nSome dismiss Fiennes' character as one-dimensional and unreal but, in fact, any study of SS types who commanded those camps reveal the same split personalities: people who could be fine family men before setting off to work to superintend mass murder, stopping on the way to commit the occasional individual atrocity.\n\nThe DVD release has been digitally enhanced and the sound is crisp. Spielberg declined to provide the usual extras found on most DVD releases, stating that his original film should speak for itself. But augmenting the movie is a documentary where some who survived because of Schindler recount their experiences. It must not be missed: some of these voices are already stilled-all will be soon.\n\nA very unusual item in the DVD edition is an envelope soliciting contributions to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and to teach its lessons to young people increasingly remote from the war. The solicitation is appropriate-I'm posting a check.\n\nTonight was my third viewing, the first at home on DVD. An amazing, disturbing, brilliant film that will continue through the decades to be invaluable.\n\n10/10"

The one that gets me the most is the motion the child makes as the train goes by.

If you don't like instrumental music, you might after this film.\n\nThis film sucks me in every time I see it.

This was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. Like 'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary. It's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. And can't.\n\nMany have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. Subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.\n\nAs a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.\n\nA film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling. An effective parable? Perhaps. But a worrying one.\n\nSteev"

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.\n\nSteven Spielberg directs this moving drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, which counteracts the realistically depicted violence revealed on screen. Spielberg maturely presents the film through an honest and sometimes disturbing lens, but it's completely necessary in telling the story with complete authenticity. The horror on display in this film exceeds anything I've ever seen, because of the painful reality. It sickens me as a person to know that this sort of thing actually happened and watching Schindler's List is not only an experience, but a history lesson that we should never forget.\n\nSchindler boasts incredible, convincing performances all across the board. Liam Neeson gives a brave performance as Schindler. Like fellow Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes, who plays evil Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Neeson is not afraid to play his character as written: in Neeson's case, an arrogant war profiteer who does not realize--until the very end--the enormity of his actions; in Fiennes's case, a human embodiment of pure evil and hate. Lesser actors would try to romanticize their characters to make them more pleasant to the audience. Fiennes and Neeson wisely chose not to take that route, and make an even more favorable impression than they would have had they tried to soften their roles. Ben Kingsley (as Schindler's accountant, Itzhak Stern), Embeth Davidtz (as Goeth's Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch), and Caroline Goodall (as Schindler's wife, Emilie) all turn in the type of performance that is easily taken for granted. They are so convincing that it is easy for the audience to forget that they are actors playing roles, especially since they are in the background. While watching Schindler's, the audience does not see actors acting in a made-up world; it believes it sees real people living in the real world."

I'm sure this will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time.\n\nFirst off, the acting. Liam Neeson is a great actor overall and shows his excellence in this movie, playing Oskar Schindler. For me, the best actor in this movie is Ralph Fiennes. His role as Amon Goeth is simply amazing. I once read one of the survivors of the Holocaust visited the set and started shaking when she met Ralph Fiennes because he portrayed such a resemblance of Amon Goeth. I can completely understand that. The way he acts in this movie, the way his character thinks are very well thought of. Ralph Fiennes is truly terrifying in this movie, which is a remarkable feat and an Honor to witness.\n\nSecondly, I applaud the choice of Stephen Spielberg to film this movie in black and white. It makes the entire war seem sinister, dark and intriguing. The tiny aspect of the movie in color, the young girl in the red coat is beautiful. Just that small thing made my mouth drop, it works really well.\n\nIn the end,Stephen Spielberg made a lot of excellent, top-notch movies. In my eyes, this one is his best. I don't think he will ever beat the degree this movie is in. If he does I will be flabbergasted. This movie blew me away.\n\nWithout any doubt in my heart, 10/10."

He is so good that for months I didn't know he wasn't German. And his character is truly vile. Read up on the real Amon Goeth and you will see what an evil man he portrayed. He probably didn't care, but good golly.\n\nSecondly, having dated an observant Jew for a long time, I can attest to the Talmud quotation. My boyfriend believed and lived that precept.\n\nNo, this film is not earth-shaking, but once you see it, please remember that some of the people who made the film with Spielberg were, themselves, survivors. If you remember that Oscar ceremony, you might remember that one man got up to accept the award and gave the numbers that he had tattooed on his arm. It really happened!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is the kind of once-in-a-generation film that comes along and earns truly universal acclaim. The tale of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saves well over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. Approaching its 20th anniversary, Universal Sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity.\n\nSchindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a Nazi second. In the throes of WWII, he sees opportunity in hiring Jewish POWs to work in his enamel factory. With the help of trustworthy accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the Jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. Naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking German officers, including the sadistic Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).\n\nThe legacy of Schindler's List stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. The film took home seven Oscars at the 1994 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while Neeson and Fiennes were bested in the Acting categories by Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) respectively. Today, Schindler and Goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career.\n\nThe Blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. It is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. The update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to Bach and the first glimpse of Auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. The famous Girl in Red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative.\n\nFor such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of Spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. The film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. As he did with more contemporary histo-drama Lincoln, Spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any A-list director ever.\n\nThe end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. Schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the Benjamins- or in this case, the Reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. Likewise, Goeth, the man who kills Jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his Jewish maid.\n\nKingsley's Stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for Schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted.\n\nIt is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. Appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which Spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects.\n\nThe Blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including Voices from the List, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'Schindler Jews' who survived the Holocaust, as well as a story on Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation.\n\nThe intentions of Universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. However, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through Spielberg's screenings of Seinfeld and Robin Williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of Fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real Goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition.\n\n*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

Don't get me wrong it disgusts me what happened and upon seeing other movies on the subject matter and visiting concentration camps personally nothing disgusts me more but I just couldn't relate to the victims in Schindler's List. Maybe it was because there was no individual character to feel for but instead these crimes were being committed against nameless faces.\n\nAlso some of the scenes came off as slightly comical (whether they mean't to do that or not) but it made it hard to take this movie seriously. Maybe my expectations were too high, especially for a movie made in the early nineties, but if you are going to claim it is one of the greatest movies of all time then it better be able to back up that claim."

Spanning through the workers at the end brings to light what a good job Spielberg has done with this connection.\n\nIn my opinion this film has more in common with inception then any other . in that there is the possibility that one simple idea can change your life and the lives around you. In the case of Schindler it was the red coat of the young girl who provoked an idea to grow and i believe this is the reason for this film to be black and white. To make sure the audience got the poignancy of that scene, that something so beautiful cannot help but stand out against the rest of the world and effect the people involve more so.\n\nRalph Fiennes brings a brilliant typically perceived German into the picture, ruthless and cold blooded in the way he unnecessarily kills the workers for fun almost but eventually shows heart. One of the hardest rolls in the film well played.\n\nThe ending of the film is perfect as you feel that it has already climaxed with 20 minutes to go and in ways of personal actions changing the storyline drastically it has but in drama it has certainly not . An unbelievable performance by Liam Neeson in its last moments is what pushes this film to 10/10"

Main roles and extras are playing like never before. This is a must see film, involving every aspect of life and death itself. The war is bad but also beautiful with its strange aspects and turns. The situation and all the scenes in the film are unique and the atmosphere catches you from the first moment on. In one moment you will stop realizing this is a film and will totally dive into the whole feeling of being a part of that altered reality. Definitely a film, that should be watched with a nice party- from beginning till the end! Happy watching! Enjoy!"

The movie delves deep into the darkness of human heart and depicts the metamorphosis of a shrewd businessman and womanizer into the greatest philanthropists humanity has ever seen.\n\nThe movie is almost entirely shot in black and white which gives it a grim and timeless look, a remarkable effort by the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski.\n\nThe acting is brilliant. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler has given his career best performance for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Ben Kingsley has also stood well with him in his role of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. However, it is Ralph Fiennes who has stood apart in his portrayal of Amon Goeth, a sociopath Nazi officer without a moral code. Unfortunately, he did not win a well deserved Academy Award for supporting actor.\n\nFurthermore, John Williams has come up with a brilliant score bringing out the misery, horror and tragedy of the Holocaust.\n\nSchindler's List is Spielberg's unforgettable piece of art that makes one cry many times over, especially in the final moments of the three hour seventeen minute epic. Its a must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, this is not a bad film. I think it starts and ends quite well, but there are are too many scenes that seem to be there mostly to document atrocities done by the Nazis in WWII. I understand the motivation to put them all in there, but rather than convey some sense of horror and outrage that events like these should elicit, I found myself both numb and bored. These pseudo-documentary parts took me out of the story and made it really hard to pay attention at all. And this is coming from a huge documentary fan, as well as someone who is not at all turned off by a long run-time if the film warrants it.\n\nMaybe Spielberg felt it was dishonouring the memory of the dead to leave those scenes on the cutting room floor, but for a film over three hours long, I can't help but feel that there's considerably less than two hours of narrative trying to hold it all together.\n\nI was sixteen when this film came out, and I really didn't understand why it didn't work for me then. Having watched it for only the second time recently (in 2011), I sincerely doubt I'll ever feel the need to watch it again. Given that I do think that there's a decent film hiding in there, that is a shame."

The utmost of detail and scrutiny has been given on the setup and the props used, giving it an authentic WWII feel. All these combined with the acting delivered by some of the legends concocts a ensemble of drama. This is one of those movies that is sure to leave you pondering into the abyss of humanity. Pretty lengthy movie, but totally justified. Definitely a must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally and on a true story about a German factory worker, Oskar Schindler, who is a member of the Nazi party and due to his decreasing number of employees, employs the Jewish residents in his factory. Schindler's List explores the true dark side of the Second World War. Unlike most World War Two based movies, Schindler's List is based on the Holocaust; the cruelty of the Jews during the period. The film is also a history lesson; it explores all the years of the war; starting from 1939, the start of the war, to the very end, although the main focus is Oskar Schindler whose actor is Liam Neeson (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, A-Team movie). The character, not only is represented as a womanizer and laid-back, but he is obviously the odd one out; he does not see the Jews as bad people unlike the other Nazis and because it is his job to employ factory workers, cannot resist temptation in saving the Jews from the camps, where the Jews are imprisoned. This shows the message that working on the evil side is the only way to rescue innocent people, which is what would have occurred during a brutal era like World War Two. This is why the film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Picture. John Williams' incredible score links very well with the German Jewish culture, but also represents sadness and bleakness in the story, because it tempts the viewers to feel sympathy for the Jews. The black and white tone also suggests the darkness of the story, but also links with the 1940s setting when most films used the colour tone. Even if it looks older than other nineties movies, Schindler's List was definitely a modern film; for one reason, the film combines black and white with colour; the first shot consisting of a group of Jews paying respects to Oskar Schindler is filmed using colour and the viewer will easily spot a tiny amount of colour during one of the crowd scenes. Another reason is due to the following actors in the film; Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Thunderbirds movie) who plays Ishaak Stern, Ralph Fiennes (Wallace & Gromit In The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit) as Amon Goth and Caroline Goodall (Hook) the actress of Emilie Schindler. Schindler's List was directed by Steven Spielberg who won an Oscar for Best Director and is considered one of his best works ever. It proves that Steven does not just direct thrilling adventure movies!"

        "review_title": "One of the greatest and most important films ever",
        "review_detailed_main": "Without a shadow of a doubt, Schindler's List is the finest film Spielberghas ever made; it is also, comfortably, the most important and is a movie everybody should make an effort to see, not just because of it's quality as a film but because of the message it carries with it. Everyone must surely now know the basis of the film - war profiteer OskarSchindler, a Nazi party member, works to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust, risking his own life in doing so. It is a story that, told incorrectly, could have been overly sentimental or that could have failed to make the points it needed to make about the Holocaust.Instead, it is told so well, it transcends the boundaries of it's media and has become both a vital historical document, cataloging the terror of the Nazis in a way everyone can understand, and a salient warning for our future. The strength of the film lies in the fact that it makes no attempt to preach to the person watching it. The primary characters are painted in shades of Grey. Schindler is a womanizer, a drinker, a profiteer who seemingly puts money before morals much of the time. He laughs and jokes with Nazis, including the primary villain, Plaszow commandant Amon Goeth,who himself is never presented as entirely evil. Throughout, the viewer is presented with a document of the actions of the characters and left to make up their own mind. Spielberg shot the film in black and white, often using hand-held cameras,to give it the appearance of a documentary, and it works. Coupled with the realities of the characters, and the fact that Spielberg neither draws back from the brutality of the Nazis nor uses the script to preach about it, this gives the film \"the ring of truth\". One of the hardest things in film-making is to take the truth, make no major changes to it and then make it believable on the screen; here Spielberg succeeds in this totally. The central performances in the movie are immense. Liam Neeson, RalphFiennes and Ben Kingsley give utterly convincing performances in the lead roles and the scenes where they appear with each other pin the film together and carefully chart the development of Schindler's sympathies.They are the final link in a film that has no weaknesses. This is a dark film though - how could it be otherwise with it's subject matter? It is upsetting and deeply moving and anybody who watches can'help but be changed in some way. The emotional climax of the film, in Auschwitz itself, is one of the most harrowing scenes ever put on celluloid. Spielberg handles the ending wonderfully as well, avoiding cloying sentimentality but still managing to provide some hope after all the darkness that has come before. The final scene, involving some of the people Schindler saved, is profoundly moving. If you haven't seen this film and are considering buying it, do so. Quiteaside from the fact that this is one of the finest movies ever to come out of Hollywood anyway, it also stands alongside books like 1984 and TheGrapes of Wrath, and films like The Battle of Algiers, as being\"entertainment\" that is far more important than the genres which spawned them. The 2-disc set is beautifully packaged, and somehow this seems important for once. There is a deeply moving documentary included featuring interviews with survivors from Schindler's List. The transfer of the film to DVD is excellent as well - clear, bright and smooth. The choice of starting point for the second part of the film on the second DVD is also well made and poignant. For those who wish to further their knowledge of history's darkest hour,the best starting place is Martin Gilbert's book The Holocaust. Alsorecommended are Primo Levi's books If This Is A Man, The Sixth Day and IfNot Now, When; Roman Polanski's film The Pianist and, in music, Gorecki's3rd symphony and Shostakovich's Babi Yar. Equally important is another Martin Gilbert book, The Righteous, which catalogers the actions of some of the 17,000 other people so far recognized by the Council of Yad Vashemin Israel as righteous people who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. All these works help further tolerance and understanding,as does Schindler's List and that, surely, is the film's greatest credit and testimony."

The choice of black and white (with one hint of red) was brilliant and added a darkness that was truly dire. The film also gave a feeling of the European Jews and the Nazi's as human and not statistics. The Goetz was a psychopath but a lot of Nazi's were historically. The SS welcomed people with violence problems and obsessions. The whole regime was run by dark eccentrics and uber-patriots with a chip on their shoulder. I felt that this was history in a way that other films (the Piano not included) did not make me feel."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most successful attempts of Spielberg to create his masterpiece and it's just off the mark..It suffers from what appears to haunt most Spielberg's efforts that is the 2/3 syndrome.For almost two hours the movie is appropriately realistic raw even and its plot is clever and absorbing .The acting is mostly top class especially from Neeson who balances superbly between shroudness and kindness and Ralph Fieness who incarnates the brutality and insanity of the third Reich and considers Jews subhumans. The cinematography is wonderful as usual and the camera work exemplary.The anti war message is conveyed in a strong shocking manner as is the message for human compassion in the middle of the holocaust.Similar qualities graced \"The empire of the sun\" .But as it happened in that movie as well , the balance gradually gets lost.Not due to miscalculation but due to a conscious submission to the melodramatic ...The public gets what the public wants? Maybe from a commercial point of view Spielberg's approach is more appealing to the patriotic or peace loving audience that loves the melodramatic. Not so if you belong to the group of people that don't like art to be reduced to a preaching to the converted.Not if you consider realism a virtue in this type of films.Not if you don't like mellow approaches. You can't fault the first two thirds of the movie.The movie is as it is exceptional, but not a masterpiece, by choice..I admire Spielberg for what he can create and has partly created but not what he chose to do to the end of potentially one of the best movies of all times for definitely non artistic reasons.. 7.5 out of 10 (10/10 for the first two thirds and 3/10 for the rest)"

        "review_detailed_main": "What I really dislike about this movie is that it I think I was really mislead about what it was. Whether the movie itself, its marketing or just word of mouth is to blame I can't say.\n\nI believed it was meant to be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews. Which I was fine to see. But what I got instead was some candid exhibition of the holocaust with the Schindler plot kind of tacked on for good measure. I can agree that we should have a really well-made holocaust movie out there but it's the duplicity of the picture that sits unwell with me. The scenes are disconnected and episodic which would have been appropriate if only it could have been established that this experience was the focus of the movie but since there is a pretence of a linear plot that we only get glimpses of they just feel like filler. I barely remember how this thing of saving anyone developed or how he did it. It was really just a marketing gimmick and is in its own right really not that interesting beyond its premise.\n\nMaybe if it had been some kind of hybrid of \"Shoah\" with \"Waltz with Bashir\" it really could have been something; with real people relaying their experiences which were then dramatized. But because of the way these episodes are contextualized, they just seem pornographic in the sense it is more about a sadomasochistic voyeurism on this example of genocide, relying way too much on its production values and the gruesomeness of what it is showing so to me it is basically just a slasher than rips off reality. At least \"Friday the Thirteenth\" tried to be original.\n\nAnother design flaw is the film's desperation to show you things to make you recoil. Once you establish crimes against humanity to be on the stakes, the endless parade of candid shootings just seem redundant. It doesn't matter how bluntly they the lady gets shot, the apathy to human lives already blatantly obvious. It's just \"what's going to happen? Oh? Another person got shot? Shocking...\" This candour is also jarringly contrastive to strangely lyrical dialogues and monologues that make it very unclear what tone the movie really wants.\n\nPowerful moments asides, it's a very sugary experience, and the horror of its subject matter does not excuse the handling. As you can tell from the cover art used on this website. I respect the use of black and white, it's very appropriate and usually the colour against black and white thing would greatly appeal to me, but it focuses on a little girl which is just pandering. The same kind of physiognomy that Nazi Propaganda used. Maybe I'm slow but the point that it was to personalize the impersonal nature of mass killings was lost on me. Perhaps most insultingly of all, the movie, despite how keenly it fetishizes holocaust imagery, doesn't give any kind of reflection on why the holocaust happened. No one is entirely sure but there is surely something to say about it. It's happy to talk about why people went along with it, but the mentalities of the axis peoples are lacking. That these people don't have more of a presence is a big hole in this movie.\n\nAlso, it's in English, which costs it a whole point out of ten from me. It should be in German. I am not German.\n\nAs snooty as this must sound, I am inclined to think that this movie was a case of people really falling for a sentimental, well produced collage of an historical even we all like to hold in mind but not really think too carefully about that compromised the art (and the very story it was supposed to tell) for artsiness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.\n\nSchindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for \"his Jewish workers\", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.\n\nThere are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.\n\nI find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must admit I was stunned! With so many bad movies, with no substance at all, it's wonderful to know that those kind of movies like \"Schindler's List\" prove to us that masterpieces are still possible. Congrats, Steven Spielberg!!! The movie presents an apparently vain character who wants to gain profit with his business, by employing only Hebrew people, because they are paid less( they aren't paid at all, only the taxes for them are paid). Through the movie we are given the chance to see some great and very very moving frames of the Holocaust...women and old people are being killed in front of our eyes, humiliation and cruelty is being presented as if it would happen right now...it is a lesson to learn and it is history relieved in a traumatic way. The movie is tragic, but the fact that Schindler acts in such a humanitarian way is reassuring for us to know that...after so many crimes and so much evil, there still is GOOD in us. This movie is a MUST if you wanna watch an unforgettable movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Schindler's List\" is the kind of movie that, because of its historical accuracy, could be used as a documentary. But it also gives us a deep story, and a performance by Liam Neeson, that is among the best of all time.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a vain, glorious and greedy German businessman who becomes unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nSteven Spielberg has a technical talent like no one else has. His frames are so elegant and objective, that you know what is going on, and where (in the last battle of \"Saving Private Ryan\" you can notice this qualities better), which makes us feel that we are living the movie. The massacres and killing scenes are distressing, because it looks like it's happening to you. And the idea of making this movie black and white gives a tone of reality, that looks like the movie was shot during WWII.\n\nThe plot, beyond giving us a history lesson, shows the amazing story of Orkar Schindler, whose personality and turns are probably the best thing in the movie, and powered by Liam Neeson's incredible and contained performance, that is just one of the best. And other great characters, Ben Kingsley as Stern, as the smart, but quiet Jew, Fiennes as Goeth, the obsessed with power German (Although I thought it was exaggerated sometimes, like when he wakes up, and shoot Jews with a rifle, just for fun). And the construction of the characters is very well made, which makes the ending even more powerful, being one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.\n\nVerdict: Probably Spieberg's best work, with a moving and accurate story, and a mesmerizing performance by Liam Neeson, this movie is simply, one of the best."

        "review_detailed_main": "|This film is almost perfect,both in its place as a cinematic masterpiece visually,and in its sensitively handled subject matter.It is only given a nine by myself because i really don't think i will ever see a film that truly deserves a ten.The film is about a subject that affected millions,The Holocaust,but it has a very personal impact on the viewer by concentrating on a group of people that are characterised enough that the viewer relates with them so much more.If they had tried to show the wider spread effects of the Holocaust,the empathy would be diminished,because although based on harrowing events it would become just another historically based movie,with too much going on.What makes Schlindlers list so touching is that your given time to relate to the central characters in such a way that you feel you could almost imagine what they are feeling,and any film that can take you to that level of empathy is automatically a classic in my book! It is a good way to ''teach lessons''as it were because it affects anybody who watches it.Anyone harbouring fascist views should be made to sit and watch this movie repeatedly.If they can still be that way after seeing this,they must be in human,it really is that good at getting to anyone on an emotional level.This impact is heightened by the beautifully used black and white tones of the film,with significant items/parts in vibrant colours,stunning!The score is very effective too.Any one who can watch the ending without feeling moved is a robot!Fact!The film is great,granted but the cast also take this film to new heights,Liam Nesson is superb in his portrayal of a man forced to question his own values,beliefs and place in a system that is wrong,and who chooses the right path,absolutely mesmerising! Touching,informative and beautifully made.Easily one of the best films of all time,and THE best film on this subject.9/10"

After the first hour it begins to be tiring and a punishment to watch. The acting is \"ok\" but plot mundane and uninteresting. The worst part is the runtime. It could be easily cut down too 1 and a half hours. Bottomline, don't watch it, it's a waste of time."

Schindler's List is the work of master and is masterfully crafted on all counts, this is an unforgettable, iconic film that simply cannot be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.\n\nIdeas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.\n\nSchindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget ($35.6 million in 2014 dollars). It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004."

And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, \"Isn't a town over there?\" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf."

The choice of black and white to portray the bleak, hopeless atmosphere, coupled with those few flashes of color to underline the horror and make it more personal, is just genius.\n\nHowever I mostly wanted to write this review because in very few of them did I see John Williams' name. True, the acting in this film is topnotch, the direction is basically flawless, but it's the music that makes this film. Seriously I dare anyone to hear those violins crying and not cry themselves.\n\nThere is something extremely powerful in it and I truly believe that the film would not be half of what it is without it, that feeling of horror, stupor mixed with anger and outrage that I personally felt at the end of this film mainly stems from the power of the music. Of course I'm not taking anything away from the actors and the director which were all BRILLIANT , but I just felt that there hadn't been enough said about John Williams..."

        "review_title": "\"Not the work \u2013 the presentation\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "One of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, I mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. The more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.\n\nScreenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone \u2013 each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see \u2013 the one-armed man and the civil engineer \u2013 are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them \"Nice things cost money\". Eventually he will be buying human lives.\n\nIn evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained fa\u00e7ade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.\n\nSteven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous \u2013 his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama \u2013 but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.\n\nAnd this \u2013 the life \u2013 is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this."

I mean, why add all those dramatic scenes of children being led to their deaths, the gassings, bodies burning etc? What did all that add to the film story apart from try to shock the viewers? Schindler himself was, in reality, far removed from the nice man portrayed by Liam Neeson. Most of what he did was not because he particularly cared about the Jews, but because they made him lots of money. He was also a serial womaniser and adulterer. Basically, the film is a sentimental Hollywood melodrama which happens to be set at a time of great cruelty, motivated by blind fanaticism. An opportunity was lost to analyse WHY the Nazis hated Jews so much, what were the fundamental roots of the German-Jewish conflict? Instead Spielberg went for the safe option of creating brutal German robots and innocent, perplexed Jewish victims. And the final scene when Schindler gave his speech was frankly ridiculous. Final verdict: magnificent film, subject matter not properly presented."

        "review_detailed_main": "By making this movie, Spielberg reportedly wanted to increase awareness of the holocaust. In this regard, he probably succeeded. But that should not cloud the fact that this is a very mediocre to bad movie. The acting is, save for Kingsley, stale and in some instances, such as the train to Auschwitz scene, almost aching to an Ed Wood movie (I assume these women were not professional actors). The story is clumsily told, the symbolism (red dress) heavy handed and the psychology of some characters (such as Goetz's scene in front of the mirror) very simple minded. A few scenes did work for me. I thought that the shower scene was well done and intense, and I do not feel that it was too exploitative in the context of the movie. Also, the shot of the smoking chimney was eerie, but this has been lifted from other movies. What really did bring the film to its knees was the speech at the end. My god! This was even worse than Steven Seagal's at the end of 'Fire Down Below'.\n\nIf you want to learn about the holocaust, pick up a history book or watch some of the many documentaries on the subject. It will not be pleasant, but you'll learn so much more than from this movie."

The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing.\n\nThe Jewish saying \"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire\",is a pivotal element of the plot.

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating: 9/10\n\nSchindler's List takes place during World War II. It revolves around the Germans and the Jewish Ghettos. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an influential business man in the Nazi party, looking to make an enormous profit due to the was. Schindler brings several hundred Jews onto his work crew and starts manufacturing. Schindler runs into trouble a few times with keeping his work crew from being killed by Nazi rule and their general way of running things. Schindler hires a jewish accountant to run his business for him and keep track if the business. The focus of the movie revolves around Schindler's relationship with his workers and their struggle through the war.\n\nSchindler's List is a black and white movie which turns a lot of people off, however it was a wonderful concept that was executed very well. Schindler's List made more of an impact being in black and white. It gave the movie more of a sense of actually being involved in the war era. Spielberg did a good job at directing this movie, but could have altered a few things to make the movie less awkward and more focused. For instance, there were a few shots of nudity that were completely unnecessary and could have been avoided and modified and still effectively portray the concept being presented. The nudity with a few individual lovers of Nazi members, for this movie, took the film from an engaging story with meaning to a meaningless question and cheap entertainment thrown in to captivate the audience. In my opinion the film did not need to be \"perked up\" to keep the audience awake. However, there was mass nudity during a few scenes, both male and female, which I felt was completely necessary and helped in presenting a more real illustration of the camps the jews were forced to dwell in. Schindler's List was an excellent film that did an extraordinary job at portraying the Jewish struggle and Nazi politics during World War II."

His performance in this movie was superb.\n\nEverything about this film is right on the money (okay, okay, Liam Neeson's thing at the end, \"...this pin could have saved 3 people... this limousine 10 people...\" was a little over the top [maybe]). The first time I saw Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the cheek. She then said, \"thank you,\" and left. Was she or a member of her family a holocaust survivor? I'll never know but it was great to see a movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national Holocaust museum in Washington DC. If you thought Schindler's List was amazing, a trip to the museum really emphasizes the scale and magnitude of this act of evil."

I love all of those films. However, \"Schindler's List\" is his #1 masterpiece. The movie that would finally win him the Best Director Oscar after losing and being snubbed by the Academy for years, \"Schindler's List\" takes place during the Holocaust and tells the story of Oscar Schindler, the real-life German war profiteer who saved the lives of more than 1,000 Polish Jews. This is one of the most powerful movies ever made, lasting over 3 hours long and shot in beautiful black-and-white. Winner of 7 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), \"Schindler's List\" features spectacular performances by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler, Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant, and Ralph Fiennes in one of the scariest movie performances of all time as an evil Nazi commandant. A harrowing, powerful film that will live on forever, \"Schindler's List\" is an outstanding movie that I'll never forget.\n\n**** (out of four)"

It ascends to a new level; it so poignantly and delicately conveys its message that you are left breathless, speechless and completely in awe of what you have just seen.\n\nMr Spielberg so often shows his talent in a very forward and visible way; his restraint and control in this film adds so greatly to its power because it IS restrained and you are left with the memory of what the film is about, not just any specific effect, sequence, style or even performance.\n\nIndeed these performances were second to none, Ralph Fiennes comes particularly to mind \u0096 you feel such hatred towards him and yet there are flaws in the evil of his character, indeed this would have been a very hard part to play.\n\nThere are also reminders of the human tragedy of the holocaust that tie the entire event to one person, the use of the red coat on the little girl is a simple and brilliant way of doing this; it serves to shatter any desensitisation that we may build up to protect ourselves from horrors that we are seeing, it brings the entire thing back home; in such a simple and effective way and makes it personal \u0096 VERY personal.\n\nI think that this will serve to educate us and remind us of what happened for many centuries to come, it is a work that will stand the test of time like no other; I firmly believe that it will go far in serving its ultimate cause, that such events may never happen again.\n\nIn short I do not think that it is possible to speak too highly of Schindler's List. I fear that we may never see another film of this calibre but if we do it would have to be something truly remarkable and be of someone of at least Mr Spielberg's brilliance; a very, very hard act to follow."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a film that is made by a filmmaker at the height of his powers. The dramatization of the Holocaust is some of the most intense footage ever made. In so far as the end goal was to get the viewer to experience even a small part of horrors European Jews experienced the film succeeds wonderfully.\n\nBut the film's focus is critically off in two ways. Schindler's story of moving from an amoral capitalist to a humanitarian saver is compelling but it is not what the Holocaust was. It was genocide, murder and pointless brutality. There's no good reason to tell Schindler's story as the central point. It was and is an anomaly. This problem is really brought home with the fake out sequence in the Auschwitz showers/gas chamber. Most people who entered that space were murdered. It is almost as if Spielberg cannot bring himself to display the actual horrors of genocide directly. To tell only the story of Schindler's List is fundamentally misleading.\n\nSecond, I don't understand why Stern isn't the protagonist or why Schindler is. To frame the Holocaust through the eyes of a German gentile is gross. Schindler, for all his goodness, was not the target of the genocide. Moreover, certain beats in Schindler's story trivialize the Holocaust if treated as the focal point. The famous sequence of the young girl in the red coat is the moment Schindler changes. It is when he first sees the humanity of Jewish people. But that isn't what matters. What matters is the mass murder that is occurring. If the film made Stern the protagonist this problem would be greatly lessened.\n\nThis is a film with messed up priorities."

Ralph Fiennes is the very personification of human evil; Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is an opportunistic war profiteer. He doesn't have any grand epiphany or sympathy for the Jews. He just knows somewhere that he has to help how he can - despite his fear and greed.\n\nLike Saving Private Ryan, however, the core of the movie's power is the documentary-like scenes that bring home the atrocities we've heard about our whole lives, but never maybe never FELT like this."

But of course, I don't have any choice in the matter, because it's simply too disturbing to never see again. I don't believe there is any finer monument to the horrors of the Holocaust than Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List.\" People may tell us of the horrors, of the concentration camps, of the deaths, but this film puts us there, among the survivors.\n\nThis is, of course, Spielberg's crowning achievement. As far as I am concerned, there is no other film ever made anywhere that has the power and emotion of \"Schindler's List,\" least of all the technical expertise that is so evident here. For instance, Janusz Kaminski's frenetic camera work whips us through the ghettos in such a way that we can not help but be terrified, and yet is calm enough to let us catch a breath, cry a tear. This is also, in my opinion, John Williams' finest score. It is so sparse, so beautiful. For any classical music fans, I can only compare this score to Henryk Gorecki's Third Symphony, \"A Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.\" But I'm getting off the topic.\n\nThe acting is flawless, with performances from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. And, of course Steven Zaillian's moving script that puts us everywhere, from the heart of the horror to the outskirts of it.\n\nLet me go back to what I said at the beginning of this review. I do not like \"Schindler's List.\" I love it. And yet, I don't love it quite it the way that I love any other film. What I can do is recommend it without reservation to anybody who has never seen it. There is no better film than this. Period.\n\nOf special note, Spielberg apparently donated a copy of this film to every American high school. I can not thank him enough for that, because it was in class that I first saw \"Schindler's List.\" I just pray that others have been as affected by it as I have.\n\n**** out of ****."

With help from high-ranking Nazi officers, he starts up a pots and pans factory to help the Jews work. After a few years, when we have seen many Jews massacred and shot, Schindler makes a list of Jews, to be escorted to a German arms factory in his home town, and saves them from a trigger-happy, power-mad Nazi officer (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes). After YOU (who haven't seen it) see it, you will agree that it will not soon be a forgotten masterpiece."

In other words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie. And it's great.\n\nLiam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII. Ben Kingsley is very good as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the factory. However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful. His role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a great job at it. In fact, I believe he should have won best supporting-actor in \"Schindler's list\".\n\nMoving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten list.

The film is in black-and-white because that is actually how Spielberg envisioned the Holocaust from the documentaries he had seen; we see the coat on the little girl in red in color in order to indicate that Oskar Schindler is focused on her; and so on.\n\nIt is wholly evident that Spielberg wanted to make this movie the best movie possible so that, in turn, it becomes a timeless document depicting but one story of the Holocaust. And indeed, while we still enjoy the fun adventures in Jurassic Park, E.T. and the like, it is Schindler's List that will be remembered, years from now, as one of the greatest films of his entire career, if not the greatest."

Before seeing it, I never would have thought, that a director like Spielberg, would be able to create such feelings of total distress, desperation and hope. Only the ending with the jewish rites of the stones on the grave of Schindler was a little bit disapointing. In my oppinion nothing else than a bow to the box office.\n\nSchindler's list is a great film. It shows the holocaust as it really might have happened and leaves you with a feeling of fear that it might happen again in any country, at every given time."

        "review_title": "A hero amidst the horror",
        "review_detailed_main": "Oskar Schindler did not set out to be a hero. He set out to make money. He was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of Poland's Jews. They were cheap, easy labor. But somewhere along the way things changed. Schindler saw what was happening all around him. The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. But this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. Even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. There is room for a hero.\n\nSetting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. You have to celebrate those who were saved. But you must also honor those who were lost. Steven Spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. He told his uplifting story of Oskar Schindler. But the bigger picture was never lost. The horror of what took place comes through very clearly. Spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. The pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. Seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. Seeing the bravery and heroism of Oskar Schindler restores that faith.\n\nSpielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. Liam Neeson played Schindler so beautifully. Here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and Neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. War-profiteering Nazi or heroic savior of Jews, whatever the moment called for Neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. Who was Oskar Schindler really, why did he do the things he did? He was an enigma who Neeson portrayed wonderfully. Ben Kingsley played Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. At first Schindler and Stern have very different motivations. But a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. And Stern plays his part in helping to save his people. A quiet, yet determined, presence whom Kingsley personifies so well. And then there is Ralph Fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil Amon Goeth. Any story of a hero needs a villain and Goeth, as played chillingly by Fiennes, is as villainous as they come. Perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. But in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. Kingsley is very good, Neeson is terrific but Fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. He makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality.\n\nThe three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. But Spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. Some play characters who we get to know a little bit. Many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. The hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. Spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. And the specter of death always looms. It's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. It grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. And there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. One scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. And you're just watching, people actually lived this. This was such a challenging story to tell and Spielberg tells it so well. The Holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. But here a hero was found. And Oskar Schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world."

It depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation, and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tag line says \"Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world\". And this film shows us that no human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!"

However, I feel that it should have focused more on Schindler's factory. We all know the historical facts about the holocaust, but Schindler's heroism is a unique story, one that has not been told.\n\nSome scenes, like when Schindler witnesses a raid while horseback riding, were necessary and I would not have cut them out. However, scenes like when the Nazi officer searches for a maid or when a Jewish engineer insists that a foundation be re-poured were repetitive and stretched out the movie.\n\nHowever, it is still worth seeing for the gorgeous cinematography and Schindler's final words in the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Schindler's List strives to be hailed as an unparalleled cinematic achievement, yet upon closer scrutiny, it becomes painfully evident that the praise it garners is wholly undeserved. Upon a recent reevaluation, undertaken to validate my initial impression from years ago, it is imperative to call into question the intentions of every individual associated with this production, particularly Steven Spielberg, for subjecting audiences to the cinematic ordeal that is Schindler's List.\n\nSchindler's List falls astonishingly short in delivering any semblance of depth or insight. It possesses neither the intellectual acumen nor the emotional resonance to offer a nuanced perspective on the Holocaust or the human experience during that harrowing period. Instead of grappling with the profound complexities of its subject matter, Schindler's List seems content with indulging in a superficial and manipulative portrayal of historical events.\n\nSchindler's List's aspirations to be poignant and profound are regrettably misplaced. The film's overt attempts at eliciting sympathy and pathos are overtaken by its evident desire to manipulate the viewer's emotions. Spielberg's heavy-handed direction, coupled with John Williams' score that underlines every emotional beat, only succeed in detracting from the authenticity the film aims to convey.\n\nSchindler's List's narrative approach is marred by its reliance on shock value and graphic imagery. Rather than engaging with the historical narrative in a respectful and thoughtful manner, the film often descends into gratuitous scenes of violence and suffering. This reliance on visceral images and sensationalism diminishes the potential impact of the film's central message and serves to exploit the suffering of those who endured the Holocaust.\n\nThe performances, while praised, are marred by their overtly theatrical nature. The characters, particularly Oskar Schindler himself, often feel more like caricatures than fully realized individuals. Liam Neeson's portrayal, while lauded, veers into the realm of self-congratulatory heroism, failing to capture the genuine complexities of Schindler's motivations and actions.\n\nSpielberg's choice to accompany nearly every scene with an emotionally charged score is a transparent attempt to manipulate the audience's sentiments. This musical heavy-handedness serves to underscore the film's lack of subtlety and confidence in its own storytelling.\n\nSchindler's List is an exercise in exploitation rather than a genuine exploration of historical tragedy. Its reliance on manipulative techniques and its inability to engage with its subject matter in a thoughtful and respectful manner taints its reputation as a significant cinematic achievement. The film ultimately serves to trivialize the horrors of the Holocaust by reducing them to a spectacle for the sake of emotional manipulation."

They do not act, they are the characters. Ralph Fiennes is most terrifying as Amon Goeth.\n\nThe photography is as beatiful as documentary- like. After three hours, when the end credits start to roll, I realized I was watching a movie and not a documentary. And of course, Spielbergs direction makes it all just a perfect history lesson.\n\nIt's a must see for everybody!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Schindler's List\" is easily one of the greatest films ever made. The technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and displayed in its nakedness like it is here. Steven Spielberg richly deserves life-long accolades for creating this film. His choice of b&w cinematography is brilliant. Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are all fully realized. Spielberg's epic is a far cry from normal Hollywood movie making and that unto itself is an amazing accomplishment for the misguided 90s filmmakers.\n\nEasily, the greatest creative element for this film is Ralph Fiennes. Without his central protagonistic presence, \"Schindler's List\" would certainly be a flawed examination of the Holocaust. Instead, Fiennes' character displays uncontrollable impulsive fits of rage and unpredictability which epitomizes the Nazi aura. Fiennes' performance is the best in recent years, and his finely drawn and provocative character richly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest ever drawn up!\n\nTrue to life affecting drama has never been better and it seems incomprehensible to expect a motion picture of this magnitude and quality to appear again in our lifetimes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust."

However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gas ed, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this \"flip side\" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic \"gung-ho\" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be \"Saving Pte Ryan\" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.\n\nLike the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening portrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young Jew remains as one of my many fa-vs!"
