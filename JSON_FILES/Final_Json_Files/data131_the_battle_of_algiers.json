This is real cinema, this is why it is considered a form of art!\n\nWith the metaphysical crudeness of black and white, the dramatical facts of the Algerian rebellion against the French are accounted. The movie has the realistic appearance of a chronicle. And there are tons of intellectual honesty, too. I mean that there are no white hats VS black hats. You can see terrorists troubled as they are about to leave a bomb in a cafe. Policemen who struggle to save an arabian child from being killed by outraged crowd. Most of all, I like the frank words of Colonel Mathieu about the \"bad methods\" he's using during interrogations... Watch the movie and you will know."

It helped me to put imagines and sounds to stories I heard from my teachers, cousins, as my grand-parents and my parents still can't talk about that horrible war.\n\nBy now, as I'm growing old, I understand that this movie is not the 'Truth', it was 'war', and in a war even good people can do horrible things. And I know what I'm talking about as I was there, in Algeria, during the 'Dark Decennial', while we were fighting against our own people whom turned terrorists in the name of Islam.\n\nSo for those who will watch this film, please just remember not to judge any of the parties : Algerian /or/ French. It was a war and no war is nice, people die, and those who survive will suffer. Films/art are a form of exorcism for that pain we keep silently inside.\n\nI like this movie, because I saw tears in the beautiful green eyes of my grand mother every time she watched it and it always gave her a good opportunity to cry for my grand father that she lost during the war. I saw my father crying for his father that he never knew, and saw him also being closer to his mom because.\n\nFor me, this movie will always be a 'Good movie to watch in Family'"

Ennio Morricone composed one of his early successful scores."

        "review_detailed_main": "An historian writing about the Algerian war against the French colonial authorities entitled his book \"A Savage War of Peace\". \"The Battle of Algiers\" provides many answers to that enigmatic title. It does not attempt to show us the entire war but centers on the city of Algiers. Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people. The camera shows no heros or villains but humanity in its darkest forms. This is a powerful film with superb direction and cinematography. It truly is one of a kind and once seen will never be forgotten."

Then all of a sudden, this amazingly haunting music starts, and we're told the story in flashback of how the Algierian people tried to revolt against the French Soldiers.\n\nFrom what I understand, the movie uses no documentary footage, which is amazing as some of the scenes in the movie must have taken a great deal of effort to produce., There are some pretty amazing crowd scenes and the explosion scenes are just breathtaking.\n\nAlso, I guess some of the actual revolutionaries are in the film as well. They are pretty hard to point out as all of the acting here is amazing, very realistic.\n\nSo, looking for a war movie? Dammit, don't go for Private Ryan, go to Algiers."

        "review_title": "Powerful , award-winning flick depicting the uprising against French Colonial rule",
        "review_detailed_main": "An impressive and historical film in semi-documentary style . Set when the Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (FLN) is leading the resistance in Algeria against their French rulers , the FLN that the colonial authorities believe, or want to believe, comprise only a small minority of the Muslim Algerian population in wanting Algerian independence. Subsequently , specifically violent incidents taking place in the battle in Algiers -between 1954 and the final time of independence in 1962- are introduced . The final scene happens some time later in 1960. There is a riot going on with soldiers shooting into the crowds. Finally , the \u00c9vian Accords were a set of peace treaties signed on 18 March 1962 in \u00c9vian-les-Bains, France, by France and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the government-in-exile of FLN, which sought Algeria's independence from France . The Accords ended the 1954-1962 Algerian War with a formal cease-fire proclaimed for 19 March and formalized the status of Algeria as an independent nation and the idea of cooperative exchanges between the two countries . The movie ends with the captain narrating that on July 2, 1962 a new nation of Algeria was born . The French Colonel...who was forced even to torture ! . One of the many women...who stopped at nothing to win! The Algerian Street Boy...who became a rebel hero!. The Revolt that Stirred the World!\n\nThis seminal semi-documentary style film was well directed by Gillo Pontecorvo , who also participated in the script and the music (in this last aspect, advised by the great maestro Ennio Morricone) . The main characters were represented by Brahim Hadjadj , Yacef Sa\u00e2di and Jean Martin who was the only professional actor . The Battle of Algiers was inspired by the 1962 book Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger, an FLN military commander's account of the campaign, by Saadi Yacef . Yacef wrote the book while he was held as a prisoner of the French , and it served to boost morale for the FLN and other militants . After independence, the French released Yacef , who became a leader in the new government. The Algerian government backed adapting Yacef's memoir as a film . Salash Baazi , an FLN leader who had been exiled by the French, approached Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas with the project . To meet the demands of film, The Battle of Algiers uses composite characters and changes the names of certain persons . For example , Colonel Mathieu is a composite of several French counterinsurgency officers , especially Jacques Massu . Saadi Yacef has said that Mathieu was based more on Marcel Bigeard , although the character is also reminiscent of Roger Trinquier . Accused of portraying Mathieu as too elegant and noble, screenwriter Franco Solinas denied that this was his intention . He said in an interview that the Colonel is \"elegant and cultured, because Western civilization is neither inelegant nor uncultured\". For The Battle of Algiers , Pontecorvo and cinematographer Marcello Gatti filmed in black and white and experimented with various techniques to give the film the look of newsreel and documentary film . The effect was so convincing that American releases carried a notice that \"not one foot\" of newsreel was used.\n\nPontecorvo's use of fictional realism enables the movie \"to operate along a double-bind as it consciously addresses different audiences\" . The film makes special use of television in order to link western audiences with images they are constantly faced with that are asserted to express the \"truth\". The film seems to be filmed through the point of view of a western reporter, as telephoto lenses and hand-held cameras are used, whilst \"depicting the struggle from a 'safe' distance with French soldiers placed between the crowds and camera\" .\n\nLa battaglia di Algeri (1966) is an excellent film which makes most political films seem intellectual by comparison in its use o of non-professional actors , realistic violence , gritty cinematography and a boldly propagandistic sense of social outrage . The motion picture was competently directed by Gillo Pontecorvo . Although Gillo made fewer than 20 films , he is regarded as one of Italy's greatest directors . He moved to France in 1938 to escape Italy's fascist racial laws . He eventually returned to Italy and led a Resistance brigade during WWII. After the war, he studied chemistry and worked as a journalist before becoming a film director; he started out making documentaries . His first feature film was \u00a8The Wide Blue Road\u00a8. Pontecorvo was born into a Jewish family , as he directed \u00a8Kapo\u00a8 that was one of the first films about the theme of Jewish holocaust and one of the more realistic in its recreation . Gillo subsequently directed this successful \u00a8Battle of Algiers\u00a8 and \u00a8Queimada\u00a8 with Marlon Brando and his final feature movie : \u00a8Ogro\u00a8 , later on , he made Documentaries and Shorts . This \u00a8The Battle of Algiers\u00a8 won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for three Academy Awards (in non-consecutive years, a unique achievement) : Best Foreign Language Film in 1967, and Best Screenplay (Gillo Pontecorvo and Franco Solinas) and Best Director (Gillo Pontecorvo) in 1969."

It is however, the gripping presentation of a reality into a thoroughly convincing and believable portrayal of that reality that grabs the audiences attention, giving it longevity, linking it to future conflicts, keeping it relevant. It leaves you questioning what you would have done under the same or similar circumstance, while juggling the difference in semantics between freedom fighter and terrorist and considering the situational similarities that currently exist in the world today."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1954, the National Liberation Front of Algiers shots many French policemen beginning a movement for the independence of their country; in return, the Chief of Police plants a bomb in the Arab quarter, killing many dwellers. The NLF sends three women with bombs to two bars and the Air France office in the European quarter, killing many people. The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command. In 1962, the Algerians finally achieve their aimed independence.\n\n\"La Battaglia di Algeri\" is a powerful and impressive masterpiece about the fight that happened in Algiers in the period between 1954 and 1962 between the Algerian resistance and the French military forces. A couple of months ago I saw \"Mon Colonel\", another magnificent movie about this dark period of the mankind history. In both movies, we see no difference between the methods used by French in Algerian, or the Nazis in World War II, or the South American's dictatorships in the 60's, 70's and 80's, or by the American in Iraq, of the Chinese in Tibet. \"Liberty, Fraternity, Equality for us, but torture and abuse of the human rights for the others\" should be the correct sentence applicable to most nations. Therefore the writing of Machiavelli in \"The Prince\" about the behavior of the \"princes\" along history could be updated to the disrespect of human rights by powerful nations against weakest ones in the name of their best interests. This movie is impressive because it seems to be a documentary, with grainy cinematography and non-professional actors, in a perfect contemporary Neorealism. I am not familiar with the work of director Gillo Pontecorvo, but I really believe that this movie is his masterpiece. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Batalha de Argel\" (\"The Battle of Algiers\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's *The Battle of Algiers* is an even-handed account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought, perhaps simple-mindedly, that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all, the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again -- via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3-disc (!) edition -- did nothing to alter my opinion, though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM even-handed.\n\nIn two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu, a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran, now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises, and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for \"identification\". Everybody admires a good soldier, and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool, world-weary, competent, tactically brilliant, not above admiring his enemies, sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor, also, and Martin gets all the good lines in *The Battle of Algiers*, which is really unfortunate, because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that, in my opinion, prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col. Mathieu damn near unbalances the whole thing when he irrupts into the movie about a half-hour into it.\n\nThe problem is that there are no equally compelling Muslim figures in the film to balance off Mathieu. Jaffar, played by the above-mentioned real-life FLN leader Saadi Yacef, is an important character to the plot yet has no interiority. The young man playing the fiery \"Ali La Pointe\" LOOKS magnificent, but the script doesn't do much for him, other than to tell him to look angry. We don't get to know the three women who tart themselves up as French sophisticates in order to sneak past the checkpoints so that they can plant bombs in civilian areas. The teenage boys who shoot the gendarmes to death are just faces in the crowd. Pontecorvo's magisterial Neo-Realism manages to be both dry and diabolically partisan: after all, a nameless mass of people avoids having character flaws, and Pontecorvo and Yacef don't want to muddy the waters with unlikeable individuals. (But perhaps we don't want that either, as the Algerians' cause is eminently just.) If you want to be politically correct, you may congratulate Pontecorvo for refusing to present the Muslims in a traditionally melodramatic way, but this approach fails the test of great drama: development of character.\n\nHaving said all that, I also don't want to be misconstrued: *The Battle of Algiers* is a great and important film that is an almost mandatory viewing experience, given the shocking and scandalous similarities between what's going on in Arabia right now and the events of the Algerian uprising depicted in this film. It appears that officials at the Pentagon screened this movie for themselves a couple of years ago: one hopes that the scenes of torture in *The Battle of Algiers* didn't give them some kinky ideas for Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, though it's rather hard to imagine what other uses they could get out of the movie (besides, of course, the obvious lesson: don't mess with the Muslims). The scenes of torture, terrorism, and the loud clamoring for freedom will alternately raise blood pressures and stoke outrage, regardless of an individual's political bias. The cinematography by Marcello Gatti is a culmination of Neo-Realist and cinema-verite techniques, and the score by Ennio Morricone is groundbreaking.\n\nMake an effort to see *The Battle of Algiers*; it will truly pay off. No film released in the Sixties has more relevance for us today than this one. 7 stars out of 10."

Based on the Algerian revolution of 1962. But the grit and grim of this film never brought me to sympathize for the rebel Algerians. I never managed to be won over by the \"others\".

As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul.

First time I have ever seen that.\n\nIt was nominated in 1967 for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to A Man and a Woman; and was nominated again in 1969, when Gillo Pontecorvo was nominated for Best Director, and he was nominated along with Franco Solinas for Screenplay.\n\nIt shows up on many Top Ten lists as it illustrates the timeless march of men fighting for their basic human rights and freedom. It could be a film about the West Bank or Afghanistan, or any other locale where men struggle to be free. It just happened here to occur in Algeria. This is a timeless film about freedom and the horrors of war.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of this film is how real it looks and feels. This is done without using stock footage. It was filmed that way, and presents a picture of war that is hard to stomach. It will make all other so-called \"war movies\" seem like cartoons.\n\nJean Martin as Col. Mathieu was outstanding, especially when he was defending the use of Bush-Cheney tactics to defeat the Algerians.\n\nOne has to realize watching this film that the Algerians didn't like being occupied by the French any more than the French like being occupied by the Nazis or Iraq likes being occupied by America."

But it has a strong narrative drive, and it consistently held my interest. Even though you know how it all turns out, you didn't feel like the ending was a certainty. Of course, it is biased toward the Algerians, and there is more than a little dose of left-wing agitprop. But the French aren't portrayed as monsters, and the leader of the French forces is at least a somewhat sympathetic figure. I wish the movie had given more of an historical overview and that it discussed more what was going on in the rest of the country. But it's a solid, well-done movie worth your time. It's free now on Kanopy."

Although it does a great job in the storytelling aspect to see both sides, I cannot separate the blowing up of innocent people in the town square scenes. I know the other side to it was the bombing of the village the Muslims were at and killing innocent victims there, but it was unnerving and disturbing seeing the underhandedness of playing the system in order to kill hundreds of people in the town caf\u00e9s. Personally I thought the the scenes were shot perfectly in the use of close-ups and camera angles. The subject matter is not pleasant though."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie takes place during the Algerian independence from France. The director spent a good amount of time depicting the violence in the city of Algiers between both the French military and the Algerian National Liberation Army. It shows the tactics and strategies that both sides use to achieve their goal. Each one commits atrocities to each other. After Algerians kill random people in the street, the French retaliate by throwing bombs into random's Algerian's houses and vice versa. The violence just keeps escalating. Given that the city is neatly divided between both Algerian and French, both organizations can easily attack the other side by going to their enemy's neighborhood and randomly attacking them.\n\nI was impressed by how soon to the events the movie was made - just a few years after Algeria was independent and the war ended so that made it much more relevant. This movie is something that should be watched by military and foreign policymakers. It shows that you can win a battle but not necessarily the war. This movie is in black and white and plays like a documentary. There is no sugarcoating. The dialogue can be pretty intense, and the hate between protagonists is on full display. Some of the scenes are disturbing as well. There are some moments that just feel the same as events that happened in the last few years. The movie feels new and yet it was made almost 50 years ago. I think it was so raw, and focused on the fight that I wished the director could have explored the characters more."

Some of it's themes echoes what is happening in real life, such as between Palestine/ Israel, Northern Ireland/ England to name two when one ethnic group can't settle their differences with another creating extreme radicalism by using physical, perhaps unnecessary 'violence' by using terrorist acts! Like the IRA of Northern Ireland- the Arabs in Algeria also started the FLN (National Liberation Front) either to retaliate or as retribution against the French, using some actual 'news' footage's on specific parts of this film! Groundbreaking and influential because of stating history which is similar to films such as \"Sunday, Bloody, Sunday\", \"The Kite Runner\", \"Cry Freedom\" to name a few! Although, I may have been ignorant about Algerian history and very appreciative to have seen this since it's unbiased, my rating might've been much higher had it shown actual footage's about what French governments or any other had to say 'verbally' about the hostility."

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a true-life event, they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.\n\nThe cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole, I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "1st watched 11/30/2007, 6 out of 10(Dir-Gillo Pontecorvo): Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution in the late 50's and early 60's from France's occupied police-rule. This is one of those movies that takes you places American audiences aren't used to seeing and brings you a perspective that is sometimes hard to swallow. This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us, it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflict(it's really not a typical battle) at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics, but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs, but not without many casualties. This realistic, documentary-like movie does not back away from actual violence and it's after-effects, but keeps us interested with a linear American-like story. There is definitely a little lacking in the portrayal of the characters at the expense of the story but overall it keeps your interest. The movie is definitely not like most battles, but instead is a calculated series of incidents done by both sides until someone has to give in. Eventually the French find all the leaders in the rebellion in the city, but the rebellion leaks to the countryside where it wins out in 1962. Again, the interest of this movie for me was learning a new society, it's history and it's ways more so than seeing an action-filled movie experience."

There were many scenes that were a little hard to watch because of all the people that were killed in the bombings while living their everyday lives. It was interesting to see how many men and women join together to seek revenge against another group. The director cleverly uses imagery to make the viewers see the insight of a terrorist mind. The attacks and battles are insane among one another, accusations towards the innocent. It was an interesting film to watch if you enjoy battle and war films. I personally don't do well in sitting still in these type of films but I did understand what the director portrays. I only recommend this film if you enjoy learning about history and wars."

Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo made this film with a bit of distance between the French-Algerian War post World War II. Pontecorvo skillfully uses documentary footage to blend in nicely with the story he shot. You think you are getting an inside look at the war.\n\nLooking back this seems so ludicrous. Post the Napoleonic age France's colonial expansion took her to North Africa just across the Mediterranean and between Morocco, Tunisia, and the countries carved out of French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa she had one large chunk of the continent. By degree and somewhat hurried by the end of World War II. Except for Algeria and particularly Algiers it's capital city on the coast. For some inexplicable reason the French took a proprietary interest in the place and would not let it go.\n\nNo hearts and minds were won by the French among the Moslem population. Especially after use of torture. Why they just didn't let them go with the rest is beyond me.\n\nThe Algerian story is told from the point of view of freedom figter Braham Hadjaji. The French point of view is covered from high ranking officer Jean Martin. Martin's attitudes are frightening as his sense of propriety concerning Algiers.\n\nThis is one great film with a lot of lessons to be learned about neo-colonialism."

So, when I heard this way made by the Algerian government, I was expecting a typically biased propaganda film. I was wrong - very wrong.\n\nThis is one of the most realistic war films I have ever seen. It is made even more impressive by the fact that it was made in the 60's, before big budget Hollywood effects, and it was made in what was, at the time, a third world country. It is also realistic in the fact that there is not set \"good\" or \"bad\". It shows that in war, everyone must go to extreme measures, trying constantly to top the enemy's gruesome acts. The scene when the suicide bombers know they are about to kill some of their own people along with the French is stunning.\n\nThe characters are very well acted as well. This could be due to that fact that the film was made right after the revolution, so it was still fresh in their memories. I suppose I am probably biased, because this film tells the story of my ancestors country, but I'm sure most non-Algerians could agree that it is a very important film in this new world we live in. I rank it with Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket as the best war films I have ever seen. And I have seen a LOT of war films."

A cinema classic that is frequently mentioned in several lists of the best films of all time, including the consecrated list, chosen every 10 years, by the BFI ( British Film Institute) which was voted precisely this year and in which it ranked 45th.\n\nIt portrays the struggle of the Algerian National Liberation Front for Algerian independence in its capital Algiers, from 1954 to 1957. It also portrays the respective strategic military response of the French, apparently managing to restore colonialist control by defeating the FLN. Meanwhile the seeds of revolution were sown and the population revolted en masse forcing the French political regime to grant independence in 1960.\n\nThe film results in an unavoidable historical document, but made with great mastery with a very sagacious cinematography in the use of long plans and close-ups, always with mastery and counting on great performances from the main actors. I also highlight the way in which, approaching a theme with extreme violence, there is the artistic choice of commitment in its exhibition. Resulting perhaps even with greater impact than if it showed gratuitous violence.\n\nIt's an excellent film, a classic that I highly recommend."

It doesn't romanticize the Algerian fighters and their tactics. We see as them bomb civilians and gun them down in the streets. On the French side, their forces systematically torture those they capture in order to gain information. The parallels with more recent historical events are easy to see.\n\nOverall, the film stares down the sheer brutality and human cost of such asymmetrical conflicts. Both sides use deplorable means, France to maintain its colony, the FLN fighters to achieve independence for their country. Civilians caught in the crossfire suffer at the hands of both sides. It's a powerful viewing experience that leaves you to ponder many a political question."

Its ideas have long since been absorbed into mainstream film -- recent topical examples include \"Red Dawn\" and \"The Siege\". Today, we expect a narrative game with the viewer; there's none to be had here, just an ugly reminder of the end days of European colonialism.\n\nUnfortunately, historical revisionists seize on this as 'evidence' of Western hegemony and injustice - as if Islam never occupied and forced into dhimmitude major tracts of Europe for centuries. Or as if Islam never harried Mediterranean Christians and enslaved them in vast numbers (Americans, too, among them - remember our war with the Barbary coast over this issue - enshrined in the 'shores of Tripoli' from the Marines' Hymn). Or as if armed intervention wasn't necessary to decisively turn that tide in the West's favor. The fact that Europeans/Americans can criticize themselves in film, but Arab Muslims will never direct criticism at themselves speaks to the deeply inherent cultural superiority of the West, and tends to make us stronger."

The French ultimately catch up with the Algerians in brutality, and the camera fairly clearly sympathizes with the latter, but the film makes no real attempt to evaluate the justice of the rebel's demands or the necessity of their resorting to terrorist methods.\n\nThe viewer who does not begin with the notion that anyone connected to a colonial power deserves to be killed is left inclined to sympathize with the French, simply because most of the murders in the first hour or so of the film are committed by the Algerians, but one assumes that the story leading up to the first terrorist attacks would provide some justification for them. Not seeing the history, one can't judge."

        "review_title": "Captivating and compelling; superbly well made - and all too relevant",
        "review_detailed_main": "What a striking, powerful, disturbing film, and one that continues to be all too relevant. Few are those titles to come to mind across all genres in which the active narrative is more or less imparted from the perspective of the antagonists and concludes with the defeat of the sympathetic party; if we're lucky we'll at least get an afterword that informs the protagonists' struggle wasn't in vain. And for all those works of past eras that speak directly to living history and continuing geopolitical, sociopolitical, and cultural issues, I can't immediately think of any of the latter bent save for this. It's noteworthy and in no way accidental that though a select few characters are spotlighted, representations or amalgamations of real-life figures from the period depicted, the actors are at most secondary and are here only to serve the story. That story, presented in stark black and white and with another timeless, often underhandedly haunting score from Ennio Morricone, is terrifyingly appropriate nearly sixty years on: the tale of an extreme differential of power in which colonizers and occupational forces are faced with the struggle for liberty, independence, and self-determination by those whose land they illegitimately claim. Both sides commit ugly acts of violence, yet those who benefit from the lion's share of that power differential - while presenting a false face of freedom, peace, order, and moral rectitude - are both deadlier and more indiscriminate with their acts, and at the same time actively forsake any notion of ethics or humanity, and use past heroism or victimization (specifically, resistance against or detention by the Nazis) as if it were a shield that could protect them from the abominable, blatant hypocrisy of now being the unquestionable villains.\n\nSound familiar? This is the story of 'The Battle of Algiers,' a barely fictionalized account of a part of the Algerian fight for independence for France, but change the setting and people and we could just as well be watching a movie about any similar struggle, set in any time, even now in 2024. That the saga herein is so identifiable and relatable makes it extra absorbing and harrowing; the viewing experience is marginally softened only by the fact that we know Algeria ultimately succeeded and became her own nation, as the last seconds emphasize. Every choice made along the way in shaping this feature is marvelously sharp, if not brilliant. That black and white presentation makes the gnawing tension, the fine acting, and the excellent stunts, effects, and action sequences feel all the more pure and vivid, and impactful in turn. Morricone was one of the greatest film composers to ever live and his work here is highly engaging and memorable as it complements the visuals; some moments are utterly stellar. Everyone in the cast, largely non-professionals, give superb performances that come across as achingly real and believable - a verisimilitude perhaps bolstered by the fact that some were indeed accordingly active agents in the Algerian fight against French settlers and occupiers. Between the root story of Franco Solinas and filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo and Solinas' subsequent screenplay, adapting Saadi Yacef's firsthand account of then-recent events, and Pontecorvo's oversight as director, on paper and in execution the picture really does feel like a reenactment in which we as viewers are thrown right in the the action. The dialogue could be ripped from any modern-day video; the characters are shrewdly penned with utmost determination and tenacity; for good and for ill the scene writing is vibrant and compelling, just as the narrative at large keeps us firmly locked in. Between Pontecorvo's direction and Marcello Gatti's cinematography we're often given the effect of feeling as if we're right there on the street, or looking down on events from a window at which we're witting, while at other points the presentation really does come off as a near-perfect replication of a documentary or newsreel. The result is all but dazzling.\n\nIt would be enough for 'The Battle of Algiers to relate these events of the 50s and 60s; it would be enough to zero in even more particularly on those themes and ideas that are echoed in every similar struggle of resistance, rebellion, and defiance against looming titans, entrenched powers, and fascists. It would be enough for the movie to boast action, or fierce drama, or the legacy of fantastic music, or smart direction or cinematography. 'The Battle of Algiers' instead does all these things, and more, and is therefore captivating, deeply satisfying, and at length, frankly essential. Given the subject matter and the violence it's not always the easiest title to watch, but if these are not obstacles to exploring cinema, I can hardly recommend this any more fervently. Immensely engrossing, thought-provoking, and stirring and even inspiring - and not least of all given those topics of real life to which it speaks, infuriating - this is a tremendous classic that holds up stupendously, and maybe too well. As far as I'm concerned this is a flick that's worth going out of your way to see, and it would be a mistake to pass up any opportunity to watch."

It primarily follows one of the FLN leaders and the French Colonel who led the paratroopers brought in to crush a general strike and to \"behead\" the FLN leadership.\n\nColonel Philippe Mathieu (Jean Martin) leads the paratroops against the FLN leaders in Algiers, who include El-Hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag). The tactics of both sides are shown realistically but not excessively graphically. These include bombings and assassinations by the FLN and violence against demonstrators by the French paratroopers. Captured second-tier FLN fighters receive \"enhanced interrogation\" that is more hinted at than shown, and some suffer death by suicide. Threats to blow up the houses in which the FLN is hiding are made and carried out.\n\nAlthough fictional, some have described the film as a documentary on urban guerrilla warfare. Its style, black-and-white photography, and great use of cast extras underscore this sense. The film's final minutes describe how the larger Algerian War played out.\n\nThis film is significant historically, though its cinematic effects are not especially strong by modern standards. The acting is OK but somewhat flat, given the documentary style."

And yet the movie is not about the fight against terrorism. Or, it is, but it's also about the fight against foreign invaders and occupiers.\n\nThe film is noted both for its style as well as its neutrality. A bit more time is spent with the FLN, but we also see much of the events from the point of view of Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the leader of the French forces. And both these sides commit terrible acts of brutality during their fight for Algiers. Bombings, mass slaughter, torture, everything goes.\n\nAnd apparently all this happened in the 50s, on French-controlled soil. Shows how much I know about history. In fact, the movie almost forces you to know something about its backgrounds and general situation. Very little is explained and it's more of a newsreel slash documentary style look into the methods used by the two sides. Very little is talked about motivations or politics. Which is both of a strength and a weakness. Those that have studied history in detail and/or those that lived during those times are going to find the film poignant and heavy. Those that did not will have an increasingly hard time with it as years pass.\n\nNevertheless, despite belonging to the latter camp of viewers, I did find the film a good watch. It's perhaps more interesting than truly enjoyable, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in history."

This is as intimate as any film about warfare is ever able to get.The focus is on guerilla warfare and its practitioners. There are is no glory or machismo involved, these are authentically frightened people driven from political protest to suicide tactics.Rather than being able to confront the enemy face on the N.L.F. spend most of their time hiding in disused buildings, using children as bomb-runners, and fleeing from soldiers disguised as women. When the occupying French forces are fleshed out they are either insouciant and world weary, as with Jean Martin's Colonel, or simply teenagers on their National service and anxious to get home. The political focus of the film is on the science of revolution; propaganda, counter-propaganda, determinism, etc. Therefore the viewer is not stirred or moved by the film but rather hit with the fact that certain conflicts are irreconcilable and there is nothing to be done about it. In this sense it is one of very few films with a Marxist concious that will ever hope to reach a mass audience. One brief technichal difficulty lies in the excessive use of real outdoor photography bleaches the majority of the screen white, and therefore makes the subtitles at times difficult to read. However it remains one of films most implacably well informed films of conflict."

        "review_detailed_main": "All I want to add is some more background behind the conflict. Again the main source is Alistair Horne's book \"A savage war of peace\". Alistair Horne wrote a trilogy of books on 20th century French history incorporating Verdun, the fall of France in 1940 and the Algerian war. Although Britain also had an empire it seemed to be able to extricate itself from it in a less bloody manner and those colonies that did see conflict did not see the kind of bloodshed France experienced in Vietnam and Algeria. I think Britain was able to see that the concept of empire was politically, militarily, economically and morally unviable. The French did not seem to see it that way. Alistair Horne wrote that the French seemed to think that if the rebellion was repressed they could carry on ruling Algeria like Ian Smith's Rhodesia or apartheid era South Africa, a totally unrealistic option. I suppose all whites have to accept that attitudes were much more racist in that era which explains a lot. Also I suspect that after the humiliation of 1940 the French military were determined to win a battle. What is not generally known is that most of the Free French troops that fought in Italy and France in 1943/45 were from French north Africa. The brutal battle of Cassino in Italy was brought to a conclusion by these colonial troops making an outflanking manoeuvre over mountainous terraine. Most of the troops liberating Paris were colonial. The natives were liberating the mother country and many of them later led the FLN. French dissatisfaction with the ongoing war led in 1958 to General Charles De Gaulle being called out of 12 years of retirement. Most Frenchmen expected De Gaulle to crush the FLN but De Gaulle was a statesman not a 3rd rate politician and could see that long term France had to let Algeria go. When this became clear the French military in Algeria felt betrayed and astonishly tried to stage a coup d'etat in mainland France. It failed of course and many rebel officers went underground and formed a terrorist group called the OAS which murdered people in both mainland France and Algeria. The coup attempt was a PR disaster and most French people now wanted out of Algeria.\n\nAs independence for Algeria approached the OAS atrocities in the country made the situation untenable for the white colonist population after majority rule arrived. A million white colonists, many born and bred in Algeria fled for mainland France abandoning everything they owned and worked for in an incredible mass exodus. It was a retreat for western civilisation as villages and churches were abandoned to decay to be consumed by the majority Muslim culture. The OAS continued their campaign of terror in France, attempting to assassinate De Gaulle. And this of course inspired Frederick Forsythe to write the book \"The Day of the Jackal\", later a film. So whilst I feel sorry for the colonists who lost everything, their advocacy of \"Algerie Francais\" against a tide of De-colonisation was un-realistic and un-workable and led France and Algeria into a brutal and costly conflict. Fortunatly France was able to call on a man of the calibre of Charles De Gaulle who was able to convince the nation of the unpalatable truth, end the war and take France forward."

        "review_detailed_main": "When 'La Battaglia di Algeri {The Battle of Algiers}' premiered in the United States in 1967, it carried a disclaimer, assuring the audience that \"not one foot\" of actual newsreel footage was used in the compilation of the film. This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentary-realism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries, and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anti-colonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage; surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians, is jostled by the crowd, reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire, and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score, composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone.\n\n'The Battle of Algiers' recreates the Algerian War of Independence, from November 1954 to December 1960, focusing entirely on the capital city of Algiers. Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France, a selection of determined civilians (Brahim Hagiag, Yacef Saadi \u0096 the latter playing a fictional version of himself) form the National Liberation Front (FLN), who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers, led by Colonel Mathieu (believed to be a combination of real-life officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu, and played by Jean Martin). In a bid to combat the frequent street-bombs and police officer shootings, Mathieu employs any possible means, including lynch mobs, murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple: \"should we remain in Algeria? If you answer \"yes,\" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.\"\n\nAnother element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause (an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government), it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my post-September 11/Bali bombings mentality coming through, but, having entered the film without any background knowledge, I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers, hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly, caf\u00e9-bombing terrorists. Unlike other seemingly-similar revolution pictures (such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925)'), 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda: every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat; every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clear-cut heroes and villains here; everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful."

The military wanted a way to make its generals understand the actions the people they were going to fight were taking. While it might still be hard to understand why people would resort to terrorist actions, this movie does prove to be a very useful tool in getting people to realize what can drive people to consider going down that road.\n\nThe movie tells the story of Algeria's road to independence from France in the early 1960's and was filmed in a documentary style, making it hard to remember sometimes that the image we see on the screen is only a reenactment of actual events. In fact, some of the main people who actively participated in the revolution acted in this movie, reliving events from their past.\n\nI grew up in a country that experienced terror attacks like the ones that are shown in the movie on an almost regular basis. Seeing scenes like the bombing of the discotheque or the bar hit a little too close to home for me, bringing up memories of similar images from popular hangouts in my home town. But it also made me see the other side of those attacks, the side that I never saw in those images from my childhood. I can't say that I condone the use of violence or the killing of innocent people, but watching the movie and what the people of Algiers went through that made them choose that path, made me understand the other side of terror a little better.\n\nThe documentary style of this movie doesn't show one side or another as the right one. It gives you the facts of what happened, and how it ended. And this is the greatness of this movie. It doesn't take sides, it just lets you see things for how they were, and lets you decide which one you want to identify with."

One of the lesser known signatories is Jean Martin, an actor who had fought in the French Resistance and served as a paratrooper in Indochina. Putting his name to the Manifesto cost him his job at the Theatre National Populaire.\n\nSupremely ironic that six years later he was to be cast by Gillo Pontecorvo as Colonel Mathieu who is assigned the task of crushing Algerian insurgency. Ironic also is the supposed difficulty experienced by the director in toning down Martin's performance so that he would not stand out among the cast of non-professionals.\n\nOne of the high profile signatories was Jean-Paul Sartre who is cleverly referred to in the film. When Mathieu is asked by a journalist if he likes Sartre he replies: \"Not really, but I like him even less as an opponent\".\n\nTo the average cinema-goer the length and content of this film are daunting to say the least whereas to those who recognise film as the seventh art it is an undisputed masterpiece. Essential of course to have one's moral compass handy for although Pontecorvo claimed he had made a 'politically neutral' film, as an avowed Marxist there is absolutely no doubt as to where his sympathies lay and its undeniable influence on the tactics of terrorist groups has guaranteed its controversial status.\n\nInspired by the memoirs of Saadi Jacef who appears in the film as an FLN leader, this is shot in a neo-realist, semi-documentary style strongly reminiscent of Rossellini's 'Rome, open City'.\n\nTechnically it is nigh on faultless with its haunting soundtrack, composition of shots, superb editing and one of Ennio Morricone's most evocative scores.\n\nBanned in France for four years, it has been consistently praised by critics, heaped with awards and made a deep impression on directors, notably Stanley Kubrick.\n\nHistorically of course it has cast an even greater shadow as nations are forced to come to terms with and face the consequences of their colonial past.\n\nIt must be said however that the world has since seen a seismic shift in attitudes towards politically engendered violence and it is now virtually impossible to justify the unjustifiable."

Some people have to be careful to compare that war for independence with terrorism ..etc . You have to read history to understand!\n\nWe have seen in the movie when the french started bombing civilians in the casbah (this is real terrorism) which was the beginning of series of attacks between the two parts.\n\nI'm algerian and my parents and relatives lived in Algeria that time, I can tell you, you have to live it to know what's occupation, war and suffering! and I think what I saw in \"the battle of Algiers\" is worst!.\n\nI especially admire Larbi Ben M'hidi which is one of the most important leaders of the algerian liberation revolution, a man who has a good vision , who believed in the freedom of Algeria and sacrificed himself for it, even the french who tortured him, they recognized his incredible courage and that he is a rare person.\n\nThe DVD is available now, you have to see it, there are many extra and many reactions/opinions of many people, Yassef Saadi, Pontecorvo, ex-french soldiers and officials , American officials..etc\n\nGood movie :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had for a long time misgivings about \"La Battaglia di Algeri\". Even being one of the milestones of the political film, I thought that it employed the traditional means used by the genre, that is, \"objectivity\", speeches where people tell what they are fighting for, loads of facts, not forgetting to add some \"human\" element (maybe some romance, children , family, whatever..) to try to make the whole more digestible. But I was really mistaken! \"La Battaglia di Algeri\" is a sober but deeply moving film. It portrays the fight of the Algerian people against the french for their freedom. Even if the film tries not to take sides, it is clear from the beginning that the french (short of employing nazi or israeli tactics) were fighting a losing battle, because they were fighting against a rising nation.\n\nThe film describes the first beginnings of the FLN (front of national liberation) in 1954, how it grows from a small group of people to an organized movement and eventually wins the Algerian people to their side. The escalation of violence on both sides - the FLN organizing terrorist attacks in restaurants, airport, on the streets, that leave many casualties and the french police and army replying with bombings, torture and trigger-happy shootings on the streets. After each french repression shock, singing, shouting and cries for freedom arise from the arab quarters. Women, children, peddlers, merchants, people old and new, are behind the FLN fighters and do everything they can to help in the war against the french.\n\nWe follow the film through some characters on the Algerian and french side. There's no demonizing of either side. We can even understand Coronel Mathieu (commander of the french paratroopers) and his views.\n\nAll in all it is an excellent film. I had a very hazy notion about the Algerian war for independence, and I didn't feel like reading a book and swallowing tons of facts in order to inform myself about the subject. Now I've got a living, emotional knowledge about it. Thanks to \"La Battaglia di Algeri\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most war movies are peopled by overgrown children, or technicians, or cartoon heroes and villains. \"The Battle of Algiers\" is nearly alone in its fully believable depiction of adults at a particular time and place being molded by wartime experience. Only \"Band of Brothers,\" in my opinion and to my knowledge, is worthy of comparison. In the other direction, the formulaic leftism and phony pretensions to knowingness in Pontecorvo's \"Queimada\" result, I guess, from its subservience to the director's thoughts rather than close contact with real events.\n\n\"Algiers\" is a more complete film than \"Brothers,\" showing the battle, if not the entire war, from inception to results, from the perspectives of the all the main combatants and bystanders. This is possible because the historical conflict was more circumscribed, and, despite its documentary feel, because \"Algiers\" has more fictionalization, such as combining several real people into one character and inventing others. Nevertheless, and with the provisos that there are honest debates and I am no expert, fundamental strategy and character have not been essentially falsified.\n\nThe movie opens near the end of the battle, with a chillingly unexaggerated torture of a FLN rebel by the French army, and then proceeds to the beginning. \"Algiers\" shows a city that is largely either French and bourgeois, or Moslem and proletarian. Not comfortably so. The French have a professional army, but are in a demographically precarious position. Among the Moslems, socialism and secularism are in the air a bit. Most people fear being caught on the losing side, and try to wait and see. Consequentially, small numbers can tip the balance of power. Terrorism and threat of later reprisal are used to force people off or onto the fence. The rationale for the French strategy of policing and torture is also carefully laid out.\n\n\"Algiers\" has a neither sentimentalized nor over-cynical understanding of human nature, and is very good at bringing alive the vagaries of charisma and public moods. At stake are lives, and ideology, and religion. The characters have thought hard about what is achievable, and what they are willing to sacrifice to win or survive. Appalling as are torture and random slaughter of innocents, by the end we have seen enough through the eyes of both sides to grasp how they came about.\n\nIn the closing scene, the FLN's loss of the battle is juxtaposed with its later winning of the war in a way that suggests that France's loss was the logical result of France's brutality. But the intervening period is not depicted, and, to the movie's credit, causation is not clearer than in life. With hindsight, which includes the knowledge that the FLN's current extremely brutal war against an Islamist rebellion has worked, we can see that effectiveness of tactics depends on many details. Even though we know the history, the movie's tension is genuine because the outcome was not preordained."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic history. Unarguably the leader of its genre - war/politics - each frame of this masterpiece is cinemagic.\n\nBased on Saadi Yacef's biased memoirs, but done in a much more neutral manner by Italian communist filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo, this has a marked Neorealistic influence stamped on it. From the opening frame when an Algerian is tortured into revealing the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe and the movement of the paramilitary into the casbah to nab/kill the FLN leader, you'll know this is the real McCoy. There gritty realism, the amazing crowd scenes, the hustle-bustle, squalor and beauty of the Casbah weave a cinematic magic.\n\nThe bulk of the action takes place during the eventful year of 1957 in what started out as a gentlemen's war but eventually degenerated into all out civilian bombings when the French played dirty by planting a bomb in the casbah. The FLN retaliation is swift and brilliantly executed - disturbing though it is. The tactics used by the FLN and French Army as shown in this film have been studied for years by various terrorist organizations (especially the PLO) and by governments (including the Pentagon).\n\nThere are so many wonderful moments in this film that you get sucked into another world, another time from the word Go! It is wonderfully watchable and intelligent at the same time. The dialogue is superb too - especially Ben MHidi's \"Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets.\" In real life, the vastly experienced Ben MHidi - an elder of the movement - was in his early 30's when he \"committed suicide\" so that gives you an idea of the youth of the FLN support base.\n\nUnmissable!!!"

Soon, he finds that a petty criminal has been recruited to fight against the colonisers. This is a film based on true events: the war between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front from 1954 to 1962, which led to Algeria gaining its independence from France-an important decolonization war characterised by guerrilla warfare, maquis fighting, and the use of torture by both sides. It is a highly dramatic film shot in a documentary reel style with non-actors. Its achievement was not only the power of the storyline and narrative but also its effect of appearing as truth stylistically. No stock news footage was used, which is astonishing for the realism it succeeded in depicting. As an aside, the failure to win \"hearts and minds\" was considered important material by some involved in the consideration of the outcome of the War on Terror in Iraq and perhaps even highly prescient. Its value has increased from a historical point of view because those involved in the actual skirmishes and conflicts will no doubt have seen the film differently in 1966."

Recognized for the accurate settings, use of everyday people, and realistic scenes and action, the film is highly regarded in the industry. Stars Brahim Hadjadj and Jean Martin as the resisitance and the colonizing force. Because there are so many extras being used in various roles, some of it is over the top. They talk about the casbah, which we know from Algiers, made in 1938, is dangerous, and off limits to most people not born there. Much talk of the FLN, the Front Liberation Nationale, the name of the resistance group, testing new members, and carrying out the actions to free themselves of french rule. Because it was actually filmed in various locations in algeria, we get a great sense of the scenery , even ten years later. It's over two hours long, and gets a bit repetitious. Probably could have been done in a shorter time. A telling moment when the arab women remove their burkas and change their hair and appearance to plant bombs around town, as french women. Up to that point, they had really been following the arabian customs for appearance and propriety. Very well done. The torture scenes get pretty rough, so not for the children! Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. Some weirdness over the academy awards... nominated for best foreign film of 1967, and was also nominated for best director and best writing in 1969."

        "review_title": "as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some",
        "review_detailed_main": "A couple of times here and there watching Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, winner of the 1966 Golden Lion at Venice, I thought off-handedly (maybe with a smidgen of sarcasm), 'this is probably one of the top 5 favorite films of like Rage Against the Machine or something'. It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.\n\nBut what struck me most about how Pontecorvo and his collaborators (both screenwriter and producer as the latter of which had complete first hand contact with the events and plays an acting part), is how he approached violence and its effect on an urban climate. Through Pontecorvo's camera, we see the ugly side to both sides, even the one that we should be rooting for. France is the (supposedly unintentional) oppressor here, and in this time frame had made them a colonial power for decades, and in order to sustain order and track down their 'targets' in 1957 they go from complete militarization (shown quite starkly and simply, and like a good would-be neorealist 'as it is if we are right there') to torture tactics. Their acts of violence and brutality are however given the other side of the coin in the scenes where the lieutenant Colonel of the French troops Matthieu (played by the great Jean Martin) talks to the press or lays out his point of view in scenes. Then the other side of the Algiers, those who are fighting back early on in the film with guerrilla-like terrorist tactics go to lengths to make their messages clear through seemingly random but daunting acts of violence. Pontecorvo's point in showing both sides is almost complex while seeming simple- neither side is right when it comes to committing violence against one another in this situation. It's a very powerful statement made that doesn't cut corners, of the truth that still permeates of a first-world power, already very adept in their military powers from past (proud) military conflicts who can't seem to let up from giving the people they say they want to help and provide some leeway in establishing their own government and freedom despite the fervent opposition. Sound familiar?\n\nAt any rate, the real success behind this message- which could've been done on the flip-side with a lot of pumped melodrama- is by making it a kind of hybrid of doc and fiction. Unlike Memories of Underdevelopment, which would come out 2 years after this in Cuba, it's never exactly certain when the footage is even dramatized or not. And there are two aspects to what Pontecorvo covers in his purely cinematic style that totally serves his content. One is how he deals with crowds, with the dirty city life of the Arab section of Algiers where all the madness, chaos, and just frustration takes place, in range from the scenes of people walking by in burkas to reveal themselves as the \"enemy\" with guns, to those startling sequences of the revolutions and multi-militant post. The other one is how Pontecorvo deals with his 'subjects', as one might call them, as they are all save for one non-actors. Like directors before him (mentioned above) and after (like Fernando Meirelles) the filmmaker here is after the right look on people, and in going almost as a bystander at times getting these people. The guy playing La Pointe- the center of the film (an illiterate petty criminal turned major terrorist)- isn't particularly 'good', but he doesn't need to be. His face tells all. In maybe my favorite scene in the film, when a female from the Algiers section sneaks into a quasi-dance hall in the European section, we get various shots of the faces of the patrons as well as her own. None are professional, which obviously adds to the complexities of this scene. Who's innocent and who's guilty in this world?\n\nSometimes there are some very brutal moments in the film, and then there are others that sometimes even work just as a usual, well, thriller. Here and there I almost felt like I was watching a more recent film without taking into account how it might have influenced a few directors over time. With one of his best early scores via Ennio Morricone, and some uncompromising details with the multiple deaths in the film, The Battle of Algiers does come quite close to being one of those 'essential' films of the 1960's, where a political attitude or need to put onto film a time and place in the world was captured. And if it has at least a little relevance for some military-style situations of the now (and I am not at all anti-US, but the comparisons could be made with bits in the film) its a credit to the filmmakers that its basically the film they wanted to make, with a freedom relatable to the doomed characters on the side of Algiers."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" undoubtedly ranks among the most unique, innovative and essential war films to date. Especially because it comes entirely without the pathos, glorification, special effects and artificially created drama that crowds want to see to get some entertainment out of war. Instead the viewer gets a fresh historical scenario - the 1956/57 Algerian insurrection of the National Liberation Front (FLN) against the French colonists. Following the events laid out in the \"Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger\", a book written in prison by of one of the former FLN leaders, Yacef Saadi, it is an unvarnished account of a brutal reality that emerged as a natural consequence of colonial oppression. To add to the realism Yacef Saadi - now an Algerian senator - even plays a key part in the production.\n\nOutstanding feature of the film is that director Gillo Pontecorvo opts for a breathtakingly dramatized documentary style, a genre where he came from and clearly feels at home. The result is very close to newsreel footage, which makes it look like no other comparable war picture: Executions, demonstrations, strikes, bombings, interrogations, the house-to-house guerilla warfare look so real that Pontecorvo had to point out explicitly that not a single frame of actual documentary or news footage was used in the film. Furthermore the film stays as unbiased as possible and portrays both sides of the conflict: the rebels with the few, risky and desperate means they are capable of organizing to hurt the enemy, and the French paratroopers under Col. Mathieu striking back with unrelenting force in order to crush the FLN's backbone. The picture hasn't lost any of its relevance since the day it was made, as an uncomfortable question on both sides of a conflict arises again and again: Do the ends justify the means?"

Ali at that time 24 years old with a long criminal record is arrested and jailed for assault and while in prison he gets influenced by one of the inmates who's executed for being part of the revolt against the French occupying government.\n\nWhen he's released Ali joins the FLN and makes his way up in that organization from a spy to a soldier and then to a major leader of rebels attacking French troops and police in the Casbah section of the city of Algiers. The revolt grow from taking pot shots on the French police and military to all out attacks on dance halls restaurants bus and train depots where hundreds of French as well as Algerian civilian are killed and wounded. Also the scale of attacks on the French police and soldiers reach such a point that law and order becomes almost no-existent in Algiers as well as all of Algeria by 1957.\n\nThe French government in desperation sends in it's most seasoned troops into the country to quell the revolt led by paratroop commander Col. Mathieu, Jean Martin, a WWII as well as a Indochina war hero. The French under Mathieu go about to put down the rebel revolt almost if not even more ruthlessly as the the FLN rebels which only turns more Algerians, who were neutral, against the French. Col. Mathieu's plan is to kill or capture all the top rebel leaders and with that accomplished he feels that the revolt would be extinguished and Ali La Pointe is one of those leaders that Col. Mathieu is looking to put out of commission.\n\nThe torture of a FLN rebel pays off when he breaks down and leads to French troops under Col. Mathieu to the place where Ali is hiding and thats where we get back to the beginning of the movie. Refusing to surrender Ali and his men are blown to pieces when the French army dynamites the building that they are hold up in and with that Ali La Pointe's contribution to the Algerian revolt is over but not for those still fighting against the French.\n\nThe movie goes into the early 1960's where the revolt got to the point where the French government, in a last and desperate effort to end the bloodshed, held an open election for Algerian independence in 1962 With the vote was 91% in favor of independence on July 5, 1962, the 132nd anniversary of the French entrance into Algeria, Algeria was proclaimed a free and independent nation and thus the bloody Algerian revolt ended.\n\nGreat docudrama of one of the most defining event of the post WWII world without a single inch of actual news footage. The Algerian revolt lasted eight years and cost the French some 18,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians The loss of life among the Algerian people was astronomical being estimated a around and even over one million dead. The Algerian revolt even spilled over into France proper itself and cost some 4,000 casualties in that country in terrorist and counter-terrorist attacks.\n\n\"The Battle of Algiers\" is one of the best historical films, even though it has no news footage in it at all, ever made and is being re-issued this year, 2004, on VHS and DVD. With what's been happening in the news it's re-release couldn't be more timely,don't miss it. It will be an historical as well as emotional experience to everyone that sees it."

The Film is so real that sometimes viewer think that some scenes are original,hundreds of people marching, tanks, police and the blast scenes are very original when there was no green screens and VFX at that time, the story the performance of non-actors from directors point of view is excellent, the expressions of people, the mood, the scenario, the music its a combination of all art forms together. Gillo Pontecorvo is one of the great director in the history of film making no question about it."

The FLN arose during the war of Algeria against France. The FLN organizes terrorist attacks in restaurants, on the streets, and the airport; which lead to the French police fighting back with bombings and shooting in the streets. It depicted true events of what would have happened, but to me the actors weren't so convincing. The movie seemed to be realistic and catchy, but it left me with a hazy view on the Algerians fight for Independence. Its interesting to watch after the terrorist attacks we've received here in the U.S, to see that problems like this arise anywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow, \"The Battle of Algiers\" really could have been made today, couldn't it?\n\nI don't know if I should be comforted or disturbed that the events depicted in Gillo Pontecorvo's film so closely mirror those going on in the Middle East right now. On the one hand, it's comforting to realize that events and tensions that seem scary in the present day have been going on virtually forever, and that every generation has probably thought at some point that the world they lived in represented the human race at its lowest point. But on the other hand, it's disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again.\n\n\"The Battle of Algiers\" chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.\n\nThere's a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar?\n\nPontecorvo's film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of \"freedom,\" \"liberty\" and such. But we do see the human cost and dubious morality of terrorist warfare, and the film fairly showcases the brutality inflicted by both groups.\n\n\"The Battle of Algiers\" has an astounding authentic quality to it that makes it almost impossible to believe that this is a fictional film and not a documentary.\n\nGrade: A"

To say this film represents both sides is not true. The French, supposedly the more civilized country, looked down upon the Algerians and as the violence started coming from the Algerians, the French escalated their violence (in absolutely appalling methods) thereby increasing the Algerians' violence. Would the French have responded to calm, reasoning with the Algerians? I don't think so. The British did not respond to the colonies' plea for release; it took a Revelutionary War to do that. Is revolution only acceptable to Americans if we do it but not good if other countries do it? Would slavery have been abolished if not for the Civil War? I don't think so. Would the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have been passed if the violence of the white leadership of the south hadn't acted so murderously towards the activists for the blacks? I don't condone violence in any way but sometimes people feel there is no other way and the US should not be hypocritical of the frustration and pain that cause people to rebel in the only way they know how.\n\nThis film is amazing and Pontecorvo had to put a disclaimer about the reality at the beginning of the film because it looked so real.\n\nBut read the book!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It feels redundant to talk about a film as iconic as Gillo Pontecorvo's \"The Battle of Algiers\". Still, as a descendant of the colonized (and quite possibly the colonizer, too) it's hard not to get affected by what could very well be the greatest anti-colonialism film ever made. Something as potent and political as this demands a reaction. \"Algiers\" is among a handful of films that are so exceptional and humanistic they ought to qualify as required viewing for a better humanity: Mira Nair's \"Salaam Bombay\", Koreeda Hirokazu's \"Nobody Knows\", Kieslowski's \"The Decalogues\", and Lee Chang-Dong's \"Oasis\", to cite a few.\n\n'Two hours' and 'black & white' aren't the most appetizing words even to the most adventurous of cineastes but here the story is quite absorbing, the work paced well, and the mood of resistance so palpable, one barely notices the film's length. Algeria's National Liberation Front (FLN) and one of its top leaders, Ali La Pointe (real name Ali Ammar?), are the obvious protagonists and, despite what some reviewers say, it's very clear that the colonizer, France, is the devil here. It's in the employment of war tactics where it gets blurry. Both parties resort to violence and murder for entirely different reasons, the Algerians' nobler than that of the French, but does purpose supersede the moral dilemma? Does the struggle for freedom justify murder?\n\nDespite the quandary, it's quite easy to root for the Algerians especially when they're led by a reformed petty crook-turned-revolutionary. \"Algiers\" is a classic underdog film with a heavy dose of historical credibility. In other words, \"It happened!\" We repeatedly see the Algerian 'rebel' forces getting crushed by France's more superior military forces and it's very commendable and heartbreaking to see them fight back over and over again. And how. It's astonishing to finally witness the film's legendary realism. I actually cried at some point when Ali's situation seemed very bleak.\n\nThe history of colonization and oppression is naturally full of fascinating stories of rebels and revolutionaries, loyalties are tested, courage is in high demand, traitors abound, nationalism is in action. Sometimes I wonder how fellow Filipinos and I would've acted back then under Spanish oppression. Books I'm sure barely do justice to these crucial moments in history (not mention distort the truth rampantly) so to see a chunk of it staged in a very realistic manner on film is quite poignant for me. \"Battle of Algiers\" is easily among the most well-made films I've ever seen, heavy yet accessible, a well-deserved film icon that is still being talked about long after 1966 and will be so well beyond 2006."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the best political films ever, about the 1954-1957 uprising of Algiers against French colonial rule. As the film shows, the uprising was brutally crushed, but the seeds of independence had already been sown, and in 1960 a new uprising, covering all Algeria, would rise up, and the country would become independent two years later. The French colonists, who numbered more than a million and who had lived in Algeria for more than a century, would be expelled after wards, marking a complete defeat for France. Made in 1965, with financing by the Algerian independent government, it is nevertheless surprisingly fair in some aspects. It shows the brutal terror tactics employed by the FLN (the main Algerian liberation group) like bombing bars and discos used by the Europeans. It also shows the French colonel in charge of suppressing the revolt (played by the only professional actor in the cast) in a quite positive light: in a film without true heroes, he is probably the most sympathetic character, competent and self-effacing, even if he doesn't flinch in using torture to crush the revolt (torture being in his mind the only method to destroy the FLN's cell structure). And, perhaps inadvertently, by showing the terror tactics used by the FLN, it suggests the oppressive, antidemocratic nature of the future independent government of Algeria. Overall, one of the must-see films in every cinephile list (and in any person interested in the politics of the region or in anti terror tactics)."

Both are portrayed with equal objectivity very successfully.\n\nA film in the style of realism, it looks much like a documentary, but actually uses NO \"News Footage,\" at all and is completely staged. This is quite remarkable and quite an accomplishment. The movie utilizes all non-actors (except one), even more amazing, and uses real locations, and people as the characters. All of this adding to a sense of a documentary, which it is not. Even one of the main characters is played by himself (the Producer of the movie (Saadi Yacef, playing a character based on himself - - El-hadi Jafar. The scenes are all shot on location with a hand held camera, utilizing natural light, locations, and real people. This film is \"Realism\" with a documentary feel. Music is very important in this film and was scored by Maricone, who has done hundreds of films and did a wonderful and often hauntingly beautiful job on this film. The premise of the film is that there is a loss of cultural identity when a country is colonized, which has certain costs and ramifications, and that, no country can ever, in the end, be run by or ruled by others. It has never lasted, and is always temporary. Racism is a main subject of this movie as one group (the French colonists) try to impose their value systems on the Algerian people, and the resistance that takes place. The film also depicts, especially through the \"raw,\" uneducated Protagonist \"Ali,\" the use of illiteracy, which is a weapon in colonization, and how lack of education is a problem here. Ali is also one of the most complex characters in the movie, as well as Omar, the little boy. This movie makes an effort to show both sides of the story, the rationale of each side. The movie also served as a sort of \"cautionary tale,\" of what could happen in Vietnam, and for this reason, the film was banned in the U.S. The film did actually turn out to be prophetic in this instance, and when it was released caused quite a stir. It also fueled the fire surrounding the plight of the African American in American ghettos, as equated with the Algerian Casbah, and the socio-economic implications. The movie also serves to humanize the \"Terrorist,\" giving them a face and cause and showing their motivations. \"Why does a terrorist become a terrorist.\" Since its initial release, this film has had a resurgence and has been used by groups as diverse as the \"black panthers,\" to the U.S. government in briefings and instruction on urban guerrilla warfare. So in many ways, it is a very contemporary subject matter, even though it was made over 40 years ago. In addition, one of the scariest scenes of the movie is when the children beat up an old drunk man for no reason. This is a foreshadowing of the new generation of extremist terrorist that we see today. This is a movie of yesterday, and also a movie of our times."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers is about Algeria's brutal war of independence with France and it's more one-sided history lesson than entertainment. Gillo Pontecorvo's film was released in 1966 and provides a documentary-style portrait of events. The Algerian insurgents, the National Liberation Front (\"FLN\") are presented as heroic freedom fighters while the French are nasty and ridiculous.\n\nIn 1954 the FLN begins a guerrilla war with the unsuspecting French authorities. The French retaliate and there is a curfew, searches, road-blocks and torture. The French try to break the resistance movement and ordinary Arabs are attacked in the street. The FLN then kill French civilians by planting bombs in bars and caf\u00e9s. The film shows that ratcheting up the violence just begets more extreme violence from the other side.\n\nMany European countries faced similar conflicts as they were forced to abandon their colonies after World War II. As a Brit I'm familiar with the narrative of an unpopular foreign power deciding how much violence to use to put down an insurgency. The UK usually decided that it was better to get out than engage in a guerrilla war with a hostile local population. The movie gives the impression that the French had some difficulty in accepting that the world had moved on and their time as a colonial power was up. Ironically, Jacques Chirac, the French president who opposed the Iraq war, served as an officer in the conflict and was wounded in action.\n\nThe film's sympathies are clearly with the FLN and the film's happy ending is independence in 1962. However since independence Algeria has often been violent and unstable. By 1976 the FLN had turned the country into a virtual one-party state and banned dissent. When elections resumed in 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front were the winners. This was unacceptable to the military and in 1992 a 10-year civil war began, with 160,000 deaths.\n\nOverall the film is disappointing as entertainment and the level of brutality involved makes it a depressing story. You would also be better served buying a book on the recent history of Algeria to get a more balanced understanding of the country's conflicts."

This is the version you must have.\n\nThe film is striking in its imagery, and while not many Americans probably know about France and Algeria, this might open their eyes a bit. (They could also read the work of Albert Camus, though he tends to side with the colonial power for some odd reason.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers, a film by Gillo Pontecorvo is based on events during the 1954-1962 Algerian War of Independence against French rule. It depicts the conflict between native Algerians and European settlers in which the two sides exchange acts of increasing violence, leading to the introduction of French paratroopers, under the direction of General Massu and then Colonel Bigeard, to root out the National Liberation Front (FLN). The paratroops are depicted as \"winning\" the battle by neutralizing the whole FLN leadership through assassination or capture. However, the film ends with a coda, depicting demonstrations and rioting by native Algerians for independence, in which it suggested that though the French have won the Battle of Algiers, they have lost the war. The movie reminds me of the current situation in Iraq. In May 1, 2003 President Bush announced \"Mission Accomplished\"; however, four years after his announcement, the battle has been intensified. Children shoot soldiers, women plant bombs in restaurants and suicide bomber are increasing. This movie is about independence and fighting for belief. The belief is profoundly rooted in people of Algeria that brought independence to Algeria. It is a lesson that US must learn, military action does not work against strong, deep rooted belief. History is repeating!"

Insurgents to learn how to win, Americans to learn the mindset of insurgents.\n\nI also pointed out the \"actors\" who were real life terrorist leaders. That they were quiet intellectuals instead of screaming fanatics surprised them.\n\nUS teens from the 2000s were fascinated by a 1960s B&W film in Arabic and French. Neither side presented as all good or evil, all knowing or competent.\n\nThose students came out of the film understanding why the Iraq War was happening, why the other side was angry and wanted Americans out, even why they were willing to use car bombs and kill civilians. Their questions after showed they didn't think any better of the insurgents, but did understand their reasons for terrorism. None of them tried to pretend the foreign invader was innocent anymore, whether French or American."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" or \"Paths of Glory\", \"The Battle of Algiers\" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, \"The Battle of Algiers\" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see."

The French see the Algerians as trying to take something that has been rightfully theirs for 100+ years. Who is the bigger coward?

Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, it would seem this film is more documentary than cinematic fiction, and with Marcello Gatti's grainy B&W photography (many scenes filmed with a hand-held camera), this impression is not that far off the mark. Since the struggle for independence from France was so fresh in the minds of most Algerians, the participants in the actual events were used in the film, and once Pontecorvo and his team recreated the atmosphere and visuals, the emotions of the people were ignited again and suddenly they were no longer acting. While THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS does take a position on the conflict, Pontecorvo is remarkably even handed in his approach and does not shy away from difficult questions, but confronts them with brutal clarity and honesty. Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is an intense, powerful experience, and Ennio Morricone's subdued but emotive score gives the images a resonance that will haunt the viewer long after they've dissolved into closing credits."

I was happy to find, though, involvement in the production of Algerian was huge, never the less the participant of some ex-FLN fighters as actors, the movie does show us the terrible affect of terrorist action against the local European civilians. Furthermore, the portrayal of the French army was decent, consider their complicated task in converting battlefield tactics into heavy populated areas.\n\nI think in such delicate issues, and of course if the main purpose is to bring the audience neutral opinion, Pontecorovo did an excellent job. The movie, except from the great history lesson, is relevant for today also, we can refer to it in different clashes around the world involving regular army forces and guerilla fighting."

Economic and neighborhood segregation between Algerians and French, it made Algerians feel foreign and inferior in their own land. They had all the rights to fight because theirs was a war for independence. French on the other hand, were fighting for their dominance over Algiers. I personally was very surprised by the Algiers women's role in this movie especially during the time they went to place the bombs in the most French frequented public areas. I like those scenes for another very important reason as well. After seeing an Algerian women sacrifice her hair, dressed up like modern French lady and looking at a little boy eyes eating ice-cream and knowing that she will kill that child after a few minutes, it all left me as a viewer without any good or bad opinion about Algerians. Furthermore, that's what this movie is all about; to not point who are the good and the bad characters in this movie, but to show the reality of this war. The involvement of children in the war was very significant and helpful element of the war as well because it is harder to punish or to catch a little child, as we saw in this movie. They were moving through the French military checkpoint transporting weapons then after will be used to kill the French soldiers. Also, the French tortures especially in the prison to make Algerians talk about the FLN members, were a very disturbing scenes of this movie."

Every european country did that and they shall never been forgiven for what cruelties they caused. Fortunately today these colonies are mostly a thing of the past, but it is not long ago when they were common.\n\nThe battle of algiers portrays the fight for independence brilliantly and critizes the french reaction of trying to stop their will for freedom.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers is a multi-layered film describing the attempts of Algerian rebels to gain independence from France in the 1950's. The French bring in military might, but the guerrilla tactics of the rebels prevent direct assault. Thus the French officials are left with an unclear path of bringing order to the city. The film chronicles individual terrorist plots and attacks, while also describing the attempts of the French army to react and hunt down rebel power. The small attacks slowly build up into a brilliant, touching conclusion.\n\nThe person that stood out the most was Colonel Mathieu, a confident and cunning head of the French military. He made an admirable character from his first appearance in a paratrooper march to his final statement. The rebels meet our expectations; there are a few major rebel figures, but none of them have the unanimous command like Colonel Mathieu. They are also imperfect. The plans are drawn up quickly, but the goal is always the same: to stimulate Algeria's resistance to French command. Overall, it makes for an uncannily realistic plot structure.\n\nThe film is loaded with material and messages that will keep you thinking long after watching it. It is not the usual well-defined revolution that we expect; rather, the rebels are terrorists whose bombs kill innocent people, while the French army is very orderly and (despite torturing prisoners) civilized. Neither side is perfect, and its hard to tell what side is right. This makes for a highly realistic vision that is as complex as it is political.\n\nThe only major downside to the film is that, although filmed professionally, the quality of the footage and sound is not always the best. It isn't enough to detract much from the experienced viewer, but its a shame that it could not have been better preserved or restored. Other than that, the film is masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is a war drama film that, in a realistic way, describes events during the Algerian War. On the other hand, it is a traditional view of a conflict between a guerrilla movement for the liberation and a colonial superiority. Mr. Pontecorvo was inspired by the Italian neo-realism, which is evident in authentic locations and his documentary expression. Of course, when it comes to style, I would pull a thin line between this film and the film \"Rome, Open City\" by Roberto Rossellini.\n\nThe Battle of Algiers reconstructs the events that occurred in the capital city of French Algeria between November 1954 and December 1957, during the Algerian War of Independence. The story begins and ends from the perspective of Ali la Pointe, a petty criminal who is politically radicalized while in prison. He has joined the secretive organization in order to help rid the Casbah of vice associated with the colonial government. Ali is becoming one of the leading members of the National Liberation Front (FLN). The film traces the rebels' struggle and the increasingly extreme measures taken by the French government to quell what soon becomes a nationwide revolt...\n\nThis film, in a credible way, shows crimes against civilians, through an uncontrolled guerrilla war in an urban area. We have a very difficult task to draw a parallel between the bombings as one of the terrifying form of terrorism, and the colonial power, which is reflected through different forms of lynchings, torture and intimidation. Colonizer and colonized commit atrocities against civilians. The politicians, as always, tactical discuss some obvious facts. Some scenes from indigenous districts are frightening, while people falling into puddles of blood and after each new news something explodes. There is no some melodramatic plot, direction is too realistic to some part could be ignored.\n\nThe characterization is very good.\n\nBrahim Haggiag as Ali la Pointe is the personification of a guerrilla fighter, who has mixed up his own life purpose and a strong desire for freedom. Saadi Yacef as Djafar is a very convincing as a leader and tactician of the National Liberation Front.\n\nJean Martin as Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu is a tenacious officer who intends to defeat his opponent, with a certain military respect, at any cost.\n\nWell, some have won the battle, while the other have won the war, and many of them have lost their lives."

Although made in 1965, the Pentagon screened it last year to demonstrate what soldiers might face during occupation of Iraq. And organisations like the Black Panthers have used it as a training video in guerrilla-style warfare.\n\nCo-writer and co-producer Saadi Yacef, who also stars, based the film on his experiences as the military leader of the Algierian FLN (National Liberation Front) during that time. Director Gillo Pontecorvo, who was heavily influenced by neorealist Italian director Rosselini, was also a communist activist during WWII.\n\nDespite their credentials, the film falls short of being propaganda. The Battle of Algiers is a black-and-white masterpiece, with scenes so realistic it is difficult to believe they were scripted and re-shot years after the war had ended, albeit in the same locations\n\nPontecorvo pioneers the use of hand-held camera and other techniques to create immediacy. The score, by Ennio Morricone and Yacef, enhances the film, interweaving percussive themes with traditional Arabic melody. The cast is made up of Ali La Pointe (played by the charismatic Brahim Haggiag), an illiterate youth who becomes the revolution's posterchild, and military commander Ali Kader (Yacef). The only professional actor in the cast, Jean Martin, is Colonel Matthieu, the efficient, hardline head of the French paratroopers brought in to quell the uprising. This film will engage you, emotionally and intellectually. I left wanting to know more. ****/***** stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "It must be impossible today to discuss this film without branching out into broader political observations. The Battle Of Algiers may be more relevant today than it was in 1966, though the situations we face today are different to some degree, it's uncomfortably close to what we're seeing every night on cable news. This is one of those movies that everyone has heard about, but fewer have seen.\n\nFilmed in a neorealist semi-documentary style, which was striking in the '60s but less impressive today, the film has the feel of old news footage, and to modern audiences unused to such a look, it might be hard to distinguish. Besides the obvious visual style and lack of professional actors, American audiences would now, as they have in the past, find it difficult to respond to a film that does not offer a clear/cut black and white storyline. Though it makes somewhat of an effort to portray both sides, the filmmakers sentiments are clearly on the side of the Algerian national resistance movement. This is one area that might raise a lot of questions. Obviously the issue of Algerian independence and its struggle cannot be recounted in a 2, 3 or 10 hour movie and it would take about 1,000 interviews with players of both sides for an outsider like an American to form any type of semi valid opinion about the events.\n\nLately the catchword in the U.S. is \"I support the troops,\" though the ones who say it never can give a satisfactory response as to what it means. Supporting the Paras in Algeria obviously meant supporting their temporarily successful methods, that is, torturing suspects for information. For this film to make a statement on that it could have used more graphic scenes. The use of torture and savage methods by the French Army, while proving successful in Algiers, cost them the support of the French people and led to the downfall of the government, so it was a two edged sword which Americans should pay attention to. I think the entire issue should have been recounted here in more detail.\n\nWhile the subject matter is even more timely today, the film making style is not, but anyone interested in current events as well as the history of Arab nationalism and revolutionary movements would be interested in this. I especially liked the character of the colonel as played by Jean Martin, he portrayed an effective and decisive leader without resorting to any kind of clich\u00e9, and you could respect him no matter where your sentiments were, a character I wish we'd see more of."

I would recommend this movie as an educational source as it shows both sides, it does not portray one particular side as \"good\" or \"bad\". I think that this is a useful source if you want to learn about history and wars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Personally, I can't see the beauty and quality of this film. I recognize the ability to be objective and rigorous in the report made, and it is quite unusual to find a film that resembles both a documentary or a major journalistic report. However, the way it was conceived and its high-contrast cinematography make the experience of watching the film truly tiring.\n\nDirected and written by Gillo Pontecorvo, the film addresses, in very broad lines, the effort of the Algerians to resist French colonization and conquer the independence of their country, in one of the most striking colonial conflicts that France faced. However, the way the film approaches the subject could not be worse: instead of building a fictional story on top of historical facts, the narrative is dispersed and, if most of the time we follow in the footsteps of a specific Algerian terrorist, the script proved to be unable to focus on this story and to avoid unreasonable or accessory considerations. Furthermore, and while the film tries to be neutral, the sympathy for the revolutionaries is evident.\n\nThe cast is satisfactory, but it's made up of names I don't know. Brahim Hadjadj brought to life the most notable character in the film, a member of the Algerian resistance, and was happy in his effort. Technically, it is an uneven film, with a neo-realistic aesthetic, but an excessively crude cinematography, of high contrast, tiring for the eyes. The sets and costumes are fine and the film is quite authentic, and the soundtrack does not bring anything remarkable."

But I'm here to urge anyone who's not seen this to do so, and soon, for four reasons: 1. The obvious relevance in 2006 - an Arab nation fighting against occupation (I mean Palestine as well as Iraq), vivid depictions of terrorist attacks and military torture, reminding us of what is going on every day in these countries. But also. . .\n\n2. The neutral viewpoint. As a work of cinematic art, Battle of Algiers distances its POV from the subject matter, leaving us to decide for ourselves, although it gives us plenty of emotional ammunition against either side. (In the reviews, this debate continues, 40 years on.) 3. Universality. Yes, you can watch this thinking about French colonies or the Iraq occupation, but the ethical questions it poses are relevant to any political struggle for freedom.\n\n4. It's exciting! In fact, I'm going to watch it again this afternoon. Long live Free Algeria! Long live cinema verit\u00e9!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Algerian Government subsidized and hired Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo to shoot a film to recount the bloody clash between FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front) and French colonial only few years after its independence (1962). The film was not only won GOLDEN LION in Venice in 1966 and an Academy Awards nomination for BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM in 1967 but also was nominated for BEST DIRECTOR and SCREENPLAY in 1969 for a rare second round.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF ALGIERS impresses its viewers with a haunting collection of close-up portraits of various people (both French and Algerian) under a soul-searching orchestration emphasized by stark chiaroscuro, it was years after Italian Neo-Realism, but the non-professional cast (the only pro is a wiry and bulged-eyed Jean Martin, who commands a stance of military mettle perfectly) and locale-revamping contributes a great amount of authenticity in the final work. There are plenty of overlooking angles with extensive depth of focus to examine and the city and enlighten one's appreciation, plus there are fleeting montages of torture under interrogation are disturbing but can potently generates a sense of boldness to show audience the cruelty in reality. However the most indelible ones are the waiting-for-the-bombs-to-explode experiences, with camera panning over innocent white victims-to-be unwittingly relish their last moment of hedonism, utterly guarantee a surge of compassion out of shock value terms.\n\nTherefore, the film should also be extolled by its unbiased perspective in telling its stories from both parts, dispassionately channels viewers to witness the vindictive constitution lying underneath common humanity and the aimless and reproachable tit-for-tat acts ensuring. There are radical debates as regards the essence of revolution, a much more penetrating motto is revolution doesn't mean war and terrorism is not a means to win a revolution, which should be indoctrinated all over the world, especially to those tinderboxes where religious and political threats are pervading rampantly at present.\n\nShowing no partiality to either sides is not an easy move since the production was backed and green-lit by one of the government, thus the film is a genuine gem in retaining the integrity and fabricating a gripping panorama of a chain of bloodshed and baring its true color under the stark daylight."

So for me, it was only a revolutionary and national film that depicts the cruelty f the french colonization in Algeria that I memorized scene by scene. it was only until recently that I decided to see the film for what it really is and getting a restored copy of it. After not watching it for almost 10 years, I tried to stay unbiased and take it for what it is, and to my surprise, I was in trance. it's one of the best movies ever made, why? Because it readapts the truth so meticulously it feels like a documentation of the reality itself. the film doesn't take sides, it doesn't try to give the right to any side on the expense of the other, this movie doesn't play ethics, it just shows the terror that goes on both sides and the story flow to the rhythm of these true events perfectly restaged, to the point it can be considered as a minute by minute reportage of the events. The war of Algiers was so eventful on itself, the Algerian revolutionaries so complex they didn't need writing and it was made 3 years after the Algerian independence so the memories were fresh, the feelings and terror still lived and felt, it's impossible to make such movie nowadays, Every scene is perfect and felt intensely. this movie is cinema witnessing history. perfection"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" is a film that everyone should see. It presents the historical account of the struggle of Algerian nationalists for independence from French colonists, and in doing so clearly displays the total futility of war. While not as renowned as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" or \"Paths of Glory\", \"The Battle of Algiers\" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, \"The Battle of Algiers\" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see."

That one looks like a downer already. Terrorists aren't mere mobs of fanatics who don't have anything better to do. The soldiers fighting them aren't a bunch of patriotic morons who got drafted as they walked out of a war movie. And this movie masterfully reveals both. The direction is superb, and the footage is incredibly convincing--so much that the movie opens with credits emphasizing that news footage wasn't used in the making of the film. But what is even more gripping is the imagery that is used before terrorist acts and military raids--men, women, and children, families, lives about to be destroyed. Don't blink. This movie has nothing to be missed."

This landmark film has the interesting distinction of being at once a propaganda piece and somewhat even-handed. Despite being commissioned by the Algerian FLN government, and certainly ultimately siding with the rebels, it presents the French commander Colonel Mathieu (a stand-in for real paratrooper commander Jacques Massu) in a sympathetic light, and the horror brought on by FLN bombings is in no way minimized. This film achieves a chaotic, tense feel that conveys the essence of the people's war in the Casbah. The characters, almost all of whom display some nobility, commit terrible acts against their enemies, and we see an almost chivalric battle of jaded, duty-bound warriors against fiery nationalist rebels. Above all, the film showcases how the French won the battle of Algiers military but lost the war politically."

But this detracts little from the film, which just produces one memorable scene after another, until the final scenes of revolution. The film actually does an excellent job of taking into account the complexities of the French occupation in Algeria as well. I can't recommend it enough."

I am not a film buff or anything but I love a good film & like to be drawn in by the quality of the shots & the variety of camera techniques around today which are frankly, just better.\n\nHowever, fortunately this film simply made me forget about any of this within it's first five minutes & I got more & more engrossed as it went on. As well as the fine scenes, brilliant atmospheric music & gripping look at the human struggle, as has already been said the vast amount of resonance which can be seen today within the film is incredible.\n\nAs I already have mentioned, we watched this film both from both a political and legal point of view and discussions could be held literally for days on what this film means to these and both other areas of life.

Part of what makes it so incredible is that it was shot in Algeria soon after the revolution with members of the revolutionary party in the development team and in the cast, so it's a narrative film with a documentary's realness. What makes the film so powerful is the city and the people itself, you can sense the anger and the hope. And strangely the film can even make you empathize with the most diabolical acts of terrorism. Now, is it as unbiased as everyone makes it out to be? I don't think so. I think it is pretty favorable to the revolutionaries. Even though it shows sympathetic characters on the side of the French colonial forces, the presentation is still weighted heavily on the side of the revolutionaries. Regardless, it is a marvelous film."

I must ask, what was the ultimate outcome of its independence in terms of political freedom? Algeria may have achieved independence, but its people are far from free today.\n\nWhile the pace of the film was exciting during my first viewing many years ago, the action loses its momentum with the second experience. I do give director Pontecorvo much credit for the ability to recreate acts of terrorism and their deadly results cinematically. The musical background also effectively contributes to the dramatic circumstances. I recognize these attributes in my rating."

Now that's how a movie should be made.'\n\nColonialism and oppression have a tremendous affect on people. Watching this movie, you will see exactly how."

Unfortunately, terrorism, counter-terrorism, revolution, torture and Islam, which were seen in Algeria fifty years ago, are still on the agenda in 2006.\n\nOn the DVD, Pontecorvo explains in an interview how he recreated the effect of newsreel footage. Every scene was staged for the film, and every detail choreographed; even the bright sunlight of Algiers was softened with white sheets. The result is a visual masterpiece which stands the test of time."

They then went on to develop them in Indochina (see \"The 317th Platoon\"); and after Algiers was \"lost\" a few of the veterans provided \"the inspiration, the training, and some of the intelligence that enabled Latin American dictators to torture and kill thousands of their own citizens\" as documented in the film \"Death Squadrons: The French School.\" They also trained the U.S. operatives in such techniques as assassinations, extraordinary rendition, and water boarding used in Guantanimo and Abu Ghraib, providing the basic curriculum for the infamous School of the Americas where so much of the U.S. Empire's genocidal activities were/are engineered."

You are thrown some facts about Algerians being unhappy with French rule, given a flavor of their mistreatment at the checkpoints, but beyond that, one sees little of what is causing the unrest and cannot make an emotional connection with the characters. In fact, for me, the main character was not likable. At the end of the movie when it states that the Algerians won their independence, it is a purely intellectual process where you think, \"that's good,\" and have zero emotional response. On the other hand, you wonder why the Algerians chose violence as the first resort instead of a peaceful strike, and you are left with a feeling of disdain at the barbaric nature of their resistance. Violence should always be the last resort and should only be in self defense. Of course, one could argue that the French placed the first bomb, but that was a rogue bomb placed for the sole purpose of inciting the Algerians to violence so that the French would respond in kind. For me, the takeaway is the age old message that two wrongs do not make a right."

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching this brilliantly filmed movie you can understand why filmmakers such as Spike Lee and Oliver Stone were influenced by it. Although Spike Lee's \"Do The Right Thing\" and Oliver Stone's \"Salvador\" are not about colonization, the human conditions and issues that \"The Battle Of Algiers\" addresses is relevant enough to inspire filmmakers who want to make a movie about human oppression, which exists in many different forms. The way in which Pontecorvo utilizes his skills and cinematic elements available to him to address not a single protagonist, but tell the story from multiple perspectives is one of the reasons I believe this film is successful. The film is able to effectively illustrate the socio-economical problems of colonization and is not biased in faulting either side. The fact that the movie did not fall into the traps that previous movies about colonization had is also something to be praised. The colonizers were not seen as single dimensional killing machines, but rather people with sense and a consciousness as we see in Col. Mathieu. The film also shines a light on terrorism showing the reason, thought, and purpose behind public bombings. The film justifies the realist genre it falls under, and it is hard to believe that every scene was completely staged and scripted instead of documented. It is hard to watch this film and not be left with compelling thoughts or lingering emotions, which, in my opinion, should be the goal of every good filmmaker."

Its been watched countless times as an example of what to expect when the state or a foreign power is forced into conflict with a civilian population armed with their wits, their intelligence, and what little weapons and technology they can get their hands on. It's not difficult to see how the current conflicts in the Middle East and the American reaction to them relates to this film. In fact, the story of this film relates to any major conflict between an invading force that is more technologically advanced and seemingly more powerful than the population it seeks to control. Both struggling \"freedom fighters\" and the governments that seek to eliminate \"terrorism\" appreciate the film, as it was filmed in a way that creates no sense of hidden variables or any sort of a Manichaean world view. The film is one of the best examples of a world where black and white concepts simply do not exist. At one point, one of the French colonels in charge of stopping the Algerian resistance movement explains that the French government has only two options, and that any concept of right or wrong simply has nothing to do with the task at hand; that if the French want to stay in Algeria, they must accept what must be done, and that entails putting up with brutality and torture as the means to accomplish their end. This film can best be described as \"real.\" Nothing about it seems contrived, everything mirrors real life and the gray areas of the world that so much suffering seems to thrive in. Whether you feel that the French are in the right or the Algerians have the moral high ground, Pontecorvo's film will leave you with a better understanding of the other side, despite the fact that you may loathe everything that they stand for. For every act of violence in the film, one cannot find true justification, only explanation, but perhaps that is Pontecorvo's point; that explanation and understanding is enough to get humanity towards whatever sort of peace it tries to attain. Even if you can't appreciate the film for its style, drama, music, or any cinematic aspects, the message is one that all humans can learn from and appreciate."

Done in black-and-white, at a break-a- neck pace, it unravels the intense, life changing confrontation of the Muslim Algiers, against the French occupancy. Filmed in a documentary style, it brings us in the midst of the conflict, and developing of a revolution, with mind bugling intimacy, and as every genius work of Art it asks more questions, than gives answers.\n\nThe terrorist that we deal with nowadays, are caricatured into uneducated, dirty desert monkeys, dying not for freedom but for a chance to get some pussy in heaven, but one forgets is that it's quite the opposite. That the people that stand behind it all, are highly intelligent, well organized, extremely well educated and idealistic. And in the case of this movie, they are freedom fighters. Please don't misconstrued this as a justification for terrorism, just don't make a mistake of simplifying things to some absurd notion that its a number of virgins in heaven that motivates these people. Perhaps at the lowest ranks, it what gets people going, but the higher ups are motivated by something completely different. Even in case of world tr center, it was done rather symbolic, (people forget that the same thing is done in \"Fight Club\" with the only difference that there are no people in the building), to show how that place created unfair trade treaties all the time, and it's the cause of poverty in many countries. A perfect example would be China, with whom once the trading was allowed, their economy boomed. (by the way all this came to me after I watched this movie, I am not that much of a political person )))).\n\nMostly important with every step of the way, with incredible clarity, tension and on-the- edge-of-your-seat intensity, this film explains the inner motivation of both the French occupancy, and the soldiers that come to defend it, and the opposition that eventually leads to revolution and independence of Algiers. All character's actions, no matter how heroic or horrific are understood, sympathized and relived by the viewer, with often unexpected personal discoveries."

Despite telling the story largely from the point of view of Ali la Pointe, it provided a fairly unbiased view of the conflict. It showed the violence on both sides in a way that truly showed that neither side was truly good. Instead they showed the conflict as what it was, a struggle between a terrorist group justifying it's actions as the people's will, and tyrannical oppressors determined not to lose yet another country."

Although this depicts Algiers revolt from the French it's similar to the what's being played out in the Middle East. Living in America, the word terrorist is now associated with people who want to destroy American freedom. I've never been a fan of this idea and always was interested to learn more about the other side, the people who never get a voice. Although I didn't agree with either side in this film, it was interesting to see a more objective stance that almost felt like a documentary. There are shots that feel so real, it's a little uncomfortable, which I guess is how it should be. This film isn't for everyone; it doesn't have an obvious bad or good guy and also doesn't have a set protagonist. Although Ali La Pointe is supposed to be the protagonist, it's more about the people as a whole and their struggle for freedom. It's an interesting film that definitely sheds light on present matters as well as historical ones."

The film is timeless because it depicts a conflict that exists even today. It's so relevant to the way we function on a personal as well as on a global level.

It focus to much on the few terrorists in the beginning and that the french military was just protecting the europeans (maybe with an iron fist, but it isn't shown).\n\nThere is no story development to show how live was in the colony at that time and how intrusive the actions of police and the french empire conflicted with simple people. This makes it a bit difficult to get the context for of the reason for the uprise. Maybe this is because the movie was made so soon after the events and out of fresh memory that the writers saw no reason to talk about it.\n\nThe Algerien war was very bloody and the french troops were doing everything else then obeying human rights but amazingly no comment about that. Don't understand why an algerian movie isn't putting this on their agenda.\n\nAnd finally i find that the most interesting part - after the initial group is defeated - and a peoples mass movement starts is just shown in less then 10min in a news summary style. I have to guess again, maybe because mass scenes were just not financial possible to recreate with the small budget of this film.\n\nConclusion: A nice movie to watch with good cinematography that deserves it 8 star rating here on IMDb but gives too little political information and leaves the average viewer without and increased understanding."

The reality was that at least 100,000 Algerians were killed in the war versus 10,000 French. Yet the film shows many more scenes of random killing of the French than Algerians caught in the cross fire. A significant omission is any portrayal of the aerial war in the mountain villages although it is alluded to by one of the FLN leaders. Otherwise, I found the film to be very balanced in its portrayal of the suffering endured in this conflict by both sides. An excellent and gripping film which is reminiscent of the present day struggle going on in Iraq."

And you can see Greengrass' influence all the way through; shot like the real deal with a political storyline and an unknown cast, his 'United 93' draws several similarities. Director Pontecorvo was under the influence of Italian masterpiece 'Rome, Open City' while shooting what would become his own grand work; made to feel like a documentary, the film plots around the Algerian revolutionists wanting independence from French government. Using the zoom effect, Pontecorvo aims in on the details of humanity, on the shackled humanity that faces chaos. Adding on emotionally laden music by Pontecorvo himself and master film composer Ennio Morricone, the film certainly finds a beating heart amongst all the smoky ruins and bloody torture. Pontecorvo was by some back in the 60ties declared a \"pro-Marxist\" as he doesn't always steer his motivations objectively, but finely balances the line between propaganda and pure observation. Systematically told in its cinematic narrative and with its journalistic narrator, the film still has a ruthless undertone much because of the importance of the story and the following shackles of war. I warmly recommend this brilliant war-film of 1966 whose influence can be seen in many films - most recently in Steven Soderbergh's 'Che'."

I respected Pontecorvo's efforts in remaining neutral to the French and Algerian side in his film making process. However, as an audience member I felt compassion for the Algiers alone. The altruistic \"behavior\" of the French were seen as a facade in my eyes. The French overtook Algeria as their own 130 years prior to the story in the film of the Algiers rebellion. They pushed the Algiers into a ghetto where they were surveyed and treated with diminishing respect. Shooting in natural locations and with non-actors made my experience of watching this film a memorable one. When drinking alcohol was prohibited in the country, there is a scene where an old man is taunted by the little children, they chorus \"wino\" and attack him. I felt remorse for the old man, and in the scheme of things his tiny flaw of alcoholism in the eyes of the colonized government was illustrated to me as the beginnings of a dictatorship. A ruling in which a man may not choose his drink or where he treads. The film resonates to cultures all around the world in its message of the examination of a repressed culture that rebels. Pontecorvo does not justify the actions of the Algiers or the French, but rather, he allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion on what is truly altruistic. Consistently throughout the film my conscience chorused \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\""

We democratically voted and decided that France did the best job giving independence to their colonies. Algeria was a French colony and this movie changed my mind because the French were actually being harsh towards the Algerians. La battaglia di Algeri was a realist movie because it included the two languages that the Algerians were speaking. They eventually put the movie in black and white which remarkably set the mood of the movie. I enjoyed it even though the acting was quite poor. This is a good educational source. This film changed my mind on how the way the French decolonized their colonies."

        "review_detailed_main": "For all the beauty of the French language, pastries, etc... there are two things the French don't do well: cars and film. Yes, yes ... it sounds like a gross generalization, but true nonetheless.\n\nLet me preface by saying I only lasted about 20 minutes on this, so the review will be scant.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\nSTORY: No doubt, the telling of a people oppressed by colonization should always be told naked in all it's brutality, and perhaps some hope and mercy. This is a difficult-to-watch film for that reason, but not only that.\n\nDocudramas are necessary, but they don't have to be told DRY. I'm not asking for the shallow BS we get here in the US the past 20 years. What I'm suggesting is this be told with both accuracy and some softer / entertaining features.\n\nTake films like \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978) or \"Paths of Glory\" (1957), while they're fictional, they're nonetheless built around historical context. They are each brutal and difficult-to-watch, but they are filmed and told in ways that allow the viewer to participate (vicariously).\n\nFilms such as \"Battle for Algiers\" could have, yes, could have been told and filmed with more finesse, and thus, more accessible to viewers. Perhaps too, the subtitles don't help.\n\nACTING: The acting is hard to judge, but not so much because I wimped out early. The cast were as dour as can be, which arguably, was necessary. But this is a film, not a funeral.\n\nSo whether the cast were / are capable and have acting range and character depth is hard to assess.\n\nTEMPO: Like so many French (European) films I've watched, this is a hectic pace and it doesn't feel at all well edited.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Perfect for the context, but almost as dark as death\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: It's near impossible for me to \"judge,\" but ... I will apply the same rule here as with US directors - don't direct stories you write. Some directors are especially gifted and wear both hats brilliantly. But this is most uncommon.\n\nIs it a good film? Maybe if you speak French or are accustomed to French film\n\nShould you watch this once? There have to be better alternatives on the same subject ...\n\nRating: 5.0."

        "review_detailed_main": "The battle of Algeria is very powerful movie and it is still relevant today. This movie shows directly how it affected the Algerian's in every day life. The director showed people's faces close up and usually showed random people's faces on the street. The shot of people's faces perfectly make this movie more powerful. Unlike some Hollywood movie, the terrorist is not faceless and a heartless creature from a different world.\n\nAnother trade mark is that an unknown narrator is explaining the story while the camera is shooting every thing that happens on the street. It has a documentary feel to it. Sometimes I feel like the camera man is right there when this entire event were happening on the street of Algeria. That makes this movie very real.\n\nThis chanting hollow music is coming every time something bad or important is about to happen. The movie started with the ending and Ali fleshed back to where it all started. My favorite scenes are when three women tried to bomb the public places. The trade mark of this movie is that showing people's faces at the bar and coffee shop\u0085 innocent kid licking the ice-cream and some couples are having a good time. Conversely these Algerian women's faces have no emotion. As a viewer I can not tell what they are thinking before they tried to kill all these innocent people. In another scene, two Algerian boys are on a killing spree. They are going insane from being opposed for many years in their own land. After all you can't tell the differences between the authority figures and people's on the street because they do have the same skin color. It makes your heart winched as you watch this movie. I have mixed feeling towards Algerians and French.\n\nThis movie is obviously more sympathized on the Algerian point of view yet the movie doesn't really take any side of bias. It is not really anti-French movie at all."

Mathieu.We see the account of bloody struggles from both sides,the torture and suppressive methods used by military to end the struggle or the bomb explosions and guerrilla war tactics used by NLF to obtain freedom,both French Military and NLF try very extreme and violent measures to counter attack each other.\n\nThe half documentary,half fiction style of movie from the director Gillo Pontecorvo gives us the very realistic feel and drew us close and connected to the movie.The screenplay is written very well in both documentary and fiction style.It is made with very precise technical perfection,the use of camera to create a feel of documentary movie and also the thrill and tension of a war movie gives us a unique and mind-blowing ride that can be deliver from watching this movie only. the scenes of bomb explosion,assassinations and protest scenes at end of movie were shot very perfectly and seemed to be very real with the brilliant background score by one of my favorites Ennio Morricone.\n\nBattle of Algiers is the most hard hitting and violent Civil-War depiction,i have ever seen.The best thing about the movie is that it is not a propaganda movie even if the movie was made under the authority of government of Algeria the movie doesn't justify any particular side,this movie do not have any thing such as struggle between good and bad,instead of preaching and manipulating us,this movie just shows us and tells us accurately horrible and terrifying casualties of a Civil-War.Without any doubt this movie is greatest political thriller and one of the greatest war movie ever made for me."

Another aspect which I found astounding was that there was not any documentary footage that was used. The unbiased presentation of the issue led me to have an unbiased opinion on the matter as well; sure, the French were definitely wrong for colonizing Algeria, but I also feel that Algeria was going about things the wrong way. Viewing the film can be beneficial in the sense that it would help others in their pursuit of revolution."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"La Battaglia di Algeri\" (1966) tells a very sad story. That it is true makes it all the more tragic. Yet out of this strife comes a remarkable film.\n\nIt's easy to see how Pontecorvo made only a few other notable films, the most famous being \"Queimada!\" (1967). His star in the latter, Marlon Brando, undoubtedly was persuaded to work on the basis of Gillo's film of the Algerian-French battle.\n\nOn reading and viewing the history of the making of \"Battle of Algiers\" I can understand how Pontecorvo put a lifetime of energy and commitment into this project. The film is unforgettable for its realistic, documentary look. There have been other films to obtain such an image, but \"Battle\" is outstanding in the way so large a cast was employed. Indeed, it's hard to believe so many \"extras\" could be recruited, much less give such convincing performances.\n\nTwo critical quotes of the film are notable: the Washington Post hailed it as being \"just as important for our time as the work of Griffith, Riefenstahl, Dryer and Visconti were for theirs.\" And the New Yorker exclaimed, \"Pontocorvo and his team show the capability of convincing the cinema public that revolution, in certain circumstances, is a necessary thing.\" While the rebels are given a sympathetic perspective, the French are likewise fairly depicted--all resulting in a kind of observational, reportorial essay on a historical event. The entire viewing experience is quite unforgettable."

Of good historical value and with an end with good message.\n\nIt had its relevance at the time and I consider it a good film, but unfortunately it is dated: although the theme of war is always timeless and parallels can be established with current conflicts, there are already better films within the genre with best script and that appeal more to the casual viewer.

I liked this dialog that Col. Mathieu Said \"we are soldiers our duty is to win\". I liked the screenplay because It's based on true story, and if I have to add something about the cinematography and the art of directing I say Gillo Pontecorvo done it in perfect way and finally Jean Martin did a very special acting."

The characters delivered a good performance however, because there were many characters it was first difficult to familiarize with the characters in the beginning.\n\nI think the film did a good job of presenting to the audience the message and meaning of the film. I enjoyed the ending because it kept the audience questioning after the end of the film in discussion. The film was nicely put together and the style of the film made it peculiar in a way where it was unpredictable of what would happen next and kept the audience on the edge of their seats."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was actually blown away by this movie. It seemed, to me, to be so far ahead of its time. The whole time watching I felt as though I was watching a contemporary movie, which was filmed in black and white. Aside from the attire of the French characters, and a few scattered scenes, it seemed very contemporary. In many ways, it IS very contemporary. The battle between the Algerians and the colonizing French is a story, which has been played out throughout history, time and time again.\n\nThe director of this film was purposefully chosen from neither a French or Algerian background, which turned out to be an Italian director. I don't think that the directing could have been done any better. As a testament to the quality, many contemporary directors cite this feature as a major inspiration. The major reason for the choice in director is an attempt to take neither side of the story. Although I found the film to lie a bit more on the side of the Algerians (which can be taken simply as the fact that a viewer tends to side with those who are fighting for freedom), it is rather fair to say the director did a very good job at showing the angel and devil in both sides. WATCH THIS FILM."

        "review_detailed_main": "In \"Battle of Algiers\" (1967) nothing in the film is documentary footage but an actual film with non-professional actors. The events cover from 1950-1962 in Algeria. Before 1962 Algerians had been under French Colonial rule but after years of fighting in 1962 they received their independence. This was the birth of fundamentalism. The French tried to make Algeria there own and input their beliefs into the whole Algerian nation. However, the Algerians weren't any bi standers but did anything possible to get rid of these invaders. A big concept found in this movie is Neo-Realism where it captured the reality of oppression. We discovered how the Algerians were living in somewhat all right houses but compared to the French they were the ones on top. The French personally did care too much about them but as soon as things got rough, they too action. The Algerians only wanted their independence where they can practice their religion, express their culture and pass on their beliefs to future generations. Wouldn't you be angry with a group of people taking possession of one's homeland and fighting over what originally was yours?"

        "review_detailed_main": "As an Israeli I found this 1966 movie to be more relevant to today's global issues than any of the movies that are released these days. Without glorifying any side Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo manages to present an unbiased and neutral portrayal of the conflict between the Algerians and the French \u2013 which could easily symbolize any of today's conflicts. But the movie's greatness should not be measured by its neutrality, but rather by its ability to create empathy among its viewers to both sides. The use of Italian neorealism (use of real location, non professional actors, etc\u0085) adds to the authenticity of events and thus also to the emotional stages we go through. Perhaps the most important point this movie clarifies is that for every coin there are two sides, and for every war there are two perspectives \u2013 none however justifies acts of violence."

Even the Pentagon screened it in 2003 to study how revolutionary movements start and see how they develop.\n\nThe movie relates the algerian revolution and the struggling attempt of its people to free their land from occupying France, it is surprisingly unbiased, it simply tells us what happened without emphasizing neither the french or the algerian people, victims of both terrorism and counter-terrorism.\n\nThe movie has a documentary feel to it, which gives it more impact since it is based on a true story. There are some memorable dialogues in the movie, including the one involving the press with Colonel Mathieu, and especially the dialogue between Ali Lapointe and another terrorist where they discuss the meaning of their acts. In fact, Terrorism is simply the way poor oppressed people respond to a much stronger oppressor. Many people tend to forget it. Terrorists aren't just some crazy and sadists lunatics with dynamite belts. They fight for -most of the time- very legitimate causes.\n\nThis is a must-see for any history or film buff. Hopefully it will get the attention it deserves after the criterion release on September 2004."

        "review_detailed_main": "In \"Battle of Algiers\", Pontecorvo makes a conscious effort to present an impartial dramatization of the events that took place in Algeria in 1957 by neither demonizing, nor idealizing the Algerian resistance. The film delivers an unapologetic perspective on the injustices faced by the Algerian people, as well as their radical backlash against the French army.\n\nSome cringe at the striking similarities between this film and the current situation in the Middle East. But instead of interpreting it as a prophetic approximation of the present, one quickly learns even after all these years, and even though it has taken on many different forms, the battle between Western idealism and Islamic fundamentalism has had a perpetual presence in the world that will not vanish until both sides relinquish the toxic need to impose their views on the other.\n\nPontecorvo's most accomplished scenes throughout this film happen when characters are on the verge of a decision. The culmination of these decisions will make you feel shocked, moved, and often angered, but surprisingly not at the characters choices, but at their circumstance."

In addition, it was difficult to watch the violence. The story did not interest me, as most other historical films do. It was meant for an audience that did not include me.\n\nThough the film is made documentary-style, there was no actual footage from the riots shown. This is especially interesting because of how real everything looks."

This is a movie that shows that oppression occurs all over the world. Even today this movie is still applicable to how power is and how we perceive power. This movie can also cause the viewer to question their stereotypical view of who is bad and who his not. The passion in the characters cause creates a tensive compassion for the audience. Especially in a time when many people view people from certain countries as evil. The battle fought in this movie is more than for Algiers, it is for oppressed people and societies worldwide. Personally I found it to be a movie that is perfect for discussion (not debate) on modern day issues of why we do what we do."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hyper-realistic depiction of the events leading up to the 1957 'Battle of Algiers', which was fought between FLN (Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale) and elite French airborne troops. The film primarily follows FLN leader Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he organises terrorist attacks, initially on French police and later on European civilians, and his nemesis Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a composite character representing the French military authority. Although clearly sympathetic to the Algerian separatists, the film is surprisingly even-handed, with neither side refraining from targeting non-combatants. The paratroopers use torture to extract the whereabouts of the FLN leadership while the terrorists enlist women and their children to smuggle bombs out of the Muslim controlled Casbah with which to blow-up 'soft targets' such as Cafes in the European quarter. At times the film is almost a didactic documentary on how to set up a resistance movement and how to fight it (at least at the tactical level). Ironically, the back-story of Mathieu includes serving with the French resistance in WW2, as did one of the real-life men on whom he was based (Marcel \"Bruno\" Bigeard)). Other than Martin, the cast are non-professionals and is universally excellent. The footage the paratroopers arriving in Algiers and later riots and street battles with the police is outstanding (the film is so real looking that the U.S. release came with assurances that no 'news-reel' footage was used). The music is excellent, with tradition Algerian music interspersed with a score by Gillo Pontecorvo and Ennio Morricone. One-of-a-kind and highly recommended."

So right off the bat, this is a really well done film I think the cinematography and dialog were really really well done. It was interesting watching this from both sides of the story. And thought it only added to the intense feeling of this movie. I was honestly surprised with were this film takes place. I always expect to be in the middle of a war when I see a war fil, but this is the story of the beginning of it and loved the new point of view."

It really makes you think during the movie about how the characters got to be in the situations that they were in. All in all, I think this movie has an important message about what is going to happen every time you try and hold a certain group of people down. Any minority group restricted in the same way that the Algerians were is going to react in the same way that they did in this movie, and the way the French acted to control the algerians and label them all as terrorists seems to remind me a lot of America."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Battle for Algiers' is based on a true story about Algeria's fight for independence from the French government in the mid-1950s post-colonialism era. Algerian resistance fighters enter the city of Algiers to wreak havoc using guerrilla tactics against the French military. In response, the French government sends in their paratroopers to track down the guerrilla cells to fight back on the ground. Fresh off getting beat in Vietnam, the French paratroopers use brutal tactics, including torture and opening fire on rowdy crowds, to keep control of their Algerian colony. The Algerian revolutionary group, National Liberation Front (or FLN for short), strikes with their own brutal tactics using suitcase bombs, pipe bombs, and opening fire on the French citizens. Back and forth the two sides go, neither refusing to back down.\n\nThis is a dark film depicting the brutality of the atrocities committed by both sides in their battles. It was filmed on location in Algeria to appeal to realism and recreate the atmosphere. From a technical perspective, it's well made from start to finish using the Italian neorealism style famous for its focus on realism. The cinematography and directing were excellent, leaving nothing on the table from a filming aspect. Crowds of extras are used to recreate the atmosphere of the Algerian revolution, depicted from different angles to make it look like documentary footage. The pacing kept you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know what was next. Legendary composer Ennio Morricone composed the music, which was simply marvelous in building tension and feeling at important junctions in the film. The issues I had were relatively average acting and a general lack of character development, which makes it feel more like a documentary even though it isn't one. You don't feel empathy for either side once you know how they operate. You feel like a bystander trying to make sense of war and the lack of humanity.\n\nWould I recommend it? I'm a bit on the edge about this one. I think it's a decent film, but I would not consider it a must-watch. The plot is not always easy to follow, and took me a while to get interested in it. However, the story is relevant even today."

        "review_detailed_main": "Four decades after its release The Battle of Algiers remains as emotionally powerful and timely as ever. Its semi documentary look and universal theme addressing a people's right to run their own country and not some foreign colonizer or more pertinent to today's front page, despotic dictator, has not lost an ounce of its urgency or punch as the same part of the world including Algeria itself wrestles with self determination.\n\nStreet thief Ali Lapointe is doing time in an Algerian jail when he gets religion after witnessing the execution of an independence fighter. On the outside he attempts to enlist with the FLN but is first tested to measure the depth of his commitment. Passing that he becomes part of a cell that encourages strikes against the French oppressor but when this fails the cell turns to violence. Career officer Colonel Mathieu is given command to subdue the rebelling Arabs and he does so by imposing greater restrictions and resorting to torture of Casbah residents and suspects.\n\nDirector Giullio Pontecervo's cold sober story telling rhythmically carried along by Ennio Morricone's score and cinematographer Marcello Gatti's lensing of the vertical Casbah battle field in all its restrictive claustrophobia makes for an ideal stage to depict an oppressed people brought to the edge with nowhere to turn. While Pontecervo shows both sides resorting to atrocity he clearly sympathizes with the Arab cause and takes every opportunity to make French paratroopers look like Nazi Africa Corps and act like Gestapo. Conversely he does not glamorize (or infect the film with a movie star ) the cold dispatch of Ali and his compatriots instead leaving it up to the immoral situation to make its case.\n\nMirroring the Viet Nam conflict during its release and used as a training film by terrorists around the globe since then The Battle of Algiers remains a provocative and absorbing watch that should continue to resonate not only as a call to arms but as an example of cinema at its most powerful."

        "review_title": "The grim reality of war - and colonialism",
        "review_detailed_main": "A film that has a documentary feel to it, with extraordinary footage that was shot on location. The context - four years after Algerian independence had been won from the French and looking back on the war it took to get there, and at a time when the Vietnam war was being fought - puts it in stark contrast to the war movies from a couple of decades before. The film pulls few punches in showing violence and torture, so beware of its realism.\n\nWhat I found striking is that the leaders of the two sides seem upstanding, or at least living to some sort of rational code with moral values, and yet in the situation they're in, they choose to do some horrifying things. There is the leader of the French, who had been part of the (certainly noble) cause of the Resistance in WWII, explaining to reporters that if they want the French in Algiers, they have to accept the consequences. We then see the prisoners his men have captured being brutally tortured. There is the leader of the guerillas, explaining to his lieutenant in one scene how terrorism must segue to other forms of protest, and to reporters in another that if he had airplanes at his disposal, he wouldn't have to resort to it. And yet when we see baskets with bombs being left in public places with innocent civilians and children, it's hard to see the actions as necessary or honorable.\n\nThe French military are in a difficult position, as when they strong-arm the population it naturally leads to more hatred of their presence, and when they're too lenient, letting Algerian women through security as a show of respect or because they've donned Western clothing, arms or bombs can slip through with devastating consequences. Meanwhile the insurgents adopt some nonviolent measure ala Gandhi, e.g. a worker's striker, but they believe that the French aren't just going to voluntarily give up their country without being forced (a reasonable view), and that violence in the form of terrorism is a big lever.\n\nIt's hard to understand whether either side has to employ the tactics that they do, and it's in this fog of war, with violence leading to violence, that the film has devastating power. The underlying enemy is of course colonialism, which in this case lasted from 1830 to 1962, and whose inevitable outcome seems apparent - resentment, rebellion, bloodshed, and (eventual) independence, with variations on these themes all over the world. The film shows events as they happened in what I believe is a factual way, and it allows both sides to express their views, but its sympathies seem to be with the Algerians, or maybe it feels that way because we know in our hearts they should have a right to their country. And yet, it's tough to feel good about either side, or to be all that sanguine about mankind after watching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers is recognised as a classic film, having a high IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores and being placed 120th on Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time in 2008. There is a great reason why it is so regarded, getting all areas of filmmaking right and having such an impact that the French banned it: the French need to learn to accept criticism.\n\nAs the title suggests the Battle of Algiers focuses on the Battle of Algiers between 1955 to 1957 during the Algerian War of Independence. Gillo Pontecorvo's film focuses on both sides of the conflict, Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj), a young ex-prisoner who joins the National Liberation Front (FLN) and becomes a senior leader and Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a Free-French veteran who heads the Counter-Terrorism operation.\n\nPontecorvo shows the harsh nature of this war, the Algerians fighting for independence, a simple nationalist idea of self-rule and the French, whilst not explained in the film, fought for two main reasons, the first being Algeria was seen as a part of France and the closest colony they had India that British had and they had already suffered two major defeats, World War II and Vietnam, they did not fancy a third. During this conflict there was no real good guys, the FLN were willing to use women and children to pass on messages, weapons and place bombs in busy caf\u00e9s. Teenagers are used to kill police officers and the FLN organises strikes to show it is a wider movement. On the French side Mathieu is show to be a competent commander and that leaders of FLN work in cells so they could not betray each other, but the French resort to torture, checkpoints and quick raids, using intimation and violence. Whilst the Colons (French colonists) start to turn their racism against Arabs into violence attacks against anyone Arab, including children.\n\nPontecorvo sets out to show the wider picture of what went on during the war: it was a tough, brutal war that American Generals during the Iraqi War have studied the conflict because of the similarities between them. There are a lot of modern parallels, from army officers having to talk to the media, the army trying to use media for their own aims, that there is two sides and two stories during a war and that characters are mixed, what is considered a legitimate target, what is terrorism, who is your real enemy, how you gather popular support and many more issues. You could thrown in a lot other historical events that are similar to Algeria, from the General Strikes in Apartheid South Africa to the Arab uprising.\n\nThere is great acting throughout the film and you could easily believe in them and their actions. They are fully developed and there is a true mixed picture because that is what the world is like. Both sides were willing to do unpleasant, illegal acts. Pontecorvo knew how to add tension in a film, from the action scenes, to where people hide from the police and army or weapons. The music really adds to the atmosphere, some of the best judge music as the tension builds in scenes. There is no glamour in this war."

Even to this day, these happen in many parts of the world. The makers of the movie have struck a perfect balance between the features of a documentary and a feature film. Kudos for them for that.\n\nOne more important thing to be noted is that the makers have not taken any sides, be it Algerian or the French while narrating, but the story is told form a neutral point and is one more point which adds beauty to the movie.\n\nIf you are a fan of war movies, or a student of history then this movie must be in your watch-list!!"

It had the patriotic energy in this film for the viewer perfectly. Making the Algerian liberals the Antagonist and the French colonist as the Protagonist.\n\nWhat made it nice was not really talking about the politics of the Algerian war. Like which parties supported the liberals or which supported the French colonist, the counter arguments from both sides, etc. This was explaining the movement and how it was getting more and more popular for the average Algerian, which I enjoyed.\n\nAnother thing in the film the I liked was Jafar. One of the leaders for the liberals, he was the character that was on a stand off with the French military and eventually surrendering because they were going to bomb the house where he was in. Was actually involved in the liberation on Algeria and was actually playing himself in the film.\n\nI give this film hands down, two thumbs up."

        "review_detailed_main": "A stark, unsentimental tale of the 1957 uprising against the French in Algiers, one of the earliest conflicts based on the urban terrorism and \"intifada tactics\" that seem so commonplace today.\n\nAlthough the film was made in Algeria only 3 years after independence I was \"pleasantly\" (perhaps not the best adverb) surprised at how objective and free of propaganda it was. The French are the villains, yet their point of view gets a fair hearing. Even Colonel Massu, commander of the French paratroops, is shown to be a cold, yet intelligent man rather than an evil brute. He is an apolitical soldier carrying out the policy of his government, and will stop at nothing to do so. The FALN are depicted as flawed heroes without halos. Just as ruthless as their enemies despite their righteous cause. I find it ironic that the present day French are so critical of Israel, although the Israelis are a lot more restrained than they were and are fighting a much less unified and more bloodthirsty enemy. If the present day Palestinian groups were as disciplined and goal oriented as the FALN (at least as portrayed in the movie) there would probably be a viable Palestinian state and at least a cold peace with Israel.\n\nIt was quite interesting to see both secular and more traditional Muslims uniting in nationalism without the mindless hatred, blatant corruption, and atavistic religious fanaticism we see today. A great history lesson and great cinema, even for those who don't agree with the film's point of view."

        "review_detailed_main": "J. Hoberman, The Village Voice's resident film reviewer, described \"The Battle of Algiers\", Gillo Pontecorvo's Golden Lion-winner at the 1966 Venice International Film Festival, as the \"revolutionary du jour\". I have to agree. Completely.\n\nEverything in the film could and should inspire ferocious and deeply-rooted ideologies and sentiments pertaining to one's own nation's freedom, independence and basic human rights.\n\nThe film is already four-decades old and the subject that it depicts, the Algerian people's struggle for liberation and self-determination against the French colonial government during the mid-'50s, can be rightfully considered as an integral part of modern history, but even when viewed from today's vantage point (as in my case) it still manages to unsettle and stun, to provoke and inspire. \"The Battle of Algiers\" possesses such staggering turmoil and realism that, as the events gradually unfold towards the nationwide street revolution, one can't help but be wide-eyed and unnerved throughout the film's 2-hour running time.\n\nIt works well to the film's advantage that it has managed to acquire through time an uncanny sense of historical immediacy. It feels as if Pontecorvo were still alive today working as a TV news reporter or documentarist recording with his own camera the incendiary real-life events right before our very own eyes. The Dziga Vertov principle of \"life caught unawares\" has moved onto a new level of meaning. It now becomes an almost-impossible task to draw the line between fiction and documentary, between what is staged and what is actual, if there really is such a distinction.\n\nIn my humble knowledge, no other highly-political film of World Cinema during those times and after has come close to the feral neo-realist energy of \"The Battle of Algiers\"--not even Costa-Gavra's \"Z\", \"Missing\" and \"Amen\", not even Francis Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\", not even \"L'America\" (Amelio), \"The Mission\" (Joffe), \"World Apart\" (Menges), \"Bloody Sunday\" (Greengrass), not even our own \"Orapronobis\" (Brocka), just to name a handful.\n\nWhat can even be more baffling--and thus put one more notch higher the film's above-mentioned quality--for today's viewers is how \"The Battle of Algiers\" can put in context today's headline-hogging and highly-relevant spate of \"political terrorism\", international and local. As \"outsiders\" having to become aware of the headlines mainly by means of TV or newspaper, it has become a necessary habit (justified or otherwise) to regard these bombings, assassinations, insurrections and any other forms of \"terroristic\" acts as a work of pure evil and inhumanity. This is for the reason that what we, the spectators, get to encounter immediately is the outcome, the damages done, of the event in question (the what and the how). More often than not, we don't get the opportunity to dig deep into the ideologies and motivations that led to the act (the why). If we ever had the chance to know the raison d'etre of the act, most likely the account is biased or blurred, thus further fuelling our \"prejudices\".\n\nThe numerous bombing incidents in the film (as well as the attacks on the French officials), mostly at the cost of innocent lives and in broad daylight, can be a sure cause of alarm, considering that these events essentially ring true as to what's being delivered from today's news. But as director Pontecorvo and writer Franco Solinas take pains to give an objective account of the Algerian struggle for liberation and independence--or of the Algerian insurrection, popularly known as the Front Liberation de Nationale (FLN), if one takes the liberty to use an \"extreme\" description--we get to come to the knowledge that these extreme measures used by the Algerian nationals could be the only possible way to attain an extreme goal, otherwise unimaginable through \"simple\" and \"humble\" acts (like the local prohibition of vices associated with the colonial government, such as alcohol, drugs and prostitution).\n\nThe unbiased account of the historical events is such that the high-ranking French colonial officers, during those tension-filled and critical moments (like the setting up for explosion of a resistance fighter's hideout), still get to exhibit some kind of humanity for their considered \"enemies of the state\" (\"If you want to die there, then let the children out first\", is one such line). Such \"humaneness\", though, by the very situation itself (or the description of the situation itself), gets to border on a comical awkwardness. These colonizers still manage to put a smile on our faces.\n\nAn intertitle towards the film's end says that the Algerian people finally attained freedom by 1962 (not after some nationwide turmoil, bloodshed and protest, those \"unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries\"). However, if we are to take bloody seriously the film's timeless immediacy, then the battle doesn't only stop at Algiers. It continues on and on, in another form, in another place, in another era. Whether won or not, only history can tell."

If anyone is interested in the history of Algeria, I definitely recommend this film. Its grainy, raw appearance, and audio, make you feel as though you're right in the middle of the action, which needless to say, can really stir up some emotions and make you empathize with the rebel Algerians.\n\nTruly a great film!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's the mid 1950s and the population of Algeria are increasingly determined to break free from the colonial administration of France. From one perspective it's a fight for freedom, from the other a response to dangerous insurrectionism. What makes this drama stand out is the degree of impartiality with which it depicts the story. The French are still licking their wounds after leaving their Indo-Chinese empire and are desperate to avoid another defeat here. The local population are poorly educated and hopelessly outgunned but have the advantage of mobility and surprise as they seek to emulate their Oriental contemporaries. Neither side shies away from acts of brutality and that's depicted poignantly here with anyone in uniform a target for the rebels and any one at all a target by way of response. It has the feel of a docu-drama to it, with the characterisations of \"La Ponte\" (Brahim Hadjadj) and \"Col. Mathieu\" (Jean Martin) acting well as a conduit for both sides of a story that saw losers on every side and tested the humanity of each as any semblance of decency or a code of war went swiftly by the board. It's not just both sides here that are exposed to judgment, but the pretty hapless UN doesn't really come off any better (perhaps restricted by a potential French veto?). The photography and visual effects are very effective at presenting us with a largely urban war zone in which collateral damage was inevitable, and seemingly a price both parties were prepared to pay. The history of the scenario and it's results are fact, but Gillo Pontecorvo uses quite a considerable degree of creativity and sensitivity in demonstrating just how desperate times can result in desperate measures - and maybe even a little grudging respect. At times, the violence is claustrophobically presented and it's never an easy watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle of Algiers is a controversial film about the struggle of Algerian rebels to throw off French occupation. The film depicts the guerrilla tactics of the Algerian insurgency as well as the French counter-insurgency designed to contain and squash the rebellion. Shot in a documentary/newsreel style, the film follows several narrative threads, and takes us inside the command structures on both sides of the conflict. The film ironically points out that the French commander was part of the resistance against the Nazis, and now he's in the role of the occupier, using his knowledge of resistance against those struggling for freedom. Though The Battle of Algiers has a natural back and forth rhythm, showing attacks by one side and then counter attacks by the other, in the end the film's conscience sides with the Algerians struggling for independence and against colonialism. Even though both sides are shown committing acts of violence against civilians, leading some to believe the film is being objective and neutral, the film gives a clear sense of purpose to the Algerians and celebrates their ultimate victory, even though they lose the battle portrayed in the film. As a result The Battle of Algiers was banned in France for 5 years, and the film stands as a powerful depiction of revolutionary struggle against foreign occupation, as well as the lengths colonial powers will go to in order to maintain their empires."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Battle of Algiers\" amazed me at how real everything was. Of course it was only but a few years after this whole revolution took place so the feelings and passion was still there. Not one person ever came out of character because they embodied those people so well (some even played themselves). It was really amazing to see so many people so passionate about a movie. I'm sure the actors didn't even care about the paycheck. They knew they were a part of something special and wanted to make it great. It's a shame it was banned in the United States, for it could have taught us a lot and maybe we wouldn't even have had so much support for the War in Iraq or Afghanistan. People would have seen similarities between the two. This film is universal because so many people have colonization in their heritages. Millions of people can relate to this film which is what makes it a must-see."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gillo Pontecorvos portrayal of the Algerian war against the French paratroopers carefully studies conflict of war and how violence, through escalation, only brings sorrow to those surrounding communities. Pontecorvo's and Franco Salinas' screenplay is very well articulated with memorable quotes and a dramatic structure which that continue to keep the picture tense yet emotionally intriguing. Both Pontecorvo and Salinas chose an interaction of characters from both sides of the war to feel passionate about their stance, thus leaving the picture to sympathize for both peoples, the FLN and the French civilians. Through the deaths of innocents, violence begins to escalate from the beginning, all the way to an explosive ending. Though no protagonist took the film by storm, Pontecorvo weaved a film where all the characters were equally felt for. His structure feels like a race of increasing violent acts, beginning with small gun battles and moving into the direction of time-bombs as acts of terrorism and revenge came soaring. Ennio Morricone's score couldn't help the picture anymore than make it an emotional driven roller-coaster, providing a tear or two in the process. When tension could be felt, Morricone exploded the scene with what sounds like a score of haunting rattling noises that get louder and louder. And finally, when tragedy strikes, like the scene when the Algerians begin looking for their loved ones in the bombs ruffle, Morricone goes into a haunting notion of a score driving one to feel sympathy for the Algerians. Overall, The Battle of Algiers is a foreign right masterpiece telling the horrors of terrorism, without creating a protagonist to sympathize for. It does for what real war does, incorporate a viewpoint from both sides and showcase the peoples pride each side has. It is a haunting story about sacrifices, pride and justice all told to portray freedom as something not so free."

        "review_detailed_main": "No need to add to the assessment of this film's quality, but I can throw some light on aspects of the film. Someone who was present at the making of this film clarified to me what the significance of this film was, and why certain things are as they are.\n\nThis film was commissioned after independence during the short reign of Ben Bella, but was not completed until after the coup of Boumedienne. The short- lived Ben Bella revolution was full of the ideals of genuine peace-loving idealism and cooperative socialism. The dispassionate message of the film was very much in tune with the intellectual thinking of the regime. (Compare, perhaps ,the film \"Memories of Underdevelopment\").\n\nUnfortunately the regime was easy prey for a military coup which happened during the making of the film. The crowd scenes, remarked on as so authentic, were in fact made so because this was the only form of gathering allowed immediately after the coup, and one is watching an odd blend of staging and reality, where Algerians were taking to the streets in a disguised protest against the coup.\n\nAre there any heroes in the film? Well, yes. If one looks closely towards the end of the film one can see the scrawled message \"Un seule hero - le peuple\" - (only one hero - the people).\n\nIn a way then, one is witnessing not just a film about what had passed, but the beginning of the unfolding of the Algerian tragedy as it later became, and that is part of the film's potency.\n\nBeware of seeing this film and the events it portrays through today's prism. The question of religion did not arise - the movements were anti-colonial & nationalistic at first, as portrayed. Later socialist, secular, communistic and cooperative, but finally succumbing to militarism. These cannot be termed as \"Muslim\". Only after the failures of the subsequent militaristic and anti-democratic governments that popular political Islam gained in importance.\n\nAs a footnote it may be observed that one of the Milk Bar bombers became a political figure in her own right, married a later president, and is, as I write, the Vice-President of the Council of the Nation. In appearance, she could still easily be mistaken for a French women."

Its director Gillo Pontecorvo uses Neo-Italian Realism and a monochromatic setting to show the racial tension between the French and the Algerians. The actors are mostly Algerians, and the film is spoken 95% of the time in French. It maybe fair to say that this movie is another Conquest movie of how people of a different belief are ruled under European Ideology. This movie shows the tactics the Gorillas used to slowly one by one take down French officers. However, there is on thing that will impact you is the involvement of children throughout the film. We see children from the Gorilla side being used by their mothers as a decoyed to smuggle bombs to French own/run places. We also see the children in the places where the Gorillas bombed, and also where the French set gun fire or bombed. The Director did this to show the innocent people that lost their lives for independence. This is a movie that makes you think about the price of Freedom and who really does suffer. It's sad once you think of it."

The visceral nature of the film showing the atrocities committed by the French Military and the FLN can be quite difficult to watch. The way in which the film does not take sides or portray either of them to be 'Good' or 'Bad' shows how committed the Director (Gillo Pontecorvo) was to giving the audience a realistic account of the Revolution. With strong acting, special effects and stunning cinematography La battaglia di Algeri stands the test of time and is still one of the most important Third Cinema products and Influential films of the 1960s."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even tough the director of the movie neither french nor Algerian it is more on the Algerian sight since I felt more empathy towards Algerian sight. Yet some parts of the movie gives tips about the Algerian culture but it doesn't fulfill the theme or philosophy under it for example when Ali la Pointe says Hasan \"I only afraid god\" it is because Muslims are taught to be afraid of god but it is not the afraid in literal meaning. To be afraid of god is if one do something wrong he/she looses the god's compassion and consent . The earth born people are not the subject of to be afraid of so you don't have to lie or do wrong on a purpose of being threatened feelings. how these people kill the french then? because it is permissible to kill to defend your country in Islam. Further more it is the highest rank to die as a veteran for your country. Veterans are the most respectable and sensitive points of Muslim cultures. More over, the reporter's voice saying that that the Muslim's echoing with those unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries is actually called \"zilgit\" . conversely what reporter defines zilgit , it is actually thrown at the weddings or folk dancing . it is basically the sound of the excitement of happiness or ecstasy of being together or celebrating something with other people. it is the sound of sharing a common excitement together. the french reporter saying about zilgit as unintelligible sound is very alien definition . Eastern Muslim people act mostly emotionally and so called\" unintelligibly by western mentality. Algerian people is absolutely oppressing at the casbah and being torched at the prisons Algerian people is considered as an ignorant and uncivilized people by french . Soldiers laughs at the man drooping mouses out of his box .it is obvious that they are less developed in technology and science as other Muslim countries but their immaterial world is more developed than french even tough french don't realize it. such as their pride and woman's dignity is their dignity either they know that woman or not it's a divine matter. These people live for their dignity . that's the reason Ali la Pointe hit the guy instead of running away police. They have a sad state of freedom in casbah and considered as a link or number but human by french. they are torched killed oppressed. The psychological battle is as intense as physical one. french mostly announce or dictate that NFL is nonfunctional and announce the names who were captured. on the other hand even a child believes their freedom battle he sneaks and takes the microphone and courage people. NFL was been dissolved but they throw themselves to the roads with the cloth flags and making their body a bulwark because It's this way: being captured is beside the point, the point is not to surrender."

Even though the movie tries to explain a terrorists motives, by no means does it ever justify them. Displaying both sides in equal light, where neither the terrorists, or the colonizers are ever displayed in a more positive light than the other.\n\nBeautifully shot in black and white, and with an amazing soundtrack that accentuates every moment and feeling of the movie, there is no reason to be disappointed with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Who says history lessons have to be boring and drawn out? They can also be visceral and intense in the form of a movie like The Battle of Algiers. This film tells the story of one of the bloodiest revolutions in history. The French occupied Algeria was a desolate and harrowing landscape that became a bloody battleground for the revolutionaries who would stop at nothing to regain control of their country. The film focuses on the leaders of the revolution as they plan violent terrorist attacks against the French to show them they are deathly serious. Parts of the film are also from the French army perspective, following General Mathieu as he hunts down the leaders of the revolution and aims to take them down one by one. These two perspectives create a balanced view of the war, one where we are never quite sure who is in the wrong and it is up to the audience to discern if the shamelessly brutal methods the Algerians use to gain independence are justified or not. It is a difficult film, but one that is executed with visceral beauty and grandeur.\n\nThe Battle of Algiers is a fascinating film that tells a emotionally chilling story about the determination and anguish of the Algerian people. Both sides are victimized in this story as the Algerians have their freedoms stripped and the French civilians living in Algeria pay the price through the revolutionaries acts of terrorism. There is a steadfast amount of determination here that is almost disturbing. However, I refrain from saying it is reasonable but there is of course reason behind the violence. These people want their freedom and they will stop at nothing to gain it. The various characters and perspectives in the film exemplify this determination so well and at such tense lengths that there are times where you won't even believe your eyes.\n\nOn that note, The Battle of Algiers is also an intense audio-visual experience. The sights and sounds of the film are haunting yet so compelling. Ennio Morricone, one of the all time greatest film composers, leads the action of the film with a brilliantly chilling score which makes scenes of destruction and desolation all the more harrowing. The film never holds back, displaying to us the grotesque results of the violence which this revolution brings about. Bodies of children. Demolished homes of innocent civilians. These things disturb us and yet we never know who to blame. It makes the film all the more fascinating. Gillo Pontecorvo directs with harrowing grace and glorious chaos that absorbs us into the action so well. We are thrown into such insanity and disorder via the noisy rallies and the always bustling streets of the ravaged Algeria. The Battle of Algiers is a film which throws us into the middle of an experience and forces itself upon us, making us handle every emotion. It is not just a film, it's an experience.\n\nBy todays standards, The Battle of Algiers may not seem like much but considering it was a film made in 1966 this is an impressive feat. The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It is brutally honest and viscerally real. You won't find films like this from the time period often, especially ones that chronicle true events. This is a triumph in filmmaking that has forever changed the face of political cinema."

After viewing the film, I later decided to review it at length.\n\nOriginally released in 1966, Gillo Pontecorvo's film graphically depicts the Algerian urban uprising against the French colonial administration. It is filmed in black and white, in the form of a semi-documentary. Considering the subject matter, it remains astoundingly non-partisan while striving for objectivity -which it attains. There are striking similarities between the film and recent events in the American-led war on terror. As a matter of fact, this film portrays the inherent paradoxes of terrorism in such a clear way that one can only wish that it captivated a wider audience -particularly among policy-makers. The boundaries between freedom-fighter and terrorist are cleverly blended leaving it up to the viewer which side to pick. This is no Hollywood flick so the moral choice is not served to us on a silver platter. Both sides are guilty of war crimes.\n\nNaturally the film works on many levels and will certainly be enjoyed by the film buff as well as anyone interested in wider political issues. The soundtrack deserves specific mentioning, coming as it does from the maestro Ennio Morricone himself.\n\nThe film gives an inside account of the tough decisions policy-makers are forced to make on a daily basis when it comes to foreign occupation. Sensitive viewers beware: this film contains gritty violence that carries a sense of realism that will remain with you for days."

While counting all the historical war films and tales battle of freedom fights in my mind I noticed that most of the films came with excessive use of cinematic liberty and The Battle Of Algiers just changed the entire course of filmmaking in this genre. This film is historically accurate yet dramatic and gives the same chills as fictional stories. The video material involved in this film is sensitive and brutal which makes it highly realistic and mostly authentic. As an audience we feel those situations, those riots, those screams, those explosion, those massacre and the outrage of the people which makes this film more special than any other historical film. It is shot in Black While and the narrative is given a touch of documentary filming and in result of it we enjoy the experience of watching both the streams of cinema, documentary and feature film. It may feel disturbing at several occasions but without all that hard-hitting treatment you will never understand the importance of those events. The major chunk of actors in this film is non-professional yet carries the ride smoothly. Cinematography is brilliant as you can see how it zoom in when needed and how it pans when needed. These are technical things and if you understand them then it's better for you to judge this film. Even after keeping all the historical events realistic and less dramatic, The Battle Of Algiers still manages to give plenty of High cinematic moments where goosebumps are guaranteed. Gillo Pontecorvo's direction is lesson to all the filmmakers that how to make an extraordinary film without losing sense of reality. The way he crafted and presented this revolutionary battle is nothing short of an incredible achievement. This Cult Classic deserves more attention and praise than other dramatic circus shows.\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

More films are dumb down today than ever before in my humble opinion. Maybe it's because we're all getting dumber, or maybe it's because capitalism has entwined itself in American film culture and utterly corrupted it. Needless to say, the sense of realism in films like Ladri di Biciclette, and this film, La battaglia di Algeri, seems otherwise extinct. I come from a documentary photography background and I cringe at most movies for how plastic they all are. I admire a sense of truth in everything. But from clich\u00e9 romances with overpaid A-List celebrities, to absurd, fictional epics featuring talentless actors like Nick Cage and Brendon Frazier, we rarely see truth in film. The Battle of Algiers is so pure and captivating it restored faith in cinema completely for me. It is an epic of realism and emits startling truths about war and insurgency. All the while it accomplishes this reenactment of a time in history without the slightest sense of fabrication. Rarely do I applaud a movie at the credits, but at the end of Algiers, I wanted a standing ovation. Summary: A masterpiece."

What is even rarer is what makes this film so good: it is perhaps the most successful documentary approach recreation of actual events ever produced.\n\nOne of the biggest keys to the documentary approach of the film is the fact that the actors do not seem to be acting. Often it is the very fact that actors do seems to be acting that can kill the reality of a film like this one yet this represents one of the successful attempts at using not just actors but non-actors to create a seamless whole. In fact one of the best decisions made by Gillo Pontecorvo was to cast Saadi Yacef who was directly involved in the real events to effectively play himself. The advantage of this is that it adds an even greater degree of verisimilitude to the film and its approach.\n\nThe documentary approach is in fact the very key to the success of The Battle Of Algiers. The cinematography wobbles, zooms and frames in the way that a documentary film would if filming these events as they were taking place and gives the film the visual reference of a documentary. The result of this is the feeling in the midst of riots, shooting, bombings, meetings, torturing etc. In short the film gives the feeling of being in the midst of a modern revolution from both sides of it.\n\nIn fact it is the very fact that The Battle Of Algiers covers both sides that makes the film stand-out. It is true that the filmmakers have an obvious bias for the FLN, yet one must look deeper into the film. Despite that bias the film pulls no punches on the morals of terrorism. The very fact that is shows shooting and bombings up close and personal and the aftermaths as well in perhaps the single best example of this. Neither side be it the FLN with their terrorist attacks of the French with their paratroopers using torture is portrayed as the definite good guys or bad guys to put it in more conventional, literal terms. The film proves that one point of view is as valid as the other, something rather unique to this film. The bias is for the FLN and the journey of Ali La Pointe from average Algerian to revolutionary yet the fact is that the film shows both sides. The point of this: nobody is right yet nobodies wrong and both sides of any conflict must understand this. That fact alone makes the film as relevant today as it was forty plus years ago.\n\nAnother strong element of the film is its rather sparse score. The score was a collaboration between films core master Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo and it is proof of the old saying less is more. The score provided emotional clout to an all ready emotionally charged film from the almost thunderous paratrooper theme to the heartbreaking piece used in the aftermath of both the French and FLN bombings. In fact that latter piece alone makes clear the intent of those scenes: human suffering in universal no matter which side of a conflict you are on. It is a unique score for a unique film.\n\nThe Battle Of Algiers is a unique film in many ways. From the verisimilitude of its cast to its documentary approach and unique view of modern revolutions and terrorism, few films can match the sheer power and realism of this film. It is this uncommon aspect that makes the film unique even some four decades after it was made. For anyone seeking a unique insight into modern terrorism or seeking a fine example of how a film can bring history to life after the event I recommend The Battle Of Algiers without hesitation. Watch it, learn from it and be all the better for it."

        "review_title": "Powerful film decades later",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" is a stunning black-and-white film which tells the story of the violent clashes between Algerian Nationalists and their French Colonial rulers in the 1950s, but mostly tells of the rise and fall of the spirited 1957 resistance campaign. At several times I wondered if I was watching documentary footage, as this obscure film achieves tremendous realism with expansive casts of extras, sparse music, excellent crowd sound and on-location shooting. At many times it does feel closer to documentary than scripted drama as it follows many stories, but chiefly that of Ali la Pointe, an illiterate petty criminal who becomes radicalized in prison and rises to the upper echelons of the resistance. The movie shows atrocities committed by both sides and doesn't seem to show undue sympathy for either, a remarkable accomplishment for any film, let alone one made so soon after the events and on such an emotionally charged topic as colonial resistance and terrorism.\n\nAt some points the film rivals the great scenes of any crime and war movie as we see the characters on both sites execute their plots, be it paratroopers storming a rebel hideout or female bombers infiltrating hangouts in the European Quarter. The pacing is a bit slow at times, at least compared to the just-for-entertainment greats of the genre like The Godfather or Goodfellas, where this film's 5+ minute female bombers sequence would be shaved down to a minute and set to orchestral or rock music. The slow pacing, even if it's to a bit less exploitative music, does come off as a weak point of the movie, but one must remember that this movie is conveying meaningful emotion and real-world lessons, it's not just showing us people committing intricately planned acts of violence because it looks cool on screen.\n\nMuch is said about how those real-world lessons of the movie, especially as the subject is Islamic terrorism against white occupiers. If there's a better movie about an insurgency and guerrilla resistance, I haven't seen it. While I think it's foolish to act as if seeing this movie will give one all the answers about the terrorism question, it's certainly something you should be able to see and accept before you start spouting off opinions about dealing with terrorism - or counter-terrorism."

The right sovereignty of a state and the right of freedom are the themes of this movie. Even in this movie we see many connections to the Italian NE realism, like for instance the choice to use non professional actors, and to shoot the movie on actual location where the real events took place. Overall I found this movie very violent but also very thought full. We could compare the issue of Frnace colonialism over Aljerie with many other current events. The use of non professional actors made this movie even more realistic."

This may have been the history of most developing countries in the world. India can be a bright example. But, I have not seen a finer depiction of a rebellion for independence than this movie. I would rate it along with Battleship Potemkin, as the best propaganda movie, I have ever seen.\n\nThe specialty of this movie is the way it is filmed. Black and white cinematography which also gives the impression of a documentary. I really thought, I was watching a documentary in History Channel than an actual movie. Editing is crisp as well, which really helps in not lingering in the death scenes which is the case in many other movies. The movie does not have a single protagonist or antagonist which according to me is the victory of the movie.\n\nI am so glad I watched this movie as not only a part of movie history, but a part of world history as well.\n\nRating : 9/10"

The performances in \"The Battle of Algiers\" are compelling, with Brahim Hadjadj, Jean Martin, and Yacef Saadi delivering standout portrayals.

        "review_title": "A unique film, and one that everyone should see",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Battle Of Algiers documents the Algerian peoples fight for independence from the French in the 50's and 60's. Heavily inspired by the Italian neo-realist movement, Director Pontecorvo used hundreds of non-actors and shot the entire film on location. This all adds to the documentary like photography with which the account is presented, setting it apart from all other war films, imbuing the action with a shocking sense of realism comparable to a news report of a real terrorist demonstration. Despite being a docu-film on the Algerian insurrection against the French, a conflict that has long been resolved, the film still remains extremely significant today, particularly due to the current American occupation of Iraq.\n\nAlthough I enjoy and appreciate more mainstream war films such as Apocalypse Now and Platoon, The Battle Of Algiers uncovers the pointlessness of conflict and the harsh repercussions of it, like no other war film I have seen. Taking a deliberately impartial stance, the torture based methods of interrogation employed by the French troops are juxtaposed with the violent terrorist attacks of the Algerians. This powerfully illustrates the destruction caused by both sides, and how their tactics, although different in nature, are united in their ugliness and betrayal of humanitarian values, causing nothing but death and suffering. In this respect, the film documents like no other the sad foolishness of trying to solve conflicts with violence, causing maximum loss on both sides, perpetuating conflict rather than preventing it. The Battle Of Algiers is also instrumental in emphasising how the actions of an extremist group using violent methods, can result in a racial hatred of an entire ethnic minority. This occurrence resonates powerfully across western civilisation in a supposedly enlightened 21st century, where hundreds of innocent civilians are labelled as potential terrorists because of a select few who choose to cause destruction."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a scene in The Battle of Algiers that left me in awe. It is a wide shot of a road with a right turn up a slope. Hundreds of Algerians pack the street in a strike for independence while a huge French tank rolls across the tarmac towards these people, forcing them to the sidewalks. The scene's unbelievable realism stems from director Gillo Pontecorvo's decision to shoot on location, use local non-professional actors, and achieving a grainy, organic visual style through hand-held cameras and newsreel style editing.\n\nThe entire film is shot in this manner. As a result, The Battle of Algiers is often considered a breakthrough in cinema, the first of its kind. It is a fictional film based on something that has happened in real life, and of which it portrays so realistically that it is hard to believe that it is not a two-hour long documentary footage.\n\nReleased only four years after the independence of Algeria, Pontecorvo's film touches upon a nation's suffering and hope during the French occupation, detailing the violent activities of the National Liberation Front (FLN in abbreviated French), a revolutionary group that was systematically wiped out but whose sacrificial efforts became etched in the collective psyche of the Algerians, prompting them to rise up to their oppressors.\n\nThe film is also noted especially for its outstanding direction, of which Pontecorvo deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for. Scenes where hundreds of innocent Algerians roam the streets only to be gunned down by the French military evoke a powerful sense of unjust and tragedy. The use of wide, composed shots and long lens allow the situation to unfold almost like a live event, its visual scope unparalleled at that time.\n\nOf equal impressiveness are scenes of bombs planted by the FLN that explode in a number of crowded places. The camera captures the real-time explosions as the non-actors try frantically to get away from the blast. Considering that this was the sixties when computer visual effects were not in existence yet, these dangerous feats could only be filmed as they happened.\n\nEven though Pontecorvo's film tries to emphasize on the plight of the Algerians (with disturbing scenes of torture), it is still a fair, unbiased take on the French military. It portrays Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the chief officer in charge of restoring order to the colony, as someone who understands and sympathizes with the enemy, attempting to seek cooperation with them rather than trying to annihilate them.\n\nPontecorvo's use of Ennio Morricone's deeply haunting music as accompaniment to scenes of Algerian victims of bombings (and later, French civilian victims in another sequence) reflects the collateral effect of war on those caught in the crossfire. In many sequences, a running radio commentary delivering propagandistic messages is broadcasted, heightening the sense of realism already so vividly brought to the screen.\n\nWidely regarded as one of cinema's most important films, The Battle of Algiers is still not widely seen by the mainstream audience. That needs to change because this is a masterpiece, a film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.\n\nSCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

        "review_title": "A prequel for \"The day of the Jackal\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Director Gillo Pontecorvo had a strong political awareness. He always took the side of the oppressed. In 1960 he made a film about Jews in a concentration camp (\"Kapo\"), in 1969 he made a fim about a slave revolt (\"Queimada\") and in 1979 he made a film about the oppression of the Basque bij the Franco dictatorship (\"Operacion Ogro\").\n\n\"The battle of Algiers\" (1966) is about the colonial war France fought in Algeria from 1954 to 1962. It ended in the indepence of Algeria. The film is situated in a time when the liberation movement of Algeria (FLN) rules the Kasbah and the French army is dominant in the European part of town. There are only a few films about the Algerian war. The only other one I know is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann) and this film only has an indiect link. The action in this film is set in motion by a part of the French army who is frustrated by the defeat in the Algerian war.\n\n\"The battle of Algiers\" has a documentary look and feel. The film was even used as instruction film in military training. As a semi documentary the film gives a nuanced picture of the war. Pontecorvo takes the side of the FLN (the oppressed side) but that does not mean that he is blind for the cruelties they commit. There is a scene in which female solders of the FLN are installing time bombs on a busy place. After they have done their job, their gaze just glides over the crowd. A crowd from which many will be dead in a couple of minutes.\n\nThe French are led by Colonel Mathieu, a ruthless person who does not shy away for the most horrible forms of torture. He is however not only a savage beast but a cool politician as well. Somewhere in the film he remarks that the war ultimately will be decided in the public opinion at home. A statement that turned out to be very true for the Vietnam-war, that was still going on when this film was made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The theme of Battle of Algiers is universal in nature: The struggle between the \"occupied\" and their \"occupiers\". It chiefly deals with what the great social scientist Franz Fanton termed in his classic The wretched of the earth, \"the pitfalls of national consciousness\" \u0096 colonialism. While it seeks to depict the colonial strife between the native Algerians and their French occupiers, what makes this film so potent even today is its ability to transcend global barriers; it could apply just as well to the Palestinian problem, to Afghanistan, our very own monumental struggle against the British Raj, or to any of the classic Latin American standoffs that pit a US-backed rightist government against Marxist left-wing guerrillas \u0096 be it Nicaragua or El Salvador.\n\nThe film depicts an important segment in the Franco-Algerian colonial strife \u0096 the urban skirmishes between the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French paratroopers between 1954-1957, commonly known as the \"Battle of Algiers\".\n\nIt opens with the brutal interrogation of an FLN member by the French paratroopers, who is tortured into giving the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe, an important FLN fighter. We next see the roll of credits while French paratroopers are storming the Kasbah (The native Arab quarter) with a view to surround Ali La Pointe with Ennio Morricone's riveting martial soundtrack hammering away in the background. The next frame shows Ali being asked to surrender or face death by dynamite. The screen then dissolves on a pensive Ali and the viewer sees the story gradually unfold in the form of a flashback.\n\nThis astounding opening sequence sets the standard for what is to follow for the remainder of the film. Director Gillo Pontecorvo, himself a man of the left, was greatly influenced by his mentor Roberto Rossellini's Paisan(1946), which made great use of \"naturalism\". Along with Marxist writer Franco Solinas, Pontecorvo fashioned a screenplay which would be enacted by natural actors \u0096 not big name stars (in fact, with the exception of the French Paratroop Colonel Mathieu, played by stage actor Jean Martin, the rest of the cast is entirely made up of non-professionals!).\n\nThis, coupled with the usage of 16 mm hand-held cameras gave the film a stunning feel of \"realism\" which is usually brought about by a documentary film \u0096 especially in the mob scenes with the Algerian women chanting hysterically. As a result, this led to many viewers and critics being confused as to whether this film was a documentary or not containing several reels of footage. (The producers as a result, proudly put a general disclaimer on the film stating not a single reel had been used)\n\nPontecorvo and Solinas strongly took the median path when dealing with the politics of the French and Algerian sides, though polemically siding with the FLN. The film documents the brutalities of the French paratroopers \u0096 as is evident in chilling scenes depicting torture by using blowtorches and half-drowning victims in their efforts to decapitate the FLN, while balancing those with the terror tactics of the FLN \u0096 as in the bombing of French public places of leisure and entertainment. The objective nature of the film, its sanctimonious attitude towards truth, and its supercharged atmosphere of political awareness have undoubtedly inspired future filmmakers like Costa-Gavras, Marcel Ophuls and Oliver Stone.\n\nFor instance, we see in the best works of Costa-Gavras like Z and State of Siege, a frenetic tension and sense of political urgency which makes one aware of the reality of time and place in which one is living in.\n\nAnd as for timeliness and reality, Battle of Algiers is an uncomfortable reminder of the Iraqi occupation, posing important questions on colonialism, imperialism and the relationship between the \"occupier\" and the \"occupied\"."

Battle Of Algiers showcases the pulse of racial tension as the Algerian people begin to fight for their independence from French occupation. It is a true test of character to give up control for another's freedom and the French are definitely not portrayed as compassionate people in this film, but rather rational when the Algerians are left to act irrationally out of desperation and a place of extreme emotions. The actions of both sides heinous but the really atrocity comes from the act of insubordination. Making others feel dehumanized and inferior alone would be cause for revolt. This film speaks to a person's soul and truly makes me appreciate freedom to choose my religion and carry out the traditions pertaining to, without judgment or persecution. Shot as if it could've taken place in real life, you see both sides take a stand, who would you side with? Watch this film to experience a fight for the right to life!"
