        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed by:Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.4/5 stars\n\nSay what you want about Rohit Shetty, but the man sure does know to mindlessly entertain you, unlike many of his clones spawned over the past few years, who just numb your senses with their weak endeavors in trying to ape his brand of easygoing, risk-free cinema. \"Chennai Express\" is actually his best work since \"All The Best\" (though nothing compared to \"All The Best\"), and does have a semblance of plot and even some heart, which is usually not the case with most of his projects. The film exceeds expectations for the mere fact that it entertains you for most its duration.\n\nLet's not even try and get into the other technical and creative aspects (or flaws) of the film, because if any of you'll went into a Rohit Shetty movie looking for a coherent plot narration or solid character development, then you'll need a serious reality check, or rather a surgical extraction of your prudish natures. The songs (barring the \"1 2 3 4\" number), editing, and production design are admittedly all over the place, but then again you should be well prepared to ignore these parameters. However, the background score and cinematography are surprisingly quite decent.\n\nFor his part, SRK necessarily hams it up delightfully to the hilt and renders a slightly tweaked and caricatured version of his now famous \"Rahul\" persona. And Deepika's acting is finally showing signs of real improvement. She literally shines in some scenes of the movie. What adds some required chutzpah to this potboiler, is the sizzling chemistry between the two. Their second film together gives sufficient indication that we might have the next hot jodi in Bollywood.\n\n\"Chennai Express\" is melodramatic and over-the-top, but it certainly isn't tedious and long-drawn like most other wannabe masala films. You'll gladly lap it up over the disoriented \"Bodyguards\", \"Ek Tha Tigers\", \"Singhams\", \"Himmatwalas\", \"Son Of Sardars\" and \"Rowdy Rathores\" anyday. Most of the dialogues and gags are actually humorous and the action at the end at least makes the hero feel human (something that can't be said for the other staple masala heroes like Salman and Ajay). At the end of the day, if you don't analyze \"Chennai Express\" too much, you'll actually end up having quite an entertaining 140-minute ride."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chennai Express delivers what was expected from a commercial spicy masala entertainer. The movie has got no great story as the title tells you the one line \"Express love on a journey\". It's a usual SRK movie with Rohit Shetty style of execution.\n\nSince the plot surrounds strong Tamil background I have to tell you my analysis in two views 1. As a viewer like me from Tamil Nadu 2. As a Non tamilian viewer As a viewer like me from Tamil Nadu it was like a spoof of 1980's Tamil movie and sometimes looked like humiliating Tamilians. For a non Tamil viewer like my friends they did like the Tamil base in it. Since we can see so much of Tamil influence in Bollywood industry nowadays. To start off with singers from Tamil, actors from Tamil like Dhanush directors from Tamil AR Murugadoss and choreographers from Tamil Prabhudeva. But it does promise you to stay glued to your seats by all the necessary ingredients.\n\nSRK as usual a non serious Indian blushing types of hero and was yet again with his trade name Rahul. He does a great job and gives what was demanded for a film like this. At least this time he has come with a character with an age of 40.\n\nWorth mention would be the lady lead Deepika Padukone she has done an excellent job by adapting the Tamil style of English and Hindi speaking. She was shown well in the movie with her beautiful makeover.\n\nSatyaraj plays the father fits the role picture perfect. The villain has done justice to the role of Thangaballi. There are so many gigantic long haired fatty black goons you will see in the movie. Direction,Camera, Music and Editing were good as per requirements for a spicy masala.\n\nMusic was very good particularly \"Titli\" was a good breezy romantic number that makes us hum after we come out of the theater.\n\nI have to say the positives were Deepika,SRK and music. Negatives were the sets and Tamil base were over colored and totally artificial.\n\nGet in for a movie which has got something for everyone in the family to keep you entertained for 2 hours 20 mins.\n\n-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran\n\n(bsiva84@gmail.com)"

Yes there were few action scenes here and there, but it was not very \"over the top\" as was synonymous with a Shetty movie. For me, I will not tag it as a complete \"no brainer mindless masala flick\", as it surely isn't.\n\nComing to acting, SRK's comic timing was impeccable even when he was hamming through the scenes, it was done with a purpose, but finally it was Deepika Padukone who stole the hearts with her endearing performance. And did I mention it was funny, rather hilarious at times.\n\nA complete Family Entertainer.\n\nThose who don't feel laughing their hearts out won't hurt their intellect, will surely love this movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "Since the days of Chak De India, judging his grace & his stupendous acting skills, I am a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan. A man of substance, he shows his skills in every film through his strong dialogue delivery & a firm grip over the emotional phenomena of the film. Every film he does, he makes it new for his audience & that is what makes him a stand-out actor.\n\nJust few hours back, I caught up with his new film released today 'Chennai Express' directed by the Singham & Golmaal director Rohit Shetty, co-starring Deepika Padukone. It showed the King of Romance in a dynamic never-seen-before avatar & some fun-rolled laughter & Rohit Shetty style action.\n\nNot much of surprise, the film touches all the genres of Bollywood completing a circle of entertainment. The film is the mixture of both: humour as well as some serious action. Frankly, I only liked Shetty for Golmaal & Singham. I found that mostly his films lacked sensibility & displayed some mindless insensitive action. But the fact that Shah Rukh Khan is starring in it made me really look into Chennai Express. Because as far as I know SRK, he is one of intelligent brains in Bollywood & knows completely well what he is up to.\n\nNot deviating from Chennai Express, I would like to tell about the plot. The story is about Rahul, a 40 year unmarried man, who lives with his grandparents in Mumbai. After his grandfather's death, Rahul embarks on a journey to Goa but a series of confusions & misunderstanding, he finds himself in Chennai Express, a train that brings a big turn in the life of Rahul leading him to the place where he is destined to be.\n\nFrustrated of his misfortune about not being able to go to Goa, Rahul meets Meenama, a South Indian girl from Kumban village in Chennai. She happens to be the pivotal part of the film that changes the monotony of Rahul's life. Rahul witnesses the ticket checker of the train being thrown in the waters from running train by the Tamil goons who happen to have kidnapped Meenama, thus being the only witness to the incident. Rahul is plunged into the world where he is being pestered, troubled & led into some humorous mishap. Shetty has depicted all of this in funny way that audience find themselves having the best time of their lives.\n\nChennai Express is sheer entertainment with fun-filled comedy all over. There is action, romance & humour throughout the film. It will leave smiles on everyone's faces when they leave the theatre. It is very impressive and unlike all Rohit Shetty films, it has the powerful element of emotion, the element which Indian directors use to uplift their standard of cinema. The songs are combination of foot-tapping numbers as well as some melodiously extravagant songs. If you have caught up with all Rohit Shetty films, this one you will be the most satisfied with. The first time collaboration of Rohit Shetty- SRK duo will undoubtedly set the box office registers ringing."

From the start the movie tries to merge the culture of north India and south India which resulted some romantic and creative moments in the movie which also generated good chemistry between the main actor and actress.Cinematography and art direction in this movie really captured the different cultures of south India and north India.Magnificent sets and music numbers added the well needed color to the movie. Chennai Express is a movie which is a fun and entertaining movie but it's no way near a thinking movie.The movie tries to give out a message pointing out how Indian woman lack freedom that message is lost through the comedy of the movie. For a person who is tired of watching movies with serious plot twists this movie is a well deserve break.But if a person tries to logically evaluate this movie then that person will fail miserably.To have a good time in the movie hall this is a well recommended movie."

Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal makes it interesting. Dialogues by Sajid - Farhad is witty and impressing. You can say dialogues are the best part of this film. After long time I watched a movie which is far better than its promos and trailer. This movie has more humor and romance than action except the climax. Movie would have been more interesting if creative team would have preferred to flex their brain muscles rather than flexing the body muscles in climax as it was in Singham. Action in climax makes the film exaggerated otherwise it always moves on a sweet pace. Shahrukh Khan can carry emotional scene better than the action one. Actually , he is incomparable and best in emotional scenes. Performance wise Deepika Padukone is brilliantly awesome. She acts with ease and makes the character believable. Shahrukh Khan is also commendable. His comedy timing is superb. In climax emotional speech, he is the one and only one, who could have emoted it so convincingly. Rest cast supports the film in fair manner. Music by Vishal and Shekhar is not so good at audio level but in film, it gels with mood and flow. After all one time must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I went to watch Chennai Express, I had in my mind that it was a Rohit Shetty movie and hence it couldn't be very good. I knew it could be highly nonsensical. I just hoped it would've a sensible plot. And I am glad to say it does have a sensible plot. It's little forced and unconvincing at times, but it's extremely entertaining. This is the story of Rahul, played by Shah Rukh Khan, who isn't satisfied with his life. His life takes a turn, when he meets Meena, played by Deepika Padukone, on Chennai Express. In following events, the movie shifts to South India of amazingly beautiful locations and significantly developed villages. The movie though keeps delivering hilarious punches, the story gets a bit stagnant. Meanwhile the two songs, \"Titli\" and \"Tera Rasta Chodoon Na\" lend movie the romantic texture. The fighting sequence was realistic and hence very unlike the Rohit Shetty films. Talking about acting, this isn't how I would like Shah Rukh Khan to act but then it is that kind of film. Deepika Padukone is amazing in her portrayal of a Tamil girl. The music by Vishal-Shekhar is quite decent. Rohit Shetty's direction seems evolved and I think this is his best film by now. He hasn't been very good with his movies' endings but this one has a fine climax that leaves us with a smile on our face. I'll go with 7 on the scale of 10."

Amazing comedy timing, carefully written script, beautifully shot and two absolutely BRILLIANT actors. Deepika in particular is exceptionally good! She does so well that Shahrukh is side lined in a number of scenes they have together! The support cast and background actors do a fab job too.\n\nA lot had been written and said about what is the need for Shahrukh to follow the others and be a part of another brainless action flick. But thats the difference, this one is miles away from one. No south film remake, no ridiculous flying fight scenes and the female lead actually HAD a role! I never thought the two of them could actually come together and make a one of a kind film, keeping the essence of the genres that each of them is famous for intact!\n\nAn original Bollywood flick 'King Khan' and Rohit Shetty style.\n\nThe music is extremely catchy and does complete justice to the film,not being too much, but just right.So a BIG thumbs up to Vishal-Shekhar!\n\nA good comedy after a long, long time. Shahrukh had said that he took up this movie only because he was in 'splits' when he heard the script. And he's right, the script is the hero and thats why everything else falls in place. There is logic to everything.\n\nIf your a Shahrukh or Deepika fan, your're in for a treat! And the others, trust me, you will not be bored! :)\n\nSo,get on the train baby!\n\nAnd, for the record, this film does not show any of the community in bad light or try to ridicule a south Indian as it was assumed initially by a lot of people as Deepika was required to do a south accent. I agree its not completely authentic but the dialogues are so good that the different accents is just to portray the cultural difference. Me, being a part north Indian and part south Indian did not feel humiliated but enjoyed every little bit. :)"

For first half i will give 4.5 out of 5 stars and for second half 2.5 out of 5. I don't think this movie will have repeat audience like 3 idiots. But people will definitely enjoy it at least once. My only disappointment was second half. Watch CE if you are a SRK or Deepika fan, you will not get disappointed. But if you are looking for perfect then this is not the movie.

This time around , he is 40 but flirts and flies with the same intensity and is all set to party with his friends at Goa(burying aside his family responsibility, hoodwinking his granny )and as destiny would have it, he comes across a Tamil runaway-bride Meena(Deepika) and heads to Rameswaram.So one wrong train and he gets the right track in his life \u2013 that's the crux of the story that Rohit tries to bring in, with his usual elements of masala and generous doses of entertainment. Conscience hits the protagonist and he chooses parent's blessings over elopement , quite DDLJish! Isn't it ? even though he has to fight the don's(Deepika's father ) goons and the muscular hulk Hogan , Thangavvalli (Nikitin Dheer).\n\nYou would like to forgive all the clich\u00e9d melodrama if you are a die- hard SRK fan , love his buffoonery even when he tries hard to make you laugh with those silly Tamil dialogues. SRK's energy is unflinching and infectious, but I felt that Deepika stole the show with her endearing Meena and her accent. It's a thorough testament of her blazing talent, and let me tell you that it's not easy to inhabit that character.My only bone of contention was the superficial treatment towards the ending portions which made the journey look haggard.Some of Vishal Dadlani's chart-busters served hot from the pantry,of course skewed towards the second half, were indeed a pleasant respite in the narrative which seemed to propel without any creative fuel."

What it earns is only because of the publicity and marketing gimmicks by the superstar who hopes that people should worship him like the Tamil and Telgu movie stars. The movie has a very limited story which can be explained in a minute. There are no twists. Blatant advertising is used to increase revenue. Cinematography is good but with cheap script and acting make it fall in the shadows. The entire movie is based on SRK and dipika who entirely occupy the screen space. The songs have the most mindless lyrics and numbing tunes which are easily forgotten. The most unfortunate thing is to see an aging superstar who had produced great pieces of acting in his early days resort to promoting his own acting in a film which has no original acting. Watching the movie in theater is a waste of money..."

These two people have come together for the first time and combined Romance and Comedy in just the right doses with a side dish of a couple of action scenes, and they have hit the jackpot!! The audience has been enthralled and entertained...And that is why it has done the business that it has. Complete family entertainment...Leave your brains and logic at home and don't expect any social messages please. Just relax and enjoy and walk out of the cinema for this one. I know many people have their opinion that it is a masala film and they are right. It is a masala entertainer. But so are most of the successful films in Hindi cinema history with the exception of a handful. I consider this movie a must watch for the simple reason that you shall experience the true slice of Bollywood style in this one. Laugh and cry and be entertained, like the entire country has been...As a dialogue in the movie famously goes \"Don't underestimate the power of a common man!\" And the common man has spoken!

This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen. It has absolutely no entertainment value.\n\nSRK is terrible in this movie, not that he has impressed me with his acting skills in any movie. Deepika Padukone is absolutely gorgeous, but, her performance in this movie lacks acting skills. Is it the director who does not bring out the best in her, or is it the Indian audience who just wants \" Time Pass \" movies with just a couple of beautiful faces, stupid story line and making fun of dwarfs!!\n\nOMG this is such a terrible movie and got such good reviews ! Probably the reviews are paid for as a marketing gimmick."

        "review_detailed_main": "Couldn't wait for tomorrow as this movie had created so much buzz, so I decided to attend the paid previews show today (8th Aug.).\n\n**This review will neither contain any spoilers nor any fake remarks. In other words, this is an honest review.**\n\nMark my words as I say... This movie, Chennai Express, is a full-on entertainer, and you wont get bored anywhere in the long run. You will not call it \"masala film\" (a famous genre in bollywood since 2010 after release of 'Dabangg' created by movie buffs. Movies for no brainers fall under that genre.) as you walk out of the theaters, because the action and the comedy and the drama... all contain some logic behind them, all are sensible and none are not overdone. It is not like the other crappy mass entertainers like 'Rowdy Rathore', 'Dabangg 2' and Singham. Chennai Express looked promising when its posters and trailer released. Unexpectedly, it kept its promise.\n\nDirection: Rohit Shetty proved his best with this. Honestly, this is the second film from the director that I enjoyed. The first being 'Golmaal'. Anyway, the direction is flawless without any glitches.\n\nCast: The performance of the cast is excellent. After watching the film, you WILL say \"Shah Rukh Khan is back in his game\" and you will fall in love with Deepika Padukone. SRK never performed in a mass entertainer or a comedy flick before (as far as I remember), and we thought he wouldn't fit-in to this kind of a role. We, the audiences, are more used to see him acting in serious dramas like 'MNIK', 'KHNH', Chak De! India' and therefore he is famous for such stern dramatic performances. But he delivered an extraordinary performance in this film, which was so unexpected. Deepika, being a Bangalore girl, essayed a South Indian accent in this film. I found out two or three flaws in her accent, in fact anyone who watches South films will do. Still then, you will love accent and her acting is brilliant as always. Nikitin Dheer was a fitted perfectly in his role as a villain, Tangaballi. He has the perfect build and attitude to be called a \"bad-ass\".\n\nMusic: The background score is very good and original. The songs are catchy, and aren't misplaced.\n\nPlot: Adventure/Comedy/Action... all equalized. Won't discuss anymore. Watch it for yourself.\n\nEditing & everything else: Two thumbs up!\n\nOverall: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the bollywood potboilers are meant to entertain with mindless screenplay and no-sense comedy. Rohit Shetty has mastered the art of this kind of cinema. Only this time , he goes one step back and gives you a delightful action-comedy.\n\nRahul ( Sharukh Khan) boards a train Chennai Expressway to immerse his grandfather's ashes into the holy water of Rameshwaram. As he embarks on his journey , he meets Meena ( Deepika Padukone) , a small town girl who is escaping from her evil-spirited father's decision to get her married to local goon. Their fate changes the moment they land in South India.\n\nFrom the masala entertainments like Golmaal , Singham , Bol Bachan , Rohit Shetty gives yet spineless film which is enjoyable but easily forgettable once you are out of theater. The silver lining is Chennai Express is better than his previous flicks thanks to the superb acting by Sharukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. The movie begins with some glorious moments which you are sure going to love especially the ones in the train. The second half drags and the climax becomes typical bollywood melodrama with hero delivering high-content dialogues and blowing few punches. Editing could have been better and songs becomes hindrance to the pace. Art direction and cinematography is outstanding. Sharukh Khan is the scene stealer despite so many shortcomings in the movie. The actor is brilliant in his comic timings and his fans will surely love him.Deepika Padukone lends a good support with funny Hindi dialogues with Tamil accent. Overall , Chennai Express is a fun ride. It does have few glitches but Sharukh Khan compensates for that and you are entertained for 141 mins. Good 3/5"

I understand this is supposed to be a comedy/drama movie, but come on. Oh well, its made by Rohit Shetty, could not have expected anything better. The direction is horrible, more of a Tamil/Tollywood movie than a Bollywood movie. Cars flying, hero beating the crap out of 20 guys at once, I guess that turns on the audience.\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTING MOVIE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of course being an SRK fan, a huge fan, i had to see Chennai Express which i have been enthusiastically awaiting since first hearing of it. And let me just say what a great ode to SRK's past films it was. Those references add fantastic nostalgic humor to the already good humor of this fun filled adventure. A hilarious journey about a man unwillingly dragged along for the adventure of his lifetime. And what an adventure it was. Perhaps not the best SRK film and perhaps not the best film of the year, still it is entertaining and that is what counts.\n\nLet us just get this out of the way, this is not award season cinema. This film however is pure through and through entertainment for everyone in the family whether they be SRK fans, comedy lovers, adventure enthusiasts, wholesome family entertainment lovers, crazy stunts and action buffs or drama and emotion aficionados. Throw in some pretty wholesome life messages and a fun filled musical journey and you get Chennai Express.\n\nAs expected with Bollywood, you get color, loads of color. Colorful costumes, colorful backdrops, colorful personalities. In addition to great scenic views and a cultural journey through the beautiful south of India. I love that this film depicted culture of the south, traditions, architecture and wonder. Breathtaking in all cinematographic aspects.\n\nThe music is fun and pumping though few in number. I love Titli and the title song most but the wonderfully choreographed 1234 get on the dance floor is absolutely energy packed. The score is excellent and adds to the amazing dramatic value. See the last scene.\n\nGood comedic performance with touches of great drama from the evergreen and ever awesome SRK. Deepika was was superb and a sensation to behold. The supporting cast was just as amazing. Add to this the great sensational chemistry between the two leads and you get everything you wanted in a blockbuster. Though the humor does get trying and forced at times.\n\nThe romance is fun but feels rushed.\n\nProps to Mr Shetty for a wonderfully well directed film that was the perfect entertainer.\n\nWhat truly makes a great film experience in my opinion is a movie that elicits a wide range of emotions and never leaves you bored even for a single second. This film did just that for me. I smiled through the entire film, laughed my heart out and even shed tears. It really is one of those films that will have you at the edge of your seat, make you laugh, make you cry and perhaps even make you fall in love. :D I never noticed the time fly. A fun adventure that really has heart and speaks about a lot of important life lessons for those who paid attention. It is not a mindless masala action flick but it certainly is masala."

Cinematography : Cinematography was excellent. I really appreciate for this. Overall: If you want to see this movie then wait for just 1 month.Don't buy tickets for this kind of movie. If you are a sensible movie lover then you don't need to watch this movie in theater."

        "review_detailed_main": "What it's about: The story isn't very different from all the usual boy-meets girl romance. You know from the beginning what will happen. You have seen it many times before but the beauty is that you know whats coming, and you still want it. Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) embarks on a journey to fulfill the last wish of his grandfather: to have his ashes immersed in the Holy water of Rameshwaram. He meets Meena (Deepika Padukone) on the train and while attempting to rescue her from kidnappers gets caught up in her mess. Thus begins his journey to her village, her people, and how her fight becomes his fight. It's a refreshing light-headed cocktail of love and laughs. The director stays true to his style and his audience. It is clean, colorful and comical.\n\nWhat's good: This is a treat for all Hindi film lovers. It has it all you'd expect from a big commercial masala film. It has all the ingredients -- big star cast, drama, action, comedy, songs, the car chases and the big finish, all delivered in Rohit Shetty's unapologetic ishtyle. For SRK fans, it is an even bigger treat. The actor returns to what he does best -- romance. But it isn't the sacrificing and soppy love of Jab Tak Hai Jaan. This one is a crowd-pleaser. The film begins with a flashback with Rahul growling like a wild animal, and then he tells just how he got there. Among the things that crop up in Rahul and Meena's misadventures: Her dad's stolen car, a dwarf in the middle of the forest, a walk up 300 steps of a temple and drama at high-seas! SRK is in his elements whether he is beating up a village full of people, romancing Meena, beating up the big baddie or faking bravado when faced with four hefty goons. Deepika delivers yet another fantastic performance. She stays in character throughout and matches her co-star's energy and enthusiasm whether it is singing dialogues or fighting goondas. It's impossible to watch this movie impassively. Chennai Express has the the kind of flourish that makes you smile. Watch out for the crazy references in songs and scenes to Shah Rukh's previous films. Overall, this is a bubblegum blockbuster."

But to my amusement SRK has proved himself to be a lot more entertaining than his \"blockbuster\" contemporaries.\n\nThe concept of north-meets-south has enormous opportunities to create humor given the language difference and to an extent this movie fares well in that department. SRK Plays the role of a 40 year old(virgin!) who incidentally gets entangled in a strange situation and travels to Deepika's village with her. All the south-Indian actors are up to the mark and Deepika is as charming as ever, and SRK...for better or for worse people liked him in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and I'm sure they will love him in this movie too. The soundtrack is okay, the shooting locations are scenic. Story and dialogs are second-grade...but maybe thats what makes a movie super-hit in our country these days.\n\nOverall, an okay movie which you can watch with your family and have a couple of laughs."

His usual brand of hyperbole is starting to wear thin (apparently not with the average audience though).\n\nDeepika Padukone is the only saving grace.\n\nThe movie doesn't even deserve the one star that I am forced to give it because of the IMDb rating system.

        "review_detailed_main": "First thing, I am gonna talk about myself very honestly.. I am a movie addict and a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I truly don't see a greater star than him in the Bollywood industry (though some International magazines state he is the biggest star in the globe. - I disagree with that.). As I already said, I am a movie buff (I watch both Hollywood & Bollywood movies), I have seen almost all the movies this year that has been well received by critics, and I must say, this movie is the best at comedy and action. It can compared to some Hollywood biggies like Hot Fuzz or The World's End.\n\nNow let's talk about the various aspects of the movie.\n\nPlot: The plot goes like this... a 40-year-old Punjabi man is on a mission to immerse his grandfather's ashes down South. Enroute he meets a young Tamilian girl who has eloped. Their lives entwine and his journey takes an altogether different route. In reality, the is plot is as adventurous as you find reading it, but the humor is even greater. And the plot take (with a few plot holes I have to say) many dramatic turns towards the end. Though some are likely to make you think \"Why?\". Of course, it being a Rohit Shetty film, expect some illogical humor that still manages to crack up the audiences in laughter.\n\nDirection: Rohit Shetty, well, I am not a fan, but I must admit... he does well. At least better than his previous movies. I found no glitches in the direction. Superb work by him and his team.\n\nCast Performances: First & foremost, lets talk about the man under the spotlight, Shah Rukh Khan, who leads the cast. Man, he rocks. I salute this guy. The definition of acting may have been written by someone else but he (Shah Rukh Khan) defines it. The most important thing about him (and what makes him the greatest star in Bollywood) is that he knows what he has to do and how to do it. He does everything with perfection. Rohit Shetty once mentioned this in an interview, and right he is. Deepika Padukone is even better and more vivid and honest essaying her role. Her accent in the movie is so funny. Will crack you up time to time. Nikitin Dheer had a considerably small role to play. But even still, he was awesome. He was perfect for the role. A good future he has in front of him (no sarcasm intended)...\n\nMusic/Songs: Songs are just above average. I, honestly, didn't find anything special in the music.\n\nEditing/Camera Work/Choreography & Other Aspects: Brilliant.\n\n10/10 just for awesome acting and direction."

In Eid and Diwali they are Respectively Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan. They have their own Fan bases who always clashes among themselves for their own Superstar. Now in this year Eid the Scenario slightly changed. In spite of Salman's Movie, this year Eid \"CHENNAI EXPRESS\" released form Shahrukh's Own Red chilies banner and this time \"KING KHAN\" patched up with a deadly Combination with Rohit Shetty and Deepika Padukone n Rohit Shetty did his job as usual in \"SHETTY STYLE\".\n\nThe whole story can be told in one or two lines. Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) starts a journey to a town in Tamil Nadu to fulfill the last wish of his grandfather to have his ashes immersed in Rameshwaram. During his journey, he meets a South Indian girl, Meena (Deepika Padukone), who wants to flee from the prison of her father (Sathyaraj). Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer) who is good friend of Durgeshwara (Sathyaraj) and wants to marry Meena puts forth every possible hurdle. And Lets the Journey Ohh sorry Fun Begins..!!\n\nAs Rahul, KING KHAN is in top form. He is brilliant in his comic timing as expected. But what is saluted to him that such a Big Superstar like him credited his name second (after Deepika Padukone) in the Title card and also made jokes on himself, on his age, on his movies throughout the movie. Deepika was a Surprise Package (Returned with Shahrukh after Om Shanti Om and with a full maturity). Her Beauty, her pronunciations will make you flat for sure. Sathyaraj is super as Deepika's father. The actor conveys everything through his eyes. Nikitin Dheer's TV tower like presence adds a lot of weight to his character.\n\nSongs are Very good and well crafted. First one \"1234\" is a really foot tapping one and post interval through \"TITLI\" and \"Kashmir to kanyakumari\" Vishal-Shekhar's soundtrack make you feel young and gives a very soothing charm to your ears. But make the film little bit lengthy.\n\nBut the most important thing in this movie in my point of view is its awesome Cinematography. This captures the mood of the film as well as the stunning locales. The locations and cultures captured in South India Throughout the movie are so so and so beautiful that I AM SURE THAT AFTER LEAVING THE HALL YOU WILL AGAIN FALL IN LOVE FOR YOUR COUNTRY, FOR YOUR India.\n\nOn a whole Rohit Shetty made a movie with a stamp of his \"ISHTYLE\" in every part of it.Its a Complete Entertainer with fun, romance, jokes, songs, dances, stunning locations, actions. So if entertainment is in your mind, keep your brain in your house and board Chennai express for sure.\n\nAnd don't don't don't forget to see the \"Lungi Dance\" at last.\n\nMessage for Salman's Fans: Please keep your ego n clashes outside for some days, Board CHENNAI EXPRESS with every one of your family and start a happy journey of this year festive season.\n\nTake home message: Don't Underestimate the Power of a Common Man. \uf04a \uf04a"

It proved to be one of the best decisions i took before watching a movie, as i was able to sit back and enjoy the fun ride to the full extend! SRK is well and truly back and Rohit Shetty proved he is better than 'Bol Bachan'\n\nSRK, especially during the first half steals the show with his brilliant comic timing. Deepika Padukone meanwhile slowly slipped into her role and got more and more ravishing as the movie progressed. Background score was commendable and the camera work was simply out of the world. The beauty of Southern India was promptly displayed on screen. For once, the songs in a bollywood movie did not feel misplaced nor incorrect. Everything just jelled in so well. The second half could have been made a little less dragging though.\n\nThe movie was a mash up of one tamil movie(which I am not naming here, to avoid spoilers) and many of the old SRK movies but never felt overtly redundant. SRK, then put every other positive to the backseat by dedicating a song to Thalaiva, Rajnikanth which pretty much should seal the fate of the movie as a blockbuster even if it didn't have any of the above good things about it.\n\nMy verdict: Expect nothing and get something close to everything :)"

All in all,this wasn't the Chennai i was hoping to see when i came to see the movie.It could very well be have been named \"South India Express\"."

Rohit Shetty has given some good comedies. Nowadays, his comedies are not that great.\n\nThe plot of the movie is same old formula used in Bollywood for years now. I don't know why they cannot come up with better concept. At least, the comedy part could have been better although the story is old. Except few scenes, the movie does not really make any impact. Deepika has been improving. Her dialogue \"Kahaan se kharidi aisi bakwaas Dictionary\" is somewhat nice to hear.\n\nIt is certainly missing charms of movies like Chupke Chupke, Golmaal, Chashme Buddor, Rang Birangi etc of 70s and 80s."

Shahrukh looks old but then he is 47, so age does catch up on best of us, but he is still Shahrukh! Perfect comic timing and a costar who challenges his skills as a comedian! Yes Deepika is perfect as a south Indian damsel in distress who saves the hero from getting murdered in most of the movie! Sounds tricky!well it is. The movie is not perfect. In fact I didn't like ddlj type ending! All the bloodshed in the end. Was it necessary Mr. Rohit shetty?"

SRK still thinks his 1990's formula can work in 2013 thinking the audience is dumb and high time stops riding on the DDLJ success. And surely the Director, Rohit Shetty should grow up and improve from the same repetitive cinematic experience of flying vehicles and big sets.

        "review_title": "Chennai Express; was it worth it?",
        "review_detailed_main": "Before I tell you what I thought about the movie, I must admit that I was not rushing to the cinemas to book tickets in advance for this title, despite being a die-hard SRK fan. Something told me this would be similar to the likes of Rowdy Rathore and Om Shanti Om (sorry folks, I just did NOT like that movie). My brother forced me to go along with him (he only wanted to go for Deepika), and so I watched Chennai Express.\n\nNow, moving on to my review. I was so very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Let's start with the cast; Shahrukh Khan and Deepika Padukone both delivered commendable performances. I was reminded once again why SRK is the King of Bollywood, and Padukone looks beautiful in every scene. Truth be told, I guess I was a little skeptic of Khan acting a comedy role, but God, can that guy act! Now I can safely (and proudly) say that Khan didn't let me or his fans down and delivered a purely entertaining performance, including a few truly hilarious moments. Padukone proves all her critics wrong (that is if she has any!) by delivering a stunning performance. She is extremely graceful in the movie, much like in Om Shanti Om but this time it's a more 'down-to- earth' grace and charm she exudes.\n\nThe cinematography is wonderful, all the shots captured with perfection and the viewers are showed details of the scenery which, by the way, is G.O.R.G.E.O.U.S! I found yet another reason to add to my 'Why I must visit India' list. All I wanted to do when a scene in a dazzling new area was shown was to hop on a train from Lahore to Amritsar! The costumes worn by Padukone are also beautiful; the colorful sarees are very pleasing to the eye and add to the whole fun, colorful, all-in- all happy ambiance which is reflected in most of the movie. The songs are catchy and fit well with the movie; if you catch yourself humming a tune from one of the songs once you exit the cinema, don't be surprised! Yes, as times passes by you can sort of start guessing what's going to happen next (now they're gonna fall in love, the hero will win the fight etc), but that still doesn't stop you from looking at the screen. There might be some moments where you think to yourself \"hurry along to the next scene,\" but the movie never proves to be dull or boring. Although the general genre of Chennai Express is lighthearted rom-com, there was no way a Bollywood flick would be complete without some action. There are a few 'dishum dishum' scenes and a main one at the climax, which, I guess, completed the whole feel of Bollywood. All in all, Chennai Express is a typical Bollywood movie with a not-so-typical script which covers all aspects of a good entertainment number; action, romance, comedy and even a bit of tragedy.\n\nIs it on my top ten movies list? No. Would I be re-watching it anytime soon? Probably not, but once the movie finished I came out of the cinema hall feeling happy and with a smile on my face. So if you want good entertainment and are fans of Khan and/or Padukone, go watch this movie! You'll enjoy it."

The acting was good too, but I hated the part where Shah Rukh Khan becomes emotional, it is the same copy and paste in all his films, and if Isaac Newton was alive, he would have returned to his grave after watching those awful action scenes, which are the trademark of director Rohit Shetty. Yeah, those are the only two negative points I could find. Frankly, it was Deepika Padukone and the funny dialogues (full of references to old Indian films) that have saved the film for me. The story was OK, but the beautiful landscapes of South lndia were breathtaking, allowing us to forget story line. The only thing new was the \"song-conversion\" between Rahul (SRK) and Meena (Deepika) and I must say it was a brilliantly awesome idea! Loved this movie even if I'm not a great fan of SRK and I will definitely re-watch it with my family."

But it's his humor which makes him different from many who are just doing a copy-paste job. Although his works are not the best but still they have something in them to offer. Yes, you feel exasperated at times but it also makes you laugh at some points and Chennai Express is no exception.\n\nChennai Express is a train,not a movie which gets delayed and at times even forgets its route which is a disappointment. It's a movie which has no plot but still tries to have one. SRK's charm is the only highlight of the movie that moves from very-funny-that-i-forgot-to-laugh to really-funny kind of sequences.Deepika Padukone is sometimes just perfect but at times exaggeration comes into being. And when every thing doesn't work then Rohit tries to give a message to the audiences which makes it more irritating. Does every movie need to give a message just for the sake of it?\n\nApart from Titli the music of Vishal-Shekhar is another disappointment. Those songs which should have been cut at the editing table comes out of nowhere and makes it even more tough to continue watching the movie. But there are sequences which really stands out like Life-of-Pi, Teen MRF ke Tyre and some portions of those parts where the characters start conversing using songs as a medium.\n\nI am going with 2.5 stars out of 5 for Chennai Express. This one is certainly not for the classes but for the masses."

Must watch for ShahRukh lovers & neutral people... (Haters are gonna spread negative things anyways.. they need a better prescription ) Chennai Express ***1/2\n\nFrankly speaking , I was more excited and happier after 1st half and expected too much in second half.... First half is much better than second one .... or we can say second half is not as hilarious as 1st one... I promise you will laugh, clap, whistle for first half... second half might sound little long as it includes all drama, love , songs , climax etc etc.... It's really battle between Shahrukh & Deepika ( staring from beautiful dimples )... After long time you will see shahrukh's amazing mass performance... ( he really doesn't need that... he is class anyway ) Deepika gives him tough battle in performance... Deepika's one of the best movie and performance... ( SRK has kept his promise by giving first slot to Deeps in credits.. salute for his all time woman respect ) SRK rocks with deepika... Tanagablli is so powerful villain who will be served as trump card... he has bright future.... Sathyraj and Mukesh Tiwari do their job well...\n\nNow real hero of this movie... Rohit Shetty ..... yes he really knows how to make masala movie... He knows he is not here to grab Oscar nominations, festival entries... but he focuses on his target audience.. he is really improving movie by movie... He is the star of family entertainer... One liners, plots are really cool & hilarious...\n\nDudley is Rohit's favr8 cinemato and he has done fantabulous job... Class people can go only for it... Editing is good... few of the last part could have been edited...\n\nSongs tasted more sweet visually and that south darshan is amazing man... And Thalaivaa wins your heart... I saluted my two Gods.. Rajanikant sir and SRK...\n\nSo visit the theater watch it.. enjoy it... .. simple, comedy action movie.... Full money vasool family entertainer...\n\n1st half : **** 2nd half:*** Average ***1/2\n\nAnd gonna watch it again ( now this is biased )"

Of course, it is a brainless comic flick but it is charming in its own ways. It is said that comedy does not lie in actions, it lies in reactions. So it is not hard to observe that Shahrukh Khan plays the victim act quite up to the mark in most of the comic scenes. But movie belongs to Deepika Padukone who plays the bridge between Hindi and Tamil language dialogs and charms you with her subtle expressions and thick south Indian accent done quite right. Movie works in comic scenes but derails in last half an hour by putting extra song like Kashmir to Kanyakumari, out of context speech by hero and long DDLJ type fighting scene. All in all, SRK fans can easily survive the movie and it makes a good family entertainer when watching at home."

After Rohit Shetty's hits like Singham I was modestly hopeful to see SRK in a new form. Disliking SRK in his smoochy roles I was hoping for something new.\n\nThe movie lacks a comprehensive structure and story with close to no character development. SRK is amazingly dense in this movie. Slapstick comedy attempts of SRK fail badly and the character is not at all believable.\n\nThe only positive points of this movie were Deepika's look. She looked quite good in this movie, the South Indian dresses suit her. Also the villain, played by Nikiten Dheer plays his role well and looks impressive.\n\nBut all in all the movie is an utter disappointment, a waste of time, and a braincell-killer. It definitely shows the power of bogus marketing, when looking at the success of the movie. This movie is one of the biggest Hindi movies released in International theaters. Taking into account that this movie is a calling card for the Hindi film industry, it has sent the completely wrong image and frankly embarrasses me as an Indian living abroad.\n\nA 0 was better suited for this movie, but unfortunately the IMDb system does not allow that."

Deepika is a revelation. Her south-Indian accent and acting is surprisingly awesome. Her comic timing was worth noting as well.\n\nRohit, also doesn't have too much dumb humor. In his previous films, the humor was in the dialogs (\"atha maji satakli\" and \"I can walk English...\") . In chennai express, the humor lies in the language barrier Shah Rukh faces (tamil vs Hindi). The quirks on Shah Rukh Khan (the actor, not the character) are also pretty funny.\n\nOn the whole, Chennai Express was a decent movie. There weren't as many laugh out loud moments, but the story was okay. Deepika's acting and the decent pace of the film makes the film work.\n\nWorth a watch!\n\n@in2deepjagani"

Overall the movie is average nothing much great about the movie and it is a one time watch movie for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chennai Express, directed by Rohit Shetty, is an example of complete garbage which does not make any sense when it comes to cinema. Shah Rukh Khan is really trying hard to get his lost mark but every effort is in vain because of his senseless choices. They are making fun of their own movies in an irregular and thin screenplay, way-over-the-top acting especially by Shah Rukh, mindless comedy scenes, flying cars and people, just by touching them, childish characters or caricatures and watching it for 141 Minutes is an intolerable cruelty . 25% of the dialog are in Tamil and it is inconceivable for the people unacquainted with the language.\n\nIt really does not matter if it makes billions of money (I am sure it will) because it has become a trend now like other blotted movies earlier.\n\nRahul (I don't want to hear this name), boarding the 'Chennai Express', pretending to go to Rameshwaram to immerse his grandfather's ashes but has a plan to go to Goa with his friends. He meets Meena Amma (Deepika Padukone), whose father's goons, accompanying her as she ran away from home. Rahul is engulfed and now he has been presented as Meena's fianc\u00e9.\n\nHer father \"The Don\" wanted to marry her with Thambabali (Niketan Dheer), which is why she eloped from her village. Rest of the thing is known to every Indian Cinema viewer.\n\n\"Chennai Express\" never thrives in its dilemma of portraying a Rohit's typical action-comedy style or Shah Rukh's patent genre comedy-romance. By mingling so many ingredients, the dish has become something else (because nobody knew what they are making) which cannot even be eaten by an animal.\n\nThere are only two kinds of people who will love the movie, first a die-hard Shah Rukh fan, second, who do not care about anything. Simply because, it does not have funny-gags like Golmaal or punches like Singham not Shah Rukh natural acts in \"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa\" or\"Chak-De India\". Many forced characters and situations confronted by the viewers which do not have any sense.\n\nHowever, Deepika Padukone, does a god job sustaining her bizarre accent and fabulous screen presence.\n\nWe have already witnessed Shah Rukh's capability and there is no need for him to gain attention by doing these mindless craps. We need more \"Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na\", \"Swades\" & \"Chak De\" from him.\n\n4/10."

SRK's comedy holds good, and Deepika has done justice to her character as a Tamilian girl. But, i just found the movie lagging a bit.Speaking of first half, its fun filled, with Shetty throwing memories of SRK's old time flicks. The second half becomes predictable, and a bit boring too.South Indian culture has been shown in good light, with the peculiar Tamil accent. Deepika has done her homework.The lungi dance tribute to Rajnikanth hasn't worked out.\n\nSimply speaking, my verdict is you can go and watch this movie for fun. But it won't be a movie which you will always remember. As an SRK fan, i'm a bit disappointed,but i guess it'll be a typical commercial grosser,in the future."

The film is pure entertainment and there isn't a dull moment which slows down the sprightly pace. The biggest plus of the film is that it is a complete laughathon. Humor and a whole lot of it keeps you engaged. Chennai Express isn't your run-of-the-mill romantic flicks with a happy ending. Of course, we have Shah Rukh and Deepika overcoming all obstacles and finding happiness at the end, but that comes with a good dose of fights, blowing up of cars and jeeps, goof ups and dawn of wisdom of the baddies.\n\nMusically, Chennai Express tops the chart with foot-tapping numbers. Three cheers to Vishal-Shekhar! Deepika is awesome as Meena. The simplicity and the effortlessness with which she speaks the South Indian accent is commendable. Shah Rukh as the vivacious Rahul is a treat to watch. His comic timings are perfect, sometimes almost Jim Carreyish. Some moments are sure to have you in splits. You can't get enough of King Khan! The supporting cast provides a perfect backup.\n\nIf it's non-stop entertainment that you're looking for, you will not be disappointed. There's a riot of colors, dance, song, costumes, romance and tears in typical South-Indian style. Photography, especially when it captures the whole train on the bridge is just amazing! Rohit Shetty and SRK together strikes gold. The originality of the film is simply mind-blowing. No doubt, Chennai Express is having the box-office cash register ringing!"

Only SRK can Speak Hindi whereas Deepikas South Indian flavoured Hindi is too good.Whereas all other character speaks only Tamil .... :D\n\nSongs and Music is Good, Few Comedy scene and typical Rohit Shetty Action Scene.\n\nThe much hyped chennai express is a flop and simply bakwaas.

I think half of the script was just translations. They mockingly used DDLJ themes throughout the movie but didn't realize that the whole movie is kind of a Desi Knockoff of DDLJ - well a really poor knock-off.

But what I got was a hamming SRK every time.\n\nThe movie starts off well and I enjoyed Deepika's entry scene inspired from SRK's DDLJ and the antakshari scenes between her and SRK. But from there the movie becomes silly as the writing goes bad. There could have been some genuine hilarious moments at Deepika's house but the writers miss the plot and SRK over acts.\n\nAnd the 2nd half, the movie takes the emotional and romantic turns and the comedy dries up. The climax saves the film to an extent.\n\nFirst, the good things in Chennai Express. Deepika Padukone is fabulous. She is the only reason I was watching this film after a point. She had a bad accent but she pulls it off well and remains in character till the end. Check out the sleep talking scene and beats SRK in comedy hands down.\n\nThe casting is also perfect. Shetty gets a lot of Tamil actors like Sathyaraj to play the Tamil speaking characters which lends credibility to the story. There is a lot of Tamil spoken so be prepared.\n\nThe locations and cinematography is breath taking to say the least.\n\nAlso, I've to say its a very clean comedy. No dirty or double meaning jokes.\n\nNow, the negatives. SRK. He hams and over acts and is in never in control of his character. Its not that SRK can't do comedy but here its a confusion of whether his character is an idiot or of a wrong man in wrong place. Hence, I cannot feel bad for him.\n\nAnd the writers missed the bus again. This could have been a comedy classic like SRK's Main Hoo Naa which was clean and fun. But somewhere, Shetty and team are lost in translation."

Though Rohit could Have made SRK kicking every villains a**, he controlled himself and made the hero look more Human rather than a typical Bollywood Butt kicking Hero.\n\nThough songs could have been better and the movie was probably 15 minute too long.\n\nDespite its many faults if you keep logic aside and go with an open mind you will enjoy it.

I think it's superb movie, which for the first time the director has attempted to make a fusion movie of Tamil and Hindi.

The only scene that seems interesting is the twist at the beginning just after Shahrukh first pulls Deepika into the train.\n\nIt is nothing but a waste of time to watch this movie. If you are not a die-hard Shahrukh fan you would simply sleep over most of this movie. I wouldn't say there are even 10 sequences in this film where you would feel like having a full laugh. I would say that Rohit Shetty's Golmaal series was a much better entertainer than is nonsense of a movie. I would rate it as the most over-hyped third-class movie of this year - though the year is not yet over.\n\nLet me rate this 4/10."

Even from the trailer i knew that i wouldn't be classic like Chak De India or romantic like DDLJ...But its worse than Om Shanti Om. No proper script, No situational comedy, just some south Indian dialogs which didn't impress me at all. yes cinematography is really impressive. Beautiful south Indian locations. Fights are just same as all Rohit Shetty's movies. Car's flying, hero fighting so many villains at once.\n\nThis movie looked like Rohit shetty didn't had proper script but he wanted to cash out SRK's popularity. No doubt movie will be a commercial hit just bcoz of SRK and Id. Otherwise a crap.\n\nMoral of the story is go if you SRK fan otherwise you can skip Chennai Express. (Sorry SRK but its the truth. Please choose movies wisely)"

As for Shahrukh, please stop using Rajni Sir's brand to market your films in Southern India. Pathetic performance. There can't be better examples of talent being wasted than this. For a change Deepika was tolerable, although they looked odd when paired together. Terrible music,equally bad choreography. But if you liked Ra.One, you will love this one."

        "review_title": "The curse of second half works here too but it still can be seen once for a new Deepika & Shahrukh for sure.",
        "review_detailed_main": "The rare combination of Hit director Rohit Shetty and Shahrukh Khan was looked upon differently by two sections of viewers before the release of CHENNAI EXPRESS. Where a few were quite excited, there were many who were hugely doubtful and confused about what to expect from the two famous names coming together for the first time. However the after release news is not that bad since the film is neither a complete dud nor a big epic entertainer as was being expected.\n\nDescribing it from Rohit Shetty kind of cinema's point of view, CE is much more than the director's weak BOL BACHCHAN and a step below than his hugely successful SINGHAM. But moving ahead than Rohit's all previous ventures; here we have a fresh film with a new backdrop of South and few enjoyable performances surprisingly led by the leading lady, Deepika Padukone.\n\nNow the major reason, why CE can be rated as a fairly entertaining film altogether is its fast paced & engaging first half which actually saves the project in totality. It begins on a shaky note, without any heroic entry of King Khan but then goes on to become a decent entertainer with a new setting of South India and its colorful (yet dark) characters. Frankly, I found a new Shahrukh here in the first half along with the extremely gifted Deepika who slowly and steadily goes on to score even better than Shahrukh as the film progresses. Though we do have some downers in this part like Nokia brand endorsement and the not-so- required item song, yet till interval CHENNAI EXPRESS easily wins you over being a fine masala entertainer equipped with a brand new Deepika, Shahrukh and Rohit too (with less action, no cheap comedy or double meaning dialogues).\n\nThe unexpectedly good first half raises the level of the movie arguably and one starts expecting more novel twists in its storyline and the characters coming ahead. But unfortunately nothing of that sort happens post intermission and the film simply goes back to the same routine stuff seen many times before in several hit films. Moreover all of a sudden more than 3 songs hit you hard one after another and the film loses its well developed pace in just few scenes. One or two appealing sequences try to bring back the lost interest sincerely, but with nothing new in its basic storyline CHENNAI EXPRESS doesn't perform to the expected levels in its pretty ordinary or average second half and loses all the magic created earlier. Anyway the long concluding moments of the film thankfully turn out to be the big savior, where Shahrukh performs brilliantly in a well conceived action sequence fighting it hard for his own dignity, love and pride.\n\nCinematography adds a lot to the overall experience of watching the South's natural beauty and background score works well with its changing themes featuring comedy, family drama, action & romance compiled together. The dialogues play a major role in the initial hour but then they too fall in the same bracket of being 'nothing new' post interval. Musically this is not an upto the mark soundtrack from Vishal Shekhar with only \"Titlee\" impressing you the most. May be this was the reason why they called in Honey Singh to compose a new item song dedicated to Rajnikanth. The song \"Lungi Dance\" sounds good as a dancing track but its video really brings down all the energy generated, mainly due to a weak (vague) direction and a lost choreography.\n\nRegarding the performances, as mentioned above this is more a Deepika Padukone film than a Shahrukh's movie. No doubt, they both have visibly worked real hard, but the lady scores a little more than the King Star here majorly due to his excellent facial expressions and a fabulous accent. Though many may find the regional dialogues in the movie (without any subtitles) a bit annoying, but I found the move quite right keeping the originality intact. Deepika looks stunningly beautiful in all those traditional attires and its really hard to believe that she is the same bikini girl of COCKTAIL. So this is one Hindi film which clearly proves that an Indian lady surely looks more beautiful with his body nicely covered than the other way round.\n\nAlong with Deepika, we have a new Shahrukh in CE who is willing enough to try something novel and unconventional at this age of his career. But sadly all his innovations sustain only till the first half and post intermission he again goes back to the same love and drama seen umpteen times before. Still he surely deserves praises especially for the final action sequence in the film performed with great guts and passion. In the supporting cast, Sathyaraj is impressive as the Don-father, Nikitin Dheer is just fine as the strong opponent and it was really nice to see Kamini Kaushal's gracious presence in the opening scenes. But I did miss Mukesh Tiwari playing the Sikh Inspector, literally vanishing in the second half, because he really played it well initially.\n\nSo, as they say Rohit Shetty has simply made CHENNAI EXPRESS just for that common man looking for some decent entertainment in those three hours bought from his hard earned money. But here I would like to ask a question that, if Rohit really makes films for the common man then what was that dialogue in CE, in which Shahrukh very ruthlessly addresses the kind of humor enjoyed by that common man only watching films in the smaller centers?\n\nAnyway, hoping that the makers soon come forward with an explanation for that, CHENNAI EXPRESS is yet another big film affected by the curse of second half but it still can be seen once for especially Deepika and then a different Shahrukh surprising you with his rediscovered comic timing in the first hour."

        "review_detailed_main": "SRK's dada kick starts Chennai Express by kicking the bucket which is followed by Deepika boarding the train, the DDLJ style. But she is not the only one (her four cousins) courtesy of SRK, with the DDLJ tune fading away accordingly. From there on, the Express takes us on a journey throughout the state. \"Tamil Nadu Express\" would have been a more appropriate title.\n\nThe protagonist is the odd man out (literally) throughout the movie, being man handled by everyone including Deepika. Though SRK appears innocent, his long stay in the Tamil soil made him ingest the Tamil hero's formula that takes effect in the climax fight.\n\nDeepika is desperate to speak perfect Tamil but any native would find her Tamil to be \"bokwas\" and in certain cases requiring the usage of subtitles. Her effort deserves appreciation though acting needs improvement.\n\nSathyaraj, a veteran of the south is the guard who comes in the last compartment of the Express (Important role but is hardly noticed). He withholds his daughter until the end and lets her go at the last moment so that the director can roll down the end credits (Same as what Amrish Puri did in DDLJ).\n\nFrankly, the Antakshari songs are far more enjoyable than the major five. The cinematographer has used more colors in a single song (Kashmir main) than in the entire movie.\n\nIf Rohit Shetty (Director) is targeting an audience of a non Hindi speaking state, then he should try not to copy scenes from the movies of the same language ( Refer Rajini's Muthu, Vijay's Ghilli).\n\nSRK was gagging throughout the movie about the power of a common man, but when the audiences came back inside the theater to watch the end credits, one can truly understand the power of RAJINIKANTH. His presence in the movie as a mere snapshot can make the fans go gaga.\n\nHaving said that,\n\nFirst Half: Chennai \"Express\" Second half: Chennai \"Passenger\""

One thing is sure that people still love Khans and Kapoors even if they (sometimes) works in such crappy movies.Lastly Deepika's acting was good and descent."

Chennai Express is a typical Rohit film - action, romance, comedy all packed into one film and overall it works!\n\nShah Rukh Khan is funny, and performs well but seriously looks too old to romance Deepika on screen. Deepika looks absolutely stunning and for me, puts her best performance to date. She perfects the south Indian accent, and her comic timing is fantastic alongside SRK. She will surely be nominated for best actress award, and has a real chance of winning it!\n\nOverall I don't think it's a 225 crore film, but it is certainly a good family entertainer."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched without prejudice & came out hating the film. There are more than 100 reasons, goofs & wrongs in this affectedly naive flick that I could/should write a book (about) and it might just go bestselling, due to the connection.\n\nStarting off with what we saw few years ago in Jab We Met, Shahrukh Khan tries very hard to impress his audience, spoofing his own films, songs, sequences (most notably that of DDLJ; it was funny, though) and meets his co-star, Deepika Padukone, who other than having a laughable South- Indian accent, does her part well. Khan imitates Jim Carrey in the first half, while he goes onto following his muscle memory of his yesteryear films. His character induces ridicule all through the 140 minutes of flashback screenplay. Supporting cast is fine but they are sidelined with not much dialogs given to them.\n\nAnd the dialogs given to the lead characters are either of their previous movies or of some other actors of other movies. Blast! Ridiculousness has no limits in the second half. From nerve-bending Antakshari to pun-centered jokes, from stupid drama to extremely atrocious points, the plot approaches climax and moves one step further to cross the highest level of predictability.\n\nRohit Shetty has minimized his unbelievable stunts, but he has made it up with the level of spoofing, terrible humor & top-level horseplay. Awful cinematography accentuated with zero story sense & horrific plot advancements makes me wanna advice the whole crew not to underestimate the power of a common man's cinema interest. People depending upon Bollywood, thus need to find pleasure in International Film Festivals. I would prefer Ship Of Theseus, Calapor, BA Pass or even Sixteen over this, if I were you.\n\nThe message at the end is truly unconventional but depicting it after such a long meaningless charade is a dumb idea. And the love-romance factor is gonna be the base of second, forth & eighteenth chapters if at all my book gets materialized.\n\nLastly, music (read songs) comes to its rescue, although Rohit Shetty excels in directing the credit song video \"Lungi Dance.\" The song is also catchy & one of the few parts of the film which forces me to rate it a hard-hearted 2.0/10!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The end of Shahrukh Khan era is imminent. Rohit Shetty should stop, but I know he won't. Let him go paranoid in his own vomit! And for SRK fans, I suggest you to polish your Tamil before it is showcased on DTH. Not recommended! Overall, I laughed countably four times.\n\nCan be watched a typical Indian family? YES\n\nProfanity: Very Mild | Sex/Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: No | Smoking: Mild | Alcohol: Mild | Drugs: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Nudity: No | Vulgarity: Mild"

Well SRK has again proved that why he is the best actor of Bollywood presently. I'am saying this not because he is my favorite or i'am his biggest fan but i'am saying this because his acting touches you. Deepika and Srk both look very cute with each other and way the movie is directed in chennai and elsewhere. It was really awe-inspiring. I will not reveal the story as it will reduce the fun of watching this movie. So guys, undoubtedly go with your friends and family and have an awesome time watching this really good,awesome and a hilarious movie. Three cheers to SRK, Deepika and Rohit shetty. .

        "review_detailed_main": "This time very, more than very early entry to the City Center for the last show. But guess what? We have the only option to watch it if we sit very near to the engine of \"Chennai Express\"; I mean very first row of the screen3.All the 8 shows were houseful for the day. Why not? It's quite obviously; the unique combo of R Shetty and King Khan is enough to make one curious about their product and when you get Deepika Padukone as bonus.\n\nThe journey on-screen begins with Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan back with one of his favorite screen names, good thing is that this time he aged 40) on way from Mumbai to join his friends in Goa for a vacation. But at his foster grandmother's behest, he reluctantly agrees to go to Rameshwaram to immerse the ashes of his dead grandfather. He boards Chennai Express but all his plans are foiled by a Tamilian beauty in distress \u2013 the runaway Meena \u2013 daughter of Komban village's don Dugeshwara \u2013 who runs into Rahul accidentally while being chased by four of her brothers. Thing is better in the screen when she enters like SRK's all time blockbuster DDLJ and \"Rahul Nam to suna hi hoga\" style the journey begins. Now as the story unfolds, it is revealed that Meena's father wants her to get married against her wishes, and Rahul is supposed to be the girl's knight in shining armor. The rest of the story is a riot of hilarious, romantic and action sequences with some interesting drama peppered and pickled in.\n\nThe Tamilian don and his henchmen (with hacking knives in hand) are shown in their full glory; as are the exotic locations down South. Seriously, cinematographer Dudley has an eye for capturing the Southern landscape in its abundance, and the breathtaking locations that one would see in 'Chennai Express' are going to make nature lovers fall in love with the lower reaches of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nCrowd puller Shah Rukh Khan, in his act throughout the film, is zany, charming and at times flinching. On the other side, Deepika's character exudes shades of rebellion, warmth and commitment. Her Hindi with Tamil accents sounds easy on the ears, convincing and humor inducing unlike I felt unpleasant in trailer. Together the pair's camaraderie on the celluloid results in funny situations and makes their chemistry more compelling.\n\nThe music of the film by composer duo Vishal-Shekhar boasts of a couple of good tracks like 'Titli' and '1 2 3 4 Get On The Dance Floor' SRK with Priyamani will force you to dance. The backgrounds number 'Chennai Express' also ups the excitement level. But songs like 'Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari' could have been skipped. But anyway may be they are having a serenity idea of harmonizing North and South of India with song.\n\nOne of the downsides of 'Chennai Express' is its predictability. As the story moves forward, the guessing game becomes easier, thereby revealing the climax of the movie. Second, like any of the previous Rohit Shetty's films, this one too is nothing really out-of-the box or one that can qualify for awards. It is Shah Rukh Khan's act that makes the film substantial and keeps one hooked.\n\nBut in no time you feel bore on the trip in \"Chennai Express\". Overall, a super Entertainer with not so Super Climax for me, but a must watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is hard to classify Chennai Express as a film, it is more like a non stop spoof fest. Most of the movie is spent in spoofing or referencing earlier films such as Dil Se, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Bhool Bhuliaya, Main Hoo Na, My Name is Khan, and 3 Idiots, or insulting Tamil movie stereotypes. While this is expected out of a Rohit Shetty movie, the fact that SRK was party to going the Salman way is kind of sad.\n\nShahrukh has excelled in his career to tow the middle path. He has not gone crass like Salman or taken the heavy handed method actor route of Aamir. His audience has always identified with him as the common man who could succeed. Even though he keeps shouting that he is playing the common man in Chennai Express, and starts off by doing so, it all comes crashing down post interval in a familiar Bollywood plot where the common man beats the living daylight out of half the population of Chennai.\n\nSpeaking of which there is precious little of Chennai or express in the movie, which does not matter much. But what does matter is the shocking lack of humor, especially in the second half. When i say Deepika Padukone was the best thing in the movie even though there is zero chemistry with SRK, that is making quite a statement, isn't it? The jokes are forced, the product placements are overlong, the music is sub par, the choreography even worse, the action typical of a Shetty movie is over the top gravity defying, and the absurd colors take away whatever way the cinematographer was trying to pass off as Tamil Nadu. Rohit Shetty should stick to complete mindless fare with B grade stars, not rope in a Khan and raise expectations.\n\nChennai Express is one of the worst hyped movies of 2013. Paid reviews will maintain \"good\"word of mouth- I kept wanting to like it but could not. Even though this will cross the 100 crore club, i hope SRK realizes too that he and lame comedies are not a good combo. Recommended only for die hard SRK fans- 5/10"

The only thing that I find to be worth applauding is Deepika's performance, which has been no less than brilliant. She is the string that can be said to be holding the beads together. The songs are good though, and will be the main reason this movie is remembered for the times to come. The \"Thalaiva song\" is the one that i cannot get out of my mind!!!

        "review_detailed_main": "In many ways, \"Chennai Express\" is a typical Indian film. It features the usual mismatched lovers and song and dance numbers but it is very different because the film features four different languages (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi and English) and is a very multicultural affair--as India is almost like a country comprised of many little countries and each with its own language. And, you see a lot of India in this movie.\n\nWhen the film begins, Rahul (Indian mega-star, Shah Rukh Khan) is supposed to be headed from Mumbai south to deposit his grandfather's ashes in a river. However, Rahul is tired of being responsible and plans instead to head to the city of Goa and have a good time with his friends. After all, Grandfather won't know which river he's deposited into and all water eventually flows together! However, his selfish plans are thrown off course when he returns to the train to retrieve this ashes he's just forgotten...and ends up in the middle of a kidnapping!\n\nMeena (Deepika Padukone) refuses to marry the man her father picked for her and has run away from home. While this is a tough enough situation, he keeps running away and her father's goons keep catching her and returning her...and now they've captured her and Rahul. It turns out her father is a big mob boss in the Southern Tamil region (near Chennai). How will Rahul extricate himself from this predicament? Well, Menna tells him to trust her and do what she says when they return to her village. And, since Rahul only speaks Hindi and everyone around him is speaking Tamil, he just does what Menna tells him....and then he learns that she's told her father that she intends to marry Rahul...a man who just met her!\n\nSo do Rahul and Meena now marry and live happily ever after? Not on your life! In addition to Rahul not loving Meena, Meena's fianc\u00e9 is bent on killing the upstart who has stolen his woman!! Not surprisingly, Rahul and Meena soon sneak away and go on a cross- country and cross-cultural road trip.\n\nThe film is a mixed bag. I liked the plot, the dialog and the acting by Khan and Padukone and found the film to be quite enjoyable. However, the stunts were, at times, completely stupid! So stupid, the film loses a point or two. In one scene, Rahul swings a knife-like thingie at a car as it speeds towards him--and it then flips and blows up!! In another portion of this escape sequence, Rahul's car (along with two other vehicles) smashes through a brick wall and sustains NO DAMAGE!!! There are other stupid stunts and they have the effect of cheapening a very good film. It's a shame, as without these scenes I'd strongly recommend this one. As it is, my recommendation is tempered by a warning about these dumb stunts."

Hero and heroine meet accidentally and eventually they fall in love. But heroine's father wants another guy (villain) to marry him. And after proving himself with all the fights and emotional drama, hero manages to marry the heroine. That is what Chennai Express is all about! Half of the movie is in Tamil language including two songs. So if you want to enjoy Chennai Express thoroughly, i will suggest you to take Tamil coaching first. Direction of the movie is average. Nothing great. Shahrukh Khan has played character of Rahul in the movie which the most common character played by him in past movies. Action sequences are also not impressive. Sorry, but Rahul Shetty Ishtyle will not work every time. Music is average. Punches in movie will make kids laugh for sure. Overall, it is a big disappointment for all SRK fans.\n\nWhat is good about Chennai Express? Cinematography, beautiful locations and colorful screen are the plus points. Song parodies used in the movie are really amusing. Specially those after the interval. Deepika Padukone has done an impressive job in the movie with her Tamil accent. We are giving 2 stars to the colorful locations, those song parodies and Deepika Padukone's performance.\n\nChennai Express has nothing new to offer. So common bollywood love story with Rohit Shetty's action sequences. Movie is made for kids. If you want to watch it anyhow, put your mind aside and watch it at your own risk. Not at all recommended from BuddyBits.com."

Khan and Padukone give good performances with both the humorous and serious scenes. The music is solidly fine, with one exceptionally beautiful song (\"Titli\"). Padukone's costumes are gorgeous throughout the film. Despite it's predictability, it's typical enjoyable Bollywood, and would make a good introduction to those not familiar with the genre."

Shah Rukh Khan found the right mix of Bollywood and Kollywood to reach out the entire Indian audience instead of his usual NRI market. Thank you Shah Rukh for once again proving why you're the King.\n\nAnd to the Northies dissing the film (Some clown reviewers have actually rated the film 2/5)- Enna Da Problem-eh? 1 2 3 4 Get on the DanceFloor! Oh & S.P is back..Wooh Hooh!\n\n8/10 for me. Navin Nambiar,Singapore"

It was all over the place.\n\nBut that's just me.. i have grown to be very picky when it comes to Bollywood movies. Chennai Express has no real-life relevance. It's just a movie couldn't get into any kind of genre."

Boarding the Chennai Express, Rahul meets Meenamma (Deepika Padukone), the beautiful daughter of a crime boss, who is running away from home to avoid an arranged marriage. Unfortunately, Meenamma has been followed by several of her father's goons, who have been ordered to bring the girl back. What follows is a crazy caper that sees Meenamma pretending to be in love with Rahul to avoid her wedding, only for the couple to fall in love for real.\n\nFast approaching my 3000th IMDb review, I thought it was about time I tackled Bollywood, one of the largest and most popular film industries in the world, starting with Chennai Express. Despite not understanding 90% of the humour, which revolved heavily around popular Indian cultural references and differences in language, I found myself enjoying this vibrant, good-natured and lively romantic comedy more than I had expected. Lightweight fluff it may be, but it is fun, with colourful cinematography, likable characters, a few catchy musical numbers ('1, 2, 3, 4 Get On The Dance Floor'), some surprisingly good action (including a well choreographed fight scene, and a car and motorbike chase with some very dangerous looking stunts), and a random boss-eyed dwarf who makes funny noises.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it is that the film was far too long for my liking\u2014two hours and twenty one minutes of romantic comedy is too much for me, wherever in the world it comes from."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love most Shah Rukh Khan movies. And I have enjoyed almost all the movies that Rohit Shetty has done. Deciding to watch Chennai Express first day first show was a no-brainer for me.\n\nThroughout the entire movie, I kept WANTING to like it. Shah Rukh Khan did try very hard and the effort showed on-screen, but somewhere the movie lost the connection with its audience. It is a movie that tries to celebrate itself without engaging the audience.\n\nI am all for this category of cinema. I loved the Dabang movies. I loved the Gol Maal movies (besides Gol Maal 2). I even enjoyed Om Shanti Om. I have no complaints against movies that don't have stories, as long as they are entertaining. I don't even have a problem with contrived jokes, as long as they make me laugh.\n\nUnfortunately, Chennai Express fails on several counts. Perhaps Rohit Shetty was so overawed by the fact that he was directing Shah Rukh Khan that he let it go. Or perhaps Shah Rukh Khan had so much faith in Rohit Shetty's brand of entertainment that he let it go.\n\nThe music can at best be called above average. The songs really don't stay with you, and you expect much much better stuff from a Shah Rukh Khan movie.\n\nThe end result is a movie that falls way short of expectations - at least mine. There are some good moments - especially between Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone - where they manage to make you laugh, but they are not enough to keep you entertained. Deepika Padukone actually puts in a good performance, especially compared to her previous roles. Shah Rukh Khan is extremely likable, but not likable enough for you to like Chennai Express."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chennai Express is a good comedy starring Deepika Padukone and Shah Rukh Khan. With good acting, bright colours and catchy music it is a solid Bollywood entertainment, a blend of humour with romance and action. Nothing serious or complicated, just a film to have fun but with nice message that, despite hundreds of languages in India, love has no language.\n\nThe story is simple, built around two characters of Meenamma and Rahul. It is weaker in the middle but gets better towards the end and the climax is really good (though the fight is too long). The story is based on India's north&south contrasts. Dialogues are therefore partly Hindi, partly Tamil. If you are not Indian you will need good subtitles. Certainly there are things lost in translation, but even I, with my very elementary knowledge of Hindi, could mostly distinguish two languages and have some fun from that. Some knowledge of SRK's earlier films is helpful to enjoy the film since jokes (like song dialogues or Meenamma's entry) often are reference to his earlier work.\n\nShah Rukh Khan plays Rahul, a pampered immature man from Mumbai, past his youth, who gets a chance to change his life, grow up and take responsibility. Rahul, after the death of his overprotective grandfather, sets out to meet his friends in Goa, though he is supposed to immerse his grandfather's ashes in a completely different part of India. Deepika Padukone plays Meenamma, a south-Indian beauty, running away from a marriage arranged by her father. They meet accidentally in a train, the title \"Chennai Express\", that takes them to an unexpected (for them but predictable for a viewer) destination. Shah Rukh Khan is really good (funny deliberate overacting in comedy part or whatever is required), but somehow Deepika Padukone steals their scenes. She is adorable, strong and funny. Sathyaraj and Nikitin Dheer make their mark as Meenamma's father and Tangaballi.\n\nAction scenes, sometimes ridiculous, are well-made and funny. Cinematography captivates with beautiful bright colours. I like most of the songs, particularly \"Titli\" (for me the best), \"Tera rastaa Chhodoon Na\" and \"Kashmir mein tu Kanyakumari\". \"One two three four\" is a nice energetic dance number. Characteristic background music completes the story without being too dominant.\n\nI enjoyed the film a lot, I might re-watch it anytime and still have fun."

I really wonder how SRK accepted such a kind of story, where deepika has more scope than him and she proved it to metal core. Whole 1st half is completely carry by her, only after that SRK's flavor(LOVE & DRAMA) comes into the plot and all the time he lived in his simple, stylish, most funny dialogue \"Dont under estimate the power of a common man\". Rohit Shetty has his mark on each and every frame. Though many part of the movie are lifted from some Telugu films, they are placed in a right place to make the film more attractive. On whole its SRK's funny romantic action Love Story in Rohit Shetty Istyleee"

Its Rohit Shetty film which has nothing to do with the story or logic, in simple words it was pretty lame. It was all usual stuff we see in his movies like situational comedy, exaggerated action scene, jokes which have been overheard many times, spoofs of many hit scenes.\n\nDirection \u2013 we have seen Rohit Shetty's stuff and his abilities in his earlier movies. Yes we know he can direct what else? I did not get anything which I have not seen previously. Some scenes were so utterly ridiculous that instead of laugh they will make you frown.\n\nDialogue \u2013 Nothing to talk about dialogues. I don't even remember any of them. The jokes were lame and trite, even speaking them in a funny accent had not made me laugh. Singing songs to convey massage brought smile but later it became irritating\n\nActing \u2013 Its first time that the leading actress name appeared before the actor's in the credits. And seriously Deepika outclassed SRK; with her Tamil accent Hindi, I was even convinced that she is Tamil by birth. The only thing I like about the movie was Deepika. It's true that the Indian woman look best in Saree. She was serenely beautiful and looked fab in South Indian attire.\n\nSRK why sir why....? Sorry dude next time, I think comedy is not your cup of tea. Do what you are best at ROMANCE.\n\nCinematography \u2013 Use of camera was superb to capture the scenic beauty of Dudhsagar Falls. I seriously doubt that the places exist in India.\n\nAction \u2013 As usual there were flying cars and intense action scenes which looked good. Appreciation to the stunt director that the fighting sequences were not exaggerated like single punch and 10 men flying in all direction like in previous movies. They were convincing as if a common man is fighting.\n\nVerdict \u2013 being a solo-festive-release and an entertainer as whole you can go for it if you don't have anything else to do.\n\np.s. the movie as a whole wont let you feel like you wasted 200 bucks or so .."

And since I'm not a die-hard Shahrukh fan, my review is very objective and will not go well with Shahrukh fans.\n\nAfter watching the trailer, I had some expectations for the movie but I was disappointed. I found Golmaal movies to be extremely entertaining. Let the critics yell all they want. I enjoyed all the three movies. But Chennai express does not live up-to the hype.\n\nThe plot certainly had great potential for a masala movie. At a time when every other Bollywood movie is a remake of South hits, you'll like this new cross-over premise between North and South. However, Rohit Shetty continues his puerile comedy acts and fails this time. And you may/maynot find Shahrukh's OTT antics funny. What worked extremely well in movies like Yes Boss, DDLJ, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, etc. didn't work in this movie (at least for me). There were a few scenes when I laughed out loud, but I could count them on fingers.\n\nThe action is sub-par for 2013 movie. After watching Rowdy Rathore's physics defying stunts, everyone expects a similar standard from a Bollywood movie, but somehow Rohit Shetty refrains from it.\n\nDeepika's performance is quite something. After a bombastic performance in Cocktail, she does well in this harebrained movie. Priyamani in her sexy item song (one, two, three, four) seems to enjoy herself. And Honey Singh's foot tapping number Lungi Dance is extremely catchy.\n\nAll in all, if you want to go see Shahrukh, then this is the movie for you. If not, you can skip this one and no harm's done."

SRK proved how he can turn a movie for the masses into a movie for the classes. Just superb acting!!!! Watch it especially for him. I know he has a lot of haters, but haters will also like it (mainly because the haters are fans of Salman, who does mass appealing films). So what I'm saying is this movie is for the masses as well as for the classes.\n\nThe plot has nothing much in it.. only a few of unexpected turns with one or two plot holes. But, I hope everyone will agree, acting comes first in Bollywood. Most of us don't care about plot. Still, plot was okay. Enjoyable.\n\nDeepika, the websites are saying she outshines are lead actor, but were equally good to me. And both looks good opposite each other.\n\nNikitin Dheer as villain hardly had a notable role, but did his part brilliantly. A good start to his career.\n\nShetty as director did it again.!!! He proved who's the best action-comedy director in bollywood. Superb work Shetty & team!!\n\nAs a whole, with the music, choreography and editing ... i really loved the film to the core!!!

There's no real story, our lead pair meet then keep running around to different places and getting in trouble with south Indian gundas for 3 hours. Deepikas acting is pretty bad to average. Horrible accent and she looks not very good for most of the movie. SRK is fine but looks way too old for her. The direction is exceedingly poor with a boring pace, strange scene setups and ton, cheesy camera work. Really a lame movie you should skip."

It's not worth a single watch,you'll have to watch At least TWICE. Going to watch it again in theater. Don't underestimate the power of a common man. It's a must watch for every Indian if you are really looking forward for an entertaining movie & relaxed weekend. Best part is you can watch it with your family, Complete family entertainment.

        "review_detailed_main": "i loved the movie. Its totally entertaining movie. Every things is perfect and great comedy , romance with some action. Haven't laughed this much in a film in a long time. Absolutely superb The season of biggies commences from Eid onwards. And it sets in motion with the global release of CHENNAI EXPRESS. Shah Rukh Khan. Deepika Padukone. Rohit Shetty. UTV. Four formidable entities that translate into the ultimate, unbeatable combination. The timing couldn't be better as well: Eid. The hype and buildup, obviously, is best . The question is, does CHENNAI EXPRESS live up to the gargantuan expectations? Does it deliver entertainment, entertainment and entertainment in colossal doses? After all, that's what you expect when you embark on this journey called CHENNAI EXPRESS, right?\n\nRohit Shetty's style is simple: Entertain the spectator with larger- than-life heroism, amusing episodes, high-pitched drama, clap-trap and fiery line , foot-tapping music, gravity-defying action, mass appealing humor... and of course, blow up as many cars as possible in trademark Rohit Shetty style. CHENNAI EXPRESS has all of that and much, much more. Rohit has regaled the spectators with his brand of cinema over the years, pioneering a path which many directors have tried to ape repeatedly. Rohit, of course, continues to stand tall, which is very evident as the reels of CHENNAI EXPRESS terrific .\n\nCHENNAI EXPRESS is *not* path-breaking at all. Nor does it cater to those who scoff at potboilers. Rohit has always claimed that he's still that common man watching movies at a single cinema hall , so his movies, consequently, cater to those with an appetite for good movie. CHENNAI EXPRESS lives up to the Himalayan expectations that you have from the project. It's an entertainer that proves that the SRK - Rohit Shetty combo is truly magical. In fact, it's one of the best combos to hit the good film space.\n\nFinal word? Just leave everything and board this Express called CHENNAI EXPRESS. Pronto. This one's a feast for those who love, adore, relish and worship zany best entertainers!\n\nCHENNAI EXPRESS is a smartly packaged entertainer, an unabashed best fare that packs just about everything that the avid moviegoer expects from a film of this stature. Relying heavily on the age-old formula of love emerging triumphant against all odds, CHENNAI EXPRESS is vintage stuff no doubt, but makes you swoon under its impact. Designed to woo the masses, very much akin to the kind of cinema Manmohan Desai made in the 1970s and 1980s, CHENNAI EXPRESS leaves you beaming, breaking into applause on varied occasions, as the plot advances.\n\nCHENNAI EXPRESS is Rohit Shetty's version of DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE and he and his team of writers whip a tale that restores the spectator's faith in this much-loved genre of cinema. But there is sense and sensibility behind what unfurls on the screen. And that's what gives CHENNAI EXPRESS the required edge when you compare this film with his earlier works. The first half is laced with the usual banter between SRK and Deepika, but the film gets into the groove during the post-interval portions, more so when the love story takes off. Starting from the sequence at the temple, right till the power-packed finale, the graph of the film continues to soar upwards. SRK's line with Deepika's father, the fight with Nikitin and of course, the 'lungi' dance towards the end credits... you exit the auditorium with a wide grin.\n\nAs Rahul, SRK is in top form. Rohit Shetty hands out a character to the actor which was lacking in some of his earlier works. And SRK does optimum justice to the character he's offered,\n\nSathyaraj is super as Deepika's authoritative father. The actor conveys so much through his eyes. Nikitin Dheer's towering presence adds a lot of weight to his character. He could just become the new face of menace. Veterans Lekh Tandon and Kamini Kaushal, as SRK's grand-parents, make their presence felt.\n\nOn the whole, CHENNAI EXPRESS has the trademark Rohit Shetty stamp all over. You seek entertainment, entertainment and entertainment in a film like CHENNAI EXPRESS and the movie lives up to the hype and hoopla surrounding it. The tremendous craze surrounding the film, the Rohit Shetty - SRK - Deepika combo, the Eid release, besides the extensive release strategy by UTV, should ensure a record-breaking start for this biggie. Right from the paid previews to the opening weekend to Week 1, CHENNAI EXPRESS should be on a glorious march in days to come, setting new records in India and also in the international markets. All you lovers of action ,Romance and comedy movies, board this Express pronto!"

The only thing which i like in the movie is Deepika she is so hot doesn't matter what she is wearing. Except Deepika there is nothing in this movie please don't watch this one. This is that much stupid it might irritate you with in an hour time. So better not give it a chance and seriously pity on Bollywood as we are making this kind of movie and they are becoming sensation. Please guys wake up i don't know what wrong goes with the audience. I was enjoying eating popcorn rather than watching a movie. There is no story at all. It was 2 hours of torture. I was suffering from headache during whole movie. There bloody 20 years old jokes will torture you and make you feel like screaming.\n\nSo this is just a another movie with no meaning, piece of garbage and please Rohit don't make a movie like that again you already owe my 2 hours."

Pros: Since Tamil is hard to pronounce, new people might find it hard to pronounce it correctly. SRK was able to do his best. He bridges gap between North Indians and South Indians. Film is a comedy film with light romance. No vulgar romance or dialogue.\n\nCons: Since people from Kerala (Malayalees) are more in Chennai, Malayalam dialogue was present. Kerala dances are also shown. 2 songs are good. Make up for SRK was not that great. Some places, over makeup is clearly visible Sathyaraj (Don) ending performance was poor. Tamil dialogue was 2% of the film. But anyone could understand 'cause they tried the best to convey it in Hindi as well. Since most of the film story is based on the south (tamil only speaking state), it would look stupid to show people over there speaking Hindi.\n\nIn short, those who comment that this film is not good, are not honest."

Kamini Kaushal (playing SRK's grand mom) makes Rahul swear that he'd immerse the ashes at Rameshwaram. Rahul is the smug types and promises he'd do so but is actually planning to go to Goa instead. He boards Chennai Express and then that fateful parody of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge occurs. Rahul(SRK) stretches out to help Meenamma(Deepika Padukone) board the train. From there on, it turns into a full blown bollywood orthodox. The story is great, holds you till the end. Acting, Direction and music composition is rich, classy and fast-moving. A total entertainer. Its a classic in the making. Ready, steady, Po!"

        "review_title": "Over-The-Top Shah Rukh Khan minus the headache",
        "review_detailed_main": "The days of Shah Rukh Khan being the king of romance are clearly behind him; the failure of 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan' bears testimony to this fact. As he inches closer to fifty, he is still busy gyrating to masala numbers with actresses half his age. But, guess what, with 'Chennai Express', the masala formula seems to have worked in his favor.\n\nAfter 'Om Shanti Om' and 'Ra.One', this is the third of Khan's films where he plays the regional card to generate humor. Nonetheless, his role in 'Chennai Express' is less inane; at least, he doesn't eat spaghetti with curds as in Ra.One. As with any Rohit Shetty film, there are cars flying before they blow up into pieces.\n\nRahul, naam toh suna hoga, as SRK is called in many of his films, is required to travel to Rameshwaram to immerse his grandfather's ashes. While he plans to get off the train mid-way and scoot with his friends to Goa, fate has other plans for him. Incidentally he helps Meena (Deepika Padukone) and a few goons to get on-board a running train in DDLJ style, played repeatedly to make it hilarious.\n\nFollowing the funnily remixed Antakshari sessions with Meena, attempting to converse in Hindi so that the Tamilian goons don't understand it, Rahul understands that she is being Kidnapped. It turns out that Meena's father Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram (Sathyaraj) is a Don and wants his daughter to marry another goon, Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer) and all that stands in between is the common man, err, Rahul.\n\nThe story is extremely weak and relies upon SRK's histrionics to make it funny. The many parodies to Khan's old films and popular dialogs evokes laugher. His popular pose with outstretched arms now comes with the self-deprecating line \"Don't underestimate the power of the common man\". It is axiomatic not to expect logic from its wafer-thin plot made like a formulaic Telugu/ Tamil commercial blockbuster.\n\nObviously, being a high budget film, the sets and locales look impressive on screen. Dudhsagar falls, portrayed as the train stop for Meena's village is shown in its monsoon majesty. The locations for Tamil Nadu have mostly been re-created in Panchgani & Wai with some scenes filmed in Munnar and a lake in Kerala where the village set makes it look idyllic. Visually, there is nothing to complain about.\n\nThe film's weakest link is Deepika's awful accent. She sounds neither like a Tamilian she portrays nor her native Kannada accent which is evident in television interviews. To confirm the awfulness, I did check up with a few Tamilians who watched this film and each of them expressed disgust at the way she mouthed those lines. Adding to the mess was her overdone facial expression, must have been a rub-off from SRK.\n\nOther actors like Sathyaraj or Nikitin Dheer, who played the towering villain in Jodhaa Akbar did a reasonable job. The goons are very typical of any of Bollywood's typecast portrayal of south Indians as being dark and fat. But, going by the trend of south-style flicks raking in the moolah and being lapped up so lovingly by movie going public, Bollywood junta has lost its bragging rights about being better than southern films.\n\nThe film's humor is worthy of a special mention. Along with parodies of SRK's movies, which we have now got used to in many films, the song- humor is well done. One joke that stands out is when Deepika innocently asks SRK if he were fifty years old; and when he expresses shock, she asks if he is actually older than that!\n\nMusic is about average. Songs like 'Titli', 'Kashmir Main Tu Kanyakumari' and the title track are bearable. Fast paced '1-2-3-4 Get on the Dance Floor' could potentially join the Tamil flavored 'Chinta Ta Chita Chita' or 'Dhinka Chika' as dance floor favorites.\n\nVerdict: An over-the-top film by SRK as usual with tons of overacting. The only thing that saves the film is the fact that it doesn't give you a headache and you can get out of the movie hall smiling, either mocking at the stupidity of the film or having enjoyed jokes in a brain-dead mode. Commercially though, the film has been successful."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chennai Express has finally released. Here's my honest review of Chennai Express. I hope you like it. Ratings- 7/10\n\nPositive Aspects- The star cast of the movie is very much suited to their roles. Deepika has done exceptionally well and she deserves a big a round of applause. Her Tamil accent is incredible and her performance in the movie shows that she is no longer a new comer. She is actually the Show Stealer. Shah Rukh Khan's comic timing and the one liners will definitely bring a smile on your face. He has done a good job and is worth appreciable. One thing that is indelible about Chennai Express is its Cinematography. The locations are picturesque and will give you a feeling that South India is actually very beautiful. The dialogs are well written and the Supporting Actors like Satyaraj are worth mentioning. The action sequences are well shot with Shah Rukh Khan defying Gravity.\n\nNegative Aspects- Rohit Shetty's technical crew has disappointed this time. Talking about the direction we expect Rohit Shetty to present a film which is full of action scenes and less melodrama. But his direction is quite abysmal which is evident in the second half of the movie where SRK tries to explain the Empowerment of Womenhood to the commoner's of a Village.It was more like a lecture than a real inspirational speech. The music is not up to the mark and Vishal Shekhar has to be blamed for this. The editing in the second half of the movie is absurd. Three Songs in the second half don't make any sense. Mukesh Tiwari is an excellent actor but Rohit Shetty has not used him to his full potential. The Tamil conversations might irritate you and Rohit Shetty should have thought of using subtitles.\n\nFinal Verdict- Chennai Express is not as good as Golmaal or Singham but it is definitely better than Bol Bachan or Dabang 2. Its a funny joy ride ride that should be on boarded only once. Since its a full masala entertainer the movie will attract the common masses. SRKians will love watching their superstar romancing with the Tall and Beautiful Deepika. The cost of the movie will be recovered within first week due to its mass appealing and SRK's superpower. But we expect that SRK will entertain us more with meaningful cinemas like Swadesh and Chak De in the near future because that defines his Badshahat over Bollywood."

These are some significant massages illustrated by this Love story told us by Rohit shetty and unanimously his best work so far.\n\nAs the journey will proceed you'll begin to fall into love with Chennai Express and till climax you'd so encompassed by the Express that you'll not desire to get down. Picturesque scenery, vicissitudous emotions, funny expressions would have made you their fan already. Grasping cinematography and clutching direction will not let you bored even for a moment. Eventually you'll fly with the speed of CHENNAI EXPRESS.\n\nShahrukh khan once again has proved his reign of acting over the land of India. He is undoubtedly the king of acting. Where ever in any field of acting,he puts his hands, he simply conquers it whether it may be romance or comedy. His expressions make you laugh as well as cry simultaneously.\n\nDepika is superstar after this movie. If you'd been not a fan of Depika,from now, you'll fall into love with her. Chennai Express is lifeless without this beautiful lady. Her acting skills are touching the zenith and for 2 hours she'll appear as the goddess of acting for you.\n\nAt length, SRK fans, it's time for you to party. cheer up. Chennai Express is Blockbuster written all over."

This poorly made film, does not shock me of the Bollywood ignorance of its neighbors in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe hero of the film supposedly portrays Sharukh Kahn as a civilized hero traveling to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu to dump his grandfather's ashes there. Without giving the plot of the film, I would like to say that the Tamils portrayed in the film are like 'zombie like' thugs with unkempt hair and out of shape bodies. What's even more demeaning is that the heroine of the film is with no shoes throughout the movie.\n\nIt is with no surprise that this Hindi made film would portray Tamils as a bunch of murderous and drunk savages. What struck me the most is that the hero is portrayed like a Rama, with his European looking Tamil heroine as Sita, with her father as the bad guy portraying Ravana.\n\nWhat's even more idiotic is the film's 'mix and match,' categorization of Tamils and other so called 'South Indians' as all the same people by mixing Katha Kali and Oddissi dances in their usual 'song and dance,' episodes, leave alone the usual negative stereotypes of Tamils as primitive people. But, then again, that is the reality with the racially divided India.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Bollywood fans for giving the lowest ratings of this film due to their dislike of Tamils and South India in general."

Watching this movie made me want to.\n\nHaven't bothered going to the cinemas to watch SRKs movies in the last few years. Don't know what made me go watch a SRK film in the cinema after so long but I'm sooooooooo glad I did coz SRK is BACK!\n\nIt was AWESOME! It was FANTASTIC from start to finish. I was laughing for 3/4th of the movie and I'm really not the kind of person who laughs at silly / clich\u00e9 jokes. I don't like movies when they're trying too hard to be funny, cool or slick. It was genuinely enjoyable from start to finish.\n\nIt wasn't just SRK who made this movie enjoyable though \u2013 Deepika was just as great as were all the supporting cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "CHENNAI EXPRESS is a comedy directed by Rohit Shetty, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Paudkone. Its directed in Rohit Shetty SH-tyle and re- unites the SRK-Paukone pair after OM SHANTI OM.\n\nThe film revolves around Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) who boards the Chennai Express and witnesses the killing of the ticket-collector. Soon, he has to go to Komban village along with Meenama (Deepika Paudkone) who's the daughter of a don.\n\nSo, the trailer of Chennai Express hit the internet with millions of views and the hype for the movie had been created. On top of that, Chennai Express had been slated for an Eid release. So with all of that, what do we think of Chennai Express?\n\nChennai Express is a half-baked timepass with a wafer-thin storyline that looses itself halfway through the film. The jokes are hardly funny except for a few and the situations placed in this film are ridiculous. Rohit Shetty, who's known for his blockbusters like the Golmaal series and Bol Bachchan along with Singham, has completely failed us with this one. Shah Rukh Khan chose not to make use of his acting skills and Deepika Paudkone is the only actress who is still sane in the film.\n\nThe music in the film is great though and is the only thing worth talking about. Songs like '1234 Get on the Dance Floor', 'Titli', 'Kashmir Dil Tu Kanyakumari' and 'Lungi Dance' have been recent chart-busters and are great to listen to. The songs weren't so well- planned in the film though; they tried cramming too many songs in the second\n\nOverall, Chennai Express does entertain enough to be worth watching on DVD or download. Its a timepass and may do well in single screens, but it was such a letdown for me after all the hype it had created.\n\nCHENNAI EXPRESS- 3.5/10"

You can feel the romance.He has shown that he can also do comedy and action rather than just romance and other serious roles. He has added the charm to the movie. As far as Deepika is concerned she was awesome. You may fall in love with her. Her south Indian accent was really incredible.I can still remember--- BOAKWAAS DICTIONARY. Really have seen such a movie after long time. It is fun. Its a treat for SRK fans. I can just say- Get on the train baby...."

SRK excellently performs the likable and humorous Rahul, while Deepika Padukone does a 100% pure heroine performance. It definitely meets the standards of both the domestic and international film market. Though it has everything from action to romance, it's absolutely strongest aspect is it's farce comedy- like humour; which frames each scene of the movie. It's easy to watch, and easy to enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was keen to watch this movie for one reason. Deepika Padukone. I knew the movie was going to be full of unrealistic action (Shetty Signature),which i understand. He promoted the movie as \"Shetty Style\"in the trailer which is a clear reminder to leave your brains at home before watching the movie, in other words, prepare yourself for a movie filled with action you would normally criticize. Other than the tiny remarks at SRK's previous movies , I found the story unoriginal and un-fresh , scenes filled with desperate attempts at humor and not much attention paid on the romance. Probably the one reason this movie grossed so much money was probably due to the combination of Deepika and SRK(which we all love). Other than that, just another action movie to cater to the masses fueled by a high budget."

Not to mention there were subtle sarcasm and jokes at the expense of a culture which some might find offensive.

The perfect combo of Shah Rukh Khan-Deepika Padukone-Rohit Shetty has delivered a sure shot blockbuster on the festive occasion of EID.\n\nThis is a film that teaches our protagonist Rahul (SRK) about the real meaning of life, relationships, sacrifices, love and the power of common man that never should be under-estimated. Chennai Express is so much better than other mindless films such as rowdy Rather, dabbing or houseful series as it has 0 percent vulgarity or any double meaning jokes which we find plenty in these films. This is a film that the audience, especially Indian audience can watch with the whole family and this is the film's strength as these days it's hard to find a bollywood film like this. The film has all that one wants in a good film, a decent story, believable action sequences (such as hand to hand duel of hero and villain), spectacular cinematography, stunning locations and beautifully shot melodious songs along with a complete dose of comedy through out its run time. One never gets bored as the film runs smoothly and the hilarious banter between the leads is fun to watch. Deepika's accent deserves a special mention here, she completely transforms herself into Meena, a Tamil girl and that is the mark of a good actress. Shah Rukh Khan obviously gives a superb performance, it's nice to see that this man can do comedy with such ease as he does romance!!! This is a light hearted film by SRK's standards as we all know what he is capable of (Darr, Baazigar, Dil Se, Swades, Chak De India, My Name is Khan) and he still steals the heart with his joyous performance.\n\nAnd last but not least, this is Rohit Shetty's best film since Golmaal-1. His next films such as golmaal 2,3, sing-ham, bol bachchan, all the best, were all blockbusters but none of them had any story or any worthy performance. I especially HATED bol bachchan (might be worst film of all time) and sing-ham (melodrama and stupid action killed it for me) but it's nice to see that he worked hard for CE and his hard work is paying off as the numerous queues outside multiplexes, cinema halls, advanced booking in full swing and positive critic and public response are evident! All in all-Chennai Express is a sure shot blockbuster! All round entertainment- deepika's accent, a decent story, full on comedy, hilarious banter between the leads, rohit she-tty's trademark direction and of course, King Khan's performance!!!"

Still the movie lacks in logic Meenamma characters' Tamil is bad also the main villain's) with a horrible climax. The other villains are tamilians so had no problem with dubbing. The movie was taken only for mass audiences and the fans of SRK down here. The movie is certainly a mas-ala movie that would guarantee a fun ride but will be a torture to those who expects logic."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's always something interesting in watching Shahrukh Khan do his usual \"common man\" antics in his films. In Chennai Express, he proves yet again why he is called as King Khan in Bollywood. Teaming up with Rohit Shetty for the first-time, the film's success was guaranteed since its inception maybe, for the film has all the elements of it being an entertainer, with the scenes so well-performed that it won't bore you even for a split second. Truly, it is 142 minutes of sheer refreshment for the mind if not anything else. Deepika Padukone is a wonder to watch every time 'cause she proves her undiscovered mettle with every different character she portrays. While some may have complained that she had overdone her 'wild-child' roles, Chennai Express is that breath of fresh air to see her donning only traditional attires \u2013 mostly Dhaavani's and Kanjivaram Saree's matched with beautifully-designed gold jewelry. What started as a promise Rahul (SRK) made to his grandmother, turned out to be an adventure he hadn't fathomed. On this adventure, he fights for a holiday, then fights for love, and finally gets married after having waited for so long. The film captures the raw beauty of Tamil Nadu in most frames and it shall be a treat for all those watching it. However, the dialect may become a tad-bit difficult to gauger easily since there is a lot of use of Tamil in the film, you would still know what is going on. An unintended adventure taught Rahul how to converse in the language fluently too. Nonetheless, Deepika as Meena is fabulous. She seems to have worked quite hard on her Tamil-infused Hindi for the film and she doesn't disappoint. There are references to many famous films, dialogs and songs in Chennai Express, besides the comic-timing is so well-placed that at no point it would seem as buffoonery. Despite the notion of a film only teasing the taste buds of the masses, this is one that both the classes and the masses are sure to enjoy. So it's an entertaining film, a travelogue, a love story, Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and a lot of elements of Rohit Shetty. You don't need more reason to go and watch the film."

I don't even understand how was it a box office hit. Sharukh should focus on good films and good scripts otherwise his entire fame will be put on ruins, and Rohit Shetty should quit film making as he is becoming worse after each film. Cars flying in the air, chopping the Tyre of a moving car and what more, total bullshit, and they have made fun of Rajanikath in the name of tribute, seriously, not funny and the scriptwriters doesn't know anything about south Indians.

Ha ha ha it was like \"JUST FILMY\" ,on the contrary I loved his aggressive action in bazigarr .. \" Chopra.... \" but this was a real disaster :) Lungi dance song is good but its after movie ends (Because its POWERED BY SUPER S SUPER SIR RAJNI..)

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie badly made bad in all respects, and has a poor sense of humor. The theme is so old , that of the tamil-Hindi cultural divide which has been exploited fully by many artistes before like Mahmood etc. This movie is supposed to be a big box office hit. That shows the sad state of Indian art. But somehow I can't believe this. I refuse to have such a low opinion of the Indian taste. I strongly suspect the media published figures about a movie's box office collections. I think the figures are fixed designed to show the movie as a box office hit though it may not even be a normal hit. The subject is outdated. Why can't the Bollywood come out of it's egg shell or is it just the problem of SRK who is out of tune. The movie's poor taste comes out in the form of showing the tamils in poor light. Who is SRK fooling? In the name of praising Tamils , he has caricatured tamils and ridiculed their culture. How could Rajni ever have blessed this movie? May be he just okayed without even crossing the movie titles. What nonsense? Tamils don't even speak Hindi like this anymore. BTW can SRK identify TN on the Indian map? Pathetic. Could not even bear watching this movie for more than 20 mts. What self righteous arrogance that this movie displays?"

When you watch movies from South Korea, Japan and USA, you wish such movies existed in Hindi cinema as well. Anyway, back to the present movie. Well, I enjoyed it and judging from the audience reaction, they did too. There is one joke after another and most of the actors, did well to play their part. I would recommend the movie for folks, who are fan of commercial movies and open minded to difference cinema. Kudos to SRK, Deepika and everyone else associated with the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie yesterday, and was stunned at the fact that this movie is doing well at the box office. The acting and expressions by SRK are horrendous at times, Thanks to Deepika Padukone, Sathya Raj and the rest of the supporting cast who put in a decent performance to save the movie. The storyline is too weak, and after sometime you feel that the movie is just drifting.\n\nThe comedy is extremely stereotypical. They depict all the South Indians in the movie as dark and ugly, and unable to understand even a single basic word of Hindi, which is definitely not the case. Deepika Padukone's exaggerated accent is irritating at times. Then the fault with the locations, they have shown Dudhsagar Falls in Goa/Karnataka and claimed this to be in Tamil Nadu. The excessive usage of Tamil dialogues in the film may not appeal to the people who do not understand the language, and you would be more involved in the movie if you could understand the Tamil dialogues.\n\nWhat forced me to give a rating of 5 for this movie, instead of a much lower rating, is the spoof on SRK's previous movies, the train scene in the beginning of the movie reminds of you of 'Dilwale Dulhaniyan Le Jayenge', and more spoofs from his other movies are quite funny. Music in the movie is also good with songs like 'Titli', 'Kashmir se', and 'Tera Rasta'.\n\nIts not worth watching this in the movie theater, Just rent the DVD and watch it at home. Its just a one-time watch, and can be easily categorized into one of Shah Rukh Khan's forgettable movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bollywood is fast, exciting and blasts out songs in the most seemingly unnecessary times, Chennai Express is no different to that. It's not that this film is unwatchable I mean for some it could be great fun and it has it's moments for sure, I felt it was just kind of average though and lacked the true spirit it needed to have. The plot see's Rahul planning to spread his grandfathers ashes before meeting his friends where they will have a fun time in Goa, things don't play out so well though and Rahul is dragged into a kidnapping. It is here we meet Meena who has run off from an arranged marriage and her fathers goons are coming to get her. The plot really lifts off from there really, the train is actually not seen for the vast majority of it and the story leads down different channels which can seem a little annoying at times.\n\nThe famous star and really the worldwide face of Bollywood Shahrukh Khan plays Rahul, he is confident in the role and take it on well although ruins a lot of his credibility as a good actor with some more silly scenes. Most praise for this film went towards the lady portraying Meena, Deepika Padukone whose performance is pretty good and she easily outshines Khan in a movie where he receives the vast amount of screen time. I enjoyed the characters on show and the movie uses a vast amount of the strange and wonderful to create at least a watchable ride.\n\nI did feel a lot of the comedy falls flat on its face which is disappointing really as the story is set up well to be kind of hilarious. I think it is truly a share of the blame when it comes to the missed opportunities at big laughs, on one hand Khan is not right for the role in a humorous way but also Rohit Shetty does not direct it in a way which makes the jokes seem smarter. The script isn't so bad and it certainly has its moments, it can be kind of smart at times and some of the scenes where Hindi is mixed with Tamil can create some nice little one-two's between characters who only understand one or the other.\n\nAs the music goes this I feel did not utilise it well enough, it has enough but only a few scenes really give you a big show and even then the songs aren't as catchy as some other Bollywood movies. It is choreographed pretty well although I can't say Khan always seems right in certain scenes, he does however provide any jokes that he does get right mostly within the dance scenes. The locations used in this are one reason alone to view this movie, fantastically set up and the use of the mountains and hills in the background make some scenes that are not that great to watch, very beautiful indeed.\n\nOverall Chennai Express is not really a movie I would recommend but it's definitely watchable, for those who are massive Shahrukh Khan Fans then this will probably please you. As movies like this go though there are plenty more out there to recommend, the only reason this is so big is one because of it's big stars but two because it received so much money at the box office, and in that becoming one of the biggest international Bollywood movies ever, that doesn't make this good though."

Only good thing about the film was Deepika Padukone. She has grown leaps and bounds as actress and performer. Three cheers for Deepika and three cheers for the music that was good if not great. Lungi dance has become a national anthem of sorts, and is playing in every corner of the country. Romantic chemistry is sometimes there and sometimes not there between the pair. But when it is there, it is only because of the one and only Shahrukh Khan, who once again plays \"Rahul\". 'Disappointing' is the only word that I felt when it ended."

        "review_detailed_main": "As usual in a Rohit Shetty film, i was hyped to see Chennai Express mostly because of the cast and the stunts in the trailer. They even released one song (1234 get on the dance floor) as part of the hype. However, as usual in a Rohit Shetty film, the hype becomes overwhelmed with disappointment as Rohit shetty portrays performances and script writing. Chennai Express falls under that category unfortunately\n\nNow onto the plot. The story starts with Rahul Mithaiwala (Shahrukh Khan) a sweet-seller who has to fulfill his grandfather's last wish and that is half of his ashes will be immensed in Rameswaram. Rahul then boards on the Chennai Express only to help Meena Lochini Azaghadusundaram (Deepika Padukone) the daughter of a Tamilian don, jump on the train along with 4 of her cousin-brothers. He then meets Meena's father (Sathyaraj) and her fianc\u00e9e Tangabali (Nikitin Dheer) in which challenges Rahul to a fight and the winner marries Meena. Meena and Rahul manages to escape Meena's hometown and start a life on their own until tragedy happens.\n\nInteresting story? Well not really because I've seen this all before. Hero fighting villains for girl's trust and girl not willing to do what her father tells her to do. Come on, can we see a plot that's not been taken away from previous movies. And also can you stop with the DDLJ references? DDLJ is considered a legacy in which cant be used for comedy.\n\nThis movie was really hyped for me, until i watched the movie in which in my opinion, sucked. And you guys will understand why.\n\n1. Performances: Well the performances from the supporting cast were really just wasted. They had no reason to be in the film as it mostly revolved around SRK and Padukone. However, it was nice to see the legendary Kamini Kaushal after a long time. Now you hardly get to see her in films again as she ages. It was also nice to see Mukesh Tiwari (aka Vasooli) but he overacted as the Punjabi inspector. Sathyaraj was really dull as the don cum father because he showed no emotion. Nikitin Dheer as Tangaballi really sucked. his dubbing was horrible whoever dubbed for him in Hindi. And also we didn't see much of his action\n\n2. Shahrukh khan. Here is one reason why i went to see the film. Mainly because it was SRK's first film with Shetty and he would've saved the film. I thought wrong. As much as i am a huge fan of SRK, he did a horrible job in the film. He completely hammed throughout the whole film. Then again i don't blame him, it's all shetty's fault for making SRK play like a child with no IQ as he does with all his heroes and cast. he showed no comedy but overact his character.\n\nThe saving grace of the film is Deepika Padukone. She saved the film with her impressive Tamilian accent and her performance. She was funnier than SRK no doubt. Her \"bed scene\" with SRK (No sex included) was honestly the best scene ever as facial expression really made it so hilarious. She was the reason why the film didn't flop.\n\nThe music was okay. Songs that are worth listening are Titli and Kashmir Main\n\nOverall, boring movie with retarded characters including SRK. watch the film ONLY for Deepika Padukone."

The dialogue was shallow and cheesy, the storyline fragile with a rather unnecessarily gruesomely violent scenes towards the end. It really beggars the question 'how it got Padukone and Khan' to sign up for it.\n\nOverall, this was more unpleasant than a cold shower. The high expectations upon entering the theatre were quickly shattered."

But after the half , the movie took on well . The director's intention was not much clear , in the case of expressing the sole idea of the film , whereas the story of it can be interpreted,i.e,it is a love story . Shah rukh Kahn sir's acting was a tremendously good for Rahul. Deepika padukone mam done well in the field of Meena mainly in disclosing her expressions . But It can be felt that something is missing at the time which I have mentioned earlier.i.e after first quarter of it's journey . Neglecting that the movie is really good to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Chennai Express\" is a delightful Bollywood film that seamlessly blends action, romance, and comedy. Released in 2013, the film directed by Rohit Shetty stars Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in charismatic roles. The story follows Rahul (played by Khan), who embarks on a journey to immerse his late grandfather's ashes in Rameswaram, only to find himself entangled in a series of misadventures when he boards the Chennai Express.\n\nOne of the film's strengths lies in its engaging narrative, which is both entertaining and heartwarming. The screenplay, penned by Yunus Sajawal, strikes a perfect balance between humor and emotion. The humor is largely derived from the clash of cultures between Rahul, a North Indian, and Meenamma (Padukone), a South Indian. The cultural nuances are portrayed with a light touch, adding to the film's overall charm.\n\nShah Rukh Khan delivers a charismatic performance, infusing Rahul with his signature charm and wit. Deepika Padukone complements him brilliantly, bringing energy and authenticity to her character. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads is palpable, enhancing the romantic and comedic elements of the film.\n\nRohit Shetty's direction is commendable, particularly in the way he orchestrates the film's action sequences. The train-based sequences are executed with finesse, combining adrenaline-pumping moments with the film's comedic elements. The cinematography by Dudley captures the scenic beauty of Southern India, adding visual appeal to the narrative.\n\nThe music of \"Chennai Express\" is another highlight, with Vishal-Shekhar composing a soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's mood. Iconic tracks like \"Lungi Dance\" and \"Titli\" have become synonymous with the film and contribute to its enduring popularity.\n\nIn addition to its entertainment value, \"Chennai Express\" also explores themes of love, family, and self-discovery. The character arcs are well-developed, and the film successfully delivers a message without compromising its entertainment quotient.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Chennai Express\" is a Bollywood gem that captivates audiences with its engaging storyline, stellar performances, and a perfect blend of humor and emotion. It remains a testament to the enduring appeal of Indian cinema on a global scale."

Chak de India was a long time ago and he actually proved he could act but apparently doesn't want to. This is pure entertainment, very funny, not realistic and totally overacted in short a typical SRK film. I spent over two hours just thinking of nothing, laughing out loud,enjoying lovely scenery, unbelievable story line, great chemistry and the charm that oozes out of the lead actors... Sometimes it's just what you need after a hard day's work. Mindless fun! And that's why SRK is the King of Bollywood! Amir Khan makes excellent movies but doesn't offer the kind of escapism this movie does! The music is forgettable aside from background music which is lovely and stays in your head a long time after the movie is over."

Cinematography and art direction in this movie really captured the different cultures of south India and north India. Magnificent sets and music numbers added the well needed color to the movie. Chennai Express is a movie which is a fun and entertaining movie but it's no way near a thinking movie. The movie tries to give out a message pointing out how Indian woman lack freedom that message is lost through the comedy of the movie. For a person who is tired of watching movies with serious plot twists this movie is a well deserve break. But if a person tries to logically evaluate this movie then that person will fail miserably."

This movie is absolutely rubbish and total waste of time. I wonder how Rohit Shetty after making films such as Golmaal(2006) how can he start producing disasters like this. He shows a lack of making good plots and finishes. In Golmmal 3 and Bol Bachchan we noticed that. But this was simply disaster. I don't know what is he trying to prove by using Tamil. May be he took the shortcut of favoring a particular group of people and wow the film is super hit in that region. I think Sharukh and Deepika tried their best neither the screenplay,plot nor the writing had the power to make u sit and watch the movie unless you are a typical third class Indian. I can't believe people say it's a good film just because it has Sharukh. And I would also say to Sharukh if your movie isn't a good one then promote it so much. And Rohit you suck."

Everything was phenomenal, from the lighting and productions, to the costumes, the choreography, the singing, and especially the acting. I thought the story was brilliantly told, not only through dance and song, but through the actor's interpretation as well. I liked how they made Meena into a well thought out character who was fighting back against the arranged marriage her father was trying to force her into. I also enjoyed seeing Rahul transform from his weaker and more submissive form into a strong dependable character. Though, it did confuse me on how love alone powered him to beat Tangaballi and his men alone. I would understand if he had had some form of training in hand to hand combat, but it just seemed as if love gave him the power to overcome his foes, and that was weird to me."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently saw \"Chennai Express\" and was very is pleased with the movie. It's a comedy, romantic and action depicts Rohit shetty bring yet another adrenaline-filled, comic, romantic, and action-inspired movie to big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but audience is introduced to a few new characters as well.\n\nNot deviating from Chennai Express, I would like to tell about the plot. The story is about Rahul, a 40 year unmarried man, who lives with his grandparents in Mumbai. After his grandfather's death, Rahul embarks on a journey to Goa but a series of confusions & misunderstanding, he finds himself in Chennai Express, a train that brings a big turn in the life of Rahul leading him to the place where he is destined to be. Frustrated of his misfortune about not being able to go to Goa, Rahul meets Meenama, a South Indian girl from Kumban village in Chennai. She happens to be the pivotal part of the film that changes the monotony of Rahul's life. Rahul witnesses the ticket checker of the train being thrown in the waters from running train by the Tamil goons who happen to have kidnapped Meenama, thus being the only witness to the incident. Rahul is plunged into the world where he is being pestered, troubled & led into some humorous mishap. Shetty has depicted all of this in funny way that audience find themselves having the best time of there.\n\nThis movie is filled with amazing actor who truly makes this film block buster. First ShaRukh Khan gives a legendary performance in this film and is absolutely hilarious. Depika padukone is as the heroine of this film and she lead is his superb funny Tamil-an language accent in Hindi language. Finally Nikitin Dheer is also good at his negative role that suits his personality trough out the film, even though he was playing a negative role. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint .this film served as a great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists.\n\nOne of the best things is that it's so relatable. We all have those twist movements, (many of them having to do with their lives) that makes us cringe. Regardless of your embarrassing situation,\" Sha Rukh Khan\" has probably gotten into something worse movement that he couldn't get out easily from that Situation. You can't help but laugh hysterically at his experience. Finally, I love how in this film when everything seems to be finally going right, yes it can turn around in an instant without giving to much away, there are so many time where we think that \"Sha Rukh Khan\" is finally is going to make a good impression but then messing up all over again, sending you into inevitable fits of laughter. true to Rohit shetty style. At 139 minutes. This film is not fairy long because of gorgeous romantic scenes and impressive dialogues really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. The songs are combination of foot-tapping numbers as well as some melodiously extravagant songs.\n\nOver all this is a great movie a mix of a ton of laughs and a twists story all rolled into one. Despite the films minor short comings, Chennai Express is exciting, creative, comedy and well worth a few hours of your time. . If you have caught up with all Rohit Shetty films, this one you will be the most satisfied with. The first time collaboration of Rohit Shetty- SRK duo will undoubtedly set the box office registers ringing. If you are for a pick-me-up or to laugh hysterically this is undoubtedly the movie for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story follows Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), a 40-year-old bachelor living in Mumbai, who sets off on a journey to fulfill his late grandfather's last wish-to immerse his ashes in the holy waters of Rameswaram. On this trip, Rahul boards the Chennai Express, where he meets Meenamma (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of a powerful southern don. Unintentionally, Rahul becomes embroiled in Meenamma's escape plan from an arranged marriage, leading to a series of adventurous and comedic escapades.\n\nThe narrative is a blend of comedy and action, peppered with moments of drama and romance. The screenplay is fast-paced, with a series of events that keep the audience engaged. The humor is often slapstick but effective, with several laugh-out-loud moments. The journey through the scenic locales of South India adds a vibrant backdrop to the unfolding drama."

It was so nice to be able to go to different places in India instead of going to a different country! I really wasn't reminded of any other movie-I felt like it was really original! I had read that this was going to be a continuation or a part 2 to Om Shanti Om and it wasn't at all. I'm just so impressed with ShahRukh doing this movie-he wasn't trying to be younger than he really is. And of course Deepika is a good actor too. She is beautiful and talented. I hope so much that Bollywood continues to make great movies like this-it will be a classic! Red Chillies-keep up the awesome work!"

The best thing is that it does not have any vulgar scenes like every other Bollywood movie. The Tamil culture is represented beautifully. The songs were amazing. Though i think the length of the movie was short, the actors performances were good. This movie has typical Rohit Shetty over action. But this time it worked out well with shah rukh khan and Deepika Padukone. The other characters did not have big roles. The ending was excellent. This movie has some scenes which are amazing while since scenes were terrible. Yet this movie has no vulgar scenes. Thus i liked this movie as it is a perfect family watch. Just go for it.

Deepika Padukone is absolutely gorgeous, but, her performance in this movie lacks acting skills. Is it the director who does not bring out the best in her, or is it the Indian audience who just wants \" Time Pass \" movies with just a couple of beautiful faces, stupid story line and making fun of dwarfs!!"

Meenama and Rahul fall in love and experienced difficulties, finally, Rahul wins the fight and the king agrees them to get marry. I will rate this film a 8 out of 10. As usual, Bollywood film has very impressive music can traditional dances connecting with the plot. We can easily tell that this is not a American film through the character's clothing and custom. It is interesting to see how the different languages in India is helping Rahul and Meenama to communicate without letting others know. What I do not feel really good about this film is some plots are way too exaggerate, making the audience can not get the point of funny."
