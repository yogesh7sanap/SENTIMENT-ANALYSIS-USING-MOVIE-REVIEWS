        "review_detailed_main": "That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.\n\nBella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.\n\nSo, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their \"love\" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matin\u00e9e price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.\n\n5/10"

        "review_title": "So bad it's ALMOST good.",
        "review_detailed_main": "NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.\n\nAnother much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.\n\nAs a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of \"so bad it's ALMOST good\". Yes, I just invented that category.\n\nThe 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.\n\nOur supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.\n\nOkay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.\n\nThat, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.\n\nAs far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.\n\nAll in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good."

I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on."

I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.\n\nI do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.\n\nRABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great."

        "review_title": "I can appreciate what this wanted and tried to be.",
        "review_detailed_main": "To say that 'Twilight' carries baggage is a dire understatement. The books' reputation precedes them, carrying questionable writing and strong themes of abusive relationships, and it's impossible to watch the movies in 2022 without being aware of much derided special effects, acting, and more. At the same time, one tries to approach movies with an open mind, and it's important to recognize in the first place that these titles were written for a \"young adult\" audience, and all the horrid awkwardness that immediately greets us with scenes of high school age characters is actually very fitting, for good or ill. And secondly - there are a lot of recognizable performers here that have more than proven their capabilities elsewhere, before or and or since; I think most viewers should be well-rounded enough to recognize that even the best actors, given poor material to work with, will look bad in a lackluster feature.\n\nI don't think 2008 film 'Twilight' is especially great. However, I'm frankly astonished to find myself thinking it's not nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be in the past 14 years. Here's the thing: all the ham-handedness, the overt and kitschy flourishes, the bluntness - and above all the stilted and gawky writing, acting, and otherwise execution - doesn't feel accidental. It's bewildering as a movie-goer, absolutely, and hard to swallow, and to whatever extent the approach here was intentional, I don't think it was pulled off with all due success. Yet this is a movie about teens, for teens, with supernatural elements forced in, and at the same time that the picture comes across as unnatural and inorganic, nothing actually seems out of place. It's a flummoxing, indelicate balance, distinctly imperfect, and I can't for one moment begrudge anyone who honestly engages with 'Twilight' and dislikes it. For my part, though, speaking as someone who has watched films of all possible styles, genres, quality, value, from silent classics to Asylum mockbusters - I see what this wanted to be, and what it could have been. I can understand and appreciate the ways in which this does work, and those in which it doesn't. If the series were produced not as feature films but as a program on The CW alongside 'Riverdale' or the like, no one would bat an eye. I don't know if it's totally correct to say I like 'Twilight,' but... I get it.\n\nHair and makeup, costume design, Elliot Davis' cinematography, Nancy Richardson's editing, the visual effects, Catherine Hardwicke's direction, filming locations, set design and decoration, the soundtrack - almost every possible aspect of the production design and art direction, more often than not, is painfully gauche, overdone, and a bit of a burden to bear. That's not to say that it's outright bad; sometimes a particular shot or scene is actually rather fetching, and were more care taken at large I can see where they would have fit in a title of greater repute. Artless as it may sometimes be, it's not sloppy.\n\nOf course, again, much has been made of the acting. To be frank: especially knowing what the cast are capable of, what I see in watching this are actors who worked with what they were given. At risk of repeating myself, the overwhelming awkwardness that pervades the picture from the very start is built into the characters and their interactions, the setting, the scenario, and every little detail, for better or for worse. In a story about young love, new friends, uncertainty, and personal and interpersonal conflict, all the somewhat halting, forced, or artificial expressions, movement, or delivery don't seem entirely wrong - but instead, kind of appropriate. Director Hardwicke has some noteworthy credits to her name, and if occasionally her contribution here is lacking, when it comes to guiding her cast, I think she was rather on point. Once more, it's a very fine line the production walks, an uneasy balancing act of \"just right\" that ever risks slipping into oafish gracelessness. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Billy Burke, Nikki Reed, Anna Kendrick, and everyone else on hand did their best with what they had. None of the performances here are great - but by no means do I think they're altogether rotten.\n\nAnd that leaves the writing. Though I have certainly heard much about Stephanie Meyer's books, I freely admit I haven't read the source material, and I can only make assume that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay is reasonably faithful. It's worth noting as well that Rosenberg has a considerable number of credits and indeed accolades to her name. The same facets I've described with 'Twilight' broadly certainly apply here, too, as the dialogue and characters vary between tawdrily brusque and direct, inelegantly clumsy and unrefined, and or what feels like is simply suitable. The scene writing, informed by Meyer's own, similarly has some bright spots, while at times struggles with contrivance. However, I also get a sense that this is just one of the difficulties of telling a YA-supernatural romance story; I find it hard to imagine there are many ways of showing scenes of Bella and Edward's blossoming love, or the demonstrations of his powers, that wouldn't come off as strained and cringe-worthy. And the overall narrative has problems in the small details, and above all treads murky territory with the questionably handled overtones of domestic violence and abuse. Yet the bare essence of the tale - a human mingling with \"creatures of the night\" - is classic, with familiar themes, and is no less worthy just because of the high school setting. In the wide strokes, I think the screenplay is just fine.\n\nWhat I think it all comes down to is that this is a movie that, beyond the presumed target audience of teen girls, is best left for those viewers who are wholly receptive to all the wonderful, weird, wild, or woeful possibilities that cinema has to offer. I genuinely believe that 2008's 'Twilight' is quite far from a bad movie - but I also readily recognize that I say this from a place of having done my best to find the value herein. Apart from the thematic material in regards to relationships, the biggest issue I see are the special effects - done well such as they are, but not considered at the storyboard stage with particular mindfulness. Everything else, from writing, acting, and directing, down to the slightest rounding elements, are \"okay\" or \"apt\" but constantly border on tactless or unsophisticated. For what it tried to do, and be, I think 'Twilight' was more of a success than not, but it tripped over its own two left feet a little bit too much for it not to be noticeable. Color me surprised, though - I can't say I wasn't entertained."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I just got back from watching \"Twilight\" and I must say, cheesiest, choppiest, worst characterization of a movie I have seen in years and by far the worst Book adaptation I've ever seen! It even beat my discontentment with Ella Enchanted.\n\nAs avid readers, we do not go to a movie to see \"surprises\" or script changes! We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare.\n\nBella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She's so clumsy it's funny, she's sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it's like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She's comical, did you even read the book?\n\nEdward, don't' look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you're suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn't' portray Edward's genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i'll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out.\n\nAlice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it's annoying. actually don't wear hats, Emmet's not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright.\n\nOne question plagues me though... WHY WEREN\"T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we'd enjoy it!\n\nJacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he's a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don't you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn't' have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn't realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn't ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies.\n\nThe chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking.\n\nI actually didn't care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn't' care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You're adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter's final book, I mean best seller's list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn't you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene?\n\nI honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I'd prefer it if you didn't. You have ruined my vision of it, you're killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn't read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn't even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward \"I would like you to meet my family\" next two minutes, \"wow you have a really nice house...\" um... hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It's called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day...? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn't know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did.\n\nAs readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I've taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i'm also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I'd make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I'm sure hardly any of them did.\n\nThis by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I'm only eighteen.\n\nADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid.\n\nYou're lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES!"

But not with the Twilight movies. They are like the books, and this without a big budget. So if you have a hard time and you need a simple but nice movie to watch to leave into another world. Please watch this."

        "review_title": "Twilight (2008): A Love Story That Sparkles and Divides",
        "review_detailed_main": "Twilight, directed by Catherine Hardwicke and based on the best-selling novel by Stephenie Meyer, is a 2008 romantic fantasy film that has garnered both passionate fans and vocal critics. Starring Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan and Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, the film explores the intense and forbidden romance between a teenage girl and a vampire.\n\nPlot and Setting: The story follows Bella Swan, a 17-year-old who moves to the small, rainy town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she becomes fascinated by the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, a student at her high school who turns out to be a vampire. As Bella and Edward fall deeply in love, they must navigate the dangers that come with their relationship, including the threat posed by other vampires.\n\nPerformances: Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella is characterized by her understated and often introspective performance, which some viewers found relatable and genuine, while others perceived it as lackluster. Robert Pattinson brings a brooding intensity to Edward Cullen, capturing the character's internal struggle and romantic allure. Their on-screen chemistry, while sometimes awkward, effectively conveys the magnetic pull between their characters.\n\nDirection and Cinematography: Catherine Hardwicke's direction emphasizes the moody and atmospheric tone of the Pacific Northwest setting. The film's cinematography, with its muted color palette and frequent use of natural light, enhances the ethereal and otherworldly feel of the story. Notable scenes, such as the iconic meadow sequence and the thrilling baseball game, are visually striking and memorable.\n\nSoundtrack and Score: The film's soundtrack, featuring artists like Muse, Paramore, and Linkin Park, plays a significant role in establishing its emotional and youthful vibe. Carter Burwell's score, particularly the haunting \"Bella's Lullaby,\" complements the film's romantic and dramatic moments, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nThemes and Reception: Twilight explores themes of love, identity, and the struggle between desire and self-control. Its portrayal of a love that transcends the ordinary resonates with many viewers, particularly its target teenage audience. However, the film has also faced criticism for its portrayal of romance, with some arguing that it promotes an unhealthy dynamic and idealizes problematic behavior.\n\nCultural Impact: Despite its polarizing reception, Twilight has had a significant cultural impact. It sparked a global phenomenon, leading to a successful film franchise, merchandise, and a dedicated fanbase. The film also played a pivotal role in the careers of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, propelling them to international stardom.\n\nConclusion: Twilight is a film that elicits strong reactions, both positive and negative. Its blend of romance, fantasy, and teen drama struck a chord with a vast audience, making it a cultural touchstone of the late 2000s. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, its appeal lies in its ability to tap into the emotions and fantasies of its viewers. Whether you love it or loathe it, Twilight remains a significant entry in the landscape of young adult adaptations, leaving an indelible mark on pop culture."

To be honest I'm so happy to see that after this saga they went to another movies, genres and proved that they have so much talent. I think it was such a learning curve for the actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a gay 66 year old man, I am clearly not part of the intended audience for this film, however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe film is filled with handsome teenage males, and many homely ugly- Betty goonily-dressed females, including the lead Bella. The boys either strut around looking pretty, with blank expressions, like runway models, or they act like silly hyper active grade 4 school boys. The boys are so inept in their attempts to impress the girls. Bella rudely dismisses them all with a look that says, \"You have got to be kidding. You thought I would have anything to do with you?\"\n\nBella is cranky, rude, not very bright, without interests, hobbies or talents. However, she is new to the school, which gives her some appeal.\n\nEdward, is considered the ultimate dreamboat by all the girls, but he allegedly considers himself too good for any of them. I thought the explanation was that he gay, but it turned it out was because he was a vampire.\n\nAll the ugly girls get cute boyfriends in the end, but that fantasy- fulfilment story is very much in the background.\n\nTo my great surprise the plot of the first half of the film unfolds with the ponderousness of a Jane Austen novel. I never expected that from a teen movie. There is great push pull between Edward and Bella. Edward is trying to control his urges to kill Bella and drink her blood. Bella blithely ignores what he is telling her. The reticence builds an incredible tension. It is similar to the sort of tension people in an earlier day felt trying to avoid sex before marriage or gay sex.\n\nWhat makes no sense is why Edward is attracted to Bella but not the other girls. I decided to pretend it had to do with scent or some vampire-only discernible attribute. The real reason has to do with fantasy fulfilment.\n\nRobert Pattinson does a brilliant job of portraying Edward the vampire. His approach is similar to Stephen Moyer playing the courtly vampire Bill Compton in True Blood. He is calm, patient, breathy, intense, old- fashioned. He is handsome, but in an almost non-human sort of way.\n\nAt one point he says roughly, \"I am the most dangerous predator on the planet. Even my face, by voice and my scent are designed to lure victims.\" You look at him, and imagine his exotic scent, he is speaking literal truth. It is like an electric shock. Photographs of him are not sufficient to show what I am talking about.\n\nLike the Superman I movie, Edward gradually reveals his powers to Bella. Unlike Lois Lane, Bella is completely unimpressed.\n\nThe movie shifts gears to comedy, when Edward takes Bella home to meet the \"family\".\n\nThen the movie shifts gears again, stealing the special effects from Superman II, where the titans battle.\n\nBella always chooses the most dangerous possible thing to do at each stage. It obviously helps the plot, but it made me want to smack her for being so stupid.\n\nBella within almost minutes of meeting Edward decided she wants marry him. Then a week or so later she decides even marriage is not sufficient commitment. The want him to commit for eternity of life as a vampire. The belief that there was only one true love for me caused me untold misery. I might even go so far as to say it ruined my life. I hate seeing that poison being sold to unsuspecting young girls."

        "review_title": "Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite'",
        "review_detailed_main": "After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels.\n\nFew Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film.\n\nHowever, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the \"Harry Potter syndrome\", feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow.\n\nBut most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary.\n\nThe film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his \"sultry, moody glances\" delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through \"stern but absent father\" clich\u00e9s to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob.\n\nWhile Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to clich\u00e9 and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy.\n\n-4/10"

The only clue that time had gone by was in the dialog (I swear the clothes rarely changed!), and only in passing. Also, Bella's high school seems to only consist of parking lot, cafeteria and Biology. Ha!"

I sat back in my seat and listened to my whole theater erupt in laughs, gasps, sighs and jumps at all the right places. Granted most of us in there were young women, but the movie just plain rocked that way. It sucks you in and tells the story just right. Even my friend who hadn't read the books was just as enthralled as the majority of us fan girls.\n\nThe humor was Twilight's greatest asset. The baseball game was amazing and the mirror fight scene was tense. I enjoyed the music, the non-overdone visual effects, the adherence to all major plot points and characters and the ending. The ending was pretty much the best. I walked out really salivating to see the next 3 on screen, just like that.\n\nIf you give Twilight a shot, you shouldn't be disappointed. It's that good."

But come on how can you give the main role to someone who can just blink and shake her head all the time?!?! Then came the second disappointment. Robert. He did not act like he was suffering from the pain he was going through but really looked like he had to pee so hard... he should have been something like \"Adonis\" but do not go deeper into the look, I may have a quite twisted imagination of Adonis :))) When I read the book I realized that the actors are the smallest problem with the movie. Why oh why did they write over almost all the scenes??? The best parts had been simply cut out - they wanted to write drama or what? They should have kept the easy jokes and chatting in order to avoid choking the story into boredom...those could show the real side of Bella - a lovably woeful, inexperienced teenager girl instead of a depressive loser. The only thing I can give a 2 is because of the actors chosen for Alice and Charlie - I really appreciate them! Okok, Emmett is also fine :) All in all, if I could start it again, I would definitely not waste my time for the movie but reading the book over and over again (like I do it every day :)).

While the movie is not perfect, it is very good fun and delivers as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. So don't raise the bar of your expectations too high - this is NOT going to be an Oscar winning masterpiece and it is NOT going to enter the IMDb Top 250.\n\nThe story is simple - Bella Swan is a common girl which falls in love with the vampire Edward Cullen. Cullen's family are \"vegetarians\" - they drink only animal blood and do not attack humans. Then, however, are the \"classic\" vampires that would not hesitate to do it, and Edward protects Bella from them.\n\nI guess those who hate the movie do not know what a bad movie really is. You can call a movie bad when you regret that you watched it and when you feel that you have lost two hours without any good reason. \"Twilight\" is not that kind of movie. It has a sense of direction and it is not just \"flowing around\" like other movies. Acting is pretty decent. Although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress, Robert Pattinson (Ed Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James, the villain vampire) excel in their roles. Although the story is not one of the most original ones, it does not bore people and if you have nothing to do, I would recommend seeing \"Twilight\".\n\nOh, and by the way, for all the girls who adore \"Twilight\", I guess I get them. After all, Ed Cullen is good-looking, super-strong, super-fast, sensitive, who wouldn't like him?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I begin, let me just say that I haven't read the book, so I'm not some die-hard Twilight fan or anything. In fact I hadn't even heard of either the book or the movie until a couple of months ago when my cousin (who had been reading the entire series) showed me her books and talked to me about it. She even said that there was a movie for the first book that was going to be released in a couple of months time. I remained uninterested, and I still lacked the enthusiasm to actually want to watch this movie in the first place, despite all of the frenzy over it, particularly with my female friends who, at the moment, have gone absolutely gaga over the male lead, Robert Pattinson (who plays the role of Edward).\n\nIt was only two days ago, when a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen since June (because I moved to another school), asked me if I wanted to go to the cinema with him to watch Twilight. There really wasn't anything else on that could have been better, so I just thought \"what the heck, might as well give it a shot\". And so I did.\n\nThis friend of mine is not really the kind of person to be watching movies like Twilight. Indeed, he is more of an action/superhero film type person, and so I don't think he liked the film that much (at the end I noticed an iPod earphone in his ear - need I say more?). Even now I'm still quite surprised that he even suggested watching Twilight in the first place.\n\nI, on the other hand, consider myself more open to different film types, and I enjoy a little bit of almost everything, Twilight being no exception.\n\nThe choice of actors was simply a job well done; all of them fit into their roles perfectly. Pattinson, with his amazing, masculine good looks and pale skin, fits perfectly into role of the \"both-warm-and-cold\" vampire that is Edward Cullens. What I mean by \"both-warm-and-cold\" is that despite his cold looks and temperaments, he is an extremely likable character and his somewhat hopeless romanticism takes over slightly without tarnishing his vampire image. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else who could suit Edward's role better than Pattinson. Needless to say, he also makes really good eye candy.\n\nThe choice of Kristen Stewart as Bella is also very noteworthy, as she also manages to fit her role as a pale, very reserved young woman really well. Bravo to her too.\n\nJust - bravo to both of them. Never have I seen such chemistry in a film. They are just such an item, and it's easy to see how much in love the two characters are thanks to these two wonderful actors.\n\nI felt that the film was filmed really well, too. I particularly love how every second of the film in Forks (the main setting of the movie) looks so cold and grim, and it kind of adds to the whole bleakness of it all.\n\nAll of this, however, does not mean that Twilight doesn't have it's flaws. In the first half of the movie, despite it starting of well, it really seemed to have dragged on quite a bit and it wasn't until the second half that things started to get really engaging and interesting, and even exciting. Unfortunately I still don't quite understand one or two elements of the plot as much as I would have wanted to, so obviously that's a major flaw too.\n\nOn a more minor note, the special effects could have been a little better, particularly with the whole \"speedy vampire\" business, which looked somewhat unrealistic, but despite it being unrealistic in the first place anyway, the special FX people could have made it seem more real than it actually did.\n\nNevertheless, the above criticisms do not change the fact that it is definitely a watchable movie. It's not perfect, and it definitely could have been, but I guess at least it's kind of gotten me interested in reading the book, now. After watching that film, now I want to read the book so that I can finally understand those things that I didn't. In a way, my criticism of that may be considered a bit of an irony, but it is still no excuse to make the plot incomprehensible. Like I said, the film could have been much better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't remember the last time that I was literally one of 3 or 4 men in an otherwise packed theater. Tonight was just the case when my wife and I took in Twilight. My interest had been peaked by a co-worker who is female and a big Twilight fan. My wife has not read the books (nor I) but did receive the first 2 for Christmas. We wanted to check out the movie and see what all the hoopla was all about. We were not disappointed.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie. It does play like an episode straight out of any female focused romance story that is currently playing on TV. But there is a maturity about the film that brings it up a notch. It is full on love story stuff, but being a guy who isn't afraid to embrace the chick-flick side, I was pulled into the story, even though I know basically the outcome of the whole 4 book set. Catherine Hardwicke spun a very nice tale, it is shame she will not be back for New Moon. I thought all of the acting was top notch, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson the obvious standouts. But it was the supporting characters; Edward's family, Bella's friends and family, that really helped with the enjoyment of the film.\n\nI had heard reports of laugh inducing dialog, never caught any of that. With any story that has a target audience that is in their teen years, one must expect earnest and often overly dramatic dialog and moments. It never goes into the day-time soap variety.\n\nThere was a lot of online snipping from mucho-macho fanboys that mocked the film (without having read the books) and called in a Covenant clone. Too bad they won't let their geek cred take a hit and actually go see this film before bashing it. Not anything that will change cinema forever, but a very different and entertaining take on the vampire genre. The thing I enjoyed the most was the return of romance to the vampire tale. Recent films have taken a more action approach to the vampire tale. I can't wait for New Moon."

Of course, I was bitterly resulted by what I saw, which is nothing more than an angsty teen romance that tries, and fails, to be a hip vampire movie. Vampire movies have long contained simmering sexuality \u2013 Chris Lee positively exuded it in his Hammer outings \u2013 but the theme is reduced to a superficial level in this film, as vampirism is just yet another problem \u2013 like acne and the in-crowd \u2013 that our young lovers have to deal with.\n\nThe movie's po-faced efforts to tell this story seriously (I mean, you want me to take sparkling vampires seriously?) make it all the worse. The overly familiar plot never once attempts to bring anything new to the table, and the late-stage introduction of a supposed villainous character is a real fail. The film's nadir has to be the baseball set-piece, in which a family of vampires use their supernatural skills to beat the opposing team. Cinema doesn't get much more embarrassingly bad than this.\n\nThen again, if sullen teenage heroines with faces you want to slap (Kristen Stewart, I'm talking about you) are your thing, and your have a penchant for spiky-haired loners in white makeup, then by all means give it a go. You never know, you might even enjoy it. Unlike me."

Kristen Stewart is believable and has a wonderfully tough vulnerability. You can almost see the supporting cast holding back a smile or grin, which made it even better. The Pacific Northwest looks gorgeous. It is a very important character in the film. Twilight made me want to take a trip to Oregon and Washington. A walk along the Cannon Beach coastline or canoe down the Salmon River would be lovely. And it would be worth every penny to hire a guide to hike to the stunning Multnomah Falls. Twilight's target audience will definitely see this movie several times. I believe the film will reach the magic box office number it needs to make sequels : )"

        "review_detailed_main": "About a year ago I was already reading and hearing about a new film, something called Twilight, which was going to hit in the fall of 2008. Well, the buzz is bigger than ever and the film finally opens this Friday. Gathering from earlier preview screenings, this film is going to be big. Based on the very popular books by Stephanie Meyer (there are 17 million books in print), Twilight is a unique vampire movie about a girl, Bella (Kristen Stewart) who moves in with her estranged father (Billy Burke) in Forks, Washington. Having always been different, she meets an even more mysterious guy, Edward (Robert Pattinson), who at first is disgusted by her (she's human, he is not) but then takes a liking to her. He's unlike any boy she's ever met and finds that Romeo and Juliet connection. Edward's family is unique; they're all vampires but don't feed on human blood, as a matter of fact, they don't eat at all. They live comfortably in a \"green house\" somewhere in the forest. His dad (Peter Facinelli, Jenny Garth's husband) is a doctor at the local hospital and they have gobs of cash (the books reveal how well off they are, but in the film, there's no explanation). A clan of new vampires are passing through and they threaten the little Pacific Northwest town feeding on the small population, but one in the group James (Cam Gigandet), is out to get the young Bella.\n\nThis modern day love story is the strangest vampire movie I've ever seen. It's sort of a cross between The Lost Boys and Gossip Girl, which if you think about it, is a pretty enticing combination. I have to admit, having not read any of the books in this four-part series, I didn't know what I was in for. I knew it was about vampire teens in some Washington coastal town and that's about it, but I was intrigued from the start. The young cast look like your every day teen, and the vampire cast are as pale as Casper the Ghost. Some move swiftly, some sprint up trees and some can see into the future, fast-drawing her visuals on paper. It's all quite impressive. The story primarily belongs to Bella and Edward. The teen vampire hasn't aged in 90 years and finally finds someone who isn't afraid of him. Unfortunately for him, she's mortal. She's definitely not afraid of his blood-thirsty needs and he fights off the temptation of human blood. I'd say he's sort of like an addict that keeps fighting his urges. See... I told you, it's unlike any other vampire movie I've seen. Twilight is certainly no Interview With A Vampire (my favorite vampire movie) or Bram Stoker's Dracula (my other favorite) but it certainly stands on it's own as a love story between a girl and a vampire; it's passionate, exciting, intense and the Northwest locations are beautiful, you just want to drive there for a weekend get-away."

This is kind of sad because I really like movies that stretch outside of reality, but Twilight was more ridiculous than reality bending.\n\nIf this movie came out in the 80's it most definitely would have lend itself to having a cartoon made after it. The theme song could have gone something like \"Twilight, na na na, sparkly vampire take you on a magical ride, na na na, they fight the other vampires cause you smell so good, na na na, twilight vampires don't eat people cause they like to eat cats, na na na,..\" (the other 2 and a half mins of the theme song would be kind of repetitive, but you get the idea) Twilight the animated show would have aired right after The Real Ghostbusters and right before Gummy Bears.

Read the books and you will love the series that much more. It is quirky and shows so much love at the same time. Things don't always go to plan. It's showing one persons life story, yes there are red flags but we all have been in relationships like that... Her and Edward grow together and make each other better for it. He does love her and the more they are together the better he will love her. This movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. Life is strange, let it go."

No one character was fully developed. There was much that was alluded to but never fully explored. How much was the budget? The problem here was directorial not financial. Some movies need polishing up; this one needs polishing off! I watched hoping it would get better - like some poor B movie. What I was left with was mild irritation, like a hangover after drinking bad wine. I can't believe I sat through this. I was so irritated at one point by the acting I almost walked out. I'm sorry this review is scathing but there was little to praise. I had little by way of expectation. I read fleetingly, in the tabloids, that it was a vampire movie. Okay, so it was a film aimed at the teenage market - but honestly, are teenagers, these days, so unsophisticated and banal? I suspect many will vote with their feet. I've heard nothing but praise for the book. I haven't read it. Was it meant to be a romantic movie? If that was the case then it was lost on me. The theme floundered like a damp squid. This was really a wasted opportunity. Give me a Hammer Horror movie any day. Movies starring the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are in a different league. Low budget but with kudos. These actors knew their trade and were proud of it. Not sure which genre I would place \"Twilight\" in, but perhaps the bin would be more appropriate. I remember vividly watching a stellar performance from a stunning Michelle Pfeiffer and the inimitable Jack Nicholson jousting with the irrepressible James Spader in the 1994 movie, \"Wolf\". Now that film was truly a joy to watch. I was moved to tears. The story and suspense had your gripped from the start. It was a roller coaster ride with superlative performances. The film evoked emotion. Memorable? Definitely! I predict that \"Twilight\" (2008), will fade with day break and be a distant memory."

However, the vampire story is a romance like, for example, the excellent version of \"Dracula\" of Francis Ford Coppola also is. The different story and the acting are not outstanding but also not as bad as indicated in many reviews. Actually I liked this movie very much. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Crep\u00fasculo\" (\"Twilight\")"

It's so bad, it's almost good.\n\nThink of it as a comedy and you'll probably enjoy it. It's hilarious in the way The Room is hilarious. There are plot holes, bad acting and writing, and bad special effects. I was shocked that an actor I had seen actually do a good job (Pattinson) could sink so low. It was like he wasn't even trying.\n\nHonestly, I feel sorry for these actors. This movie is laughably bad and they'll be compared to it for the rest of their lives.\n\nWatch this movie with anti-Twilight fans and expect a fun evening full of laughter. But don't try to compare it to a decent movie."

This movie made me start wearing knee high converse unironically and wear an excessive amount of eyeliner daily.

        "review_detailed_main": "I absolutely hated this movie. I went in prepared and fully aware that it wasn't going to be like the book and that they were going to change it so it was more adaptable to the film. I didn't really have any high expectations, I just wanted to see some parts of to life or at least attempt to come to life. I was utterly \"mouth dropping\" disappointed. I don't know how Stephenie Meyer could have let this even happen to her precious story. There was no character construction, you didn't connect with the characters and this has nothing to do with casting for the actors. I don't even blame it on the director. THERE WAS NOOOOOOOOOOOO SUBSTANCE AT ALL!!! You didn't feel any connection with the love story. Events meshed in and clashed due to wrong timing and placement of scenes. Crucial scenes were left out for useless scenes ( field trip?!?!?!?!) Even though the scenery was breathtaking they could have cut out at least 40 minutes of it to develop the storyline better. They killed the story. It was horrible just plain horrible. This was worse than adaptation of Harry Potter. I was disappointed when i first saw Harry Potter, even though i accepted that it would not be the same and still enjoyed the movie. This is on a whole new story. At least Harry Potter made you feel like it was the essence of the story still there just cut short. Twilight was just like seeing two strangers that have no real established connection no relationship (They don't even have a friendship) and then suddenly they are together and now they are trying to save this girl who doesn't even seem like is in that much danger to the very end. I laughed in some parts but then there were parts where it was not meant to be funny and they tried too hard to turn the situation into a comical moment.\n\nAlso the fact that inconsiderate fangirls were cheering for every useless pathetic scene in that movie didn't help to get into it. How can you call yourself a fan of the series if the essence of it was never even portrayed. Even if it wasn't close to the movie at least show some bonding of characters. I don't know how anyone who claims to be a fan of the book can enjoy this movie without cringing at the fact that they ruined the most basic story. Again, I am not talking about the actors' performance nor the directing. I'm talking about the beautiful aching and pain of the story. The soul of the story was never there.\n\nWill not go to another premier of any further movies. Will consider going to other movies but only to go see some the \"story parts\" being visualized. If you disagree, that is completely fine! To each their own! All i know is i love the book and will always love it but this movie killed me tonight!"

I will give credit where it is due though for the fight scene at the end though that could have renewed the plot's vigor for me.... if it wasn't at the end of it, that is, and added even more weight to the predictable column.\n\nOverall, for someone not initiated into this by the book, I'm looking for my time back. I still hold out faith that the old truth still stands firm and \"the book was better\", because if the movie and the book resemble each other as closely as I'm told, I'll be more bored than I was in the theaters.\n\nMy recommendation: if you've read the book, go see it and I'm hoping its better that way, but if you haven't read the book, stay away and find a better use of a night out."

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit, I am not a fan of Twilight. I tried the books, thought they were boring, and forgot about them. I don't hate it, but I can't say I'm a fan. Somehow, though, I ended up going to the midnight showing with a group of friends, all of whom were fanatical Twihards.\n\nThis movie was extremely entertaining to me, but for all the wrong reasons. I found myself laughing at the cheesy, often poorly-delivered lines, Rob's stony, creepy expression, which he retained throughout pretty much every scene, and the headache inducing, cheap special effects. I wasn't the only one; there was plenty of nervous, sometimes incredulous laughter from almost everyone there once the screams died down. In several scenes, it seemed almost as if the director was parodying the book, rather than trying to make a serious movie.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, this movie was not terrible. I liked the setting, it was pretty beautiful, and Bella's father's acting seemed quite believable. The plot also sped along a bit faster than the book did, making it less boring to me. However, Bella's actor seemed wooden, and Robert Pattinson seemed awkward and uncomfortable at times. Sure, he's pretty to look at, but he didn't convey emotions very well and dropped lines in a disinterested, bland way. After a while the movie began to get extremely dull and repetitive to the point where I felt like tearing my hair out.\n\nI liked how they fleshed out some of the lesser-known characters and gave them more personalities, and I loved Jacob's actor. The lack of climax was disappointing, and I found myself getting very annoyed with Bella quickly.\n\nEven so, most Twilight fans will probably enjoy it, but people new to the story (especially adults) will probably be confused (my mom was) and left with an empty feeling. I didn't feel as though I was being tortured by watching it, but besides all the unintentionally comedic parts it didn't entertain me that much."

Highlights include permissive parenting that has devolved into child neglect as both mother and father of a teenager never once question how her strange, new boyfriend ended up along with her in the hospital suffering a badly broken leg and massive blood loss. The Mormon church has some explaining to do.\n\n3 stars for Pacific Northwest tall trees and inexplicably blue atmosphere."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie, despite its polarizing reception, undeniably crafted a deeply atmospheric experience. For all the criticisms thrown its way, *Twilight* has an allure that, even years later, still resonates, especially when you examine the elements that truly make it stand out: the cinematography, the soundtrack, and the magnetic performances of its leads.\n\nFirst, the cinematography by Elliot Davis. He managed to turn the rainy, misty town of Forks, Washington, into a character of its own. The film is drenched in blue and grey tones, casting a moody, almost ethereal veil over the world of humans and vampires alike. It's a choice that subtly enhances the supernatural elements without needing to rely on flashy effects. The forest scenes, where towering evergreens are shrouded in fog, feel both vast and intimate, almost as if the forest is keeping secrets. And that iconic \"meadow scene,\" with sunlight dappling through leaves, evokes a surreal beauty-it's the stuff of fantasy, yet grounded enough to keep the romance believable.\n\nThe soundtrack, too, is an undeniable triumph. With artists like Muse and Linkin Park setting the tone, and Carter Burwell's delicate, haunting score weaving in and out, the music captures the story's intensity and the raw magnetism between Bella and Edward. \"Bella's Lullaby,\" composed by Burwell, is a soft, yearning melody that perfectly underscores the sense of dangerous romance. And let's be real-Muse's \"Supermassive Black Hole\" playing during the infamous baseball scene? It's unforgettable, capturing the adrenaline and strangeness of vampires trying to blend in. The soundtrack elevates the story, not just as background noise but as an essential emotional force.\n\nAnd then, of course, the performances. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson gave us a fresh kind of chemistry. Stewart's Bella Swan is reserved, awkward, but refreshingly real-a far cry from the typical leading lady of fantasy romances. She brings an earnestness to Bella, grounding her emotions in a way that makes the unbelievable feel palpable. Pattinson, as Edward Cullen, brings a blend of brooding allure and vulnerability, capturing the pain of a vampire eternally suspended between life and death. He plays Edward with a haunted intensity, as if every word is both a confession and a warning. Together, they make the romance feel electric yet restrained, an intimate dance of attraction held in check by Edward's fear of his own predatory nature.\n\nIn the end, *Twilight* is a film that holds nothing back in its commitment to mood, music, and a romance that, while unconventional, is as entrancing as it is uneasy. It's unapologetically itself, embracing its own brand of fantasy. And love it or hate it, you can't deny it achieved something rare: it became an iconic piece of pop culture, casting a spell that viewers have yet to shake off."

You can laugh at the poor acting and script, and nonetheless be entertained by the plot and the romance and those lines that beg to be said aloud later and out of context. As for problematic themes, they are there and inherited from the source material (e.g. Unhealthy romantic relationship dynamics and whitewashing/shallow engagement with indigenous cultures, to name just a couple). There are also positive and empowering elements, namely the centering of the female gaze and privileging of a girl's experience (and the diverse, evolving fandom that bloomed from this franchise).

I had already begun complaining to anyone who would listen over the choice of Robert Pattinson as Edward. Turns out that the casting of Edward was among the least disappointing things about this movie. I wasn't even a huge fan of the dialog in the book, let alone in the movie. The relationship between Edward and Bella--prior to when Bella discovered what he was--was way too short. In the book, their relationship is deep and meaningful, in the movie, they take about 10 minutes of the total runtime to get to know each other properly. In some cases, the casting almost made me cry (Edward, Rosalie, Esme.) BUT in other instances, they did a great job. It took me a while to warm up to Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, but by the time I got to the movie, I had begun to think she was a great Bella. Same thing goes with Ashley Green as Alice. At first, I hated the idea of Nikki Reed as Rosalie, but as the movie went on, I thought she suited the role well. Examples of perfect casting would be Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale and Peter Facinelli as Dr Carlisle. The baseball scene was probably the only scene in the movie that was true to the books description. By the end of the movie I was wondering what happened to the rest of it. I understand that they can't include everything, but they should've at least extended the meadow scene--It was a pivotal point in the book. It seemed to play out like a TV show with an introduction, conflict, climax, resolution within a small space of time. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it lacked the depth and substance that the book had. The main problem was they only touched on how strong Bella and Edward's connection is and how problematic this is for both Bella and the Cullens."

The trailer for this film looked fantastic but the film managed to disappoint me. I think what they have done here is the same with \"The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring\", focusing more on the build-up of the upcoming sequels rather than having an integrated story all of its own. The majority of this film was padding and was not needed at all. In fact, if you took out the moments that weren't necessary, you would probably end up with only about 20 minutes of footage. This film was a good idea that they shirked on and it could have been made into something a lot better. Unfortunately, a disappointing experience for both me and my friends."

This series is just so entertaining to me. I think the movie missed a lot of nuance that was present in the book, as movies often do (them getting to know each other, tension, info about the characters that is important to who they are, etc). I also felt that Edward & Bella are much more likable characters in the book. Bella is a genuinely good person, but I think in the movie she comes across mediocre. Edward feels like less of a creep in the books too. Lol. Regardless, I find this movie hilarious and fun."

If you didn't care at all about the careful building of a very ordinary town that Stephanie Meyer so beautifully crafted, or the key features of the characters in the books, then you might like this movie. The acting was hit or miss, the swirling camera scenes were obnoxious, and anyone who read the book would be horrified to see the compassionate and gentle Carlisle played as a cocky slick haired and insignificant character. The actor who played Victoria fits the description of Esme instead of the wild looking Victoria, but the actors playing Alice, Rosalie, Angela, Mike, Bella, and Edward were more representative of the book. I hope they make more because I liked the story so much, I just hope they will take more care next time to develop the setting and characters next time, even if they feel the need to leave in the swirling music video clips."

The idea sounded interesting, vampires and werewolves (not entirely original but hey whatever) fighting with a girl thrown in the mix who falls for the bloodsucking Edward Cullen. Doesn't SOUND bad, until you hear the dialogue and acting jobs of these guys. Bella (Kristen Stewart), has the personality of a bucket and Edward (Robert Pattenson) sparkles with a more flamboyant shine than Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. Putting aside that nonsense, we have ourselves a movie with pointless scenes that just kill time (ex. that poorly made baseball scene) and a plot that leads. Well, to nowhere, I guess to the sequel unfortunately. My biggest complaint with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. Edward just complains about being a vampire, Jacob hates him because Bella hangs out with him more, and Bella has the same facial expression for the whole film. It's badly; written, acted, filmed, the list goes on. That's all I gotta say. Anything else you need to know. Watch the movie, I hope you make it through the whole thing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires. I can't speak for anyone except myself in saying it simply stating that it's not a good movie. Period.\n\nAnd it's not just about the treatment of vampires. Sure, there's that. Sure there is the facet of these being diluted and watered down so-called vampires to the point of being nothing but mockable. But it's simply a story that on its own terms is not told well. It's shot through the filter of whiter-blue-shade-of-pale, where the intent, I guess, is to make Washington state (specifically the town of Fork) look like this all the time.\n\nThe director, Catherine Hardwicke, has directed some decent films before, such as 2003's Thirteen. But here she tackles the material without any subtlety. The cast, featuring sometimes very-good-actors Kristen Stewart and (yes) Robert Pattinson, seem to be in the kind of \"method* subtlety that comes with that caveat of years of the James Dean in-breeding school of acting. Her camera people roam around without, usually, any sense of placement for the sake of the story, and, well, the story itself reeks of stupidity and consequence in the most mind-boggling of happenstances.\n\nPerhaps there could have been at least a semi-interesting or compelling story here, with an out-of-town girl in a new town meeting a young mysterious man at her high school and falling in love and finding he's a vampire and still being really turned on by it and yada yada bad things happen. Or maybe I'm wishing impossible things. Coming from a book by Stephenie Meyer that is more Harlequin romance than vampire lore, it's central problem is giving us characters not only not likable, but without personality. Say what you will about the corny aspects of Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it had characters and story lines that actually meant things, with personalities and humor and real drama that could be affecting. In Twilight the coldness of the environment is reflected quadruple-fold in the characters and story, and the film-making, shoddy as it is, probably reflects that attitude of the book.\n\nOh, and of course, it's corny poppycock a lot of the time, but again it shouldn't have been a problem. I might have even laughed out loud, for all the wrong reasons, at one of the most unintentionally funny scenes of the decade with the vampire baseball scene (yes, it's as ludicrous and bang-your-head-against-the-wall-till-you-bleed without any point for the story save for a West Side Story stand-off). But aside from its abstinence-only allegory (and believe you me, this is the antithesis of 2008's Teeth), there's nothing here a viewer can take away of worth. Nada. Zilch. There's nothing interesting in the romance because the characters are either boring miscreants, befuddled side characters like Bella's father, or 1/2 dimensional drones like that \"bad\" vampire in the mirrors climax.\n\nAnd finally, nothing to add significantly to vampire lore, save for its pop culture phenomena. Maybe I'm missing something the teen girls are seeing, maybe there's something oh-so dreamy about that pretentious navel gazer Edward. But a duck is a duck, and Twilight is an overwrought, meddling piece of a twaddle-corpse movie."

I didn't believe they were in love and the acting was really bad all around. The CGI was pretty bad as well. To make them look like they were going fast all they did was make them blurry. I felt like this movie was made with 90's technology. This movie had so much potential to be great but this movie ruined it.

        "review_detailed_main": "*A bit of a late review, since I saw this on opening day, but I wanted to get my opinion out on my new account.*\n\nI liked the Twilight book. It was a little flawed, but it's God compared to the film. I don't know what the critics mean when they say it will \"please the die-hard fans\". Well, I am a fan, and I wasn't pleased. It's not because I'm hard to please, even though I am, it's just because the movie sucked.\n\nI am not going to discuss the plot, it's about love and vampires, but I will discuss the film's strengths and weaknesses. One of the main weaknesses is the leads. Kristen Stewart is quite bland as Bella. Her face is expressionless throughout the majority of the film, and I did not believe her undying love for Edward. Robert Pattinson is, at times, good as Edward, however, his British accent comes through at parts, and he appears to be trying too hard at times.\n\nThe digital effects are easily the biggest problem. They were very poorly done. The scenes where the vampires are supposed to be running extremely fast, their feet aren't even touching the ground. It just came off as cheesy and I found myself laughing at parts.\n\nNow, the film's strength comes from the secondary characters. The best were easily Charlie and Mike Newton. Billy Burke, as Bella's father Charlie, is nothing like the character in the book, but he had impeccable timing and he was easily the best character in the movie. Mike Newton was hilarious, his booty dance outside the caf\u00e9 stole the whole show.\n\nEdward's family, the Cullens, are more interesting than Edward himself. Carlisle is a bit flat at times, in my opinion, but did a pretty respectable job for what he was given to work with. Esme was very warm and is pretty much everything I imagined her to be. Rosalie is considerably bitchy, and I thought Nikki Reed did a great job. Emmett was not at all how I pictured him, but he was likable. Alice and Jasper are both terrific, though unfortunately underused. Since they are given the least lines, they don't have to utter such hideous dialogue as much as the others.\n\nIn the end, the film is unsatisfying and not faithful enough to the book. Hopefully for New Moon, they will flesh out the characters more and increase the budget so the visuals aren't as corny. I'd say wait for a rental."

Occasionally, there's the odd time where you think \"that was actually convincing acting!\" but at others you kind of cringe and think \"oh that was baaad!\" This is one of the reasons that I think it is aimed at teens, because it wouldn't seem as cheesy to a young mind, particularly if they're seduced by Robert Patterson!\n\nThe script is kind of lame, and I don't know whether this is because the books were lame or not, because I've never read the books, but either way the script needs a serious rewrite if it will ever impress mature viewers."

No, they're are not supposed to drive and vampires do not wear sunglasses, because they're not supposed to be outside on a sunny day! Do vampires eat animal blood instead of human blood?

And Stewart's character of Belle Swan and Edward Cullen have become cult heroes for this younger generation. Needless to say both older Swans and Cullens aren't crazy about these two kids going out. Still as another popular film of a decade ago remarked, somehow these two complete each other.\n\nThis film like the Harry Potter series has inspired a bunch of sequels made and in the planning stage from the novels which are bestsellers among current teens. Pattinson and Stewart are an attractive pair of young people and vampire or not, I sure see what they see in each other. More importantly they do communicate love to each other and to the audience.\n\nThe Twilight series is going to be quite a money maker for a long time to come."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home."

I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times.

In almost every scene, his words flowed almost hesitantly from his mouth. The book describes his dialogue as \"silky,\" \"velvet\" and \"warm honey.\" Also I had imagined him to be more confident than he appeared in the movie.\n\nAnother book-to-film \"mishap\" that irritated me was the speediness of Edward and Hella's relationship. In the book, it seems to build up and Edward is EXTREMELY cautious and reluctant to even touch Bella. The film completely overlooked this, considering the first day Edward and Bella were together, Edward threw his arm around her as if he had no problem controlling his thirst.\n\nThe final aspect that irritated me was the \"meadow scene.\" This scene was absolutely atrocious! I'm not going to spoil anything, however, I think Twilight could have used some nice special effects for this scene.\n\nThis is not a must-see, but it was still worth my $9.50"

A lot of the men hate this movie along with the others, and yes I'm a guy, but you know what, I don't care, I enjoyed Twilight (2008). Now I didn't exactly love Kristen Stewart, just because I don't think she has much range as an actress, but I thought she was OK in this movie.

I attended with ZERO expectation of any depth of character, storyline, dialogue, substance, etc. and it did not disappoint. In my opinion it was exactly all of that: shallow characters, so-so storyline, and dialogue that seemed unnaturally forced and to have amounted to about 5 typed, double-spaced pages for a screenplay. I left the movie with something I wanted to stress to my daughters more than anything else that Hollywood has, yet again, painted a false picture of love and how it looks in real life. This movie (and so many others), paints the hero character, Edward, as uber interested, involved, preoccuppied and concerned for the heroine, Bella, which doesn't even come close to real life is! Boys don't think like that. They don't care like that, that don't agonize over teen girls like that. Of course, I understand that he is a vampire has other fictional reasons to be drawn to Bella, but I think it still imparts a false image of what teenage boys are capable of into the minds' of the movie's target audience (young,impressionable, teenage girls). In actuality, it's really quite the opposite, girls can and some do pine and agonize and involve themselves in the lives of their boyfriends, but boys don't. Not that it could never happen, but the chances of it happening in high school are not likely and not desirable\u0085at least not to this mother of three girls. What a rude awakening Hollywood has set up for our girls...if we as parents are not pro-actively dialoguing with our daughters about the realities of love."

Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (\"Johnny Suede\") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise \u0096 let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the \"I can't live without you\" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot \u0096 the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen."

I understand you cannot put every single detail into the movie, but there was so much time spent on Bella stuttering or climbing trees.\n\nThe relationship between Edward and Bella hadn't been developed enough for it to be believable that they truly loved each other. It seems as though they were still tripping over words and being awkward, way too soon for an \"I love you.\" As far as casting goes, I liked every member of the cast except Bella. She was absolutely dreadful. Bella was supposed to be shy and awkward, whereas Kristen Stewart just came off as stuck- up. Also, the Cullens' white faces were ridiculously fake- looking. Can't makeup do a better job than that? In short, I am also a huge Harry Potter fan. Not only are their books bigger but they also have a lot more detail. HP does a much better job staying true to the book, and has me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Twilight had me about to fall asleep and more entertained by my cell phone.

Whilst yes a little cheesy (some things don't always translate well from book form in most film adaptions). The acting was exactly perfect for the characters that Stephanie Meyers wrote. So even if they weren't the worlds best actors they did a great job in the role they were given. You try to be a hunger crazed teenage vampire who is actually 100's of years old, just met your soulmate who inadvertently happens to be your biggest weakness all the while ignoring your base instincts to kill. It's gotta be a tough gig.\n\nThe cinematography of Twilight is beautiful and not just because of the scenery. Someone actually spent some love and care making this movie. They worked hard to respect the book and respect the atmosphere and feelings that it's meant to portray. This movie wasn't made for film critics or indie movie watchers or men or women who thought it was a joke even before they started it.

Hopefully if this film leads to a sequel, the sequel will be a better overall experience. Kirsten Stewart is perfect but the rest of the cast, even Robert Pattinson, is overly melodramatic.

The film itself is packed full of action and thrills and has benefited by basing itself on the amazing storyline of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. The fact that the movie uses a fictional-fantasy idea that is also an action packed thriller it reels in an audience of an age group between around 12 to around 40. Although mainly for the teens and disliked by quite a few people, it had proved to include the whole family on some level. The film uses the latest equipment in film technology to produce amazing atmospheres in the film that make the dark forests and similar scenes seem both captivating and realistic.\n\nWhether the film may have been created to make the idea of the film seem like it could be real life is undermined, though, by the over dramatic performances by the main protagonist, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), and the almost forced emotional approach by the character Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).\n\nKristen Stewart was way too over dramatic in her part as Bella Swan and made 80% of her part seem like a sob story or a cry for help, reminding me sometimes of Elijah Wood's portrayal of Frodo Baggins from The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Although she did well to capture her audience by making her entrance as the shy, uncomfortable, new girl seem both realistic, believable and relatable.\n\nRobert Pattinson was overly forceful in his attempt to be emotional as the character of Edward Cullen. While he got the eyes of the audience placed firmly on him, he lacked the natural human expression when feeling a strong emotion. For example: during the first kissing scene of the film he looked uncomfortable and shifty instead of the actual nervous and scared; and when trying to look sickened he overdid it and looked, frankly, constipated (I'm just saying...); and finally, when trying to look scared, he forced it too much and looked overly sad or angered. However, I give him that he did manage to capture his audience and reached the goal, enough so, that he went on to star in the last 4 installments of the book series.\n\nOverall, I would give the film a 9/10 for effort, but realistically given my overall opinion of the film I think it only deserves a 6/10"

I almost fell over (good luck I was sitting down), when I realized this movie is 16 years old. 16 years! I have seen this movie many times around 2008 so now it was a while since I had watched the first movie.\n\nFirst of all, I was very surprised as to why I was so obsessed with this movie as it is absolutely cringe. The movie is good but I feel like even though the movie is 2-hours long, it is very rushed. It also is just cringe on so many levels. From jumping from one tree to another to being called ''Spider Monkey''. It was bad. And yet a big, fat 10.\n\nThis movie was bad in a lot of ways but so good in a lot of other ways. The cast went on to have great careers and was good to see them back. I am looking forward to re-watch the other 4 movies."

And if you say both positive and negative things I think they will first fight over you: who can kill you? Twilight is a teen movie that is way to depressing for a teen, but too over dramatic for an adult. Also, all the characters are just very awkward.

I had never been so starstruck in my life. I was completely in love. The summer i turned 11 i had read the entire book series. All the 2500 pages. And I had a want for more. I was completely and inevitably inlove with Edward, Bella and the storyline. (Jacob does not count as a storyline or a mere character in this setting.) When I for the first time got a hold of one of the movies. It was the last one.. I watched it over and over and over on Dvd. Until it almost broke.. I was very much in love. Then when i got the entire dvd collection. I took it with me everywhere, I watched all of the movies at least 4 times a week. Edward was my biggest childhood crush, and he still is. (Also a reason why i'm such a big fangirl of Robert Pattinson..) The twilight movie franchise was something me and my sister bonded strongly over, me and my friends watched together over and over, and something my mother had to endure.. I am quite harsher of a critique now than i was before, but this movie will always be a 10 for me. Edward, Bella. They will always be a 10 for me. Even though the movie in itself may not a 10, it is for me in sentimental terms. This movie, or THESE movies will always be my comfort. That is why i've rated this movie. A 10. I'm sorry."

In the book, the character Bella is pathetic & suicidal, and Edward's obsessive and controlling. While you can ignore those traits in the book, seeing them come to life on screen is scary. I don't think that the author realizes that Bella is in an abusive relationship and neither does the majority of her teen fan base.\n\nIt looks like the director had mental images of the scenes she wanted to capture when she read the script, but didn't think through how the scenes would make sense within the film. The soundtrack doesn't fit either. The special effects consisted of sparkle powder, white powder and maybe some wire up in the trees tops to capture the flying/running scenes. The casting isn't great either. The guy that plays the dad is miscast, and so is Jacob. The other characters simply can't act, or weren't allowed to by the director or author.\n\nWatch this movie is you want a good laugh and have $10 to waste."

I am total sap for a romantic star-crossed lovers story line and is element is the heart of the films. There is all kinds of delicious Gothic and romantic melodrama. I've never really been a huge fan of vampires in the horror genre but it's done extremely well in this series of films.

        "review_detailed_main": "The plot of the first film is really simple focuses on the development of a personal relationship between a girl named Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a separate group of hostile vampires.\n\nThis film was in development for approximately three years at Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written, but Summit Entertainment bought the film rights in 2007, and all of the other TWILIGHT books were sold to Summit Entertainment.\n\nOriginally scheduled for release in December 2008, the film was moved to a worldwide release of November 21, 2008, after the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moved from a November 2008 release to being released in July of 2009.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke directed this film, Carter Burwell did a really good job with the musical score, and the movie's soundtrack is phenomenal with amazing songs like, \"Let Me Sign\" and \"Bella's Lullaby\", both performed by Robert Pattinson, \"Decode\" , performed by Paramore and \"Leave Out All The Rest\", performed by Linkin Park. Melissa Rosenberg, wrote the heck out of a script based on the first book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer.\n\nKristen Stewart is great as the lead character, Bella Swan. She is attractive and really cool, but also really great as well. Robert Pattinson is great as Edward Cullen, but this was not the first film he was in, I actually saw him as Cedric Diggory in both the fourth and fifth films in the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and he really gave a great performance in this film.\n\nThe two main actors were so great that they won an MTV Movie Award in 2009 for Best Kiss Scene in this film and they also shared a kiss at the award. This also won an MTV Movie Award in 2009, for Best Fight for Robert Pattinson vs. Cam Gigandet as James, Best Female Performance for Kristen Stewart, Best Male Performance for Robert Pattinson and Best Movie.\n\nTaylor Lautner, who was in both Cheaper by the Dozen films, and played the character Sharkboy in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, which came out in 2005, played Jacob Black, really freaking amazing. Billy Burke is also really good as Charlie Swan.\n\nAnna Kendrick is hot and sweet as Jessica Stanley in this film and something told me that she was gonna be in more movies and in 2012, I saw her as Beca in the film Pitch Perfect and she will be playing the role again in the upcoming May 15th, 2015 sequel to the first film, Pitch Perfect 2. Kendrick can also sing because I heard her sing in the film and she is really good.\n\nCam Gigandet, Rachel Levefre and Edi Gathegi plays the evil vampire clan. The rest of the cast is very awesome, but also really good. So, overall, i love the first TWILIGHT film. It's smart, fun and a good way to spend 2 hours.\n\nOut of all of the TWILIGHT films, this one, the third film, ECLIPSE, the final two films, BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE and BREAKING DAWN - PART TWO are the best ones so far, but the worst one is NEW MOON, which I will get to. Acting is not bad, music and story, and visual effects is not bad at all. I give it a 6 out of 10."

They made it \"funny\". Oh I just get so mad thinking about this movie. Wouldn't have hurt to try to actually follow the book since you used the name and such.\n\nJust one opinion of a huge Twilight BOOK fan!\n\nHope ya'll liked it."

Those who haven't read the book might get confused, or in the case of my friend, annoyed at the inconsistencies. Some of those inconsistencies wouldn't be a problem if she had read the book. A person shouldn't have to read the book a movie was based on in order to be entertained, or to know what on earth was going on. Those who have read the book will most likely be disappointed, unless you're a tween girl fascinated by Rob Pattinson. No offense tweenies, I was there at one time, too, and I do remember . . .\n\nI've read all four books and took a friend who hasn't read them. I was bored and I knew the story! You can only imagine how painful it was for my friend to sit through the picture. I had hopes (not high ones) that the picture would take care of the things in the books that I found so unessential and annoying to read (disclaimer - I'm not her target audience in fiction, so not surprising I had difficulty with areas of the books). Stephanie Meyers created an intriguing and wonderful fantasy world, and though her characters aren't deep and rich, they're still engaging. The script for this picture failed to capture what's interesting about Edward and Bella's relationship as well as the fantastical world in which they dwell. The dialogue completely fails. It's choppy and unnatural, except for three or four lines scattered throughout.\n\nIt's a shame director Hardwicke chose to hang onto large panning shots -by the 20th one, we didn't care! Good film storytelling would have established the world and hinted at the conflict in the first 30 minutes, then hit the ground running with the baseball scene (where in the book, everyone's roles are firmly established and the conflict begins full throttle). Instead, my friend and I had to sit through an hour and forty minutes of melodramatic dreft before the conflict truly began and by then, we didn't care - though by then I was thankful that I had read the book. My friend was ready to leave - but she toughed it out.\n\nThe actors all did fine work, more so since they didn't have good material with which to work. They definitely earned their pay, as well as the adoration that's being sent their way (more than likely though, the adoration is not for their fine acting talents).\n\nFinally, a note to the writer and director - if you have to resort to voice over, neither one of you has done your storytelling jobs."

This actually makes the story even more special, offering the comforting notion that everyone can be seen as extraordinary in someone else's eyes.\n\nThe idea of a love you can't live without truly feeds my soul. It's the perfect dive into a fictitious reality, where romance reigns supreme. The details match the book remarkably, capturing the essence of the story that fans adore. The soundtrack is captivating, adding an emotional depth that elevates the entire experience. There are moments that are undeniably clich\u00e9, and that only adds to the charm.

        "review_detailed_main": "The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clich\u00e9d and traditional\u0097two things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.\n\nFrom the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.\n\nThe acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasm\u0097while staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines (\"I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!\"), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy?\n\nSo, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a \"emotional love story\". I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the \"dark\" crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.\n\nOther dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The \"Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!\" scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire myths\n\nI almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.\n\nI also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim. I just wish one day popular fiction wasn't a synonym for retard fiction.\n\n0/10"

Yes, the book is far better. Edward and Bella's relationship is better in the novel. Kristen Stewart was perfectly cast, but Robert Pattinson - whilst very good - played Edward very stoically. Book Edward actually has some spark and humour about him, which is what attracts her to him in the first place. Also, the book's gorgeous meadows scene - where Edward is boyishly proud of himself for being able to (just) resist Bella - is all but removed from this film! (Not to worry filmmakers; it's only the book's most iconic scene.)\n\nMike was also a bit miscast; I imagined him less macho and a bit shyer when I read the books. But some parts were glorious: Carlisle was perfect. Kristen Stewart, as I said, was amazing. And what the hell - if you liked the books, this is definitely worth a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a fan of the twilight books, I was very disappointed when I saw it last night.\n\nThe acting was horrible to say the least. Kristen Stewart is usually great in her roles, but in this she seemed like she wasn't even trying. The character of Bella bored me to death in this film. Robert Pattinson was probably the worst actor in this film. Robert poorly represented the Edward that millions of people became infatuated with. His acting was stale, but that may be do to his inexperience in front of the camera. In the book, Edward was extremely romantic and to millions of people he was the perfect guy. However, in this film there was really nothing about Edward that made him stick out from the rest of the guys at his high school (besides him being a vampire). The scene were Bella in Edward meet in class was laughable and their relationship seemed very forced.\n\nThe Edward/Bella relationship was horribly depicted in this film. I did not feel the connection between them was as strong as it was in the book. Their lust for each other came up fast and for someone who has only seen the movie would probably wonder why they even like each other. I personally feel that the director should have spent more time developing their relationship because when/if they make the second installment, I am going to have a hard time grasping why Bella is so depressed about Edward leaving her.\n\nI would have to say that the biggest flaws in this film was the casting and how choppy the scenes felt. This movie didn't exactly flow and the best word I can use to describe it is.... choppy. Twilight would jump from one scene to another in a way that really distracted me from enjoying the movie (especially in the beginning of the film).\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed in a film I've waited so long to see. I hope that the next installment of the Twilight series has a new screenwriter and a director that takes their time to make a great film. The cast will not change but hopefully for the second film they will get better.\n\nRating: 1.5/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was one of the many who went to see Twilight at midnight. What a huge disappointment. After the movie ended I wanted my money back and the two hours of sleep I missed. The movie was disjointed to say the least. It was evident that they did not have a large budget and that good actors were hard to find. If you never read the series and saw the movie you would walk out of the theater confused and asking \"why the hype\". If you did read the series, you walked out disappointed and asking \"what was that?!\" Is that it? Is that what I was waiting months to see! Here's the deal. The beginning of the movie was seriously rushed. They took different parts from the Twilight book and created scenes\u0085 not a movie. It didn't matter where those scenes where in the film as long as it got in. The order of the events as they took place in the book obviously wasn't important to the director. It's like they wanted to cram everything from the book into the movie but didn't care about the films flow from one scene to the next. In truth, there were many scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. These scenes were just made up and didn't add anything to the story line; not that there was an actual story line. What a mess! This film looks like it was created by a first year student film maker. The acting in this movie was awful. It was more like watching a high school play rather than a motion picture film. I really expected better acting skills from both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Actually Robert Pattinson wasn't that bad, but the movie was so bad it transferred to him. Their performance was mediocre at best in some scenes and in others it was down right bad. As for their co-stars, I pray they have other aspiration outside of the world of acting. The background music in this movie sounded like the music you hear on your favorite afternoon soap opera. Listen, I love the Twilight books. True, they are not great literary works, C+ at best, but what made the books so popular was the story itself. It brought you back to a time when you got your first kiss, the first time you fell in love and the feeling that you couldn't breath or your day couldn't start until you saw that one person; the love of your life. The Twilight movie totally failed to capture the essence of the book; the reason fans love the series. It failed to do what the book did, get the audience to relive the feeling of falling in love for the 1st time. If it wasn't for Robert Pattinson's good looks the film would have been unbearable. They need not make another \"film\". And for those who think Twilight is the new Harry Potter. Please! The Twilight movie has nothing on Harry Potter films. Harry Potter films have good writers, a great director, action and a fluid flow of events and coherency. Twilight was lacking in all areas. I plan on rereading the book so I can block out what I saw the movie. The directors and writers ruined this movie and Stephenie Meyer gave this junk her seal of approval. She needs to complete and published Midnight Sun to make for this horrible film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though it was originally widely criticized and mocked for its strong blue filter, awkward portrayals of the primary teenage characters, and goofy low-budget special effects, Twilight (and its predecessors) lives in the collective consciousness all these years later as an iconic franchise brimming with nostalgia.\n\nWith a relatively small budget, Twilight was somewhat limited in how technically impressive it could be in the special effects department but the way production members worked around it ended up working out just fine. For small moments where the vampires' super speed isn't integral to the story, there's a cheap edit where those individual characters' walking gets sped up and, despite it looking strange, it doesn't really become distracting or impact audience enjoyment. In turn, dramatic fight scenes near the end crucial to the plot are given much more time and stunt work, bolstering the film in the most essential places without getting caught up on every single detail getting there.\n\nI don't find any of the acting performances to be particularly excellent, but I also don't find them necessarily overdramatic within the supernatural world of the story. Because the film is filled with various types of shots/camera angles far from the cookie-cutter formula and it's rife with dreamy sequences and perfectly paced editing, the focus of the movie often becomes the aesthetic and feeling.\n\nInterspersed with the desperate angst of teenage love, there are moments of youthful joy and playfulness from both the essential group of main characters (Edward, Bella, Jacob, and Charlie) and from the side characters (Jessica, Mike, Angela and Eric). In someone else's hands, the film adaptation could have very easily left out a lot of the interactions between Bella's friends that ground her in the human world.\n\nAs time passes, I'm more grateful with every rewatch that Catherine Hardwicke included the side characters in so many scenes- even if it's only for a few lines at a time- because her regular participation in normal life sets up the stark difference between what her life is and is fated to be (so far) compared to what she guesses Edward's to be like. Having him (and/or the other vampires) present in so many scenes throughout the entire first movie would've lessened the novelty of their supernatural abilities and the mysterious guise that fascinates Bella and it would have shot the future movies in the foot in trying to open those non-existent relationships up for the first time when the romantic plot at the forefront becomes heavier.\n\nOne of my other absolute favorite things about this movie, and I would say even more so than any of the subsequent films, is the soundtrack selection. Oftentimes, teenage romances are scored with catchy and relevant pop music- and I don't necessarily think that would have been terrible in this film- but the indie music that was chosen feels specific to this film and its visuals. Not to mention that it offers a more timeless quality as well, a keen choice for a film where many of the characters have been alive for centuries.\n\nAlso lending to Twilight's perpetual relevance is how carefully era-specific references were avoided. There's no mention of pop culture figures, flashy cell phone models, reading the characters' text messages or emails over their shoulder, or notable fashion microtrends in the costuming- all details that freeze in time and prevent it from feeling old and outdated by smudging the plausible timeframe of the story over a couple decades."

The main acting she does in this movie involves shrugging, staring awkwardly, and blinking; yes, blinking. She... just...never...stops!\n\nRobert Pattinson (Edward) is almost just as bad. Even though his character is already whiny and melodramatic, he only makes it worse.\n\nIt's not just those two-almost all of the main acting is horrible! The terrible acting really reflects the bad direction, the special effects and stunts are shoddy, and the dialogue-oh, the dialogue! It will only make you laugh, like in one scene where Edward is about to climb a tree with Bella on his back, and says to her \"you better hang on spider monkey\".\n\nTry watching this movie for twenty minutes without getting annoyed-just try. There are just so many parts that make you want to cringe and look away, waiting for it to be over. Bottom line: Twilight is an unintentionally funny bad attempt of a movie with an otherwise interesting premise.\n\nRating: 2.0/10"

Still feel the same - not horrible, not the greatest but still held my attention enough to watch all 5 of them this time. I wasn't impressed with the storyline of Breaking Dawn part 1 (4th movie) at all as it lacked any amount of excitement. I had to look up a few things on google that were happening bc I didn't read the books and either I missed its explanation in the movies or they didn't cover why it was happening/what it meant. I can see how this would appeal to the young crowd, at least back when they were originally released. There are many movies I watched when younger that I can't even sit through now even to feel nostalgia, so that's why I decided to give this a 7 rating."

I just thought it was a bad movie. Nothing really happens in it.\n\nThe fact that the vampires sparkle in the sun rather than spontaneously combust in descent vampire movies like blade or 30 days of night is a joke. The effects when the vampires move fast are terrible, smallville has better effects and its a TV series. I will not be seeing anymore of the series. Also they have rushed the release of New Moon within a year of twilights release in an attempt to milk it for all its worth and so i think it will be equally bad. The werewolf looks awful from the trailer. The vampire genre has suffered a bad blow."

The only good part was sitting next to my girlfriend, holding her hand and sharing popcorn. The movie was good, but you can't call it \"AWESOME\" like some people have...even if you are a Twilight fan. Hell, ESPECIALLY if you're a Twilight fan. A real fan would probably have flipped at that movie. Yeah, it was exciting getting to finally put faces with characters and things like that, but the movie itself just didn't hit right. Edward was way to...forced, I guess. The dude tried way too hard. Edward is suppose to be charismatic not weird. The \"Hold on spider monkey\" comment by Edward was also really uncalled for and had the extra crap like that been left out the movie would have been much better. There were just too many key scenes left out, and I think it may be difficult to transition into New Moon without dropping out even more of what made the novels enjoyable. All in all it was maybe a 6 out of 10. Hopefully New Moon will be better."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, the good news: Scene location and set dressing was very good. Assistant Directing, as seen by the fact that the extras and bit players did an excellent job and the job of managing them is usually given to an AD, was excellent. Wardrobe was good as well. The make up was second rate but okay. Continuity was fair to good. The set designer did an excellent job.\n\nBad News: The musical score was horrid and poorly edited. The music suggested to me a cell phone conversation going on behind me for how it distracted. The screen play was rushed and out of cadence. It suggested that the screenplay was written by a pack of rushed and angry Girl Scouts, some of whom read the book. The entire movie had the feel of a poorly written Cliff Notes read at a slumber party. For instance, who chose that mid sized town? That was a BIG mistake. If you are going to alter the book, do so in a manner that compliments the visual medium of a 'film'.\n\nThe main actors had the potential to do well but, in my opinion, their miscues and poor cadence was a directing error and did the main actors no justice. Whomever coached or directed the extras and bit players should have directed the rest of the movie.\n\nAll in all, I was vastly disappointed with the film. Some might say, okay, tell us what you would have done! Okay, first, the washed out, falsely 'indie' nature of the initial scene in Phoenix could have lead to the slowly resolving clear, crisp greens of Forks (ala Wizard of Oz when Dorothy steps out of her house in Oz)as she falls in love. Hell, give me a reason she fell in love (missing from the visual media). The wings behind the vampire (white owl wings) suggested a movie filled with interesting metaphorical scenes (ala an old fashioned 'European' film) but that hope faded as well. Oh, and did I say the sound track was horrid? An after school club full of Junior High students with MP3 players and access to third rate instrument packages found in the toy section of Wal Mart could have done better. The only passable music came at the end.\n\nThe movie sucked all the life out of the book and left a dry husk to stumble about in front of a camera whose motions were directed by a disinterested person named 'director' for some reason. In that regard, the movie was pornography with the actors wearing clothing and the sex scenes as washed out and empty caricatures of the emotions barely perceived in the background.\n\nI welcome rebuttal."

His characterization, however, was intriguing.\n\nStewart sulks a great deal. The best scenes were with her father. But, the sparks between Bella and Edward never seem to catch on fire.\n\nPart of the blame seems to point to the film's lack of development. Relationships are or should be an integral part of the film, but there seems to be no attempt at getting to know what motivates and stimulates the characters.\n\nThe film lacks emotion and poignancy, moves too fast, and gets stuck on a subplot--which, in my opinion, could have been deleted from the start or edited out after viewing the rushes (if scenes mid-way into the film ended up on the cutting room floor, they never would have been missed).\n\nSpecial effects were poor, but were obviously added to compensate for the poorly-developed script. Hardwicke came through with the teen, but was absent in some very-important scenes, but this may be a problem with the direction rather than the acting.\n\n\"Twilight\" misses out on effectively probing the things that each of the characters wanted, but could not get. The film is a metaphor for sex, but fails to tell a compelling story to hold one's interest. Because the focus is blurred, there is little or no clarity. And, the film is not well grounded.\n\nI rank the film a 6 out of 10--but, if the film was better developed, it would hold more promise. As is, the chemistry does not really work. \"Twilight\" ends up leaving its audience completely in the dark."

I guess that's the theme of the series, since it's based around vampires... which is a stupid idea if you think about it, but it makes me so suicidal that I bring five packs of razorblades every time I see the stupid thing.

        "review_detailed_main": "The poor quality of this movie really sets a low bar for the film industry as a whole. Unfortunately, thanks to a severe addiction to novels, I had the (dis)pleasure of reading Twilight several months before the film came out, and basically took the book for what it was - a semi-erotic vampire story in which Stephanie Meyer took her own \"romantic\" (I use the word loosely) ideal and put it into words. To further clarify, as if it weren't clear enough from the author herself, the book is her own version of erotic fan-fiction. The plot itself is laughably simple and the romance is creepy, and seems to enjoy creating a vampire lore that makes them look about as fearsome as rabbits.\n\nNevertheless, I decided to give the film a chance. After all, I've seen mediocre books turned into good films - Prince Caspian being my notable favorite. Within ten minutes of the film, I was bored and on the verge of leaving the theater. I decided to get my money's worth and sit it out, which was an unpleasant experience thanks to the fact that I and my brother were surrounded by middle school girls - and I think my brother fell asleep. It was probably the fact that the sun, a vampire's *main* weakness, made Edward's skin \"shimmer and glitter\" and the fact that he had no fangs or attributes of a vampire. It probably didn't even help that the basis behind Edward's attraction to Bella was flimsy to the point of being laughable.\n\nThere's so, so many things wrong with this film that even the novel isn't responsible for. The acting is on a level of horrid that I would expect from far less seasoned actors. Pattinson is a pretty above-average actor, and coming into the film industry as a teen heartthrob, it's probably enough for him to be on screen and for girls to ogle at his face, but for most other people his acting was stilted and his lines delivered with the fakery that only someone relying too much on his looks could possibly pull off. There is a reason why less handsome or beautiful actors are usually better at what they do, and it's because they have to make up for their visual deficiencies. He obviously didn't break the pattern. The actress, Kristin Stewart, was slightly better, but it was offset by the fact that she overacted her way and blundered through the film.\n\nThe werewolf's role was boring, forgettable, and probably not even worth noticing, as were most of the peripheral characters, like the other vampire gang and the vampire in that gang who Edward battles, whose name I can't be bothered to remember. This film wasn't just a waste of my time, it was a waste of money and I *beg* people not to watch this travesty."

I would first like to start by saying that the books are good, for what they are that is. Stephenie Meyer is an awful writer! And really needs to give the thesaurus a break. Anyway. This movie was the biggest disappointment since Lemony Snicket's \"A series of Unfortunate events\" hit the big screen. I admire Chatherine Hardwicke's directing technique, but not in this film. She took a descent novel and turned it into an atrocious film.\n\nTwilight lacks enthusiasm, chemistry and excitement. I was ready to sleep watching it the first time. However, i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried again, to no success. The cinematography is appalling as is the acting skills of Robert and Kristen. I must say that I am a fan of Rob and Kristen and they really should have thought twice before signing on to this garbage. Kristen does not suit the character of Bella at all, regardless of the fact that she resembles the character physically. How many girls don't? brown eyes, brown hair, pale skin are not too hard to come by. She just does not have the spunk Bella needed and her monotone acting frustrated me to no end. Robert was also failed by the crappy script. Not only is he forced into a monotone-like state, but he also lakes the magnetic pull of Edward. Twilight isn't a hard novel to adapt, add two spunky actors, a lot of chemistry and a good director and you're on your way. But sadly this lacked all of the stated. The \"chemistry\" between rob and Kristen is the biggest laugh of all. They look so incredibly awkward that it makes me wonder what they really think of each other. Perhaps Kristen was to scared to really sink her teeth into Rob because of her long-term bf. Who knows! but one things for sure, both must'v failed chemistry in high school. No disrespect to them as actors of course. And Finally, I must say, that there was no suspense, as there is in the novel. No sexual tension or anything! No build up to the big revelation. The film stayed on a straight run the whole way through. It was the dullest load of **** I've ever seen. I just hope the next director does a better job, good news though, is can't get any worse than this!\n\nSo, save yourself the trouble (and money) and ignore this \"phenomenon\", because this movie is definitely a waste of life. Go see Changeling instead- that movie has quality! :)"

From Kristen Stewart constantly looking like she's about to vomit and Robert Pattinson's cringey mannerisms and one-liners, to the embarrassing romance, action sequences and special effects, this movie is just so so bad... but that's actually the only reason I even watched the franchise.\n\nIt's hilarious how ridiculous and un-self-aware The Twilight Saga actually is. I can't help but wonder how both the people responsible and the Twi-Hards could actually take it seriously, and that's why I love it.\n\nBut I must admit, I just love the atmosphere of this movie, and the awesome soundtrack helps as well. Certain actors do a serviceable job and overall this one is probably the best movie in the saga."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am normally a person to read the book that a movie is based off of before actually seeing the movie. That being said, I had no intention of reading or seeing Twilight. My friend asked me to simply read the book, which she claimed was much better than the movie, and go from there. I took her up on her offer and began reading the first book in the Twilight saga. After six chapters and pulling much of my hair out, I gave the book back to my friend and told her how agonizing it had been to read even those six chapters. She asked me to see the movie, thinking that I may like it more than the book.\n\nWell, I did see the movie, and spent the entirety of it with my mouth gaping at the awful cinematics, the horrible acting, and the terrible plot.\n\nNow, I understand that the movie, being based on the book, had no real plot to begin with and, therefore, could not help the story itself. however, there is no excuse for the poor choice of actors, the overly dramatized portrayal of the infatuation of a teenage girl, and horrible scenes. Even if the director had no plot to work with, he could have at least tried to make the scenes look good, much less chosen qualified actors for the dramatic characters of the story.\n\nIn my opinion, there is no excuse for this film to have been as bad as it truly is. I have no respect for the author of the book nor the director, actors, makeup artists, of special effects teams of Twilight."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, this film looks amazing. The director of photography had done an incredible job, even if the CGI is a tad to obvious in places. Just to get that out th way; now onto the bad stuff.\n\nFor all of its failings, the Twilight series has a simple message of comfort for coming of age girls about the perils of relationships and the pain inherent with the joy of first love. All fair and good one might say, however the toned down films offer a far more damaging life lesion of how teenagers should approach their blooming sexuality, portraying a safe, rose-tinted depiction when in reality relationships are hard and rough with problems other than how to deal with overwhelming affection when separated (as is the case of the second instalment New Moon). Not that relationships are bad and destined for failure, don't get me wrong, but the relationship between Bella and Edward is playing the fairytale card too strictly to the letter when it should really be guiding its impressionable young audience with something more tangible to what they will actually face. In reality, teenage boys are commonly ravenous and rather selfish beings out for themselves and all the sex they can get, making the vampire a highly symbolic medium, so a girl in love with a vampire is a great way to portray the terror that is the adolescent male and his undying lust for\u0085well lust draining her of self-worth as she continuously pours her unrelenting love into him. Yet in Twilight Edward is patient an almost comically nonsexual, his emotions suppressed, happy to simply stare into Bella's eyes or sneak a rare passionate kiss. Now we have a woman whose urging desire to be bitten (representative of sexual congress) needs to be slapped down by Edward, who fears her becoming like him. Now from a certain feminist perspective can understand why this film is considered as a positive influence for young women; here we have an independent female protagonist who knows what she wants and refuses to back down, but when her goal is ultimately to be subject to her man the argument looses its momentum, even becoming somewhat hypocritical.\n\nGoing back to my earlier statement, monsters are steeped in symbolism \u2013 each and everyone reflecting a very real human fear, trait or outlook. As the lead male, Edward is representative of the vampires we see throughout the movie, with those acting like the classical parasitic vampires coming off as heinously villainous in contrast for simply doing what they have to. What I am getting at here is that Edward's vampirism is wasted potential if he refuses to ever act in any way like a vampire. I realise the point is he believes he is evil incarnate and so must fight to suppress his nature, but in the context here it just plain fail if Bella is more blood hungry (well, she's certainly hungry for something of Edwards) than he is. Surely Bella is a negative influence on Edward for trying to make him abandon everything he's been working so hard to achieve just so she satisfy her needs. In this light, Bella is really the more monstrous of the two.\n\nMy biggest problem with these films and books is that they play the teen monster card to safe and child-friendly \u2013 like if Disney were given the reigns to remake the Hammer Horror catalogue. Puberty and monsters is a dream combination, as it's a time of great uncertainly, self-awareness, new sensations and rapidly changing body and emotions to contend with; it's a goldmine of potential that only films such as Ginger Snaps and the more recent Let The Right One In have utilised in the last decade \u2013 and these were strictly speaking not American (Canadian and Sweden respectively) so were untainted by the overdone sentimentality of their Hollywood cousins. In Ginger Snaps the repressed sexuality of Ginger is unleashed after a werewolf attack that triggers her delayed puberty. The werewolf motif is initially unrecognised for it mirrors the traits of puberty; hair growing in new places; a changing body shape; uncontrollable lust (albeit for blood); and bouts of emotional instability. Even when a male character is infected by the lycthropancy virus after having unprotected sex the symptoms manifest like an STD rather than an urge to repent for his misdeeds. This is far more realistic a portrayal of the teenage years and sexual awakening than Twilight is willing to employ, and I find it disheartening to discover that a fluffy piece about unconditional love over between to emotionally dead and rather vacant people is a global success while the superior mediums are regarded as cult or niche. I understand that in a time of fearful and unwanted change its comforting to have films like Twilight there to hold your hand and give you head a reassuring pat, but kids need to learn that hardships coming or it will be all the harder to deal with the difficulties of boys, sexual peer pressure and the nightmare that is puberty. To this end, a film about the suppression of desire in the face of first true love is more harmful than one in which people are maimed, eaten and savaged \u2013 at least they know how to vent their frustrations and desires rather then bottling them up for the inevitable post office massacre in 30 years time."

Compareing it to the book is unfair and to go in thinking you are going to see word for word scene for scene of the book exactly how you imagined it in your mind is really stupid in my opinion. Just go in with the mind set that you are just going to see a movie that looked good in the trailers and you should be good. don't compare. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have extremely intense chemistry together and even if you are not Team Edward you can't help but root for them.Each other character although they had small parts were all very good as well and the movie has a sense of humor about it that i really enjoyed. All in all i give it a 9 out of 10."

The plot is obvious and bad and it betrays every legend that exists of vampires.\n\nSeeing this film being as successful as it has in the box-office truly does make on think what has happened to the world. How one can write such a simple peace of teenage-girl catering drivel; find a designer to direct it, muster a few million dollars and cast a few unknown young pretty people to star in it. The \"film\"; a term it is hardly deserving of is as transparent as a republican promise and it makes for a roller coaster of disappointment and is truly difficult to bear even seeing once.\n\nOn a separate note,the later installations of this franchise are the worst of cash cows in the world and elaborate on the traits the first \"film\" exhibits. That is to say; they are even worse.\n\nAll in all; it's a disgrace to the business and an affront to the world of film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now the phrase 'dragged to the cinema' is commonly used by people who end up watching a film on the silver screen that they feel embarrassed about having watched. These movie goers know that they have witnessed a truly horrible film and want to forewarn the entire world not to see it, while somehow still maintaining their dignity in having actually watched it in the first place.\n\nNow I'm not going to lie, I have never so much as thought about the Twilight saga, read any of the books or anticipated any of the film releases, but I do recall going out on a date with a girl whom I had a certain penchant for, and in willing to please her we went out, got something to eat and had a nice time. And then she suggested we watch a film in the adjacent cinema.\n\nNow at this point, alarm bells rang. I knew she was crazy about Twilight. I mean, she had already watched the film TWO times in the cinema and it had only been out for a week. But, as is my chivalrous and relaxed nature, I went along with it, telling her that she could choose the film as there was not much out at the time. But in the back of my head I knew what I was getting myself into.\n\nI mean, where to start? How about with analysis of the word 'saga', which comes from early Scadinavian and Germanic settlers and means 'epic or legendary tales'. How this term can be so much as coined to describe this plight, nay, disease that is the scourge of the earth at the moment is beyond belief.\n\nThere was nothing that I saw in that film that even made me want to think about watching or reading anything related to the name 'Stephanie Meyer' again. She has been blacklisted from my subconscious, and this travesty of a 'saga' is dead to me now, despite having only scraped the surface of this\n\nNow, I have watched films such as 'Trolls 2' that has been given a rating of 2, and Twilight does not hold a candle to that film. Literally. I would honestly choose that film over this 100 times out of 100. I would in no way describe myself as a film snob, though I would never go out of my way to watch a film that has been ill recommended to me by like minded movie goers, but Twilight is the anomaly. The film that proves that sometimes the most shameful target audiences can prove the most effective - the teen/tween female population who have watched too many sappy animations (I love Pixar releases so this isn't a jab at Disney as a concept) to believe that this storyline could happen to them if they squint hard enough and imagine.\n\nWhen it actually comes down to me describing the film, the inclusion of Muse gained it one star, whose publicists must be lapping up the adulation at the moment, though whom may be regretting it as soon as the band release a song about vampires and werewolves. The storyline isn't even a bad one, and I could imagine the books to be at least somewhat readable in a very acute (LSD?) state of mind, but the film screams money. Simple as that. And as I count, I believe we are on the 3rd or 4th one now within the space of 2 years, and my hypothesis then rings true now.\n\nThe acting was wooden, the 'romance' was transparent, the fight scenes were laughable and yet this girl (both the one sitting next to me and the big manly one on the screen) was lapping it up! Swooning when Edward 'sparkles' (how a girl could find sparkling an attractive quality in a man is beyond me) and crying at the end when they declare undying love for each other, that was read straight off of a cue card.\n\nSuffice to say I haven't spoken to her since."

There is no chemistry between the two of them. The movie is also filmed as though it's in slow motion. Stay away from Twilight"

Edward didn't appear to have any depth. The movie took the exciting parts of the book and smashed them together without any character development. If I hadn't read the books, a number of things would not have made sense as there was no attempt to set them up or connect them. In my party there was a 12 year old girl and even she was not impressed. For anyone thinking about going to this movie, I recommend that you save your money. I would go to the next outing with the Twilight Saga, but only if it had a different director, editor and cast; otherwise it would be a waste of time and money"

Luckily, I didn't because by the end of the movie, you would have thought I was Twilight's biggest fan.\n\nFirst of all, I thought Robert Pattinson did a commendable job as Edward Cullen. I started reading the book today and as I read Stephanie Beyer's words that introduced his character to the story, I realized this. Sure the real Robert is a bit scruffy in real life, but he groomed up nicely for this role! He had the certain eeriness and mystery of Edward and he SURE look GORGEOUSLY AMAZING! His eyes weren't \"dead\" to me---they enhanced that element of eeriness and mystery, if you ask me. And for the audience---gosh---it was like each and every person in the theater fell in love with him as his eyes glistened on the screen.\n\nI don't believe Kristen Stewart looked \"boring\" or \"unemotional\" in the movie. It was more like a certain vulnerability or naivet\u00e9 that she brought to her role, and I thought it worked well.\n\nThe two had amazing chemistry in my opinion.\n\nThe story moved a bit quickly, but that's about the only complaint I have. Oh yeah...and that Jacob guy...his teeth were SO unrealistically light I almost got blinded. He was also a nice addition to the cast.\n\nI also thought the lighting, which was dark and made everyday seem like there was thunderstorm outside was suitable for the theme of the film. I heard people complain about that.\n\nAnyway, that's what I felt about the film. It was well done and if you're not a Twilight fan...TRUST ME when I say you will be after the movie. I went in with an \"Ughh...a VAMPIRE movie...are you serious?\" attitude but was left with the greatest feeling of awe and amazement."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you can live forever, what do you live for? is one of the themes of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel with the cult-like female fan base, the latest of a string of much-awaited pop lit-based flicks to explode on screen.\n\nThe first of a series of four, Twilight is told from the point-of-view of high school transferee Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), an ordinary girl from Arizona, who risks everything when she falls for teen vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The reluctant beau realizes he has bitten off more than he could chew (pardon the pun) with his choice of girlfriend, when he has to forever fend off every mortal and monster out to get her.\n\nA modernized myth ensconced in a forbidden love story, director Catherine Hardwicke had a similarly against-all-odds task of pleasing audiences, most of which are hard-core fans of the book. Since much of Twilight's power is said to come from Bella's thoughts, this can of course only be visually executed in a limited fashion. The protagonists' feelings are also very reliant on the intense looks and expressions exchanged multiple times, and the actors successfully transmit their frustrations to the audience, despite the widely-held opinion of getting a cast that fit better. Can't please them all! And so, equally moody music like Debussy's Claire de Lune and other more modern angst-ridden faves \"15 Step\" by Radiohead and \"Supermassive Black Hole\" by Muse is interspersed throughout to sustain the teen drama, but could not distract the audience enough to feel the full (over two hours) length of this movie. Not only was it overlong, it was painfully cheesy at several points, but for female teens to fawn over Twilight would be understandable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considering all aspects of this film, it's fandom, and birth from a very long, tough to condense book, Catherine Hardewicke, Melissa Rosenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Robert Pattinson worked some serious movie magic. Fans of Stephenie Meyer's series will be, for the most part, thrilled with their interpretation of this vampire love story.\n\nScreenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, with the help of Stephenie Meyer, created what I believe is the best possible script, dialogue, and scenes. Condensing over 500 pages into two hours of screen time while still conveying the major issues that are so important to fans is no easy feat, and she succeeded admirably. I think that any flaws should actually be blamed on the fans themselves, and their insistence of certain key phrases, that, while perfectly played out in the imagination, would sound slightly corny even said by say, Streep and Day-Lewis.\n\nThat being said, the actors who portray the main characters, vampire with a heart Edward and every-girl Bella, are explosive. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart played the roles to perfection. Instead of falling into the expected lovey-dovey, stary-eyed version the characters seem to call for, they seem perfectly uncomfortable with the entire situation, and each other. Instead of being like two magnets who are drawn to each other, they are like polar opposites, pushing away from each other. This dynamic gives perfect credibility to their should-be unattainable love affair. After all, they should not feel comfortable with each other; Bella's life hangs in the balance every second she is with Edward. Edward's fear of hurting his ultimate love, and the self-loathing he has for himself are constants in the novel. They prevented this film from becoming a sappy, camp, teen love story, which would have probably appeased critics, and lost 98% of their fans.\n\nWhile critics will criticize everything from the lack of big-budget stunts to show off the remarkable skills of the vampires, the sometimes cheesy dialogue, and the staring actors for what they will undoubtedly title \"emo\" performances, fans will know better. They will see how the tempestuous emotion and drama of Edward and Bella are perfectly executed by Kristen and Rob, neither over- nor under-done; they will see the impression of vampiric feats that truly no studio could recreate, regardless of the budget. Most importantly, they will see the distilled, concentrated version of the story they love so much, brought to life by an amazing cast and crew.\n\nBottom line-if you're a fan, enjoy the movie in and of itself, and leave your book comparisons at the theater door. If you're a critic, well...don't be surprised if people ignore your probably plausible jabs at the film's imperfections. The magic of movies is that they affect each person differently, and each person impresses their own vision onto the film. Hardewick and Co. have given us just the right amount of our vision and theirs, turning out a film destined to be talked about by both critics and fans alike for years."

Anyhow, having lived in Seattle for nearly 9 years probably swayed me just a bit. I can't say there is tremendous acting, but there is enough here and there that you start to form a \"relationship\" with the characters. I am probably an oddball, but I like Kristen Stewart, and have watched her in several films. I kind of wish they had cast her in Hunger Games, but that's just me. I have watched all 5 Twilight's now probably close to 100 times, and each time I try to find something to hate about it so that I'll stop this infatuation, but I just cannot. Call me old-fashioned, but there is just something about a good love story that gets me every time, and for the story to include a gawky, awkward little girl falling in love with a suave and gorgeous vampire - well, you got me! You can have the werewolves, just don;t find Taylor Lautner all that hot."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hating on Twilight in book or movie form has lately become a way for pretentious self-appointed critics and lecherous \"players\" who hate Stephanie Meyer's views on sexuality to establish their \"street cred\" with their fellow losers on the internet. To be sure, I can see why guys would tend to keep their distance from this series; in book and movie form alike it's got \"chick flick\" written all over it. The focus is firmly fixed on Bella to the point of rudely shunting several potentially interesting subplots aside.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike a great many of my fellow males, I can also understand its appeal to the girls who are its target audience. To any of the aforementioned blowhards who profess not to understand its commercial success, I can only say: the continuing presence and profitability of the Lifetime Channel and its movies-of-the-week must also be quite the baffling mystery to you. Hey, Twilight is all about a shy girl who can do no wrong and doesn't realize how ravishingly attractive she really is being at the center of attention for every single guy in range, including sexually idealized vampires and werewolves. What part of that, pray tell, would not appeal to young girls in their more awkward years of adolescence?\n\nMy main complaint about this film is what a waste everyone involved seems to have made of their potential. It's overlong for an adaptation of what was a relatively short and easy read of a book, and a lot of what would have been worth keeping from the book (a brief recounting of the Cullen clan's history, a scene in which Edward demonstrates that yes, he can still eat human food though it no longer appeals to him, etc.) is cut in favor of lots and lots of awkward silences, awkward stares, and awkward conversations that come off looking and sounding like nothing more than padding. Yes, such awkwardness is actually pretty common to real life. No, we in the audience do not care to be bored with these long pauses. Come on, cast and crew, do we really have to spell this out for you? The story's supposed to be a massive overdose on romantic feminine fantasy with lots of sexy vampires and werewolves thrown in. What part of that description calls for mundane realism?\n\nSpeaking of awkward stares, the relationship between Bella and Edward in this movie seems to consist of almost nothing else. I can understand the \"show, don't tell\" principle behind some of this (though Bella's many voice-overs are, I might point out, a massive violation of that principle), but what's being shown isn't really what we're supposed to be seeing according to the book. What we should be seeing is Edward as a predator who's falling in love with his prey. Heck, that's simultaneously the Twilight series' greatest appeal to its target audience and most disturbing aspect to its critics: that a lot of girls are strangely turned on at the thought of being the subject of a troubled handsome guy's obsessive and nearly-uncontrollable desires, even if those desires come dangerously close to making him a creepy stalker.\n\nSo fine, Stephanie Meyer wants this story to be all dark and edgy by exploring a predator's appeal to his prey? Then let it be dark and edgy. Let us see Edward licking his chops with that creepy gaze that fairly shouts \"Why, Bella, you look good enough to eat!\" While we're at it, fans and critics alike have noted that the whole Twilight series is a big metaphor about sexual temptations and promoting chastity. Fine: that metaphor actually mixes pretty nicely with the whole \"A shy girl loves a stalker...\" theory to make it the somewhat more palatable \"...if he's polite about it and keeps his grubby paws to himself until she willingly gives herself over to him.\"\n\nAs long as we're being darker and edgier here, there's no need to apologize for those creepier implications: let the metaphor be writ large! Let Edward alternately stalk and try to restrain himself from stalking his prey, and let Bella mistake his hungry looks for the belligerent sexual tension it seems to be (and to which it does eventually convert). That's certainly better than what we actually saw up on the screen, which is Edward looking passive-aggressive and bipolar and not the least bit interested in Bella for either culinary or sexual purposes while she understandably keeps asking him what his problem is. Where's the chemistry?\n\nWhile we're at it, since the movie departed considerably from the book by cutting away from Bella to other characters once in a while, why not roll with this by showing a few more scenes from Edward's point of view? In the book, he tells Bella something along the lines of \"You don't think you're especially attractive? Yeah, well, that's because you don't have to hear all the other guys' thoughts the way I do.\" Letting us hear a sampling of those thoughts from his point of view would have gone a long way toward making this a better movie.\n\nHey, for all the narrowness of its appeal and the flack it gets, Twilight isn't really a bad flick. I've seen worse; in fact, I've seen a *lot* worse. What I'd really like to see, though, would be everyone trying a little harder. Were the cast and crew mostly just making this movie for the paycheck? Hey, that's all right: a lot of Hollywood's best movies were made by hardened mercenaries who'd rather have been doing something else. That's still no excuse for writers, editors, actors, and producers giving us a mediocre performance, though. It might not be quite Oscar-level material, but this story had the potential to be a very entertaining movie; how very disappointing to see so much potential frittered away."

        "review_detailed_main": "While the movie Twilight doesn't cover *all* the heart throbbing teenage angst and romance, they did do a great job of the material the makers chose to cover. I had to swallow my original comments about Pattinson as Edward, on the whole, he did a very convincing love struck vampire, and Kristin Stewart played admirably (although her emotional gamut never seemed to stray from either awkward confusion or awkward desire).\n\nThe filming was, again, for the most part, a breath of fresh air. The clunky transitions and hand-held shots did make the film feel slightly more \"indie\" than Hollywood. This is where my \"school project\" beef starts however, as it did begin to feel like young punks with a camera trying to strut their stuff. Some of the camera work seemed contrived and distracting. If it was a film school project we'd have to fail the special effects fellow, as Edward's vampire jumps came complete with motion trails and the none too subtle \"whoosh\" sound effect. Somehow, blazing along the forest trails with Bella on his back he could move fast enough to incur the \"whoosh\" sound byte without causing Bella's hair to move, or to provoke even the slightest reaction out of our sedate heroine. It was also jarring to see the \"immortal\" Edward clinging for dear life to the tree tops while supposedly showing of for the more serene Bella.\n\nThe greatest support to my film project accusation however is in the casting. It was as if they took a classroom of actors and assigned them all roles. \"OK, you are Bella, and you would make a great Edward... lets see where we can put the rest of you...\". Particularly the Cullen family - Dr. Cullen was not the charismatic vampiric patriarch from the books, and really - that hair dye and makeup... Esme looked one step from barefoot and pregnant with three little children clinging to her knees (why not an actress like Michelle Pfeifer?). Is Hollywood so short on gorgeous blonds that they had to take a \"cute\" brunette and give her a wig to represent the siren-like 'Rosalie'? The other actors were passable (exeption Gigandet for the villain James - sorry, you couldn't pass as a high school bully). But for me the real let down was Alice. Although Ashley Greene is a good looking girl, she brought nothing to the slight nymph-like character that was supposed to be Alice.\n\nOverall, the movie was quite good, but also a frustration. Why, with the mountain of support of millions of readers (and their millions of dollars) could they not have taken the movie a step further and come out with an unforgettable film, instead of the B+ film school product that they ended up with?"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Twilight\" is already the title of a 1998 thriller. I wonder if \"Crepuscule\" or something would work?\n\nWatchable piece of Gothic Urban Fantasy Romance with a great atmosphere in its foggy little one-horse town and a very likeable heroin. I'd marry Bella Swan...\n\nEverything is realized with skill and panache making it quite enchanting if you're willing to turn your brain off for a bit.\n\nMy big issue with this movie is the same one I had for My Neighbour Totoru: there isn't really enough conflict or stakes to constitute an actual plot until just before the final leg.\n\nLet me explain what I mean: I assumed that in this movie Bella would have a bad time for a bit and then find happiness in the attention from the handsome older supernatural man taking an interest in her even though the romance would be forbidden. Although Bella is understandably a little melancholic about her distance from her Mom and her new surroundings, she actually isn't bullied at all, she makes friends easily and there are two boys after her. And these boys are two DIFFERENT boys competing for her than the two who are in the sequel.\n\nHer Dad actually buys her a car. It's not an amazing car but it's something. Also, everyone on both families is just way too nice about the romance. Not one of the vampires even gives an impression of not trusting Bella. There are so many ways that conflict could be drummed up but aren't.\n\nThe last act is also rather tacked on. It feels like they realized that they had sort of run out of ideas (by which I mean, miss Meyers did) and conjured up some villains ex nihilo. A similar problem is also found in Totoru.\n\nBut to it's credit, Twilight's version of a tacked-on climax is used as an opportunity to explore its themes of temptation and immortality and it's only the first quarter of its story anyway. I know how weird this must sound but the Twilight Saga is a bit like The Ring of the Nibelungen in its structure: four parts, with the first really just to establish some themes, characters and relationships. So when people tell you the Twilight is one quarter of a movie, they're right. That's what it was meant to be.\n\nTwilight is an inevitably fascinating picture for the phenomenon it has been culturally. I sincerely believe this shift in how we want to see vampires tells us something about our culture and Meyer's own Mormon faith only adds to that. Edward is a vampire but he is one divorced from the religious subtext of Stoker or Polidori. He is not a demon, he is just a man (note how I didn't say \"person\") dealing with original sin and temptations he knows he might not be able to control so virtuously tries to resist until he cannot anymore. He is blessed and also burdened with an immortality of sorts and the power to bequeath it but is unwilling to do so too easily, much like the Mormon God. (seriously check out Mormon theology; it is not Christianity as you think you know it).\n\nThe element with the Native Americans too is interesting given the racial element of Mormon scripture, this tribe sort of serving as a stand in for black people.\n\nHaving read the book, I think it captures the tone of the book and gives it a professional polish as well as anyone could hope it would. Go in with an open mind and really suspend that disbelief and I think you'll find something quite passable."

I believe the sequel will be better. THe look of the characters seemed right for the roles. THe character of Bella was rather well played, and the character who played Edward wasn't bad, but still could've been better. I enjoyed the character that played Bella's father as well.\n\nLike I said, not that bad of a movie, but the story will likely be better in the sequel now that we got what I guess you would say was the origin story out of the way. By the way, I did not read the books."

The only positive thing I can say about Twilight is that it has damn good effects. The story is insulting ordinary, the acting the A-W-E-F-U-L to the max and the chemistry between the actors non-excisting.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt that young teenage girls will fall in love with the drop dead(!) gorgeous Robert Pattinsson, but I doubt that any other will find anything interesting about this all hyped up, ordinary and highly overrated film."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires \u2013 although quite a few have succeeded \u2013 but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.\n\nWhile I like vampire flicks, I don't really like films that play too much with accepted vampire lore. Twilight doesn't so much play with its conventions as totally re-invent them for its own somewhat cynical purposes. Twilight's vampires have no fear of daylight \u2013 they just turn a pretty silver colour when exposed to direct sunlight \u2013 which means they can interact with humans, go to school, hold down a job \u2013 as a doctor, no less; they have no fangs, no fear of water or holy symbols, and they don't feed on the blood of humans, choosing instead to chow down on wild animals. In fact, in many ways they're a typical all-American family: prick your thumb and suck the blood and you'd be as much of a vampire as these guys. (Perhaps I should amend that last sentence to typical dysfunctional All-American family).\n\nOf course, this makes the prospect of becoming a vampire a not unappealing one; after all, you get to live forever and, if like the lead vampire here, you get turned in your teens, you get to spend eternity appealing to pretty girls of a similar age. This being aimed at teens, there's a strong identification with the trials of an outsider. The young heroine is the new girl in town whose father is the local cop, and the vampires are outsiders because of who they are. All of which makes them appealing to teenagers who feel the world doesn't understand them and who are subsequently unsure of their place in it.\n\nTo be fair to the author, it's at least a fairly unique idea, and the Twilight books have clearly struck a chord with young teenagers. The film is reasonably well made, and while it won't make a particularly enjoyable experience for most adults, it at least doesn't cut corners in the belief that it doesn't have to try as hard simply because it's aimed at a less demanding than average target audience."

But anyhow, that's another story, this is about the movie isn't it? Well, well, well, to sum it all.. my user name is rather appropriate for this review considering I nearly DID have a nervous breakdown watching the film. The acting was dreadful, Isabella Swan AKA Bella was mono-toned throughout the entire film, and to top that off Edward looked seriously constipated. Throughout the film I thought it impossible to stare at each and everything as much as they did, but once again twilight proved me wrong, you CAN stare at things for an entire movie! Joy to the world.. not. The movie itself was a bore, little happened beside the staring of course. OH! And might I add the effects were dreadful, the crappy blowing of Bella's hair as she walked in, her eyes meeting the constipated vampires, instant love.\n\nHorrible, dreadful, boring. I would love to continue, but I wont, I'm getting bored just thinking about the bore that is Twilight."

I came, I saw, I sat to the end.\n\nSo yes I won, but at what cost?\n\nWell it's 90 mins I could have contributed something to society with that I'll never get back, however as Bella knows, we make our choices in life and that is that. Twilight is about as awkward and goofy a production as anything I've ever seen. Kristin Stewart, this gen's Jennifer Love Hewitt, loves shaking her head around before and after every line of dialog. I was shaking my head before and after every line of her dialog too. Robert Pattison I believe to have actual talent behind all that white powder on his face, but he phoned in his lines here. Or at least it was on purpose for us to believe he was faking it all along. I'm not sure how interesting it could be really. Twilight is essentially a story about a bad relationship.\n\nAh I'm giving it far to much credit already. in the end it's completely harmless. There's no mystery why the core story is so attractive for those seeking romantic escapism. You know, Twilight is so bad and so trashy you sort of feel sorry for it.\n\nThat's how bad relationships start."

        "review_detailed_main": "Be Warned: This is coming from a girl in her 20s who has never read the Twilight saga. But I do enjoy a good vampire film/series.\n\nAfter all the media surrounding Twilight I expected a decent film but I found Twilight to lack the luster and buzz of recent media. I love the concept behind the novel but the execution was horrendous. Emulating an episode of Passions, the film is filled with above-average looking actors and a poorly written script. Apparently the script was written in 6 weeks and it shows. As a vampire film, it was hard to concentrate on the fantasy aspect because the special effects were laughable. And when I say \"laughable\" I mean I actually laughed out loud a few times.\n\nThe film is over 2 hours long and 30 minutes in I was already checking my clock. The only thing keeping the audience (girls) in their seats was Edward, played by Robert Pattinson. I admit he is eye candy but I'd rather watch him as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter because at least that film is watchable. The actor's performances carry the film especially the actors playing the 2 leads. They do their best with the horrible script they're given. Also, I found the actress playing Alice to do a very nice job as well.\n\nThe story revolves around Bella and Edward's love story but one second their eyes meet and two seconds later she claims she loves him. The film doesn't develop their story so it's difficult to believe their love for one another. I'm sure the novel explains it in a more believable manner which is why this film may be geared more towards those loyal readers.\n\nIf you plan on watching the film, I recommend reading the novel first. That way you can visualize the story and ignore the poor script development and odd film choices. There's going to be a sequel so I hope they hire a new scriptwriter and director."

I saw it as one of my friend asked me to do so. I don't know if the book was better or not, but I swear, I did find the movie perfect. And by the way, how can you compare, from every point, a movie with a book?\n\nThe beginning was fantastic. The first half will completely get you on the character and plot. I never saw such a brilliant use of songs in a movie before. The track 'The full moon' by The Black Ghost, which opens the movie will do get you interested about the new journey of the Bella. No parts of the movie will make you feel that anything is shown in extreme. But, as the movie had a very simple story, it could not go critical (perhaps that was a plus point) and ended predictably.\n\nI don't know why I watched this movie many many times.\n\n12/10 in acting! The role of Isabella and Edward played by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson is priceless.\n\nIsabella Swan is little insecure, clumsy and introvert in nature. She always has complex thing going in her mind. All these things shown by Kristen is so perfect. The acting was so deep that it can get you obsessed with Bella. I think this is the height of acting: to make someone to have a crush and obsession with a character. Kristen, now in 19, has already shown her talent. No other actress have got such stardom in this young age. I think that one day she will be considered as one of the best actress in the history of Hollywood, and I know, that day is not very far."

The result was weak.\n\nInstead of intensifying the emotion the music is spoiling a lot of the scenes. The art direction isn't satisfactory either. The visual effects are shameful for 21st century cinema. The story is chaotic. The director had no sense of how to develop the romance. The few truly intimate moments between Bella and Edward are not as expressive as they should have been. I felt deprived from my initial feeling.\n\nThe only good thing is the acting! Despite the bad direction and screenplay Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart manage to portray the magic between Edward and Bella.\n\nOf course, it's not enough, because the rest of the factors are missing.

Was hoping for more Still left with a smile and thought it was cute but it should have dazzled me to the point of no compare...

But as a loyal twilight fan i am still going to see it mulitple times!! I will review after i see it again i think it will be better. And Randomn Stephanie Meyer Moment eating pie"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I love all 4 books and really wanted to like this movie. I went in with low expectations because the previews didn't make it look that great - but I was surprised that it was even worse than I thought it was going to be!\n\nThe only thing I liked about the movie is that the characters look like I thought they were supposed to when I read about them. And I liked the Cullen family - all except Edward. In the books, Edward is the most romantic guy you could ever dream of. But in the movie, he is just whiny and awkward. It reminded me of Hayden Christenson's butchering of Anniken Skywalker in the Star Wars movies. Robert Pattison is nice to look at, but his acting is terrible! And Kristen Stewart is not much better.\n\nI think the thing that was the worst for me when watching this movie, is knowing how the romance is supposed to play out, and instead I found myself thinking \"why do they even like each other?\" There is nothing really remarkable or special about the movie Edward or Bella. They are both very wooden and one dimensional. The scenes in the book that show how they fall in love and the intense passion they have for each other are all kind of jumbled into one really choppy, uncomfortable scene.\n\nWhen reading the book, the thing that really moves the story along is the characters - which makes for kind of a boring movie - so I knew that they were going to have to change some things around to make it more movie friendly. But the stuff that was changed didn't really add anything to the story, and the character development was totally lost in transition.\n\nAll in all, this movie was unwatchable, even for people who haven't read the books. It's super boring and the acting is bad. I actually had to re-read the book so that I could remember how Edward and Bella's story is supposed to be and try to forget I ever saw the movie as it nearly ruined the whole series for me. Hopefully the new director for New Moon will be able to make a movie that is worth watching, but I'm not holding my breath since he still has to work with the same actors..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't think Twilight was a terrible movie as such, but it is not a fantastic one either. I will admit it wasn't my cup of tea, hence my mixed score, but there are redeeming qualities. I haven't read the book, so I can't judge its faithfulness or lack of to the text. I am going to start with the negatives. The dialogue felt very clunky and awkward, and I honestly felt the actors didn't have that much to work with. The plot takes a very long time to get going, and while it gets going, there were parts that felt underdeveloped sadly. And there were a number of bits towards the beginning that were unintentionally funny, and I think that was to do with Robert Pattinson. He is a real heart-throb I know, but his acting came across as rather hammy and even overdone. When me, my family and my sister's boyfriend saw it at the cinema, there was a lot of laughter at the scenes where the character Edward Cullen was staring into the camera. However, there are some good points. Kristen Stewart does give an assured performance in the lead, and Cam Gigandet does give one of the better performances of the movie. The soundtrack was somewhat decent, the camera work was good on the most part, and the scenery was splendid. Overall, I had mixed feelings on Twilight, it wasn't bad or good, just a little on the average side. It was a vampire movie but without the bite. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

With all the technology and good examples out there for making a good fantasy film it is hard to believe how poorly this movie was made. It was filmed like a reality show combined with shots out of a CK commercial. I would have to say that the worst part of this transformation from book to movie is how the dialog from the book which was clever and witty turned into unsophisticated sad blurted out sentences. Not to mention the well built characters that sadly transformed by poor acting and poor direction into paper cutouts of their original form. I sincerely hope i was able to stop someone from subjecting themselves to this horrific crime."

The problems with Twilight were Film School project mistakes, Its almost as if they just got lazy, between the editing, or the special effects, down to the casting of Edward.\n\nFor starters the acting in Twilight was very commendable. Some of the most natural, realistic acting from an ensemble cast we have seen in a long time, except for Edward. I realize every one is in current Rob love but, he took the flirting romantic lines and made them creepy and awkward, to the point where you wonder why Bella is with him, Yes he has his moments but on the whole he was no Casanova.\n\nAnd then the ever depressing sunlight seen, where he Bella describes it as \"beautiful, like a million diamonds embedded in his skin\" and then in the movie he looks like someone dipped him in sugar. Then there is the rain scene where there drenched then they are bone dry. The fight scene where her major wounds magically heal themselves. I could note errors in the movie for hours, and don't get me wrong this movie was good the cinematography was stunning the entire film was eye candy but the mistakes were enough to draw my attention from the story and notice them.\n\nThis Series has the potential to be great They have Great Writers, A director with a good vision and a all around stellar break out cast, If they clean up there filming crew find a competent editor and a special effects crew that knows what the hell there doing New Moon will be a stellar movie!"

Now I have never walked out of a movie before but I discarded my popcorn and stormed out of the cinema in disgust after half an hour.\n\nNot only does this completely take a huge dump all over everything that is cool about vampires but it has practically destroyed the lives of the actors. If only somebody had told them what they were getting into before they signed up to be in this film. Both Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart have been repeatedly harassed by the idiotic and overly annoying behaviour of the stupid fans. I genuinely pity anybody involved in this movie. I pity even more those who enjoyed it. If you enjoyed this movie/book, you obviously have no idea what good literature or good film-making is and are seriously deprived.\n\nAs a My Chemical Romance fan, I am thoroughly insulted by the fact that Stephenie Meyer says she was inspired by them. So as you can imagine, I practically had orgasms out of joy when MCR turned down the 'opportunity' to record the theme for New Moon. Basically put, I would rather have my intestines ripped out through my mouth than hear another thing about Twatlight/Twishite or any of it's terrible sequels. Simply the brain child of a silly repressed mormon and her wet dream."

        "review_detailed_main": "It had always bugged me (hearing people constantly complain about stuff left out/things that were changed in movie adaptations of books). I'd never read any books that films had been based on, and therefore was able to enjoy the films for what they were, rather than comparing them to the books they were adapted from. With the Twilight series, however, I finally decided that I wanted to see things from a different angle. I wanted to read these novels and then watch the film so that I could get a different perspective on things. I started reading the Twilight novels after hearing that a movie was being made based on the first one. Although I'd heard it was a series targeted at girls, I thought the books were worth giving a shot and went into it with an open mind. I actually really enjoyed them and couldn't put them down, they were that good. As for the movie...\n\nBella & Edward - I can happily, and with all certainty, assure people that Kristen Stewart has been perfectly cast as Bella. They could not have found a better fit. She embodies the character completely and absolutely does her justice. Robert Pattison's Edward is suitably cold in the beginning, but soon warms up and you can tell these two actors have the chemistry needed to make the Bella and Edward relationship believable. Although they are given questionable dialogue at times, they both pull out all the stops - and thank heavens, as this film rests almost completely on their shoulders. That isn't to say the other characters in the film aren't important. Far from it. Every other person in the movie is crucial, and I'm glad to see the casting was spot-on with almost every single one of them.\n\nThe Cullens - They are given limited screen time (some more than others), but manage to make the most of their time on screen. They're ALL good in their roles. Peter Facinelli and Nikki Reed (as Carlisle and Rosalie) are probably given the best chance to develop their characters, whilst Emmett, Jasper and Esme are sadly underused. I was annoyed with how briefly Alice was on screen (she was my favourite character from the books and Ashley Greene was another superbly cast actress. What little we saw of her, however, was spot-on. She *is* Alice).\n\nMike Newton, Jessica Stanley, Eric Yorkie, Angela Weber - The actors playing Bella's \"friends\" (I use the term loosely, because she doesn't exactly treat them as such) are given a surprisingly solid amount of screen time to develop their characters. They all manage to define themselves within mere moments of Bella meeting them (Anna Kendrick as Jessica probably being the stand-out of the lot). They provide some of the film's funnier moments.\n\nCharlie and Renee - Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke (as Bella's parents) are both memorable, given their limited screen time. The awkwardness between father and daughter is something that's stayed faithful to the book. So has the mother/daughter relationship. Billy Burke is especially good as Charlie (he provides some amusing moments).\n\nJacob Black - Sadly, like quite a few other important characters in the movie, Jacob's underused and we don't really get to know him as well as we should. Taylor Lauter does the best he can, though. He shows promise. Jacob's father (Billy) has even less time, but still gets a couple of laughs.\n\nJames, Victoria and Laurent - Although Cam Gigandet is somewhat over-the-top as James, Rachelle Lefevre's Victoria has the quiet menacing thing down.\n\nDirecting - Catherine Hardwicke makes the movie visually interesting. She has a very distinct style, which I think the film benefits from. Hardwicke's directing keeps the film grounded, and it has a 'realism' about it (which is quite the feat, considering). The scenery/atmosphere is amazing and the *look* of things is very faithful to the book. There's an incredible amount of thought and detail that's gone into the movie. The film's soundtrack is used exceptionally well. It never feels intrusive, but is just there in the background to enhance things (in a subtle way). The visually-stunning baseball scene is a perfect example of this. It's one of the best parts of the film. I also liked the wide sweeping shots of Bella and Edward high up in the trees (where 'Bella's Lullaby' was used to great effect).\n\nIf I had to pick one negative, it would be that the film feels a tad rushed. It felt as though there was SO much to get through, and certain things/characters weren't lingered on long enough. But this is a minor quibble. What's most important is that the heart of the books is maintained, and I believe the film has achieved this. Twilight isn't full of CGI, which makes it a better film. It's much more subtle/serious (though there's still plenty of humour, as well as some action. The film's humour was actually something I really enjoyed). Twilight may not be totally perfect/flawless, but I think it comes pretty close and remains very true to the books. Overall, I think this movie is successful at translating the first of Stephenie Meyer's books to screen. It's very enjoyable (I saw it twice at the cinema) and I cannot wait for New Moon. Make sure to stay for the end credits, they're well worth watching."

I wasn't blown away at all, but it was fine, and I suppose I can figure why every female I know is nuts for it.\n\nBut again, the movie fails to do the book any justice. It isn't really a mess up by anyone in particular. Just the overall effort to make it an adequate adaptation seemed to be seriously lacking. It almost felt as if they were rushing to get it made. Some of the lines are just terrible. I never thought the actual writing of the book was that sophisticated, but the screenplay just takes the already corny lines and butchers them that much more.\n\nIf you are a fan of the book, avoid.

Stewert, while being in some good movies, just does not get the emotions out. Robert did an excellent job of Edward, but the movie, like the book, focused WAY too much on him. Most of the movie focuses on the two main characters, while this is expected, the others are sort of \"not as involved\". Some of the characters were very dull and you learn so little about anything. Had I not read the book first, I would have been VERY confused with this movie. In some areas, the characters have awkward moments(in fact too many) that left me seeing this movie as a corny and bad impression of some of Twilight's more dramatic moments. All in all, this movie was one of the biggest letdowns, that will only draw in profit from the inflated hype blimp created by the fans. If your a die hard fan, you will be disappointed, otherwise I recommend reading the book, before seeing the movie, otherwise you just won't get half of what is going on."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am in love with the twilight series, especially the first book. And mainly because of how much i love Edward. Hes the perfect guy. SO what if he happens to be a vampire? SOoooooooo I saw the movie and i definitely enjoyed watching it cuz its like a summary of the book that u get to see and kinda relive reading it, but it doesn't compare one bit. I mean, first off, that was the worst actor to play Edward. He was not a good actor, he sounded like he was reading from the script the whole time. And, I picture Edward to be tough and protective and just so sweet, and this guy, i don't know, just didn't portray it that way. Sure he can stop a truck and do all the Edward in the book things, but it looked so fake cuz he was such a skinny dork. And again a really bad actor. In my opinion. The Bella actress was pretty good, but i think he ruined the scenes so much that no actress could recover th magic that i picture them having between them. And since the movie is so much shorter they rush the whole relationship with Edward and Bella that u cant fully appreciate the chemistry between them like in the book. So, what i have been telling everyone is they can not see the movie before they read the book. If u do, u cant fully appreciate it and u will think that it really is nothing special and there is no point to read the book. But since i love the book so much, it was just fun to watch it and relive it and add my own imagination to it since i know what the author was trying to make us feel!"

The Film tries to stay true to the book, but it all takes place to fast at an awkward pace. There is almost zero character development and in the end your left asking \" what\"? In all fairness most movies don't stay to close to the book so this was to be expected.\n\nMost shocking was the horrible acting and all the unneeded close ups. I felt more like i was watching a Episode of something on BBC rather than a Hollywood movie.\n\nThe make up and special effects were laughable at best. Apparently all you have to do to be a vampire is spray baby powder on yourself.\n\nIn closing. Save your money, Enjoy the book and pass on this film its a train wreck. Sure teen hype will keep it afloat, but even fans cant keep this sinking ship afloat."

It is estimated that in the year following when there were no new Twilight books on the market, author Stephenie Meyer earned $14 million. In 2010, at the height of the Twilight book and movie madness, the author ranked 59th on the Forbes annual Celebrity 100 with $40 million in earnings.\n\nI don't know who has written these ridiculously low score reviews LOL -the ones that seem among the most ridiculous criticise the unique and scene-setting camera work. If you don't like vampire films then why eatch or review them. And the criticism that they are not close to the books is ridiculous - I do not recall watching a film that is so loyal to the source material.......\n\nWell here's hoping I can be involved with a project that is 1/100 as ground breaking, successful and iconic......"

Vampires that glitter? But I gave the books a shot and found them to be very delightful.\n\nI would say the movie was... delightfully terrible and unintentionally funny. I found myself giggling at the acting and the over dramatic scenes that you are frequently presented with. It's almost kind of tragic. But that's mostly the beginning of the movie. The actors seem a little more tense, the makeup is a little over done, and there are many scenes that are supposed to be really serious dramatic moments, and you don't seem to be able to point out as much during the end of the movie. It's like the actors did this in one long take, you can tell that they're more comfortable in the last half of the movie, and the makeup isn't so annoying and obvious.\n\nIt's fun to see the characters they picked and the way they played out the book. There are many scenes that are tweaked from the book that honestly would've been better off keeping it the same. Sometimes while Edward is running around or whatever, you can get the feel of the big string pulling him around, but hey, that's low budget for ya. But overall, it's fun to watch it if you're a Twilight lover, which I am. I would probably see this movie again, but I still cannot entirely take it serious, and I really hope that New Moon will do a better job considering how much money they made on Twilight alone!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is more of a comment on the previous comment -- I had not read the books when I saw the movie, but I enjoyed the movie enough that I am now on book #4... I disagree with a few things previously stated. First of all, the vampires in the books do not have fangs. There is one instance where Jacob asks Bella if Edward's fangs bother her, and she gets defensive and says \"You know he doesn't have fangs!\" It's pretty hard to turn a 300+ page book into a less than 2-hour PG-13 movie without leaving out some of the detail, especially when the detail is usually about how beautiful the characters are. The only way to really show that is through makeup and the way other people look at those characters... In my opinion, the movie was done just fine, and considering a lot of twilight fans have paid to see it multiple times, I don't think it was \"by far... the worst.\" Have you seen \"The Spirit\" yet? :) I rest my case."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, I haven't read the books and never would have watched this again if it weren't for my girlfriend being a fan. Second, going into the film after not watching it for eight years, my expectations were warped by the fact that the entire world is split into two distinct camps: those who praise 'Twilight' as the greatest thing ever produced by mankind, and those who think it's the epitome of horrendous cinema. For me, this is a bad film that's nonetheless entertaining for most of its runtime; I can see why it's a lot of people hold it as a 'guilty pleasure'.\n\nSo yeah, 'Twilight' is a bad film - but that isn't to say it's not entertaining. The acting is mostly bad and the script is mostly awful, so every character interaction comes across as incredibly awkward, forced, and plastic. The movie is hilariously cheesy with its disposable and lifeless narration, its ridiculous vampire special effects, its bizarre plot, and all the rest of it; a lot of the time it feels like I'm watching a high schooler's project. For me, the plot falls apart in the third act. I understand there is a series of source material to follow, but when looking at this film as it's own story, it didn't have to end in some low-stakes, black and white, good vs. Evil climax. The villain is boring and useless, and the movie falls flat on its face for its final act. And admittedly, while there's cute parts, the central romance is never really established, and I found most initial interactions between the two leads to be pretty lacklustre.\n\nWhile I do think it's a bad film, I think it gets an undeserved reputation, because it's not awful. Despite its many flaws I still found it a lot of fun to watch with my girlfriend. And it's not just so bad that it's good - there are genuinely good (if a little mindless) aspects to it. It's hard to pinpoint but the movie has a unique atmosphere and charm about it that I found attractive; it's not ashamed of embracing its quirks and strange world to tell its tale. A lot of it is silly but fun, like the whole development of the romance, which is underdeveloped but somehow pretty cute; Edward and Bella rocking up all cool to school in their fresh relationship; or the dramatic conversation between Edward and Bella when it's revealed he's a vampire. And honestly, there are some compelling, character-driven parts to it too, that might not be executed perfectly but are nonetheless quite nice (Bella's 'betrayal' of her father comes to mind as an emotional moment, though it's weight is nonexistent later on). A lot of what I like are concepts that aren't entirely explored or executed.\n\nSo all in all, it's a bad film that I enjoyed a lot for the most part. Just turn off your brain, get a friend to watch it with, and embrace all its quirks, faults, and cheesiness. It's a very understandable guilty pleasure."
