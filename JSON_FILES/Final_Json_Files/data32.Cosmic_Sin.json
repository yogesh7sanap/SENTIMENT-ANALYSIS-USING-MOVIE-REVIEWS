Nobody had anything to say. Anything to add. Nothing we haven't seen a million times before. Screenplay has nothing whatsoever to say or convey and is full of clich\u00e9s, just like it would be if you never wanted to write it in the first place, but had to. For a grade, or something.\n\nClearly, there was no excess money to burn - almost entire scenography is some kind of paintball course. And some forest. And all the crops are close-ups of people doing stuff, mostly shooting off into something offscreen, presumably into the distance.\n\nThe movie is set in the 26th century, with the space and time bending human species spanning three planets (only indication of this is an introductory text) and the weirdest thing we can see in the galaxy is a girl with semi-yellow hair? Everything else, technology, weapons, fashion, everything looks exactly as today. Alright, excepting a few seconds long filler scenes of spaceships.\n\nI'm writing this because one question baffles me without cease. It's - Why did you have to make this? What was the motivation behind this work? I don't see you making any money, however inadequate the investment was. What's the point? I'd really like to know.\n\nIf this is some kind of student project movie, then its kinda cool. If you go to school with the guys who made this then you should really have a go at it. Otherwise..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I noticed that \"Cosmic Sin\" recently made it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list and has a pitiful score of only 2.5! So, not only is it on the list...but it is way up the list at #39!\n\nWhen I first started watching this sci-fi film, I could IMMEDIATELY see why the film is so hated. It's a film set in the 26th century and at this time, there is space travel and life on many planets and moons. So, why do you see folks driving pickup trucks that look like they are from 2021? Why are the clothes pretty much what you'd see today and why are most of the weapons not much more effective or different than today's?! It honestly looks like they must have spend all their budget on securing Bruce Willis' talents and had nothing left to make it look like a futuristic story. Now I don't think you need expensive props to make a good film...but this is ridiculous and really takes you out of the story.\n\nThe story begins with some form of life being discovered on some new planet. It seems that up until this time, humans have never made first contact with any intelligent species...even with humans inhabiting many new worlds. As you'd expect, this new form of sentient life is not sweet and friendly....as who would want to see a film like that?! And, it turns out that it is so deadly that in the entire galaxy (numbering many, many, many billions) the only guy that can stop the creatures is a war criminal, James Ford (Willis)!\n\nI have seen much worse films that never made it to the IMDB list...mostly because they are older, cheaper and more obscure. In other words, the Bottom 100 is very heavily skewed to new films...so although the film is bad, it's not the 39th worst film ever made! I think it's just that a lot of folks get Netflix and had a chance to see it...whereas far less folks have seen the films of Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ray Dennis Steckler and William Grefe...all filmmakers who REALLY knew how to make terrible films...REALLY terrible films!\n\nSo is there anything good about this movie? Some of the CGI space scenes are very nice and would probably look great on the big screen (though I assume this film, when it came out, only went straight to Netflix and Amazon Prime). Otherwise, the story is not especially interesting, the dialog often pretty bad and the acting not especially good. It is not completely awful...just mostly awful. And, unfortunately not so bad that it's fun to watch in order to make fun of the film.\n\nBy the way, nearly all the reviews for this are extremely negative. With this and a score of 2.5, I am amazed to find some folks giving it 10s! A few admit that it's bad but are just trolling or love it because it's so bad. A few, however, are VERY short reviews that talk about how brilliant it is...a sure sign normally of fake reviews done by folks connected with the film...which is pretty shameful."

Note that he is billed first, above Willis, and his role is at most 15 minutes from the film anyway.\n\nBut what makes this film shine like a black hole is the story. It felt more than devoid of passion, like a spreadsheet that sucks one's soul away in the accounting department on a hot day after the air conditioning died. I mean, if a kid would have written it, it at least would have been fun. If someone was incompetent it would have felt like trying to send some kind of message, however badly. But no, it ... just made no sense, like someone hated writing for this film.\n\nBottom line: it is so bad you can't even enjoy it wasted. It's a non-movie. It's like what's on the other side of the event horizon of TV static."

The guy, the strong woman, the heroe, the bad enemy, the final monster, the good guy some died breaking everyone heart, the guy who had to sacrifice himself, and so on.\n\nBut I think the special effects were pretty decent and with some good ideas (compared to the budget).\n\nSo I wrote my minimum 600 chars to say: give the movie a chance and enjoy the last sparkle of a star."

Engineer Fiona Ardene (Adelaide Kane) is called in to prep the device. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) leads the soldiers while Dr. Lea Goss (Perrey Reeves) is awed by the aliens.\n\nFirst thing first, this movie opens with an info-dump in text form. It's a lot of gobbledygook. Someone should try to read it again. Then there is the awkward mix of present-day technology with the future tech. There is no logical reason for it. It's an obviously sign of bad budgeting and unimaginative set design. When that happens, they are better off putting the movie in a smaller space and as much future tech onto the screen. At least, put some effort in giving the characters some future-cars. Its greater sin is that it's boring. I think I must have spaced out.

While I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, then I must say that all throughout the course of the entire movie I was sitting with an overwhelming sense of pointlessness. I just couldn't find anything worthwhile in the storyline, and everything seemed just bland and without a cause.\n\nIt was so difficult to indulge myself into the storyline because it was so linear and anything but interesting and exciting. So the end result that is \"Cosmic Sin\" from director Edward Drake was just a very forgettable and rather mundane movie. The storyline was just so amazingly generic and linear that you could have left the movie for a longer period of time, and returned only to be right up to speed with the storyline.\n\nNow, I am sure that die-hard fans - pardon the pun - of Bruce Willis or Frank Grillo might actually find some kind of odd enjoyment here in the movie. I, however, didn't. So this movie was a swing and a miss.\n\nI must admit that it felt that Bruce Willis wasn't really committed to this movie project, and his performance felt half-hearted, as if he was running on auto-pilot. And Frank Grillo just wasn't given enough on-screen time to manage to do much of anything to salvage the movie.\n\nThe characters in the movie were every bit as bland and pointless as the storyline. So you don't really connect with any of them, nor do you form any kind of attachments to any of them. So whether they live or die, it hardly matters.\n\nNow, what did work for \"Cosmic Sin\" was the visuals. They had some nice enough suits for the soldiers of the Alliance. And the weapon effects were quite good. The aliens, however, they just felt like something out of a B movie. So that was disappointing to say the least.\n\nAll in all, \"Cosmic Sin\" was exactly what the movie title says; a cosmic sin. This movie came and went without leaving much of any blast mark or memorable impression. My rating of \"Cosmic Sin\" lands on a mere three out of ten stars."

Acting aligned with the simple cliche story so do not expect anything in that area as well. Very little character back story and universe lore, characters are shallow and aliens are just simple strange looking cannon fodder with high tech appearing randomly, talking some brief non sense here and there and doing silly stuff before they are shot. Sound was okay I guess for a low budget... thats why I gave it 2.\n\nI think anyone can guess how it ends in the first 5 minutes so not even bothering to put a spoiler here.

Not that I think Bruce Willis is a great actor, he just played in some good movies, but he's not a great actor, and lately he's been actually really bad. It's going downhill for Bruce Willis. Cosmic Sin is just bad, with a story that is badly written, special effects that looked from another century, and actors that don't seem to know what they're doing. I wish I could unwatch this piece of garbage."

In this case I at least thought I would get Frank Grillo as the actual star of the movie but as it turns out he's also phoning this one with Willis. Guest he can do that after making that money In the Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks.\n\nThe movie has a complex plot about survival of the fittest on an interstellar level, which was pretty much wrapped up in the trailer of the film and never really goes any further.\n\nI would love to tell you how action packed this film is but that falls short as well. It feels set up to be fluffed with action but its all lame .\n\nThe only thing I truly got a kick out of was the cheap Sci-fi. You could tell they were trying to turn 20 bucks into 200 million, but sometimes those failures can give a movie charm. They had some visual effects scenes that were filmed perfectly and some of the costumes were so stylish i could not keep my eyes off of them (Making it easier to see all their flaws)\n\nIf you want a really good Bruce Willis is just on the poster movie checkout Extraction, it's perfect.

But low budget, poorly directed movies can have entertaining and compelling stories, and I like to find those.\n\nThis is not it. If you think there is any redeemable quality for this movie, because Bruce Willis must have seen something to be in it, you'd be wrong. I don't know why he agreed to be in this film, but the script was not.\n\nThe movie is full of cliches, but the worst part is that it doesn't make any sense. All is supposed to happen in less than 24 hours, yet the movie has characters and events that seem to have happened for decades. The mismatch of technological advances is ludicrous, with rifles with ammo alongside lasers, and gas vehicles with wormhole jumps.\n\nAbsurd beyond believe, there is a pocket sized weapon capable of destroying an entire solar system. Unstable, it can't be rattled and can be activated if dropped. The encasing of this technological marvel of 500 years into the future? A glass cylinder. Not even a cardboard box with padding like an iPhone.\n\nThe inconsistencies are so profound and frequent, that I truly started to worry about my own understanding. Am I having a stroke? How can this have passed through a team of people and nobody said anything?\n\nBut it is not me. This movie is really that bad. Like a word salad of low budget sci fy scenes cobbled up together by a defective algorithm.\n\nDon't waste your time."

The science is messed up beyond even the lowest fiction standards of science fiction. I think I had a general understanding of what was supposed to be going on, but I'm not sure.\n\nAt times it felt almost like a bad parody, and I hope they were just trolling the viewers with just how much they can get away with.\n\nIt looks like a fan film shot on a good camera with good actors but nobody cared one bit.\n\nI can't really bash on the actors, everyone needs some cash, there were a couple of recognizable faces like Frank Grillo (who isn't a pro actor, but he's always likable), Lochlyn Munro, even Costas Mandylor from the Saw series...this is just...bizarre.\n\nWillis delivered his basic nearly-coma performance which he does in most of his fast paycheck-oriented films now, and he made sure that the contract mentioned him in the script as an ultimate badass. His appearance was obviously agreed on only to have his face mentioned in the promotion materials.\n\nI usually endorse low-budget sci-fi when I see a spark of an idea or actual care put into one. This is an absolute waste of time, I strongly recommend everyone to skip this."

Unfortunately this movie wasn't...\n\nCosmic Bin is one of most boring bad movies I have EVER SEEN!\n\nThe story is the most generic sci fi fantasy gebber gabber, Bruce Wills is a retired space soldier (or something like that) and the space military station want his stuntdoub~ I mean him, To do one last mission..\n\nThe action scenes are too boring and so far in between with unnecessary slow-motion with sound effects we have heard a thousand times before..\n\nCharacters so generic you won't even remember their names after the credits roll, Bruce Wills's character (James Ford, Such a creative name lol) kills one of soldier friends FOR NO APPARENT REASON.. and that's the character that we should love and sympathize with.. Oh yeah and Frank Grillo, The first guy in the credits, He barely appear in the movie (WOW, Such a great passion for movie making)\n\nDon't watch this movie, It's super boring, Full of filler and pointless scenes, Bad acting / custom design, Uninspired music and It's not even funny, Avoid this movie at all costs.."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read that Bruce Willis only took a day of filming for this and the rest of it was stunt doubles, that doesn't bode well. He barely put a full sentence in. It had a cast capable of making something at least decent; Bruce Willis, Frank Grillo, Lochlyn Munro are some of the more known actors that you might have seen before but are usually hit or miss actors and this was a miss. The main problem was the writing though, the script was horrible and unimaginative. The plot and premise were unoriginal but okay, with a good enough script this would have been tolerable, maybe good if you wanna stretch. It's paced all wrong too, with some scenes and pauses going on too long for dramatic effect but it just made me wanna fast forward. The CGI was all bright and neon, quintessential of low budgets sci-fi movies and series to make them seem more futuristic. Also, the whole mysterious alien wormhole gate and a rogue team heading to stop it feels like a farce take on The Expanse. I'm surprised I watched the whole thing, but I think that's owing to heading into it with already low expectations and nothing better to do. Definitely not worth a watch. I've always wondered how directors feel after making a movie and it has a crappy ratings on every review platform."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the year 2524 an Earth colony has first contact with a hostile alien race. General Ryle (Frank Grillo) enlists disgraced \"Blood General\" James Ford (Bruce Willis) who was infamous for his use of a Q-Bomb that killed 70 Million people. Ryle enlists Ford to lead an off the books team to eliminate the alien threat before they're aloud to spread through the galaxy.\n\nReteaming with Edward Drake and Corey Large of fellow DtV Willis sci-fi film Breach, Cosmic Sin looks and feels like it's from the same filmmakers to the point they almost feel like entries in their own \"universe\". Instead of aping Alien or The Thing like Breach, Cosmic Sin is more in line with sci-fi action like Aliens or Edge of Tomorrow. In a way I suppose Cosmic Sin is a marginal improvement on Breach, but in other ways with a larger scale story and a similar production budget, it feels noticeably cheaper than Breach as well.\n\nMuch like Breach the movie doesn't feel like it takes place in the future. At least with Breach once they were on the ship they at least had proper uniforms that fit with the situation, but in Cosmic Sin everything feels like it's straight from today save for some CGI establishing shots of spaceships and some \"armor\"(we'll get to that). It's clear the movie's reach far exceeds it's grasp with the \"high tech military facility\" using the same tricks as breach to make it look futuristic with harsh multicolored lighting and poorly integrated hologram effects. But the filmmakers luckily decided to give us some locational variety with their shoot....the woods! All of the colony scenes (save for one scene with a tent) take place in the woods and have the same feeling of rushed and economic one would expect to see in a LARP straight out of Role Models. The armor the characters wear in the second half of the movie makes no sense as the script says it's approved for \"quantum combat\"(whatever that's supposed to be) and with open faced helmets and massive bare patches there's no thought or care as to how these cheap bulky monstrosities function in combat or space.\n\nOutside of the bare bones production values, the movie's script is a hodgepodge of pretty much every other sci-fi film/video game you've seen(and a few you haven't) with the likes of the 2009 Star Trek, Stargate, Edge of Tomorrow, Screamers, Gears of War, Aliens, and even Ghosts of Mars. The movie's script also tries to address \"ethical issues\" in quite possibly the most ill fitting approach since 2005's Stealth tried to analyze the moral issues of unmanned drone warfare. Willis' \"Blood General\" James Ford is so named because he quelled an separatist rebellion by dropping a Q-bomb killing 70 million people. The movie is strangely uncritical about this character with many of the supporting cast spouting things about how Ford got a \"Raw Deal\", \"It's harder to give orders than follow them\", \"you need monsters to beat monsters\", and it's the kind of mindset that many villains use for justification in many films of this ilk that makes the film feel fundamentally confused. Not that the story will draw most people in as it's poorly delivered with bad camera work, poorly staged sequences, and sleepy performances from uninterested actors with Bruce Willis' voice never even breaking an octave.\n\nCosmic Sin continues Bruce Willis' disappointing DtV streak with an embarrassing cheap sci-fi rehash that is put to shame by amateurly made fan productions. With a sloppy production, cut and paste script, and uninterested performances that leave the movie inert and dull the movie will give you the odd laugh or smirk from point out its stolen ideas and concepts, but aside from that it's yet another cheap dud from a once respectable actor."

It is entertaining.\n\nI almost didn't watch due to this being rated a 2.5 overall. I mean that rating would make this a steaming piece of garbage, which it is not! I was curious how possibly bad this could be so I watched the first 10 minutes then watched the whole movie. Yes, the special effects aren't that of a 100 million dollar movie but they aren't too bad.\n\nOverall this is a good SyFy movie, definitely watchable if this is your genre. Aliens, military, action and a good enough plot with dialog. Better than the movies the SyFy channel puts out themselves. Honestly I would have rated a 6 to 6.5 but since everyone rated so low I rated it a 7. Don't rush to watch it but if you like SyFy and Bruce Willis then a good way to kill some time.\n\nI wish you could only rate if there was proof you watched the whole movie or series.\n\nI want to make this clear. Here is how ratings should work! Since we can't give a zero an average movie is 5.5. So a 5 is a little below average and a 6 is a little above average. I just jotted these all down so I am sure they could be tweaked.\n\n1 Is totally unwatchable. Complete waste of time and money! I want my eyes and time back! These are movies Elvira said no to! Burn all of these as they have zero cinematic quality to anyone!\n\n2 - This movie was rejected from the B movie festival. I would not watch again, I would never recommend and I am upset I saw it! The only reason it might do well is people watch these because they are so bad it is funny.\n\n3 - This is a B movie and not a good one at that! I was at someone's house and I could not escape. Good date movie so they might like to do something else. ^ ^ Would not recommend and I am upset I watched.\n\n4 - Ugh, This wasn't very good. I watched too much so I felt obliged to watch the rest. I am not super happy I put it on! I guess B movies fit in here.\n\n5 - Slighty below average. Watchable and okay but would not watch again.\n\n6 - Slightly above average. Watchable and a enjoyed a few parts.\n\n7 - Good movie. Happy I watched it. Some good parts in it.\n\n8 - Amazing movie. I greatly enjoyed this movie! Very happy I watched it!\n\n9 - Wow. Not a blockbuster but really enjoyed this! I would tell anyone to watch this awesome movie. I will watch again! Great job!\n\n10 - One of the best movies! I would love to see this movie again! I would like to own this. Great piece of cinematic art!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Cosmic Sin the 26th Century still using way outdated hand weapons (eventually even a grenade) and pick-up trucks and honking vehicles on a street and parked motorcycles and even cigarettes indistinguishable from the 1960s. The Nostromo from the Alien (1979) had a way much better med unit. Early scenes after the good and bad introductory mystery have of course the requisite robotic servers and hologram (country?) singers and a barfight with a slight difference with again the old-fashioned side arms and the Calvary with an attempt at twinge of an alternative outcome that really is not.\n\nThere are major storyline problems with the quarantine procedures even simple glass windows and even a typical \"gun\" fight, yet there was an initial attempt at fascinating underlying dynamic taking place however with the first contact encounter scenes and subsequent reflective commentary. Then somehow a brief firefight does not flow well, problems with editing arise, a scene very underdeveloped, and supposedly a well-manned defensive team becomes at risk of being actually overrun. Instead of a quickening climatic pace, the energy seems to dissipate and slow down along with almost no high-tech, futuristic surveillance networks to warn of impending attacks becomes more combat scenes from a mediocre World War II movie with elements from Stargate (1994) and worse yet the climatic battle is something that would be more like out of a World War I engagement and lame hand to hand sequences and a limp effort a riveting emotional end. The screenwriters were definitely not up the job and no actor could improve on a thin script that had the promise but not the actual substance to translate into a credible movie. This movie even reverted to absolutely unnecessary cowboy, western era musical harmonics while Bruce Willis strangely just seems to fade almost completely away by the end of the movie.\n\nThe major problem with Cosmic Sin lies with the screenwriters trying too hard to be cute and offer up something substance, different, and try to incorporate too many fancy relational and philosophical ideas. They failed in their execution and omitted too many important backstories to offer audiences a sense of plot flow. Instead the audience is sort of just dropped into this movie without the understanding of what the real motives of what is going on. The audience is forced to play catch up. The writers fall into their own traps with the only way out of empty ideas is to create overly convenient ways to extricate themselves out of various corners (i.e., where a general loses face for backing down on his own orders, the awkward political dynamics of the military decisions being made, past undisclosed relationships).\n\nMaybe the only nice surprise of this movie is the character and what some people might call a cameo performance of Lochlyn Munro. He appears to have finally broken out of his typecast of either simple bad guy or side character in a slew of romantic comedies. Munro had a decent performance here."

The absolute lowest it should be at is 4/10. It's watchable, at least one time.\n\nThese 1/10 reviews are dismissible. I'm giving this a 10/10 strictly because the ratings seem to be made up of people who don't actually rate movies based on what the film offers.\n\nI'd give this a 6/10. It's good enough to make me watch it again.\n\nIf you want to see a move that is less than three stars, go watch the worst of Troma's home video releases.\n\nNo this isn't a masterpiece, I'd argue it's better than The Hudson Hawk, which I can't bring myself to sit through again."

Too bad, this movie s8(!ks...\n\nThe \"story\": .....\n\nPfff... a 9 metacritics score, that is a new record low (before it was 12).\n\nIn my quest to see ALL Bruce Willis movies I also watched this one. Let's not forget that some of the movies Bruce Willis is making nowadays is only because of contractual obligations. That's the reason why he is churning out 5 till 10 movies a year upon year. That's a lot. Of course you cant be picky when you are starring in 10 movies a year. He often only stars in each movie for no more than 15 minutes or so. Producers happy, because they sell tickets with Bruce his name on the bill. Bruce Willis happy because he got his paycheck and can pay alimony to his ex-wives. But the audience watching it, might not be so happy, because they are expecting DIE HARD quality filmmaking. And to put it politely, some of these newest Bruce Willis movies are \"a bit\" inferior to DIE HARD.\n\nAt an (excrucially) important sidenote, let us not forget WHY we are watching Bruce Willis movies to begin with. We watch Bruce Willis movies because of DIE HARD (1988). THE ONE AND ONLY BIGGEST ACTION AMERICAN ACTION CLASSIC OF THE CENTURY.\n\nThis classic is still standing strong after more than 30 years. Millions of people still REwatch it during every Christmas holiday. Recently a petition was launched to rename Nakatomi Plaza into DIE HARD plaza.\n\nA life time achievement award for Bruce Willis is in the making.\n\nDIE HARD (1988) NEVER DIES but is still ALIVE AND KICKING IN 2022. Why not simply REwatch the brilliant DIE HARD (1988) again and start the new year with a bang! Happy New Year!"

        "review_detailed_main": "EDWARD DRAKE who directed this very low-budget t.v series like Sci-fi Thriller also had written it & also had written the other Bruce Willis Sci-fi Cheapy ANTI-LIFE (2021) also & that explains why both films are so similar & i thought that as I watching it, i actually said to my wife that Willis must've gotten Deya Vu making this!!! I actually liked ANTI-LIFE better of the two but to be honest they do make a chilled evening of a Double Bill of Willis Sci-fi Thriller's. Now COSMIC SIN is set like it's other half of the Double bill, in the future but this time the world isn't destroyed but just very futuristic (with what the small budget could do) with flying cars/vehicles as well as normal cars too still & robots for a barman in the bars (Similar to Will Smith's i,Robot 2004) & lots of glowing Neon lights & things & for the most part it looks good!!! Yes it's very low-budget but i gotta admit i was impressed with alot of the look & technology they pulled off with cheap c.g.i & practical effects & the basic story is our planet has finally made contact with Alien creatures but they're hostile & when a team return from another planet that they've been stationed on, they come back possessed just like in it's close brother ANTI-LIFE & start killing everyone in the station base & here we get our team of soon-to-be heroes with the rugged old infamous ex-Commander Bruce Willis known as a warmonger due to his brutal past & it's just nice having the old skool Action legend here in such a low-budget production, even if he's only here for the paycheck!!! Willis plays his part like most these days with a calmness & a Coolness & a bad attitude just like he did in Anti-life & many other of his DTV films but i like him here & just by having him lifts its quality. We also get the great B-movie legend FRANK GRILLO who i have loved since THE PURGE: ANARCHY & his Cool, rugged & no-nonsense toughness is on display again in a leader role but to be honest he doesn't get to do the action i expected & wanted but again it's great to have the veteran side by side with Willis. There's a few other familiar faces but it's these two stars is why i wanted to even watch this.\n\nI will say this though that i would rather watch this flick or Anti-life over any of the ridiculously mega budget TRANSFORMERS films & more so than many of the over-blown budget trash that is put on the Cinema, Cosmic Sin is small scale but crams in a fun little Sci-fi action story with a Cool Willis leading it all even if he's not exactly giving it his all, still miles better than the usual Steven Seagal DTV flick. Small minimalist budget yes but i see alot of creativity went into creating the look & it's futuristic technology & it does look Good for it's budget!!!\n\nAt times i got the feel & vibe of a POWER RANGERS episode or movie, especially when they gear up with body armour suits & when they fight the Alien beings (that seem like possessed humans as you Don't ever see their faces or what they really are) the villains come accross as the type that the Power Rangers would battle but hey it's a Low-budget slice of Sci-fi Thriller cheese so i just took it for that. Our team are power boosted through space & land on another planet that is fine for Humans & the rest of the Cheese fest plays on the forest planet with rebels (like STAR WARS) & the action is fine for a cheap flick with laser guns & possessed warriors that also reminded of John Carpenter's Ghost's of Mars just like ANTI-LIFE did too!!!! Many Sci-fi flicks enfluenced this as did ANTI-LIFE & like i said both written by Edward Drake but only this one was directed by him.\n\nCosmic Sin just like Anti-life is a cheap, trashy & cheesy but fun B-movie that's nothing special or great but an easy watch & does make a nice Double bill with ANTI-LIFE. Entertaining & fun."

But now this Cosmic Sin really baffled me. Nothing works, the pacing is clunky, the dialogues are terrible, Bruce Willis seems to stare at the camera and do one liners just because and looks totally bored, the cinematography looks really amateur and cheap, and the special effects are worst than the ones found on amateur Star Trek fan films. Worst of all the story is bland and it looks like it was written by some teen fed on a bad diet of unimaginative comics and boring videogames. The movie locations also don't help and all seems like a useless z movie because in some ways it does not even reach the status of a b movie. I was bored beyond words with this one, couldn't wait for it to be over and simply don't get how this was even made and more baffled to see Bruce Willis in this. Its not even one of those so bad it become great. It simply is not a fun movie at all and one star is the best I can give. One of the most boring, predictable and pointless space adventures I ever saw. And I'm 51, I've seen things ..."

Never make another movie like that please.\n\nThe story has potential, special effects are subpar, you can see the suits they are wearing are made of flimsy plastic, the weapons in 25th century are guns with bullets, they use old keyboards and computers that emite weird songs, people drive on the highway in regular pick up trucks and motor bikes that are made in the 21st century and are well over 400 year old. The highlight of the sci-fi is a jubox from the 1960...Really what were they thinking. Start trek from the late 60 had better effects and better equipment than characters in this movie. I really do not know where were the people with imagination when they were writing the script? It is beyond bad. If you want to do yourself a good thing, go for a walk in the rain, go for a run, call your friends or go get your groceries, take out the garbage, vacuume the apartment.

To say I was disappointed it's an understatement. It was horrific and like a train wreck or a car accident that you can't turn away from to see Bruce Willis in this. He looks like a deer caught in headlights, his eyes are shiny and there is no one home. It is heartbreaking that he has been used the last few films he was forced to do I'm sure.

I thought no matter how brainless the plots at least Willis entertained, not anymore. Retire already if you don't want to work. You couldn't land Moonlighting if you got the shot and the youth somehow.\n\nAn insult to movie paying public!\n\nThe question asked at the end of writing the review is are there any spoilers, I will answer no, but it has spoiled my evening and any future hope of a GOOD Bruce Willis movie."

Scenes just come and go, offering no substance other than merely padding the time. Anyone giving this high marks because it's \"hilariously bad\" is doing a disservice by inflating the overall score (currently 2.5).\n\nThe only thing that could be considered slightly decent quality is some of the special effects work, which is still outclassed by most tv commercials.

Ive seen better costumes in that D&D movie with the purple moron evil magician. The planetary defense cannon looked like a 60s carnival ride.\n\nDIRECTION: The director lacks a basic understanding of how physics works in space or low-gravity. Heck, he doesn't even grasp earth gravity.\n\nPLOTHOLES: Beyond count...\n\nBruce, what the hell are you thinking? That some sort of a sad attempt for one last big job before retirement?

One expects a story that evolves around Willis, but the whole script is adapted and twisted... So the story flies all over the place, and the insane mish-mash of present and far away future features is not doing it any favours. As a movie, I guess its good for a hang-over morning... Press play, and fall asleep once in a while, and watch with half an eye. Thats how much you should invest in this one, because they clearly did not invest enough to make this script coherent and manageable...\n\nBruce Willis career, and him as a person, deserved a better destiny than this... To be used as a commodity and forced into to movies, where he wore an earpiece just to be able to deliver the lines. The people around him saw him as a cash-cow and used him without regret.

This claptrap recycles old Independence Day troupes and doesn't even do a good job of it. Bruce Willis is the same character he plays in every movie- world weary, hard-done-by, ex expert at everything you can name, reluctantly dragged into a catastrophe so he can rescue everyone.

In still images, the sort of armor suits the characters wear look cool, however any time an actor moves, it's clear they're just plastic shells hastily velcro'd onto the actor in some sort of wetsuit.\n\nAll that would be entirely excusable if the actual plot, or characters, or world was engaging.

If you accept it as a made-for-TV movie rather than a blockbuster, you may be more easily look past its limitations.\n\nThe premise of the movie is how should terrains, spacefaring humans, react to first contact with a suspected aggressive alien race. Some movies with such a premise play out the notion of humans being being dominated by the aliens and enslaved, which is what critics love to see. This movie takes an aggressive opposing stance, even more so than Ender's Game, and argues for swift action over weakness.\n\n\"I was late once and so he broke my nose. I was never late again.\"\n\nGeeky Easter eggs exist in the movie, such as the space battleships you see appear to be StarCraft Terran Battlecruisers. It helps to explain the universe without needing to say much at all; something critics would miss.\n\nLike most of Bruce Willis movies these days, they run counter to modern liberal norms. I'm giving this movie a 7/10, as there were some cheesy fight scenes and some of the props looked a bit silly. The story was a bit abrupt at times, which might cause issues for viewers that need things spelled out for them, but I didn't have that issue myself.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed watching it."

Well, the actual performances from Willis, Grillo are pretty good. They've not phoned in their exploits here, but put some effort into good performances. However, in the grand scheme of things it makes little difference. Aside from the aforementioned, Lee, and maybe a couple others, the rest of the cast is really below par and suitably in line with the rest of the already poor production.\n\nThe only thing this film needs is Nick Cage in his current professional guise to finish it off.\n\nI assure you, 2/10 is a very fair score."

It's a campy, shoot em up action Sci-Fi film. Nothing more nothing less. I enjoyed the little banter of it, the action scenes and the plot even more than I thought, no thanks to the reviews.

The CGI is bad. The editing is bad. The majority of the movie takes place in darkness, so they didn't have to spend money on set-pieces. There's an INSANE amount of vignetting, lens flare and vaseline-lens going on as well, which is a huge indicator of a terrible production. Easily 30% of the movie is show with vaseline on the lens, I'm certain of it.\n\nThere's SO MANY things that this movie COULD have done differently to make it seem like it had a bigger budget. Upgrade (2018) is a FANTASTIC example of how to make a sci-fi film with NO budget. I mean Upgrade (2018) had a $3mil budget which is absolutely insane, and if you watched that movie then you'd know that it certainly didn't seem like a shoe-string budgeted movie. Really the fault comes down on the bad director of this movie and just the whole production team as well (since the editing and framing of this movie is terrible too).\n\nThis movie has no real redeemable qualities and I'd HIGHLY recommend that you watch something else instead. This movie is literally a waste of time and the only one who probably benefitted from this experience is Bruce Willis since he can walk away with a cool couple million (although I respect him less as an actor because of this movie now)."

Cheap costumes and sets, hammy dialogue, poor and horrible support cast coupled with a story that is so painfully written and edited that even the z-grade effects and stunts can't save it as being one of those guilty pleasure bad movies. Avoid like the plague or at best watch it during Covid lockdown when you've exhausted all other media options.

If I challenge my 4 yrs old nephew and my 6 yrs old niece to write a Scifi script and make a movie using their neighbors as actors I can guarantee that they would make a better movie. This is so bad that there are no words to describe it. Bad acting(Bruce Willis acts like he has just been dragged out of his bed in the middle of the night) , annoying storyline and dialogs and unbelievably bad special effects (I think the 1966 release Star Trek had better special effects). This movie can't even be used as a parody. I wonder who allowed the release of this piece of garbage.??He should be eliminated from his position."

They were not bad, they were not good, but at least they were OK.\n\nThe sound quality was OK, but music/sounds were at times badly chosen. For example, the sound on top of a fight scene towards the end was a harmonica playing...\n\nThe acting was between OK and bad. The most of the time it was bad. The manuscript and the directing was mostly really bad! Several scenes were more or less over after a few seconds without any build up before, or any follow up afterwards. Leaving the viewer with no explanation to neither why or how things happened!! Several scenes and lines during the movie was just cringeworthy!\n\nDo not make the same mistakes that I did: This movie IS as bad as the rating of 2.5 indicates that it is, and it is NOT worth the time watching it!"

I saw the trailer, read the reviews and thought \"nah, no way Bruce Willis would go down in a fiery crash with his acting career doing below F grade movies.\" Well, I was wrong. So VERY wrong. The reviews here are point on. I wish I could give this a movie a zero. It was the worst crap I've seen all year.\n\nI don't know if Bruce owes someone money or everyone in this film is hurting for cash because of COVID. It sucked BADLY. Seriously save your time and skip this one. It had everything bad that you could think of in a movie.\n\nThe plot was weak and missing any details that would've made this movie somewhat interesting. The actors looked like they didn't care to be there, especially Bruce who seemed drunk or stoned most of the time. Also, the actions of the characters made absolutely no sense \"put your hands up\" to people that are decaying and zombie-looking. What the hell?!\n\nThe editing was nauseating at best. The dialogs, oh god the dialogs were long and boring. Yak yak yak with pointless fillers that only extended the torture of trying to watch this.\n\nThe CGI was mediocre at best. My pre-teen daughter plays with Blender and can do a WAY better job that what they did in this movie for CGI effects. The props were also pretty bad. Someone on here stated their suit of armour looked like plastic. No, it wasn't plastic, more like spray-painted foam with two colored LEDs mounted on each side of their heads. I have a 3D printer and I can make way better props than the ones used in this film. The music kept repeating the same annoying rhythms and drowning out the dialogs at times (may be I should be thankful for that).\n\nI found myself fast forwarding a lot through this movie HOPING for something good, for ANYTHING to redeem this crap that was wasting my precious time, but I was sorely disappointed. I can go on and on about how bad this was but I feel I've ranted enough. Please trust the reviews here, they are right. If not just trust me and avoid this one like the plague."

The bad acting, poor set design, Xbox 360 worthy special effects, shoddy storyline, and otherwise poor example of a sci-fi thriller casting both Frank Grillo and Bruce Willis make Plan 9 from Outer Space look like James Cameron's Avatar. 1 star for Mr. Grillo, 1 star for Mr. Willis, and 1 star for the effort made by the production team rounds out this more than forgiving 3 star review."

        "review_detailed_main": "This might be the worst film of 2021....\n\nA non-sensical story, non-existent characters, cheap visual effects, lazy sound editing, inconsistent production designs, badly edited action scenes and a miserable, half-dead Bruce Willis sleepwalking into another pile of cinematic dirt with even less dignity and charisma than Steven Seagal.\n\nThe plot involved something about space colonization and an army fleet of alien parasites from a distant planet that could wipe out humanity (how original), and Bruce Willis plays a retired general who's called back to help stop this threat (how exciting). I barely remember anything else about the plot but it doubt any of it was important. It was so lazily written that it might as well have been auto-generated by an Xbox 360.\n\nI don't know what anyone was doing or even thinking while they were making this lousy attempt of a film. Every single component of the film just seems so lazy and uninspired that its likely everyone involved was half asleep during the production process. From a technical standpoint its almost as bad as Snyder's Army of the Dead (I honestly don't understand the appeal). The film looks ugly in parts. Like AotD a lot of the background is out of focus, but here it appears to be an attempt to block the cheap production designs. The visual effects had the quality of a 10 year old episode of Doctor Who, and the sound editing was flat and lifeless. This is bad even by DTV standards.\n\nAs for Bruce, what the heck has happened to him?! He looked tired and worn out, like a retired has-been who's desperate for money. There's one line of dialogue that summarizes Bruce's current state. When he puts on an exosuit and one of the characters say that it \"belongs in a museum\", he quips: \"They said the same thing about me.\" And he's not wrong.\n\nJust stay retired Bruce, nobody wants to waste 90 minutes of their time for useless fodder like this."

It's so so bad.\n\nThe script is atrocious, every scene is painful to watch.\n\nI don't know if Bruce Willis could ever really act, he is not acting in this film.. The story is offensive.\n\nThe first encounter the ailens look unworldy and then they are just regular humans with a head twitch.\n\nNine of them, unarmed and walking like zombies take over a military base, the cast then travel 13 lightyears away through space flying only wearing some plastic on their torsos.\n\nAgain, this is not \"so bad it's good\" it's just bad, it's time you will never get back, time that is better spent elsewhere."

Bruce Willis, a shadow of his former action-hero self, sleepwalks through his role as General James Ford, a grizzled military man tasked with saving humanity from an alien threat. Honestly, it's almost painful to watch such a talented actor phone in a performance with such disinterest.\n\nThe problems with \"Cosmic Sin\" are numerous. The dialogue is clunky and exposition-heavy, often relying on tired sci-fi tropes and clich\u00e9s. The characters are paper-thin, lacking any depth or motivation beyond shooting aliens and spouting cheesy one-liners. And the plot, oh, the plot! It's a convoluted mess that jumps between scenes with reckless abandon, leaving the audience bewildered and disoriented. One minute they're on a spaceship, the next they're teleporting to a random planet that looks suspiciously like a quarry in rural England.\n\nBut here's the thing: amidst all the chaos and absurdity, \"Cosmic Sin\" possesses a strange, almost hypnotic quality. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, you can't look away even though you know it's going to be a disaster. The film's sheer incompetence becomes a source of amusement, a testament to the depths of cinematic depravity that filmmakers can reach.\n\nSo, if you're in the mood for a truly terrible movie experience, one that will make you laugh, groan, and question the very fabric of reality, then \"Cosmic Sin\" is the perfect choice. Just grab some popcorn, gather your friends, and prepare to embark on a journey into the cinematic abyss. But be warned, you might need a strong drink afterwards to cleanse your palate."

Unless you wanted to try to beat it, this is a waste of time. To involve him and make him the prime poster cover when really he's just a cameo most of the movie, is poor salesmanship. You would have been better to try a Fifth Element 2 than this Jason X meets Riddick.\n\nThe directing was just awful, the lines were COMPLETELY unbelieveable from the start.

It rambles and stumbles it's way across the screen like an alien bug shot so full of plot holes that it's raining blood and bad lines till it finally collapses in a fit of flatulence, writhing on the theater floor, spilled popcorn and milk duds scattering in all directions, like sparks from a broken dynamo. The green screen, is cheep, the FX only add to the unrealism, there is no sense of immersiveness, and Bruce delivers his worst performance since Hudson Hawk.

Bruce Willis is in it yes.. but I was sure he could act ? Right ? And then there are a few B grade actors as well as some who look like other actors. The scripting was perhaps the worst I have ever seen. They clearly had a budget so why not make a half decent movie ?
