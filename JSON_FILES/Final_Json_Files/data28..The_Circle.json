They create a scene, introduce characters, start the narrative and then, out of nowhere, it just ends.\n\nDid the crew forget a bunch of pages from the script in the printer?\n\nAnother question is, how is it a thriller? Maybe back in 2017 the scene in itself was horrifying (no it was not). Anyways, here on Earth in 2023 companies as the Circle are mandane and the whole set up is not enough to thrill anyone.\n\nI loved Karen Gillan here, heck, the whole cast was good, the idea and teased moral is timeless, but the plot is a total mess. It's a pity though because it felt like it led somewhere."

There isn't a single moment that has you on edge or wondering what's coming next, because everything is as blatant and simplistic as it could be. There's nothing novel about any of the characters or the major plot points. What is worse, the script just can't stop preaching:\n\n\"losing all our privacy is bad...mmkay?\"\n\n\"big corporations shouldn't spy on us all the time...mmkay?\"\n\n\"sacrificing your personal life in the name of a morally dubious career can have regrettable repercussions...mmkay?\"\n\n-NO SH!T movie!

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the near future \"The Circle\" tells a horror story of the social media age involving an omnipotent American corporate, pitched somewhere between being Facebook-like and Google-like (note, lawyers, I just said \"like\"!) Emma Watson (\"Beauty and the Beast\") plays young intern Mae who, partly through the aid of family friend Annie (Karen Gillan, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Doctor Who\") but mostly through her own aptitude, lands a foothold job in customer services for the company. With the lush corporate campus fast becoming home, Mae is quickly singled out as having \"executive potential\" by the charismatic CEO Bailey (Tom Hanks, \"Bridge of Spies\") and his more taciturn sidekick Stenton (US comedian Patton Oswalt).\n\nProgressively brainwashed into believing the company's intrusive snooping (a favourite motto is \"Secrets are Lies\") is all for 'the greater good', Mae champions the cause until a tragedy rocks her world and her company beliefs to the core.\n\nWhenever I watch a film I tend to form my own opinion first before checking out what the 'general public' on IMDb think. In this case, I must confess to being a bit surprised at our divergence of views: a lot of people clearly hated this movie whereas I confess that I found it very entertaining. Certainly with the alleged role of Russia in influencing elections around the world via social media, the film is most certainly topical! Many reviewers seemed quite upset that Watson's character is such a 'doormat', in that her views are so easily manipulated by the corporate machine. But not every woman \u2013 as indeed every man \u2013 can or should be a Joan of Arc style role model in every film: why should they be?\n\nI actually found her indoctrination into \"the Circle way\" as quite convincing, especially a creepy scene where two corporate lackies (Cho Smith and Amir Talai) say that they're not checking up on Mae's social life, but\u0085. Watson enjoys extending her post-Potter repertoire well, but the talented John Boyega (\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\") is completely wasted in his role as Ty; the Wozniak-like genius behind The Circle's technology. The script gives him very little to do other than stand around and look grumpy.\n\nThe film is sad in being the last movie appearance of the great Bill Paxton (\"Apollo 13\") who plays Mae's sick father and who died of complications following heart surgery two months before the film's release (the film is dedicated \"For Bill\"). Tragically, Mae's mother in the film, actress Glenn Headly (\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\") also died suddenly at the age of 62, also due to heart problems, a couple of months after the film's release. It's surprising the film doesn't have a \"curse of The Circle\" tag on it.\n\nThe film was directed by James Ponsoldt, who also wrote the screenplay with novel-writer Dave Eggers (\"Away We Go\"). I particularly liked the on-screen use of captioning (posts) which was reminiscent to me of last year's \"Nerve\", a B-movie film I rated highly that also had a string social media theme.\n\nWhile the ending of the film is a bit twee \u2013 a movie definition of \"being hoisted by your own petard\" \u2013 it's overall a thought provoking piece sufficiently close to the truth as to where society is going to raise the hairs on your neck.\n\n(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

To be fair, they are doing the best they could with what they were given. Some say execution is bad but concept was good; I agree to some extent but even the concept was not even fully fleshed out. The motivation, growth, actions, etc. of the main characters make no sense. Add to that bad writing and directing because they blew their budget on big name actors and seemingly let film school dropouts take care of the rest, and you get this mess."

        "review_title": "Full of endless circular logic and irony",
        "review_detailed_main": "Director James Ponsoldt's The Circle depicts the story of a not-so-distant future, or perhaps an alternative present, in which one company dominates digital media, data gathering, and surveillance services. Based upon the four-year-old novel by author Dave Eggers, you'll notice some stark similarities between this motion picture narrative and the smash hit TV series Black Mirror. The biggest difference between the two is that The Circle is fast-faced and poorly written whereas Black Mirror is a slow-burning but well-written anthology series. In addition to the similarities between the aforementioned, there are certainly elements of The Truman Show in this movie as well. With a powerhouse cast, brilliant composer (Danny Elfman), and excellent editing, The Circle appears to have what a blockbuster needs; however, the hollow characters, poor character development, fractured subplots, and overall diegesis hold the film back from reaching the impact that it could have had. Having taken a digital media and privacy class in graduate school, and published a few articles, this is a film that I was looking forward to in order to analyze how the social commentary or commentary on the human condition regarding reasonable expectations of privacy and big data were integrated into the plot. Sadly, the screenplay was not strong or developed significantly enough to provide big data and privacy discussions.\n\nMae Holland (Emma Watson) hates her job at the water company, so she is incredibly excited when her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) lands Mae an interview at The Circle, the world's most powerful technology and social media company. Mae's fear of unfulfilled potential impresses the recruiters at The Circle and she lands the opportunity of a lifetime. After Mae puts herself into harm's way but rescued, thanks to The Circle's newest surveillance and data gathering system, she is encouraged by the company founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) to take a more active role in technology development by participating in an experiment that puts Mae's life on display for the world (in the vein of The Truman Show) to see. Once Mae turns on that camera, she has more \"friends\" than she ever imagined and becomes an instant online celebrity. Unfortunately, this decision will affect those closest to Mae and the negative ramifications will reach far beyond her inner circle and begin to impact humanity at large. Sometimes, people just don't want to be found or be \"social.\"\n\nFor all The Circle has going for it, the weak screenplay keeps it from being the blockbuster that it so desperately wants to be. A great movie typically begins with solid writing, and that is what's missing here. After five minutes (or so it seems) of opening title logos, perhaps that is indirect evidence that there were just too many hands in the pot, each trying to take the movie's narrative in a different direction. Much like Frozen plays off like two different movies crudely sewn together, The Circle appears to be one movie for the first two acts, but takes an unexpected and unfulfilling turn in the third. A couple of conspicuous unanswered questions come after Mae meets TrueYou designer and founder Ty (John Boyega). He designed the platform that launched The Circle. At one point he asks Mae to meet him in a secret tunnel (where all the servers are stored) and tells her that \"it's worse than I thought.\" Great opportunity to introduce intrigue, suspense, and more. The problem is that the audience is never told what Ty finds or what happens with what he found. You can remove that whole subplot and the movie remains the same. There are other subplots that are nicely introduced, but never carried out as well. Any or all of them can be removed and the film proceeds the same. Not good. If you can remove several subplots or unfulfilled turning points and the film's diegesis remain largely untouched, then you have poor writing. The third act in and of itself leaves audiences with a hurried ending that does little to provide closure to the narrative; however, it does support the film's circular logic and irony. Hardly satisfying.\n\nIn terms of the allegory here, The Circle is a Google-like company with Apple's technology. Eamon Bailey is a Steve Jobs type innovator with characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Eric Schmidt. Thankfully, The Circle does not represent any one company, but rather combines all the most notable innovations and technological achievements of Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and more into one globally dominating company. Antitrust issues are introduced early on, but again, that's never fully developed. The movie highlights many issues faced by private citizens, governments, and digital data driven companies today; therefore, it sets the foundation for a movie that could have been thought-provoking, but the writing hinders that ability. The irony in the movie is for every digital answer to streamlining services or bolstering conveniences, a little privacy is eroded each time. Pretty soon, if one shares enough information, the idea of privacy is extinct. Privacy was central to the plot, but it just wasn't handled in the most effective way. Concepts such as \"off the grid,\" self-proclaimed \"celebrity,\" and \"calls to action\" are displayed and discussed in the film, connecting this augmented reality to real-world issues each of us encounter or think about. One particularly interesting theme in the movie is deep friendship. Unfortunately, this was not fully fleshed as is the case with most of the movie; but still, it does get touched upon.\n\nIf you were hoping for another film like the brilliant Social Network, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed. Films such as The Circle should be memorable, but unfortunately this one is very much forgettable. Coincidentally, the movie itself is as hollow as the plot and characters.\n\nWritten by R.L.

Now I'm reading many poor reviews and wondering why?\n\nThis film won't set your world on fire or win an Oscar for best actress etc, but the message is compelling.\n\nTaking a spin on how much data we give away to companies like Google, Amazon or Apple, The Circle focuses on privacy and our right to it, or lack of rights to it, in modern society.\n\nThe interesting take from this is that my children and I have differing views on the value of sharing on social media; after watching the film the 14 year old was a lot more aware of the issues around making our lives so public.\n\nThis film doesn't deserve an Oscar, but it does deserve better reviews than it has received. Sure, you can pick holes in some of the plot, but its message is strong. It was fantastic to watch Tom Hanks in a role not based on a true story, with a hint of menace to his character. Bill Paxton's final ever role before his sad passing is touching, and Emma Watson was interesting in her portrayal of Mae Holland.\n\nIf you're looking for something different to watch, ignore the reviews and give this a go."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was a big fan of Dave Eggers' A Hologram for the King. It was a fantastic read for enjoyment and to analyze. The film adaptation also did not disappoint. When The Circle was announced as a film I immediately checked out the book. To my disappointment, the film wasn't as interesting an got to bogged down to its technological ventures and wasn't exactly the best read. However, I held out hope that the film would be able to impress, especially with the star studded cast at the helm.\n\nEmma Watson plays Mae Holland an ambitious young customer service rep who joins The Circle, a cutting edge technology based company that seems to be growing at fast pace and changing the future. The thing is, the technological leap of the company leads to massive privacy concerns and the company seems to be capable of more than what initially meets the eye. First off, I will say that the scathing reviews I've seen for the film are somewhat unwarranted, however the film is far from perfect and could have been much better.\n\nThe plot may seem like its minimal or nonexistent but this wasn't really my concern. I was more concerned with things being introduced into the film that have no real importance later in the film. John Boyega's character is a glorified cameo that seems to just be there as a big name. In the book the character is mysterious has a much larger effect on Mae's life. The ending of the film leaves much more to be desired; there needed to be more explanation onto what the reveal was and anything about repercussions.\n\nThe film is littered with talented people but unfortunately the writing and the structure of the film really lets them down. Its a misfire really, and the film needed to be much better and have a stronger central message. I feel like parts of the film and scenes were left on the cutting room floor. The film isn't exactly terrible but its most certainly unfulfilled and really could have left a stronger impression.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this movie yesterday, left very disappointed. I read some of the reviews so I wasn't expecting too much, but it was even worse than I had thought it would be. The writing was utterly terrible, the plot was poorly done, and even the acting was only decent, a surprising result considering the well-known cast. The overall concept of The Circle initially sounds interesting, but when explored in depth and presented through the film, multiple flaws can be found and at times, it almost seems \"stupid\". As the movie progresses, the main character's choices and actions seem contradictory to how she was introduced, and it becomes hard for the audience to relate to her and put themselves in her shoes. By the end of the movie, it became quite clear that The Circle had hoped to offer some profound social commentary on technology and human behaviour, but ultimately failed to do so by creating such a predictable and \"cheesy\" film. The dialogue was almost laughable at times, and there wasn't a single character that felt complex or real. While somewhat entertaining due to the futuristic depictions of technology and fast-paced plot, The Circle offers little more than that. Rather than provoke discussion or any deep thoughts after viewing, it leaves you with a large sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the way in which the writing and the story were carried out, as well as frustration with the immense amount of plot holes and motive flaws. Overall, The Circle tries to make a name for itself amongst the many \"dangers of technology\" movies, but as always, lazy writing and a poor and predictable plot can only lead to the disappointing result it ends up being. See The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 instead. Anything else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robbie K back, after being off the grid for a week. Tonight's review is on the latest \"dystopian\" feature film called The Circle. Former Hermione Granger, and more recently Belle, Emma Watson leads the film as she attempts to take us into the workings of a technological conglomerate who has knowledge as its key principle. Yet the trailers paint a much darker secret hidden in its stony walls, one that promises to be a real nail biter. Will this movie deliver those thrills, or are we stuck with another wash out? I'll do my best to answer that question, so sit back, and please read my latest thoughts.\n\nLIKES:\n\n\u0095 Nice tool development \u0095 Emma Watson \u0095 Culturally Relevant Film \u0095 Solid Moral Lesson\n\nSummary: We all know technology is becoming the heart of the world, if not already the heart of this country. And certainly, we all know that these technological marvels often require laborious development and maintenance to get the bugs out. The Circle portrays this very well, helping to develop the very tool that we all love. Throughout the journey, you'll get to see the development of the two-faced beast that is technology, and how it requires tweaking to get just \"right\". Not the highest selling point for a movie, but pretty cool.\n\nOf course, we all know many are going to go for the lovely Ms. Watson, to support the super actress they adore. Good news, Watson does a solid job holding up most of the movie, as she is primary the only main character of the film. Watson brings her charm to the screen once more, portraying intelligence, fortitude and inspiration in a manner that many will latch on to. Her accent is pretty sound (though it fluctuates at times), but she manages to deliver her lines with a decent balance of emotion, to sell her points\u0085 most of the time.\n\nYet the biggest strength of these movies is how culturally relevant it is to the audience. If you didn't gleam it from the trailers, The Circle is essentially a modernized version of the novel 1984 that once more addresses the issues of control, life sharing, and privacy. The film is certainly very political, but has a number of powerful lessons to teach about the place of technology and how easily it can be twisted. I myself liked the comments from Emma's followers, a fantastic representation of the shallow, superficial, and often selfish focus that the internet provides. The scenes are well developed to deliver the full emotional punch, which while not the most unique, can really shock you to the core at how true it can be.\n\nDISLIKES: \u0095 Cheesy acting at times \u0095 Other actors diluted \u0095 Missed character development \u0095 Ignorant/Idiotic moments \u0095 Lack of Suspense\n\nSummary: Despite Watson's strong performance, she is involved in some overly cheesy moments. On many of the emotionally heated moments, she loses her balance and stretches into the overdramatic region, losing her accent and dialogue forte in the process. But even her worst acting doesn't hold a candle to some of the supporting characters who give either emotionally dull deliveries or lackluster performances. These moments are noticeable enough to offset the momentum of the movie, and derailing it from the quality the trailers promised.\n\nAn even worse quality for me was how the other actors of the star-studded cast were reduced to simplistic roles. Legends like Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt and even the late Bill Paxton are reduced to very linear roles, with little character development or expansion beyond what you've seen in the trailer. With such a strong cast, I can't help but feel disappointed at the missed potential of this movie and how much this all-star cast could have done to amp up the quality of this movie.\n\nEven worse, some of the characters, primarily Emma Watson's character, become so blindly ignorant that the intelligence they worked so hard building is diluted to an idiotic level. As a result, I found myself starting to loathe the character and how 180 they took the character. Yes, I understand the premise behind the movie, but it didn't work for me. Other characters also fell into this mix as well, each built to have this incredible skill that was either not used or rapidly reversed to make the characters seem weak.\n\nYet the most disappointing aspect of this movie\u0085is the lack of suspense. The trailer made this film out to be a mystery meeting dystopian policing. Not the case at all. The Circle has no mystery, laying all the facts on the table and leaving little to be uncovered. You would think there would be intense moments of espionage, or policing by superiors to build up excitement, right? Sorry, this film doesn't have that either, with the \"exciting climax\" not showing up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As such, the movie is pretty dull and lacks the entertainment quality you might have been seeking.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nThe Circle is indeed a \"scary\" film, but it's mainly due to the reality check provides concerning the dangers technology can provide. This strong message is certainly the strongest aspect of the movie and Emma Watson was a fantastic choice to deliver it. Unfortunately, the weak characters, diluted roles, and lack of suspense took away from the entertainment quality of the movie. Such a dull delivery, leaves me recommending this one for renting at home, or at least recommending you read the book (or books) it is based on.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nDrama/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Circle is a movie based on a novel by Dave Eggers. It stars Emma Watson and Tom Hanks and it's set in a near future where they have this company called The Circle which is pretty much like Google, but even bigger. Emma Watson stars as Mae Holland, a young woman who gets a job in the company, but when she sees what the company really is doing, which side will she take?\n\nI have read the novel and even though it was flawed, it was an interesting read, so I was kinda excited about the movie. The movie isn't perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as everyone says. I didn't find it boring at all, you just need to get invested in the story and know that this is not your typical dystopian story. This really shows what life might be like one day, so not much major events happen. That made it feel a bit more realistic, but it also made it feel a bit forgettable. That's the biggest flaw of this film. It makes quite an impact on you when you finish watching it and you won't be able to stop thinking about it for the next few hours. But that's more because of the message, not because of the movie itself. But that message will get under your skin. You will shiver during some scenes in the second half and especially at the last shot. And the creepiest thing about it is how easily a large percentage of humanity could be tricked by propaganda. That's extremely well shown in Eamon Bailey, the charismatic leader of the organization played by Tom Hanks. He's smart, he's funny, he's down-to-earth, and he's very likable. And that's the scariest thing. He's one of those people who would probably manage to talk you into killing yourself in less than 5 minutes. He's such a charismatic presence and Hanks was the perfect choice for the role. Regardless of his plans for the future, you just can't hate this guy! That's how easily we can be brainwashed and the movie warns us about a lot of things going on in the world right now. When you finish it, you will think a lot about the points this movie made. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I also like how they eliminated some extremely unnecessary subplots from the book and made the story a lot more straightforward without any distractions.\n\nOverall, even though it's not amazing, I recommend this film simply for the message itself. It's really not that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE CIRCLE is the suffocating novel written by Dave Eggers who co-wrote the screenplay with director James Ponsoldt. It is difficult to classify the genre \u2013 it is not science fiction because it is more reportage of the IT control of our lives. It is not a coming of age novel because that bracket of time (moving from child into adulthood) has been usurped by texting and social media, it most assuredly is not a love story, and it is not an apocalypse tale \u2013 because it if about things as they are at the present. THE CIRCLE is about mind control, the extinguishing of privacy that is growing daily, and the stepping away from life as we know it into life as it is so very rapidly becoming \u2013 public property and available for manipulation by government and the wealthy powers that can purchase the future illegally.\n\nWhen Mae (Emma Watson) is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. Her parents (mother Glenne Headly who cares for her deteriorating multiple sclerosis husband Bill Paxton) encourage Mae to explore her possibilities to gain employment that can help the dwindling healthcare resources (sound familiar?). Mae finds an entry into the high tech CIRCLE through friend Annie (Karen Gillan) and as she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes, begin to affect the lives and future of her friends (especially Mercer as portrayed by Ellar Coltrane), family and that of humanity. Ultimately Mae's courage and enlightenment result in a dramatic ending that shares at least a ray f hope that such a mind and privacy explosion may have a means to end \u2013 or that may just be wishful thinking: money controls.\n\nThe story would be more interesting (it certainly is well acted) if it were just a possibility resulting form our obsession with IT. But actually it is too close to the truth to respond in any other manner but a deep breath and a sigh that this is where we already are."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Circle is one of those movies that once the general audience has time for their minds to wrap around the concept of this movie, then it has a chance at higher ratings and better reviews.\n\nIt was not want I expected, and yet I left with the sense that I could engage in a three hour philosophical discussion about the movie.\n\nIt lacks your typical \"antagonist\" or rather, the \"antagonist\" is not what you thought or would expect in a typical thriller. And the antagonist may not be so much of a person as it is a concept or idea that goes too far or in the wrong direction but is not in and of itself bad.\n\nThe conclusion of the film did not resolve how I would have predicted having seen the trailers. But, I won't go there so as not to spoil the movie.\n\nYou may be hesitant to see this movie, and you may not like it after having seen the movie - but none-the-less, it is still worth seeing and hopefully *maybe* you will leave the theatre thinking if you are that type of person.\n\nIts like going to an art show. I, as an amateur, would go hoping to be \"wowed\" by the typical entertaining pieces - the ones that make sense to me. However, I can easily over look a masterpiece because I do not take the time and focus to look deeper and past the non-traditional.\n\nAll that being said, the acting was a little strange, which makes some of the interactions awkward. But in hindsight, it kind of makes sense because the \"circle\" is all about community and engaging with your community. And, so some of the social interactions can be \"odd\". So if I compare it to the basic formula and standard quality of movie entertainment that money pushes out there, I could easily overlook a possible deeper element.\n\nOr maybe I'm just being ridiculous and looking too deep into this movie.\n\nThere were some intense moments. But, not so much of what you would think of in a thriller. This is not a cat-and-mouse dystopian type thriller where your life is at stake.\n\nSo, maybe you would like it - like I did. Maybe you won't. Maybe it will take a while for the concept of this movie to catch up to everyone who didn't feel entertained. Either way, worth a shot."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, does the movie have flaws? Yes. As others have said, there's not a lot of depth to the characters, but the movie is clearly about the topic of the effects of too much technology in our lives. This movie is less about the characters and more about the point. If you want to know Watson's or Hank's character, then the movie will disappoint. If you want a movie about the insidious nature of technology, then this may be more up your alley.\n\nSome people have said the movie is predictable. The predictability of the movie meshes well with the point the movie is making. Everyone is looking for depth, but missing the obvious. Ever heard the saying, \"Can't see the forest for the trees\"? Technology is seeping into every aspect of our lives to the point where we are offering up our privacy for convenience and a few cheap thrills. People worry about Big Brother, but give up personal data on Facebook and through Google and Amazon products and services. More data is available to the public than you may realize, even when you \"up\" your privacy settings. Since these companies have access to ALL of your data, imagine what they have figured out about you. This movie touches on those points and the pressure people are subjected to to participate in the sharing of one's personal information to be a part of the circle, or worse yet, the inner circle - the ultimate in over-divulging of your personal info. People need privacy. To expose everything is inhuman and not congruent with any species on this planet.\n\nSome of the reviews here reveal how young the reviewers are. If some of these people were aware of George Orwell, Soylant Green (mentioned in the film, though I suspect not followed-up on by the reviewers), and even some early 90's \"corporations run the world\"-sci-fi films, they would probably appreciate the prophetic nature of this film as it is a modern day continuation of the theme. The theme, however, is not just fiction, IT IS happening. This film it is worth watching and is not as dull or trite as many of the reviewers say it is."

Will this technology make us a better and happier society? You'll have to draw your own conclusions. Do we really need every aspect of our lives monitored by A.I.? My question to you is are you a better and happier person now that we have all of this technology? Personally, I don't think so.\n\nThis movie doesn't need an Oscar or other award, and it certainly hasn't received them. Yes, at times it dragged on and got a little boring. I wanted to watch it because it was Bill Paxton's last movie before his untimely death. I think the message is loud and clear. You're either going to think all the technology and privacy issues is wonderful for society or think as I do that it's not. I suggest you keep an open mind."

        "review_detailed_main": "Last weekend, I went to see the circle. Now, after thinking about the movie for almost an entire week I can say that I am ready to write a review. I give this movie a 7-7.5 because I did enjoy and like it, but it wasn't perfect and I did have questions. My main problem was that the movie was too short, and I think it didn't do a proper job explaining everything to us. Now, don't get me wrong, I think it's great when the audience is left wondering, left with questions. But The Circle left me with too many.\n\nI'm going to start with the characters/actors. First, obviously, Mae Holland/Emma Watson. I really liked Mae. She was a smart, likable character. All she wanted to do was what was right. She was nice, and had a vision for the future. Then she had her flaws, making her a very relatable character. Emma Watson did an amazing job portraying her. When I watched the movie, I did not see Emma Watson, I saw Mae Holland. Next, Eamon Bailey/Tom Hanks. While I wasn't a huge fan of Eamon Bailey, Tom Hanks did a very good job playing the part. I feel like the character was very well done, and so was the acting job. Next, Ty/John Boyega. This is where I run into problems. I think John Boyega did a great job on the role, but the role of Ty itself isn't a great one to play. I thought the character of Ty had potential, but he really didn't do much. In fact, he was hardly more than an extra to me. And the way he met, then instantly trusted Mae was unbelievable, I feel like it would have been much better if they had had more time to get to know one another. Finally, Annie/Karen Gillian. Karen Gillian did a beautiful acting job, which I think made Annie a better character than I would otherwise think. At the start of the movie, Annie is on top of things, a bright, bubbly, hard worker. Then she suddenly changes personality, and I don't know why. I wish it would have explained what had pushed her over the edge.\n\nThe movie itself was good and enjoyable, but could have been even better if it had been a bit longer and explained more. I thought it was well paced and I was excited to find out what comes next, but then the movie suddenly ended without a real conclusion, and I was left shocked and confused. I have mixed views on the ending because 1. It shows how the story continues, and symbolizes the statement of an ending is a new beginning or 2. I was questioning what exactly happened and what was going to happen and I was a little bit upset.\n\nOverall I do recommend to go and watch The Circle because it is a movie that really makes you think because there was no black and white. Instead, it showed how both sides had positive and negatives. The acting is very well done and I did have a good time watching the movie. It was only when the movie was over and I was left to think about it that I started to have questions and concerns."

It all seems a huge d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: the promising and smart girl from a humble setting, a bigger-than-anyone company, a dark side (roughly shown by an under-exploited Boyega), the struggle with all of this. Being The Circle marketed as a thriller, audience is meant to be thrilled, at some point; this hardly ever happens; being marketed as a dystopian picture, The Circle certainly has some suggestive elements but fails to mix them smoothly. Its lazy effort is to take problems we are already struggling with -such as loss of privacy, invasive social media and their influence on politics, appalling need for control- and push them a little further in a not-so-far future without making a good or even consistent plot out of it, not to mention a solid message. It's fairly normal to walk out the theater a bit disappointed by seeing a movie with such great talent wasted in a muddy, eyebrow-raising subject that is just as inane as its tagline: 'Knowing is good, but knowing everything is better.'"

The story about the danger of lack of privacy in a world permanently monitored and controlled by a powerful corporation is shallow and silly. The theme could have been better explored since we are close of this dangerous situation of living under surveillance of growing number cameras in the great cities under the argument of governments of improving safety and protection of the citizens. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O C\u00edrculo\" (\"The Circle\")"

Points can be made in natural, moving and realistic ways without feeling forced, contrived or simply to serve a point. Everything in The Circle feels so manufactured and forced the whole way through, constantly hammering away at this whole sense of social media indulgence and how it impacts us. That concept isn't even new or interesting by the time this came out and the performances are never well deserved. It's just so frustrating having nonsense spoon-fed to us for nearly two hours all for just a super underwhelming ending that reminds me of the old Scooby Doos when the gang would rip the mask off the ghosts.\n\nThe Circle is just a bad, preachy and super annoying experience only made worse by the absurd amount oof talent on screen that's still somehow inadequate when it comes to actually creating an engaging product. Super annoying, don't watch this nonsense, especially when there's so much better out there."

From the God awful American accent of Hermione to the writer's seeming total lack of knowledge of how computers and the internet work. This movie was more laughable than Eagle Eye with Shia LeBeouf. The movie where he is being chased by cranes in empty construction lots. Computers are not magical. They don't do what the Circle seems to think they can do. First, just because they came out with a cheap camera for the public does not in anyway explain how there are cameras every where on the planet. How about the scene where the guy is being chased by the circlers and crashes his car off a bridge. They don't even try to explain that. How did the cameras chase him onto a bridge? How did the camera get inside his car? How did a drone chase him for miles? How did no one get charged with a crime for running him off a bridge? What a joke! This script is Swiss cheese. I would like to give the writer and director together and clunk their heads together 3 stooges style. If you want to punish yourself...watch this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, I felt like this movie makes fun of start-ups and of big data, analytics in general.\n\nI know what big data is. I use big data. I know what the quantified self movement is and how it works. I know how Facebook captures data from each user and sells it to advertisers and I must say that this movie dramatizes this dramatically. It is the kind of movie that prays on uninformed audiences by taking something they are familiar with (take social media), throwing some concepts that they may know about (analytics) and then making it look like analytics are the equivalent of a nuclear weapon.\n\nI found that \u0085 sad. It is not that the world will not head there, it will, but anyone who actually worked in this field will roll his eyes. This movie is about as accurate about how web start-ups work and how information is collected as Rambo is about the Vietnam war. It is based on some truth but it is more the type you'd read into a tabloid newspaper than on Tech Crunch.\n\nAnd personally, I simply hate it when this happens - when something is taken and then dramatized in almost an obscene manner just to evoke an emotional reaction from the audience. It reminds me of the Cold War and how everything was portrayed as a caricature of good and evil, capitalism vs communism, smarts vs muscle and so on.\n\nThat being said, the movie itself was not that bad. Watson is a great actress and she carries her role well. Tom Hanks's role is a bit exaggerated and that sucks. Everyone else falls somewhere in between. This is the strange part, Watson actually portrays a living, 3D, believable character while the others fall into some stereotype or another. It is like the script writer finished the main character and then got bored and decided to go for 2D characters instead.\n\nThe ending is anti-climatic as hell and while it is supposed to provide some form of poetic justice, it falls flat. \"HOW\" is the big question as while it has some basis in the plot, it feels a huge lot like a deus ex machina, like a last minute plot device used to turn things right and make the audience feel warm and fuzzy. If they would have cut the movie 15 minutes later, I swear, it would have deserved an Oscar for the bleak end but by ending it as they did \u0085 for me, they've made a movie that required suspension of disbelief become what that is \u0085 not believable. Period.\n\nSo feel free to check it out but keep in mind that while everything said there is true, in reality, we're about 25 - 30 years away from even having the capacity to do this, not to mention use it. This is not a documentary, it is a cash grab designed to capitalize on our fear of losing our privacy in the Internet of things world."

        "review_title": "Hollow Characters On Top Of Bad Acting On Top Of Bad Dialogue Makes \"The Circle\" A Surprinsgly Forgettable Movie With Huge Potential And No Payoff",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Circle\" star Emma Watson, Tom Hanks, John Boyega, and Karen Gillian is about Mae Holland (Emma Watson) who lands a dream job at a powerful technology company called \"The Circle\" fronted by Tom Hanks, and she discovers that this company is really not what they say they are.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a movie full of potential. It stars Emma Watson who is fresh off a great performance in \"Beauty And The Beast,\" so I was excited to see if they would jump-start her acting career again. Luckily this movie is getting a wider release than some of her other films that have flown under the radar between Harry Potter and Beauty And The Beast, so maybe directors will get a chance to look at her realize her potential right? I'll come back to her in a minute.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a good idea. It is a relevant topic for the society that we live in today. We are so immersed in this technology-based world now where we ourselves even wonder about some of the scenarios the film portrays, and that's the biggest praise I can give this film. Other than that, this film is a sloppy mess full of dull characters, really bad dialogue, and poor acting.\n\nOther than those flaws, there is one core problem with this movie. This movie tries so hard to raise questions for the viewer, which it does, but never reaches the heights necessary to answer these questions. I fully understood the movie. It's just that the central theme of this movie (whether or not we are secretly being watched, if we need to know the difference between public and private) never hammers these thoughts into your brain the way it should.\n\nThere is a subplot that is introduced in this movie, and it goes nowhere. It was almost like the movie was on cruise control but sped past the exit you needed to get off at. That whole subplot is just brushed under the rug and forgotten about.\n\nThe acting is really bad in the movie. Emma Watson is fine, though I am still waiting for her to give us that Oscar worthy performance that I know she's capable of. I will say that I thought her performance improved as the movie went on, but there were times at the beginning when i thought her performance was a little wooden. John Boyega is good in the three scenes he is in. That's right, three scenes. He only gets three scenes to shine. To me this is just a filler movie for him to keep busy in between \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Last Jedi,\" but I wanted to see more of him. Karen Gillan annoyed the hell out of me in \"Guardians Of The Galaxy,\" she annoyed the hell out of me in this, and rumor has it, she's annoying in \"Gaudrians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.\" So yeah my tolerance level with her is gone. The rest of the supporting cast is awful. There's this character named Mercer and the actor that plays him looks like he never acted a day in his life. Then when Tom Hanks is on screen you look at him and think to yourself \"oh, so this is what acting is like.\"\n\nThe characters in this film are literally some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen. The main character Mae is hollow. There's nothing to her. She has no arc whatsoever. I just don't buy the fact that a girl with her intellect would just walk into this big conglomerate, look around, and think everything is going to be okay. No, just no. Put it this way. If Google and Facebook had a kid and that kid took a bunch of anabolic steroids... that's the company The Circle. If I walked into that place the moment I walked in I would think \"well this place looks super shady. Peace out homies!\" Her character rises to the top of the ladder in the company so quick you wonder how she got there. They don't show it, so how did it happen. John Boyega's character had nothing to him, he went nowhere, I didn't care. Tom Hanks, you knew he was gonna be this shady villain but hide it for the majority of the movie, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nThis movie played out the way I expected it to. Woman gets a job at a tech company. She enjoys her time, she rises to the top, finds out they're shady and exposes them. This movie is predictable, the acting is awful save for Watson, Boyega, and Hanks. The writing is all over the place. There's no characters, and the characters that we get have little to no development. Subplots are introduced and those end up going nowhere. Overall you're better just waiting for \"The Circle\" to stream for free.\n\nI am going to give \"The Circle\" a 3.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mae starts her new job at the circle, a tech company reminiscent of Google and Apple. Just like many Silicon Valley companies, 'The Circle' sees itself as more than just bringing technology to the people, it tries to change the world, wanting to make it a more open, sharable and accountable place. As Mae gets sucked into the community of 'The Circle', she realizes that she has to give up more and more of her privacy...\n\nThe Circle is very much like the TV series Black Mirror, a movie that skillfully asks you to be afraid of the near future, not the distant future. The technology displayed is already there, it's just a matter of how it is used and how power is centralized, who has access to private data and all that\u2014issues that we are already facing today. In that sense, The Circle is timely and the questions it poses are very relevant to us today.\n\nAs a movie, The Circle definitely has its flaws, mostly in terms of plot structure and character development. A few characters are deeply underexplored, with some characters being introduced that later on play almost no role. There is a sense that everything will move towards an epic conclusion, but in the end, a lot of threads are simply left hanging, with no satisfactory resolution. Some characters change their opinion rather abruptly, and in particular our main protagonist, Mae, is a bit difficult to read and her motifs are not always clear.\n\nDespite these issues, I found that The Circle was quite enjoyable. As a fan of techno, I loved the beautiful electronic score, and I loved the general sunny \"Bay Area\" feel to the whole piece. Cinematographically, this is a well done movie all throughout.\n\nAll in all, a decent-to-good movie that could have been a masterpiece with a better script... but that is still entertaining nonetheless and will definitely get you thinking about the future of technology, social media and privacy."

This isn't an amazing movie by any means, but I thought the chosen tone was great. Dark dystopian setpieces a la Brazil may be more cinematic, but this seems much closer to the hell on earth we could potentially experience in a world with less and less privacy and increasing surveillance."

Apparently half the world doesn't care about privacy or giving their life away to data-collection, and are probably more interested in sticking their nose in a cell phone and texting away than giving any real thought to what's happening in the world.

Lazy disappointing and horrible story. Its a shame too because the premise was really promising.

So I was eager to watch this film.\n\nWhat... a.... disaster.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed: its pacing issues, which are generally attributed to choppy, poor video editing. The fecal storm was piled onto by absolutely horrific acting by Emma Watson and most of the supporting cast. Even Tom Hanks looks out of place and like he is going through the motions in this one. One of the most painful moments in the film is when Emma Watson's character capitulates to some weird ideas overnight and her once-stable and supportive best friend suddenly becomes a malicious goth mess overnight. Neither one of them pulls it off well. It was partly the fault of an atrocious script that forced them to make a complete 180 in their characters.\n\nWhen directing teachers teach you how to make a film they emphasize that you should make a few thousand dollars look like you spent one million dollars. Well, this film looks like a young, inexperienced upstart had a multi-million dollar budget out of the gate.\n\nAside from some fairly good comedic moments (and I don't think that this film was designed as a comedy) it's an absolute disaster. I hope that Ponsoldt will return to his less-glossy roots soon."

        "review_detailed_main": "In this updated reworking of \"1984\", young Mae Holland (Emma Watson from the Harry Potter series) scores a great job working for \"The Circle\", a social media type of corporation which functions more or less as a cross between Facebook and Apple. The company employees are all too eerily devoted to the workings of the job, which includes harboring all intimate information on each other, and placing tiny cameras practically everywhere in public in order to peer into all citizens' private lives. The two creators of this firm are played by Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt. Their agenda dictates that privacy is equal to thievery, and that being under constant surveillance keeps people honest. They take Mae under their wing and she eventually works her way up the ladder - she even volunteers to let herself be \"transparent\", which means she wears a camera constantly (except for bathroom breaks) and allows her whole existence to be screened \"live\" all around the internet.\n\nThat's enough of that. Emma Watson does a good job in her part and feigning her American accent, and since I don't follow Harry Potter I wasn't sure until afterwards if she had faked an English accent for that series, or if it was the other way around for this. However, since I AM a big fan of THE KING OF QUEENS TV sitcom, I had a rougher time buying the comedic geek Spence Olchin (ie; Patton Oswalt) in his serious role. Tom Hanks is a good actor and was really suitably despicable and frighteningly disingenuous. The problem was, there are good ideas here but not the best level of storytelling or plot flow. Some questions, too - such as the very last shot of the movie not making any sense, given the climax that had occurred shortly before it.\n\nAt age 55 as of the viewing, the film's privacy invasion theme did at least make me leave the theater quite relieved that I'm as old as I am at this time, and maybe that I wouldn't mind being a little older, even. I grow more and more disgusted at the Facebook/social media/loss of security that abounds all around us these days. Hey, to the all infants and children out there: it's your world now, and you can gladly have it. I wish you all nothing but good luck.\n\n**1/2 out of ****"

The movie had a decent start/setup but then rushed at the end to make all its points. Because of that, it would've played better as a short 8-ep streaming series; instead, it sacrificed plausibility in order to complete its story within the short time allotted. So yes, it gets kind of dumb at the end, but if you can look past that you can see the social-media run-amok dangers forecast back in the 2012/13 timeframe when this film was first discussed."

I found all of the performances - especially John Boyega's and Karen GIllan's - enjoyable. Overall, from the performance standpoint, I thought the movie was decent, even if John Boyega (who plays the most interesting character in the movie, by far) was criminally underused. I enjoyed the music, as well.\n\nWhere the movie starts to fall apart, however, is in its structure. I found myself thinking about it afterwards, trying to figure out what about it that is just off.\n\nI came to this conclusion: It's as if they filmed an outline or a rough draft of the film. The major plot points are there, some of the characters are developed, but the film just isn't connected yet. There are a lot of flat characters and subplots that could be further explored, and definitely some things to be trimmed. The climax of the film seems to be in an awkward place as well, almost as if it should take place 15 minutes earlier, or the movie should be a bit longer (even though it was already dragging).\n\nIn the end, I don't think it's nearly as bad as a lot of people are saying; I certainly don't regret seeing it. I just wish the film had fulfilled its potential because I really think it could have been quite good.\n\nMy recommendation: Either wait for the second-run theater or for the DVD. If you don't want to wait and want see it for the actors (like I did), I'd say go ahead and go, but just don't expect too much out of it."

She's established as an intelligent person from the outset. Taking and passing a verbal exam with flying colors. She is grounded, thoughtful, quiet and reserved. She also agrees with a pivotal character that some of what's going on at the Circle is a bit much.\n\nThen Just like \"movie people\" in Alien who stick their face into a foreign pod for a closer look or in other horror movies where people drop headfirst down drainage tubes into vampire's underground body storage caves, the protagonist's IQ goes from 140 to 85 without explanation and she begins doing amazingly moronic (a shout out to all my moron friends here, nothing personal) things with no explanation. makes. no. sense.\n\nThen She loses her moral compass and goes beyond even what she previously thought was a bit much and proposes nutso enhancements to their software. makes. no. sense.\n\nFinally the friend who helped get her the job goes through a hilarious transformation in which her attitude and appearance flip.

        "review_detailed_main": "In looking at the general reviews for \"The Circle\" (on this site and others), one could surmise it is one of the worst films ever made. I refused to believe this about a movie starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, though, so I finally gave it a chance. What I found is that though the movie is very poorly constructed in terms of plot and pacing, the over-arching themes it revels in are relevant enough to make it an interesting \"what if?\" tale as it pertains to social media.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, \"The Circle\" sees Mae (Watson) beginning to work at a huge social media/internet/tech company called The Circle, presided over by front man Bailey (Hanks). Imagine a conglomeration of, say, Facebook & Google, and you'd have a rough approximation of The Circle's power/reach. While initially the new position seems almost too good to be true, Mae begins to discover that The Circle may not quite be as innocent or benevolent as it seems.\n\nWhat I liked about \"The Circle\" is how it posits some pretty spot-on (IMHO) scenarios that could happen as social media becomes more and more pervasive (for better or worse) into everyday life. Social media is such a new phenomenon, comparatively speaking, that it is easy to spin stories about its potential breadth over the culture. Will we eventually be voting or paying our taxes 100% online? Perhaps. Will, at some point, one company streamline all the social media platforms (like The Circle's \"True You\" login)? Maybe. These are all interesting questions to think about, and \"The Circle\" does a good job of presenting them in a realistic fashion.\n\nThat being said, there are also three main problems that really work against this film and prevent it from being a classic in any sense of the word: 1. The Circle isn't presented as an out-and-out villain. While I like this \"shades of grey\" approach, I think it is probably too \"out of the narrative\" for many viewers. Almost exclusively in these cases, it is usually \"big data company\" vs. \"individual rights\". While the movie does indeed go towards that direction, it doesn't explicitly frame it as such.\n\n2. Casting Watson may have been a poor choice, actually, because her film/personal acumen leads you to believe (from the minute she is introduced) that she will be \"above it all\" and see through The Circle from Day 1. When this doesn't happen, and continues to not happen, it throws viewers for a bit of a loop. Not fair on Watson's part, but I think the effect does occur.\n\n3. There are plot lines throughout the film that are interesting but don't really seem to go anywhere or aren't resolved well enough for solid character viewing. John Boyega plays a character that clearly no one knows what to do with. Mae's friends Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) & Annie (Karen Gillian) should add more to the proceedings than what ultimately transpires. Mae's relationship with her parents (played by Glenne Headly & Bill Paxton) is an intriguing element, but again doesn't get resolved like it should.\n\nEssentially, \"The Circle\" is a movie where the nuts-and-bolts execution of the script isn't nearly as compelling as the bigger ideas trying to worm their way out. If viewers can wade past the clumsiness and take a more macro view, this is a film that can be enjoyed."

        "review_title": "A star-studded 'Black Mirror'",
        "review_detailed_main": "The darkly sci-fi TV show 'Black Mirror' is well known for its weekly plots showing us various 'What if?' scenarios regarding the use (or rather MIS-use!) of modern technology in the near future. 'The Circle' feels like it kind of belongs in the 'Black Mirror' universe, although possibly the main 'What if?' question I asked was, 'What if Black Mirror could afford A-list actors for an episode?'\n\nIn 'The Circle' a young woman (Emily Watson) joins a tech company which is pretty much a hybrid of Google, Facebook and Apple. Everyone who works there is ultra dedicated to the corporate mantra and barely leave the 'campus' as everything they could ever want is at their fingertips. It's headed up by the Steve Jobs-esque mogul, played effortlessly by Tom Hanks. He charming, enigmatic and a natural leader who you can get behind due to his ultra-inspiring rhetoric. But is he a good guy? Our young and na\u00efve intern (or 'guppy' as new employees are 'lovingly' referred to as!) soon realises that there's more going on than she had first thought.\n\nThe reason I'm dwelling on how much I felt like this was like part of the 'Black Mirror' series, is that some episodes of the show I liked and some I didn't. It seemed my personal preference towards the TV show was based on how quickly I 'got' what they were trying to say. If they managed to keep the show's true meaning a secret until the end, therefore giving some - even small - 'twist element' to the story then I found it left more of a lasting impact on me. However, there were some episodes where it was painfully obvious what they were saying right from the start and, once you knew where it was going, you could almost write the rest of the tale yourself. Unfortunately, despite 'The Circle's' great cast and fine performances (although if you thought that John Boyega was criminally-underused in 'The Last Jedi' then you won't appreciate the minimal screen time he's given here) you kind of can see what they're trying to say here and therefore where the film will go.\n\nI certainly didn't hate 'The Circle.' The calibre of actors on show, plus the stylish was it was shot and the attempt to actually say something relevant about society and the effects modern technology is having on us and where we may go with it, made it worth a watch. However, with all that it had going for it, I would have liked to see it going a little further and being a little less predictable with its story.\n\nI haven't read the book it was based on, so I can't compare the two. However, I understand that it wasn't as well-received during its US theatrical release as the producers would have liked. I guess one indication of what you should expect from this film is the fact that the film-makers then chose not to give it a UK cinema release, instead opting for a 'straight-to-Netflix' launch. of course if you have the popular streaming service then you're technically getting it as part of your subscription, in which case, you should probably add it to your 'watch-list.'"

Inclusion by intrusion.\n\nYou have no friends because you're a nobody? Become a somebody by having the world know your every move with all that data stored hidden away underground on mindless servers.\n\nOnly problem is you have to live your life keeping everyone updated through all devices, sort of a new kind of prison.\n\nDisturbingly topical since that's what most of us are doing now with Facebook, Instagram and other social network sites except our addiction blinds us to seeing it as a prison and our data owned by someone that can't be controlled.\n\nIt's the smartest written theatrical release movie in the past 20 years."

On the other hand, i have to agree that they are right when they tell that there are some \"disagreement\" between the protagonist acts versus the story, from a movie standpoint, it is almost amateur... never explained, for no reason, there are many contradictions..\n\nIt's sad that people nowadays are so binary about their opinion. I have to agree that the movie seems to be astounding at the first moment, but after a while you may be disappointed, but a 7 out of 10, for me, is the best way to rate it."

But when the tech companies realised its addiction, your consent no longer matters. That's what this movie is all about. Though, it is not that dramatic as many hoped to be but it is nice in its own way. It is more like a documentary or monologue. Whatever it is, but it is definitely an eye opener. It teaches us to set the boundaries for sharing our information and to take control of our privacy. It is still time, get out if this matrix and breathe free air.

Not a bad movie, just a less popular genre, and many come expecting some sort of thriller will be disappointed.\n\nSome people might not like the pace of the story: more of a slow-burn drama or documentary speed flow. Topics of OSINT and social media overlords set in the near 'Black Mirror'-esque future. (I bet Black Mirror could do this entire movie better as an episode but alas).\n\nAs you can imagine, boiling Apple, Google, Facebook, and all existing and imagineable social tech into one hypothetical company causes the movie to take a lot of logical shortcuts. It's less detail/intellectual of a movie and more of a dystopian concept movie. I would not call this a thriller since the majority of the movie is about the drama of socializing through technology and coming-of-age drama.\n\nThere was only one moment where I didn't like how Emma Watson acted near the end; I must admit I watched this movie to see her performance. If you don't like her, she dominates the entire movie so that should be enough info to guess if you'll enjoy it. For me, overall entertaining movie that deserves 6.5-7 stars."

I was intrigued by what appeared to be parallels drawn between Silicon Valley culture and cults such as Scientology (even the idea of going \"Transparent\" as a stand-in for going \"clear\") but the woeful lack of any character or plot development quickly reveals the hollowness at the heart of the movie. This hollowness then rings throughout the rest of the movie as pointless characters exist either just to enable the climax (which doesn't actually make sense as the motives of the company leaders are never explicitly revealed to be sinister) OR characters exist for seemingly no reason at all!\n\nAll in all, a very, VERY disappointing movie as it could have been something much, MUCH better if it just hadn't rested on it's imagined laurels."

The book and novel stand so far apart that the only similarity is the names of the characters and the poor delivery of a potentially very interesting story line. The producers, casting crew and director have clearly not read the novel or decided to just completely ignore it after reading.\n\nI have read a lot of books and watched a lot of films therefore I can say that this is by far the most dreadful film I have ever watched. A total waste of time. Do not watch this unless you want to confirm what you have just read! The book is equally awful.\n\nThe more I think about this film and the book the worse it gets. The lack of correlation is astounding. Imagine reading the Harry Potter novels and then in the films Ron was missing/never introduced. This is what The Circle has achieved, the film makes no sense compared to the book."

        "review_detailed_main": "With so much great acting in this movie, the really bad acting stands way out. Specifically, I'm talking about Ellar Coltrane as Mercer. His delivery of lines and timing was painful. He really pulled me out of the movie. Was his character only allowed to watch the not funny parts Napoleon Dynamite growing up? He reminded me of the imaginary boyfriend from Inside Out, not much to say and only one way to say it. There was nothing natural about his delivery. It all seemed forced to me. I'm not sure if the issue with Mercer was because of the actor or the director, but I'm surprised that they didn't pick up on it during early focus groups.\n\nCompared to Mercer, the rest of the cast was amazing! The plot was OK. It went a little far at times, but still somewhat believable. Maybe the one Ty/Mae scene with the extended dialog between them was a little uneven, but nothing else really stood out as just OK. Even the intentionally annoying and confusing geeks came across great. Watson, Hanks, Headly, Paxton, and Gillan really made this movie work. I want to give it more than a 7 but I can't. The one character was just way too distracting."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, watch this movie together with \"Searching\" (2018), whose plot is (wanted to be) the celebration of the immense potential of Google engine, good enough for doing everything you need w/o leaving a room, searches for your missing daughter included (the idea of \"no need to leave your house anymore\" scared me much more than The Circle, because to me this is not a potential but a nightmare, unless you are constrained in a bed).\n\nThe film has puzzled me because while I do understand its goal, it failed in making the problem look real, at least to the vast majority of compulsive social users. He wanted to be a kind of \"j'accuse\" against facebook (no hypocrisy please, the movie is about Facebook and Zuckerberg and, as someone said, Steve Jobs, whose focus was tech and money and not data collection) and its desire to plunder data from users too happy to share everything. My fear is that the average \"social media -addicted user\" would think \"cool, I'd love to be online h24 and participate in a man-hunt\". Mae's character does not arouse empathy and Emma Watson's pose (it made me think of Hugh Grant) was somehow dull. Tom Hanks is a perfect synopsis of Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. Maybe too much. I believe that the vast majority of the young people who saw the film did not perceive the message, just \"the usual exaggeration of people resilient to internet\". Pushing too much on drama, made the message weaker because most people would think \"ok, it is a movie. BTW, take a pict of the funny fat guy seated in front of us eating meat\". Last but not least if you want to deliver a \"message\" you must be sure of being credible and not just another case of brain washing. Let's talk about Ty Lafitte. The only positive character ... is \"coloured\". Quite strange that while I cannot remember in the movie Indians or Pakistans, Chinese or Russian (people usually associated, because it is real, with Geek roles) the producers decided that the Geek (and somehow a hero) was supposed to be afro-american. When a movie whose goal is to denounce the intrusiveness of internet and social media, the hypocrisy of the single thought, and the \"social driven democracy\", ... appears to be totally flat with the recent Hollywood agenda whose claim is \"no Afro-American has to be cast as a bad guy, it should always appear as a positive character, better if it is the only one \", then credibility goes to hell."

The trailer made this look like it was a movie for people like me, when really the message seemed to be that the problem isn't a lack of privacy, government and corporate oversight, or increasing divisiveness... it's just who's in charge of it all! If only they were more transparent about taking away your rights and privacies, wouldn't that make you feel better?\n\nThe movie doesn't deliver on it's message and everything about it felt phony and cheesy, especially the acting of pretty much the entire cast.

That pretty much sums up director James Ponsoldt's The Circle with a screenplay by Ponsoldt and Dave Eggers, based on Eggers' 2013 novel of the same name and which stars Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. I read somewhere recently that despite his fine reputation as a novelist, Eggers is incapable of writing a good screenplay to save himself and so it seems here. This is one of those films that although having a strong production team behind it and a stellar cast, is completely let down by a seemingly haphazard storyline that is all over the shop.\n\nConsider the following frustrating inconsistencies/plot holes in The Circle.\n\nThere is no backgrounding to Mercer & Mae's relationship, so his appeals to consider their past together, just appear rather silly.\n\nThe same can be said about \"besties\" Annie and May. They don't really appear to have any chemistry together. Annie disappears for a long period of the second act, reappearing to suddenly hate working at The Circle and then leaving to return to Scotland with little explanation.\n\nDoes John Boyega's character, Ty Lafitte, actually have anything to do with the main storyline? We are never privy to really why he chose \"the guppy\" with whom to start sharing his \"secrets\". Whatever, anyway he keeps disappearing back to the shadowy corners of the story and Mae seemingly does the opposite of that which he may have been warning. It seems to me he was entirely a redundant character, which is a waste of a fine actor.\n\nIn a similar vein and I say this respectfully, not wanting to speak ill of the dead, but what's with the continual cutaways to Mae's parents? Mae goes back and has lunch/dinner with them every now and then, but so what? Was she supporting them? Was The Circle? There was something said about it providing some medical assistance, but that was it. Did it, didn't it work? Mae has lunch with them, then goes kayaking on the bay and cries. Why? Again, the thread was never really followed up.And God forbid, I hope the iconic Bill Paxton is not remembered for his comical performance as a dad stricken with MS. And was Glenne Headly really supposed to resemble an escapee from The Beverly Hillbillies and if so, why?\n\nSpeaking of kayaking, how poorly lit was that nocturnal scene on the bay? Apart from knowing Mae was near water, I didn't know what had occurred until the events were being discussed in the next scene.\n\nA support character has a fatal motor vehicle accident after being harassed by some deviates using a revolutionary new Circle app and there are seemingly no legal ramifications for The Circle. Just carry on to ...\n\n... the big reveal at the end ... which revealed exactly what? Cue Mae going for another kayak surrounded by helpful drones ... The End! I'm still shaking my head.\n\nOne thing we do know. I'd suggest the combined star wattage of Watson and Hanks managed to drag this train wreck of a film into break even budget territory, a compliment it may well not have deserved."

However, this is NOT the case with The Circle, which is quite deliberate. The whole premise is to push the story and characters over the edge in order to hammer the points home. It's deliberately exaggerated to the point of being a caricature. The (valid) point(s) are very important and THEY are indeed the lead character(s), mainly \"the lack of privacy\" -consequences. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the performances of Emma Watson and Tom Hanks - not if you understand and accept the premise. This is NOT The Social Network, but more \"simple\" and cartoonish in order to convey the closed community within the work place and the alluring, yet extremely rigid concept of The Circle."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh look, here's the movie that everyone loves to hate in Spring 2017! It's the critically reviled techno thriller which is played out as George Orwell flavored near future sci-fi, only everything in is already real. More or less. A girl (Emma Watson of \u0084Harry Potter\" movies) working at one of the world's largest tech / social media companies discovers that modern technology is only as cool as the people who own it. Turns out, free lunches are not that free after all. \u0084The Circle\" can be called an insightful look about perils of our digital life, or \u0084a paranoid thriller without suspense, urgency or a single new thing to say\", as Rolling Stone has delightfully put it. Many gravitate towards the latter. Me, I am more generous here. I'd call it a fully functional movie, just not a very gripping one. The main problem may be that if you know about the digital life and it's shadow side, \u0084The Circle\" only recapitulates the often heard bullet points and adds nothing new. And if you don't know or care, then nobody offers convincing arguments to invest yourself in it either. The result in its one-note-ness and unelegant-ness resembles some popular teen drama: you can watch it and don't have to feel bored exactly, but you'll never mistake it for really good stuff. In the age of quality TV series, \u0084The Circle\" can't help but feel anachronistic, although its topics are thoroughly modern. Emma Watson is a bit too charmless to carry the result alone but her more intriguing co-stars (Bill Paxton in his final movie role, Tom Hanks as the founder of the company, Patton Oswalt, Glenne Headley) are sadly delegated to sidelines and can't really help carry the weight. All in all, I gotta say, the reputation of \u0084The Circle\" is worse than the movie itself. Sure, it's not great, and would probably work better as an episode in anthology such as \u0084Black Mirror\". But there's nothing really wrong with it either. It's a serviceable thriller for educating youngsters and effective cautionary tale about modern digital life."

It does careful, side-long bombing runs of the Church Of Jobs and the Church of Zuckerberg and several other deserving, soft targets.\n\nBut the story execution is so poor it just kind of plops out of nowhere, drops onto the road, then flops around dying.

Or the more everyone 'knows' (THINKS they know) about each other ... the more of a FANTASY the world becomes, it doesn't become more REALISTIC.

The story could be our worst nightmare. Well at least it would be mine. A world without any privacy is just a life not worth living. We're not that far yet, but when you think about the social media, the camera's and satellites everywhere, we're not that far from it either. Big Brother is watching you and it's not a good thing.

I know Tom Hanks has acted in several children and family movies, but many of them were fun, engaging, convincing and childlike on purpose. The Circle seems to have turned out a cautionary tale for children by accident. I wonder how much money he was offered in order to put his name in this waste of a movie. It's embarrassing to watch.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's interesting how some movies can trigger a tsunami of negative commentary that is disproportionate to the film's cinematic qualities. The so-called sci-fi thriller The Circle (2017) is one such movie. Perhaps any film that satirises the seductions and power of techno giants like Google, Apple and Facebook is treading on sacred ground. While it's not a masterpiece, the film does its job in airing some chilling issues about political and corporate accountability in the ever- expanding digital domain.\n\nStuck in a dead-end job, Mae Holland (Emma Watson) gets the chance of a lifetime to work with the world's biggest intelligence surveillance company called The Circle. It's a dream workplace with thousands of employees and every conceivable benefit, but it also expects 24/7 commitment and social involvement. She comes to the attention of the guru-styled CEO Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) who nurtures her advancement in the company. It turns out that she is a natural at selling Eamon's ideas for increasing employee surveillance and she even volunteers to wear a constant monitoring camera. She becomes the company's high-profile propagandist for transparency and the dispensability of personal privacy. The company introduces automatic voter registration for employees and its own preferred congressional candidate. It wants to extend Circle accounts to the entire population and link everyone to the electoral process. Unexpected things happen when the transparency lens is turned inward on the company.\n\nSo why is this film being thoroughly trashed? Emma Watson is difficult to watch without seeing her Hermione halo, but she is perfect for a role that calls for na\u00efve understatement. Tom Hanks plays a likable baddie with his usual over-reliance on those adorably furrowed Scully eyebrows. But describing this film as a futuristic sci-fi thriller has raised expectations that are impossible to meet when its narrative suspense curve is mostly flat and its technology already available. Then there is that feeling where someone is lecturing you about the dangers of believing technological masterminds with a script that often sounds somewhere between melodrama and corny.\n\nThere is one redeeming feature that makes this film undeserving of universal panning. It modernises the Orwellian 1984 techno-dystopia with a core premise that is not as absurd as some might think. The sheer scale of economic and political power of today's mega technology empires surpasses that of contemporary government and they have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to distort democracy everywhere it exists. If fake news can sway elections, what can real-time online manipulations of voting behaviour do? Audiences and critics do not like being mocked for their willingness to be herded like sheep into digital dependence. The warnings in this film hit home."

A thrilling flick with emotion , intrigue and suspenseful , containing a sour and realistic critique to the modern technologies that begin to affect the lives and future of our starring , as well as friends , family and that of humanity . The plot is plain and simple , that's why we have already seen in other better films , dealing with a tech-millionaire who has created a artifact called SeeChange, which uses small cameras placed anywhere to provide real-time video, but it turns nasty, to the point the people are being really stalked . It results to be a groundbreaking experiment, developing company's intrusive snooping that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately the personal freedom by using small cameras placed anywhere to provide real-time video . It's displayed with aplomb , but an uneven direction , while attractive Emma Watson keeps the familiar storyline from becoming tedious , and outstanding the following message : everybody is under personal attack through every technological facet of their lives .

As well as an intriguing and moving musical score by notorious and prolific composer Danny Elffman . This thriller movie was regular but professionally directed by James Ponsoldt , though it has some flaws , gaps and failures ; however , being entertaining enough . James Ponsoldt is a craftsman with some typical trademarks . He is a writer/producer/director known for The spectacular now (2013), The End of the Tour (2015) and The Circle (2017) . Rating : 5.5/10 . Acceptable and passable , being a so-so movie with its ups and downs . The flick will appeal to Emma Watson and Tom Hanks fans."

        "review_detailed_main": "'THE CIRCLE': Four Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe new techno-thriller starring Emma Watson, Tom Hanks (who also co-produced the movie) and John Boyega (of 'STAR WARS' fame). The film tells the story of a young college student who gets an exciting new job at a successful internet company, but things become too intense when she later learns that the corporation is a huge threat to everyone's privacy. It costars Karen Gillan, Patton Oswalt, Ellar Coltrane (of 'BOYHOOD' fame), Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton (in his final film role). The movie was directed by James Ponsoldt, and it was written by Ponsoldt and Dave Eggers (Eggers also wrote the 2013 novel it's based on). It's received almost unanimous negative reviews from critics, and it's underperformed at the Box Office as well. I somewhat enjoyed the movie, but I agree it is a flawed film too.\n\nMae Holland (Watson) is a young college student that's currently bored with her life, and has to deal with a lot of family drama. She's thrilled to find out that her friend Annie (Gillan) has gotten her an interview at the most successful internet company in America. She lands the job, and things begin going really well. Then she's given an assignment, by the corporation's two co-founders (Hanks and Oswalt), to be completely transparent to all of the company's internet followers (at all times). She at first enjoys the fame and enormous power that the position brings, but when she realizes the experiment is putting everyone's privacy in tremendous danger, she realizes it's something that she can't continue. The corporation doesn't want her to stop though.\n\nThe movie is another great idea for a film, that isn't fully developed well. I enjoyed a lot of it actually, and found the movie to be very insightful about the constantly advancing technological world we all live in. It presents a great argument about both the benefits and the dangers, that being completely transparent (and constantly oversharing everything) can bring to people and our society. I think oversharing can be a really positive thing (that's why I frequently do it), and the film does make this argument well. It also presents the downside of being overly transparent too though, and I don't think it really takes one side or the other (in my opinion). Some of the characters and plot points are really poorly developed though. It's a really ambitious movie, that had a lot of promise, but it does fall a little short. Bill Paxton does give an amazing final performance in the film (on the positive side) as well though.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519"

It tries to be fair to both sides of the debate on a world that does not want to put down their phones, but the ending does not leave me satisfied, which has a lot to do with the delivery. A lot of good ideas put into the mix with no end game in sight.\n\nTom Hanks is a great actor. The small time he had on the screen, he showed what an amazing performer he can be. Too bad his younger cast members could not say the same thing. In all fairness, comparing Emma Watson with Hanks is, well unfair, but she was the lead in this film and I was not getting anything from her, and I needed something. this movie needed something.\n\nAlso disappointed with John Boyega, who I've been a fan of since the movie Attack the Block he did many years ago, but once again in all fairness he had a small part in an Emma Watson film, not that it's all her fault that she had to act in a film that seemed like a good story gone wrong.\n\nWaste of time.\n\nhttp://cinemagardens.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow, just wow. A total bomb from start to finish. Emma Watson plays Mae, a tech-savvy youngster stuck in a crappy job doing bill collections via phone. Her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) gets her an interview at The Circle, a big tech company that seems to be an amalgam of Facebook and Google. Needless to say, Mae gets the job. The campus at The Circle would be straight out of science fiction if it weren't for Google's real-life campus - a sort of mix between a college (where no one seems to have classes) and an adult Chuck E. Cheese. There's everything from hot yoga to Quidditch, plus private concerts with acts such as Beck. It's not just a trendy work environment, it's a bleeding edge of hipsterism. The Circle itself is a be-all kind of company, much like Google is, trafficking more in ideas than in material goods. It's run by Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), a stand-in for Steve Jobs, who oozes personality and whose mantra is that sharing is caring and who holds weekly \"dream meetings\" with the entire campus to put forth his new ideas. Naturally, Mae is head over heels for this new job, since it's such a pleasant environment in which to work, and even more so when she learns she can add her parents (Bill Paxton and Glenne Headley) to her insurance - which means that Dad's MS treatments are covered! Doesn't matter that her customer-approval score is \"only\" 84, they like her! And she likes it there! Bailey's new idea is called SeeChange, an initiative to create and deploy tiny camera all over the world so that there are no secrets. Raise any alarms? The cameras come in different colors, so they can blend in almost everywhere! And they'll collect data, relentlessly relaying all of it to Circle HQ for analysis. Crimes can be stopped! People can be helped! The world will prosper! Unlike the audience, Mae and the rest of the staff don't see any problems with this approach. The staff meetings, incidentally, are unbelievable - pep rallies for the boss? For a place that seems to pride itself on innovation, there doesn't seem to be an inquisitive mind in the bunch. It's all awesome to them, especially when Bailey tosses the cameras out into the crowd. It's more of a cult, really. At one point, Mae has a video chat with her mom and notices a homemade chandelier in the background, made by Mae's friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane). After the call, Mae messages everyone in The Circle (they're very, very big on social networking) and plugs Mercer's work. Turns out to be a bad idea, because he finds himself labeled as a deer killer and receives death threats. Whoops. This doesn't deter Mae, though; she still believes wholeheartedly in Bailey's ideas. Later, she helps come up with a new initiative herself that allows people - using the many SeeChange cameras - to find someone in the world. This can't possibly be used for bad, right? Shenanigans ensue. All of the red flags that popped up would have been recognized by even the dumbest staffer, so it makes zero sense that Mae doesn't grasp what's going on - and what's to come. The bad guys are broadly, broadly written, and every plot point seems equally obvious and ridiculous. There's no good reason for the story to progress past the first half hour or so - there's so much dumbness. And Watson, Hanks, and Gillan, plus John Boyega as a master programmer and Patton Oswalt as the company's CEO, are woefully one dimensional. It certainly feels as if this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for the star power involved; but here, rather than talented actors raising up a bad script, they merely sink with it. This is terrible."

Don't get bound up in the shortcomings of the plot or the minimalism, to be kind, of the script.\n\nI don't really want to criticise it much, as it's quite clearly a teen's film, rated 12 and probably best aimed at 10 to 14 year olds or younger. Therefore it doesn't mean much I as an adult saying that a older child's film is not really for them and lacks in many ways. It's just something else.\n\nBut, conversely, as a serious film for any age, a completely different entity, I think it really does have something for everyone in a therapeutic level: Just to see in a mode of depiction, with one degree of removal, just how the world has gotten in these digital days, and come to conclusions in a more immediate, natural way.\n\nSeriously. It really helped me, and I think the film knows that is something which ought best somehow be experienced without being put into words. A phenomenon. Indeed, that some to much of the content is not able to be taken so seriously doesn't matter much, because it's the experience. And life is already like very much of this film and much which isn't is very quickly heading that way."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think I can see why James Ponsoldt, who previously took on and made excellent films out of young-troubled love (The Spectacular Now) and what it means to meet a mind that is brilliant and unusual (The End of the Tour, one of those dramatic films that can still be underrated on a top ten list), wanted to take on the material from Dave Eggers book. I haven't read it, but one can tell this is a story filled with a megaton of ideas and ambition. If anything I think it's the latter part, the ambition of this quasi-present-day dystopian world where this one big company that works a little wee bit like a cult (but like a Shinny Happy People Cult(TM) that people can sink their teeth into, lacking the cynicism and nastiness one usually or should sees on social media), where a character enters in and becomes immersed and loves it, only to find out all is not what it seems.\n\nSadly, it's a mess. But I don't think it could've been made if Ponsoldt didn't have the talent of a) seeing how to cast (mostly) the right actors, and b) there's flashes of brilliance here. I think early on I was a little worried that perhaps he had gone too... not challenging enough as a director, from the music score (which is atypical techno garbage that's too emphatic throughout) to camera moves and cutting. But there's a moment where Emma Watson's Mae is at her desk at The Circle, where she's a customer service person of some sort, and these two Very Shiny Happy Employees come over and ask her in a nice yet surely pushy way why she hasn't updated her social media account or checked her emails and gone to events, which, as they say, are \"totally not mandatory, optional, y'know\" etc. It's an extremely funny scene and one that is painfully awkward, because it feels like something that would happen there, and at the same time it gives us a window into what the personalities are like there. I wish there was more of this kind of scene in the movie, but there isn't.\n\nThere's so much potential with the ingredients here; we're in a world where screenings of 1984 were sold out across the country in one-night limited release this past month, and there's even a mention (ironic coming from Patton Oswalt's character, who seems like a \"Bad Cop\" version of Hanks's \"Good Cop\" head of the company) of claiming the US government is talking in \"double-speak\" when it comes to going after the Circle for anti-trust violations). And though I wasn't sure while watching it, I can say after sitting here writing this review that Watson is fine as this lead character. Does she become a bit over-zealous as she leap-frogs from customer service rep to a quasi-social media guru at this company (after she does an odd 'I need to break free' moment in the middle of the night where she goes... kayaking)? Sure. She's not exactly likable, but that could be interesting.\n\nAgain, there's a lot to explore with people, large groups of them, and we see it today on Instagram and Facebook and elsewhere - ever see those \"stories\" people make, it's not unlike the \"Transparent\" state Mae tries out as she documents every moment of her life to, somehow, millions watching all over the world (how exactly she is so interesting, aside from working at the Circle, for this to happen, I'm not so sure) - and I was half or more expecting this all to lead to some sinister revelations that Hanks/Oswalts characters are hiding. Nope. The giant f***-up that leads to what we call the \"2nd turning point\" in screen writing comes through something involving Mae's friend Mercer (Coltrane, the painful sore thumb of this cast, not being able to sell any of his brief moments on screen) and the ENTIRE world it seems like. And even that makes so little sense.\n\nMatter of fact, a lot doesn't make sense in The Circle (i.e. ANYTHING to do with politics). I have to wonder if this was Ponsoldt not knowing how to consolidate Eggers material with the writers, or if the movie was taken out of his hands and if chunks of the narrative are missing to make an under-2-hour run-time. But most especially an egregiously, the third act, following the turning point with Mercer, is so rushed and ham-fisted and... did I mention DUMB as to ruin a lot of good-will I was building up to the movie.\n\nThere's so much I want to like here, and a lot of scenes fly as far as making some satirical points about the hive-minded nature of the world we're living in which seems to me on-line where everyone is not only fine with giving up something of themselves, but that we enjoy watching ordinary people's travails (depending), not to mention the 'Cloud' aspect that the Circle props up. But it needed to pick a side: is it going to be a dark comic satire, or is it going to be a tech-thriller? It tries to mesh the two together, with a game cast and a lead who begs our sympathy, and it turns out to be a jumble.\n\nLastly... RIP Bill Paxton. A shame this is the movie, let alone with Hanks again as a near-villain, is the one to close out a career on."

        "review_detailed_main": "In an ever-increasingly digital world, practically everyone online is concerned with privacy. Of course, we are willing to give up this privacy to make our lives more convenient. In The Circle (2017), the eponymous corporation is merely a stand-in for Google/Facebook/Amazon/Apple and is essentially a conglomeration of sorts of these tech companies. Of course, just like that antiquated operating system you've meant to update, The Circle contains a premise about five years too late. When the book this movie was based on came out, I'm sure it was thought-provoking; now it's more a matter of \"Yeah, yeah, we've heard this already.\"\n\nPart of what strikes me about this film is that several segments of it probably worked better in the book. When I'm watching characters explain \"mandatory fun\" I can't help but cringe and wonder if it reads better than the performance I saw. Granted, there are segments which are better on the big screen, like The Truman Show (1998)-esque \"Transparency\" montage filled with the prolific and inane chatter of the internet surrounding the space around the main character. I'm also sure that plenty was cut to make the book film-length since some characters like Ty Lafitte (John Boyega) and Annie Allerton (Karen Gillan) were undeveloped at best.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, the one element of this film that I felt was the most unbelievable was the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the characters, both main and collective. So many of the \"good ideas\" immediately raised red flags in my head regarding privacy and cybersecurity, let alone the mere legality of them. And yet, these characters marched blindly on, filled with idealism in their semi-utopian constructs that would lead to dystopia. Don't get me wrong, some of the ideas might have merit in our world, but the dance between the utopian and dystopian was a consequence of not thinking these concepts through to their logical conclusions.\n\nA cautionary tale for a fate that has already happened, I give The Circle 3.0 stars out of 5."

If you believe a film like \"Snowden\", cameras have been likely to pop up out of our corn flakes for decades now.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a serious version of \"The Internship\", but instead of Googliness we have Circlers, and instead of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan we have Emma Watson.\n\nEmma plays Mae Holland who lands a job in the call centre (Customer Experience) at The Circle. She is inspired by the Steve Jobs-like CEO, Eamon Bailey, played by Tom Hanks. He exudes forward thinking and enthusiasm pacing up and down the stage in front of his company of bright young acolytes. The Circle has developed cutting-edge data-gathering technology and has just created a real-time, hi-def video camera the size of a marble that can be concealed anywhere.\n\nMae is conflicted about the intrusion of The Circle into people's lives especially her own. However the story gets a little confused when she receives the opportunity to blue sky ideas, one of which involves being able to track down any person on the planet in the time it takes to make a cup of coffee. It's a concept that has Big Brother written all over it, but when she gets the job of implementing her ideas, she becomes a social networking guru.\n\nEventually the whole thing becomes intrusive for her friends, her family and herself. In one scene, the only place she can find some privacy to talk to her friend away from the camera is in the loo - but you couldn't be too sure about that either.\n\nWhen tragedy strikes she has to rethink her approach to the privacy issue. I'm not sure the morality of the whole thing gets a satisfactory answer in \"The Circle\". At the end, Mae extols the virtues of the connectivity of everyone on the planet as she canoes solo on a sparkling lake with drones buzzing all around her.\n\n\"The Circle\" really isn't very hard hitting. However, it does make you think about how much of your life and day-to-day movements you want monitored. Although it's probably too late to do much about it anyway."

It makes his Joe versus the Volcano in his early years, look like Citizen Kane. Maybe they should have re-thought this thing when Paxton and Headly, who play Watson's parents, both croak before the movie was finished. Watson is an average skilled actress, who I don't see what the big deal is about. She is not star quality, and you have to wonder how long it will be before others realize this.

Is the films message \"be like China\" and all will be right with the world, this time we can do Communism properly, is this really what we're being sold?\n\nThis movie, on the surface is awful, trite, but the narrative undertones are horrific. Watch this film so you can see what the powers that be are trying to get societies young to believe. This is why the movie is confused and disjointed, it's a thinly veiled propaganda film directed at limited childlike minds."

I think the story even moves to fast (despite having passed several months since the beginning) and there isn't time to let it breath and the main character (Watson) come aware in a believable way of what's going. But there is a point in all of it. This story makes sense for us. We live in a world where more and more social networking is part of our daily lives to work, to play, to relax or to share anything. Honestly sometimes I feel that if I don't post the things I'm doing it's like it never happened... If someone doesn't like it/comment than it's not important. For those who are socially more important (more followers)I guess it can be equally or even worse since everyone gets to comment, misread and sometimes disagree in extreme ways and assault you with words. Resuming you either post it and it happened but you submit yourself to the judgment of the world with possibility of being extremely \"punished\" or you don't even exist for everyone. It can become overwhelming and it's not hard to notice this since so many singers/actors are actually quitting social life because for them it's easier to be caught in this web. So The Circle brings attention to this subject and for that it's important. Of course the story and it's treatment could be much better so it get's to be only average.. I guess I would recommend it for a lazy Sunday when you don't know what to watch...There are no surprises in here, not very interesting lines and I personally didn't buy Mae's character but still interesting to picture some things of the real world on it and image if couldn't it happen in the future (meaning the political side of the story)."

I could see if the message was 'well the genie is out of the bottle, how do we move forward?) But there is no concluding elaboration of the protaganist's position, consequences for the company or how the technology is subsequently used by the world.\n\nI suppose we are stuck with social media and the challenges to personal privacy.

She is soon welcomed as one of the family, and finds her colleagues eager to help her use all the technology on hand to improve her life for the better. She also comes to the attention of Bailey (Tom Hanks), the CEO of the organization, who sees potential in her. But another co-worker, Ty (John Boyega) opens her eyes to just how invasive The Circle is set to become. As Mae becomes more ruthless and rises up the ranks, it sets her on a collision course of events, in which her morality and ethics will be tested to the limit.\n\nGiven recent scandalous revelations, concerning Facebook (which 'The Circle' is none too subtly meant to represent!) and its mishandling of private information of its users, involving the Cambridge Analytica firm, The Circle has hit on an inspired concept for a film, and one which is certainly timely and relevant. Indeed, it looks like one or two of my 'friends' have permanently logged out now, probably because of it, and so we're having these slightly grovelling adverts being run at the moment, trying to reassure everybody that they're going to make their settings easier to unblock, and there's nothing to worry about anymore. Unfortunately, despite the great concept, this film sadly fails to really do it any justice.\n\nHanks was quite a big name for Netflix to pull, even if he may be entering the Autumn of his career now, and his star is slightly waning. But with this in mind, it's even more amazing how little screen time he seems to occupy, at least in the first half. But even so, his character just ends up coming off as really corny, without any solid conviction. As a more fresh faced star, Watson fits the modern tech world scene a bit more smoothly, but the crazed cult-like world she enters just comes off as silly rather than creepy. But it sets the tone for the film in general, which despite its interesting idea, is for the most part just totally unengaging and strangely dull, with characters spouting ridiculous, wordy dialogue that doesn't feel real at all.\n\nIn spite of everything, weirdly you do feel compelled to find out how it will end, which at least means it never feels tired or predictable. But then it does roll by, and its the most corn-fed, saccharine laden, nonsensical drivel you can imagine, an ill-fitting pay off to a film of enormously wasted potential. **"

The story itself is a conspiracy type, what if we allowed a 'Person of Interest' scenario to be realized around the world, given to us by a company, but welcomed by all inhabitants of the planet? All people want full openness and 24/7 live cams on every person etc. Would this solve all the world's problems from crime to social to political to economical etc? You decide.

Thanks to her best friend Annie, Mia scores a job interview and lands a dream job at the powerful, high tech company called \"The Circle\". Mia soon learns there is more about this company that will effect the lives of all humanity.\n\nIt's no secret that we ourselves live in a pretty cool world full of high gadgets and advancements. The Circle is a company that desires to aim higher and one of main company's directors is Bailey (played by Tom Hanks), who is passionate to make the world an even better and safer place though the use of advanced technology.\n\nWhile Mia doesn't have any real high end experience in the world of technology or programming, as the film progresses it's Mia who meets key characters who just happen to reveal more about the company or assist her with making massive creative changes within the company which brings us to the biggest point of the film...\n\nWhile the concept and plot of The Circle is something many in the world can relate to, its overall direction and dialogue is a major disappointment and was a letdown for me. All the team members that surround Mia deliver dialogue that is over the top and painful to watch. After all, these people are all supposed to be adults at a major I.T. company, right? Emma Watson also tries her best, but the script hurts her as a lead character.\n\nAs stated above, the King actor himself, Tom Hanks is 2nd credited in this film but is really here to mostly speak on stage as \"The Circle\" crowd and team members laugh and call out during his presentations - it's all cheesy. I should also note that the actors of Mia's parents, Bill Paxton & Glenne Headly, both passed away in 2017. The thought that this is their last performance and their last film makes me wish it was something better than this.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy technology talk, sure, some of that is found here, along with creative ideas and discussions within \"The Circle\" that show some worth. It is the characters dialogue and predictable script that I found so awful to the point that halfway through the film, I actually checked my watch and let out big sigh as I found the film had one more hour to go. Danny Elfman's score is also felt out of place and tried to be something that just didn't suit this film (rare for the talented Elfman!). The actors all do what they can here but in the end, it's not enough for me to recommend this film.\n\n2.3/10 Walkden Entertainment"

Direction and editing... probably mostly direction though, are awful as well.\n\nThe couple pros in the film are (1) Tom Hanks (who seems to always be great regardless of the movie he is in) and (2) the themes about privacy and the lack thereof in a more and more connected world is somewhat thought provoking.\n\nThat said, two actors I do like quite a bit, Karen Gillan and John Boyega, are also in this but their parts are so terribly written and informed that I can't say it redeemed the film in any way although without them being in it the film probably would have been that much worse!

Whoever wrote this could benefit from such a lesson. They talk about \"TrueYou\" in as little detail as possible; it's apparently one website for everything so you don't have to remember a lot of passwords, but what does that really mean? How is this private enterprise going to tie in your banking and credit card sites, email, utilities accounts, etc? Or is it just all social media combined? Who knows; they give you only enough info to make it seem vaguely ominous. It's not developed enough to make you understand what it is or why you should care. And what's the deal with Annie? All she does is slowly fall apart, but they don't spend any time with the character so that you understand what she is doing or why she's cracking up.\n\nInstead, they spend too much time on over the top scenes criticizing people who aren't social enough. Did you get the message that you're supposed to live for the experience and not for the social media posts? If not, they'll grab you by the hair and slam your face into it over and over. Someone saw that episode of Black Mirror and decided to turn it into a full length film but didn't know how to fill out the runtime.

It was inevitable with the current controversy surrounding technology and issues of information and privacy that someone would make a film on the subject.\n\nThe Circle is a competent but by no means exceptional look at how technology controls information and impacts on personal and societal privacy.\n\nOn the plus side this is an inherently watchable film. Emma Watson hands in a decent and very honest performance in the lead role. That said, the \"show stealer\" is Tom Hanks. Hanks shines as the co-CEO of The Circle. I used to work in IT and went to more than my share of tech events and Hanks is eerily familiar as the jokery but polished, put you at ease brand marketer, who makes seemingly not so exciting techie stuff, sound interesting and even exciting.\n\nThe actual premise behind this film \"that everyone has a right to privacy\" but also informational transparency is presented in a very simple, accessible manner. It brings into sharp focus questions of where technology could and indeed is, taking us. Big technology corporations lobbying their governmental minions, who by degree chip away at our privacy. Always with the disclaimer that its to \"our benefit\". A point made and made again, in The Circle.\n\nOn the downside this film is light on insight at times. A little more exploration of how these issues effect individual characters in the film would, I feel, have added much needed depth to this film.\n\nThat said, by and large, there's a lot more to like here than not. Seven out of ten from me."

Instead of continuing to build the stakes and tension, as the Circle employees and users, who are caricatures of young social-media obsessed Milleneals, start getting increasingly cartoonishly weird and exaggerated in their privacy-invading behavior, ignorantly unaware of the harm they are doing, all the build-up just kind of tapers off part way through, leaving me asking \"That's it?\""

It was like she was trying too hard. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks always puts in a good performance he was the best thing about this film. John Boyega looked he was trying too hard as well perhaps it's trying to put on an American accent thats stoping them putting in a solid performance or maybe there holding back because it's just on Netflix and not in the cinemas. Cellar Coltrane another bit of acting which seemed wooden which is a shame after what he did in Boyhood.Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton did a good job with the MS story especially Bill his face when he realised he soiled himself was spot on I do the exact same thing well not from soiling myself but when I realise there's something wrong with me like that sinking feeling.Karen Gillian another beautiful woman again I just didn't understand, she's either a really really good actor or she just didn't care about giving a 100% seemed it at first when she first entered the film but then I don't know just didn't believe her.\n\nThe story though I was thinking as the film was going on I bet it's not far from the future. Some of it I was like yes id be up for catching criminals, stopping people getting in danger that needs to happen. Didn't agree with the thought that everyone should post everything they do all experiences, some people just want to be in the moment and u think that should be respected.\n\nSo only watch this film if your a Tom Hanks fan or a Bill Paxton fan they won't disappoint you the rest of the film probably will.

He didn't bring anything to the screen other than a campy over the top vision of what he thought steve jobs acted like when he was alive and a maniacal tyrant. The girl who was cute as Hermione is no longer cute and also acted in such a campy, this is how I think a high school girl with a crush on her teacher acts manner that it made the movie just creep along at a snails pace.

Secrets make crimes possible. Secrets need accountability), do you share your bad side to the other face of the world using technology none of us do because (Secrets make crime possible) behind everyone there is a secret do you truly show your real personality on the internet none of us do, i didn't get what really the real message is the movie couldn't propose itself, leaving the viewer at the end without a conclusion this increases hate over it all people might not get over it, preformed by a great cast having (Tom Hanks) and (Emma watson) and the idea is great but as i see the problem is with the execution, i don't want to recommend this personally but if you are intrested in the plot check it out, 6/10\u2b50"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a pointless movie. It's \"1984\" meets the \"The Truman Show,\" set in Silicon Valley, and wants to serve as a cautionary tale about personal privacy. Given what we all know about the NSA, Big Data, Snowden and WikiLeaks, however, it's too-little, too late. Or, as one critic noted, it's \"ripped from yesterday's headlines!\"\n\nThe premise is that Emma Watson goes to work for the \"Circle\" (Facebook / Google) headed by Tom Hanks (Steve Jobs) and Patton Oswalt (Steve Wozniak) in their huge Silicon Valley office complex (Apple.) Besides \u2013 literally - wanting to take over the world, Hanks and Oswalt have developed an ideology based on \"Secrets are lies, sharing is caring, privacy is theft.\" The solution is to have surveillance cameras everywhere, including those worn as universal personal body-cams.\n\nWatson plays a new employee (\"guppy\" in Circle-talk) who becomes the first person so equipped. As with the Truman Show, the world becomes addicted to following Watson's life. (Somewhat inexplicably, given that she works 80-hour weeks and has no social life.) At the same time, The Circle is convincing governments around the world to adopt its platform to enforce mandatory citizen-engagement, voting, etc.\n\nThe movie half-heartedly and perfunctorily explores some of the privacy issues, and finally, Watson begins to see the downside to all of this and ultimately rebels.\n\nWatson (who has top-billing over Tom Hanks) once again delivers an uninspired performance. (The film had major re-shoots to make Watson's character more appealing, but the re-shoots tested worse than the original scenes.) Hanks and Patton Oswalt are interesting choices as the protagonists, while Glenne Headly and Bill Paxton play her increasingly concerned parents. Karen Gillan \u2013 who seems to get better with each performance -- plays Watson's friend, who's also part of the Circle's uh, inner-circle.\n\nThe producers accurately recreate the cult-like atmosphere of big Silicon Valley companies, but don't seem to understand the underlying technology. Silicon Valley tech companies, for example, don't build data centers in abandoned subway tunnels, especially ones with water dripping off the walls and with giant puddles on the floor; people can't bring random and unannounced visitors into data centers; and data storage has progressed to where rack after rack of servers are no needed to store one person's personal data.\n\nWhile most movies today are shot in Georgia, Louisiana or overseas, The Circle proclaims in the closing credits that is was filmed entirely on location in California on in California studios.\n\nSkip this one."

Thus the film, \"The Circle\", delves into the concept that as technology develops our personal privacy disintegrates. Point in fact, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) seems to be a true believer in the idea that the world would be better if secrets didn't exist. He makes a convincing case; after all people are less likely to commit crimes if their being watched. Therefore, shouldn't we always be watched? \"The Circle\" is at it's strongest when tackling this issue. Unfortunately, it does so by sacrificing characters, subplots, and any other adjacent themes.\n\nAll the actors are solid here. Hanks delivers overwhelming credibility to a character that on paper reads like a super-villain. The remaining cast (including the late Bill Paxton) brings their utmost to this film, which is necessary since the script literally treats these characters as props for the greater moral of the movie. For instance, John Boyega's Ty Lafitte, ostensibly the Doctor Frankenstein of this piece (deprived of the soul-wrenching recognition that creation does not equal humanity), appears and disappears whenever the script needs him to do so (including but not limited to a nice piece of deus ex machina).\n\nThat brings us to the ending, no spoilers, but even if I did say something it wouldn't matter because the resolution just happens--no buildup, no backstory. \"The Circle\" frantically warn us about a future wherein huge corporate entities easily employ data mining, meanwhile failing to indict the system that allows these same corporations to wield such power. Within the context of the film, The Circle unabashedly describes how it will use its website to takeover government responsibilities for nuisances like voter registration and voting in general. However, never a peep is heard about how a corporation could exercise such power over government functions. How does this a dystopian turn-of-events occur? Is it through bribery? blackmail? The movie creates a gaping hole then fails to fill it.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a film bubbling with interesting ideas and ethical implications, but sadly, by disregarding the characters and the story, neglects to explore them properly."

The movie was very average. I think the redeeming properties of the movie were the fact that we had background on characters from the book.\n\nIf you would like to make this worthwhile, read the book and then see the movie.\n\nI will note that the ending of the movie was very appropriate and despite its difference from the book's ending, I think it was equally as meaningful, again based off the more in-depth knowledge given from the book."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a disappointment.\n\nNamed as one of my most anticipated films of 2017, for what I thought was good reasoning; solid source material, great director, intriguing cast and potent subject matter, but The Spectacular Now and The End of the Tour director James Ponsoldt's adaptation of Dave Egger's best-selling book of the same name is a mighty letdown of a movie.\n\nThe Circle really has no right to be as boring and bland as it is but despite the ample talent at its disposal and in many ways highly relevant examination of the Big Brother like world we are quickly becoming, where every move can be watched, tracked and examined, Ponsoldt's film fails to fire in any sufficient way whilst wasting a talented cast in the process.\n\nThe film looks good in a workmanlike fashion and it feels like it's always going to branch out and become something exciting or at the very least mildly engaging but as Emma Watson's young go-getter Mae takes up a seemingly simple admin job at global technology company Circle, only to find herself caught up with Tom Hanks company head Eamon Bailey, The Circle quickly finds itself caught up in an endless loop of conferences, bad sub-plots involving a sick parent sadly played by the late Bill Paxton (in a role you wish wasn't one of his last) and a narrative that never ends up going anywhere after near 2 hours of running time.\n\nThe Circle clearly has some hot topic issues at play and wants to examine them in an ultra-hip and subversive way but Ponsoldt's film captures none of the tension or mystery that no doubt helped Egger's book become a fast-selling novel and we never feel invested in Mae's plight as she gets involved in the cult-like world of the Circle's employee group.\n\nIt doesn't help that Mae isn't exactly the easiest person to warm to, happy to use people to advance her own self-gain and very easily led to do things she clearly isn't keen for, Watson struggles to make Mae work while Hanks doesn't get a lot to do bar a nice take on a Steve Jobs like CEO, whilst Force Awakens breakout star John Boyega may as well have not shown up at all with his character of Ty, a Circle employee who quite clearly doesn't drink the Kool-Aid barely getting a look in, even though he at first seems like a major player in events to come. The less said about Boyhood star Ellar Coltrane's role here as Mae's friend Mercer the better.\n\nFinal Say \u2013\n\nThere's no reason to see The Circle, a hugely disappointing film from a director as talented as Ponsoldt and while it may not be the years \"worst\" film its easily one of the year's biggest flops that could've easily been so much more, as this truly is a film that threatens to do a lot but ends up doing nothing at all.\n\n1 deer antler chandelier out of 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Circle based on a novel by Dave Eggers, is not only the name of the film and the name of the company in which the film is largely set in. The Circle can also describe the hole in which this movie tries to plug its square pegged characters, story and themes. For all its gauche, ill-conceived judgments of cyber-life and West Coast utopianism, The Circle seems not only doomed to be forgotten but berated and mocked by generations of computer engineers tickled pink by its uninformed perspective. Think the same reaction one would have of Hackers (1995) only replace Matthew Lillard's easy-going silliness with John Boyega awkwardly shuffling through the darkness.\n\nIf there's a silver-lining to this Phishing-scam made sentient it's all in the naive gaze of Emma Watson's character who stops just short of selling herself as \"real.\" Watson plays Mae, a millennial graduate who through luck and gumption comes to work for a Google/Facebook/Apple analog whose workplace culture would make any normal person worry about the Kool-Aid. After a laundry list of new-kid-on-the-block clich\u00e9s, the story settles on Mae's emergence into the all-encompassing world of her job, which cajoles her to be a guinea pig in a new kind of social media.\n\nThe Circle seems like it should be a pitch black satire on the dark side of Silicon Valley. Yet what it ends up being is a dull, incredulous parody of what people outside Silicon Valley think of people in Silicon Valley. No where is this more obvious than in the casting of Tom Hanks whose borrowed credibility feeds into the idea that cyberspace hides wolves in sheep's clothing. We want to trust his tech-billionaire Emon Bailey; even as he spouts the most outrageous, nonsensical phrases like he's complimenting a neighbors new car. Once we get to Ellar Coltrane's half-thought-out lectures on how things ought to be, the movie has gone so far up it's own a** that its brain is melting in stomach acid.\n\nWhat pains me is most of The Circle's various elements is it could have, should have, and needed to be way better. We have become a culture so dulled by the desire for convenience that most of us don't care internet companies buy and sell our personal information for the sake of better marketing and social conditioning. So long as I get my music to play on my Amazon Echo who cares if some murderer's most painful moment is immortalized on social media? Whether on purpose or on accident, Mae talks a big game about \"having a choice\" but rarely makes a choice without coercion. That could have been an interesting theme. Yet because The Circle is aiming to be A Face in the Crowd (1957) for the Youtube generation, no matter what choices she ends up making there's an immediate and negative consequence. Mae along with the audience is seemingly trapped in a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. A stolen kayak gives Emon the fuel to pursue his Orwellian fantasies, a boardroom brainstorm gets Mae to further abandon her authentic self in favor of a less-real social personality. Hell even her seemingly unrehearsed answers to interview questions get her the job, that sends her on a spiral of ruination in the first place! Thus when the ending rears it's ugly, insincere, vacuous head (apparently the ending of the book is different) we all automatically assume things aren't going to resolve themselves.\n\nIn a world of nothing but accountability, is there really a need for integrity? This is a question I thought to myself while watching The Circle and sadly it's an idea that was never explored. Nor was there any followup on The Circle's apparent monopoly on practically everything on the interwebs (surely there are other virtual supervillains in Silicon Valley angling for world domination). Nope: boring characters, circular logic and techno-phobic platitudes are all you get here. All set to a soundtrack that sounds like the Blue Man Group underwater."

I'm sure I got the movie years ago because of Tom Hanks, so I inserted the disk in my blu-ray player and gave it a look, setting aside the less than promising ratings and trying to keep an open mind. I have no recollection of having seen it before, though I may very well have (the seal was broken). For the most part I was not captivated by how the story developed but the IMDb storyline and the fact that Hanks was featured kept me watching. I mean the Dave Eggers novel, on which the movie is based, had a fair reception, not shiny, just fair, and I liked the storyline's potential.\n\nThere was less emphasis on social media than I expected or hoped for, the characters, including the principal lead role played by Emma Watson, were not exciting, not even Hanks, but I kept hoping and watching. Finally there was a breakthrough in one scene, the single and only real dramatic one. From that moment, sadly a bit too late for many who will watch the movie, the momentum picked up. It wasn't as suspenseful as it could or should have been, but I kept watching and in the last two scenes of the movie . . . Eureka! What was meant to happen did and the conclusion was great, short but great. If you are a patient moviegoer, like smart twists, even if they come late in a movie, you'll like this one. Just keep in mind all the remarks before my mention of Eureka. I look forward to Eggers' novel's sequel 'The Every' being made into a movie. Oh. . . I should read 'The Every' first, and I hope to god it is more exciting.\n\nNote of interest: Bill Paxton who had a supporting role in the movie died before the movie's release and sadly this was one of his best performances."

All topics that are highly relevant in our times, and if nothing else this film gives one pause for thought. What struck me most about The Circle however is that it isn't satisfying. You expect films like this to have a big comeuppance moment, which this film really didn't have in my opinion.\n\nI'm being more critical of this film than perhaps I should mostly because I think the underlying concept is so fascinating and relevant, but this potential wasn't capitalised on. There were a few threads introduced in the film, such as Mae's relationship with Annie, which didn't really have a pay off or purpose, and others which had unsatisfying ends. I won't delve into the plot too much so as not to spoil, however I found it teetering constantly on the edge of being more interesting than it was and never actually getting there.\n\nThe character of Mae was a tricky one. I could never quite figure out her philosophy or attitude and found it hard to follow her journey throughout the film on an emotional level and get to grips with her reasoning. I think this film was too superficial in this respect, ironic really considering its subject matter. John Boyega's character was criminally underused. A great actor but not used at all to his full potential. The character just wasn't developed at all and yet was quite instrumental to the story in the end. It seemed like it could have been an interesting plot point but wasn't explored.\n\nNone of this particularly detracted from the performances, which were solid I thought. Tom Hanks played the CEO of a hipstery tech company extremely well - the corporate man who tries so hard not to be corporate. Emma Watson was good, although I've seen her give much better performances. I mentioned earlier the lack of emotional connection and understanding with her character, but I don't think this was down to her performance, rather the plot and script. Also Karen Gillen was a lovely treat! A great actress who I'd happily watch in anything.\n\nI did enjoy the direction of this film, with the way that the digital world was presented on screen and how it was portrayed.\n\nOverall The Circle wasn't bad, but was disappointing nonetheless. It was a film with a lot of potential in its underlying themes and premise, but failed to deliver an interesting narrative around this."

I used to think that the Internet was the best human invention of all time until the advent of global social networks, which turned out to be new tools for controlling us where ever we are around the world. Facebook recently advertised, or it was simply reported, that it had reached two billion members and users. What a market? It is a perfect circle. But all circles are perfect by definition. It is perfect on more than just the literal sense. Superb story and acting, and of course, a superb message that I will let you discover. You may be not scared, but I was terrified."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those movies where you need to read the book first. The reason for that is the book is about 500 pages and they needed to cut a lot out and as a result, the editing is a bit choppy, and the film may be confusing as it does move very quickly. But since I did read the book, that wasn't a problem. Some of the best performances of the year are in this film, particularly from Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, and John Boyega. However, one of the worst performances of the year is also in this film from Ellar Coltrane. His performance is just awful. Every line from him, without exception, is either without emotion, or just very awkwardly delivered. They really should have given him better direction or hired someone else. Most movies of this nature are very one-sided, but in this film both sides of the argument are delivered very well. You see the positives and negatives to both sides, although the negative sides from Tom Hanks' character's point of view are presented as very manipulitive but that's the point. I wouldn't say Tom Hanks' character is evil or a villain in the way we traditionally think of movie villains, but he's not afraid to deceive and manipulate, and sometimes play on human emotion to get what he wants. He presents this fascist society as a good thing for the betterment of humanity, and preys on common human empathies and sympathies to convince people to side with him. He's not the level of, say, President Snow from \"The Hunger Games\", but he's pretty close. Whereas Snow uses threats, Hanks' character takes a \"You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar\" approach, as do most of the other employees of The Circle. Like I said, you should probably read the book first, or you may get confused because of the choppy editing, but once you've read it, and then seen this you'll be able to piece together the missing elements of the film. Will this win any Oscars? Probably not. but it is still a very important film that everyone needs to see. Grade: C 7/10 3/5 stars"

This aimless smattering of scenes accidentally stumbles upon compelling subject matter once or twice, but regains it's focus to continue it's journey on the bridge to nowhere.\n\nEmma Watson is the protagonist, or at the very least the person that takes us along on this chore of a story. With the driving force of the movie being full access and unfiltered knowledge of everyone, her character is incredibly detached from the audience. Motivations go completely out the window for her multiple times, leaving the audience scratching their heads. And I honestly have never seen an actor be so bored in a role they were playing. I'd say she mailed in her performance, but even that would require effort.\n\nIn a gesture of solidarity, her costars agreed to also sleepwalk through the film. Ellar Coltrane, who plays Mercer, is Watson's white knight by taking the burden of worst actor upon himself. Patton Oswalt, who is horribly miscast as the company's COO, seemed out of his element in each scene he was a part of. I can only assume he was the studio's 3rd or 4th choice for the role.\n\nThe small bright spots for me were Karen Gillan, who plays Watson's insider friend. Her initial introduction was a little jarring, but she was by far the strongest performer. Bill Paxton did well with what he was given, and it was just good to see him again, even if it was in something like this.\n\nTelling you to skip this movie is unnecessary, but I would point you in the direction of the Netflix series Black Mirror. The episode 'Nosedive' is everything this movie wished it could be. I wish the producers would have watched that episode before making this film. Not so they could have made it better, but so they wouldn't have bothered. 3/10"

So, like all humans, some are jerks, a few are exemplary, but most are somewhere in between.\n\nThis is an okay film that drags a bit in middle. The message of disappearing privacy is real enough, if a trifle overstated. The Circle can offer a certain level of entertainment, as long as the viewer realizes that it's fictional hyperbole, not a documentary."

Although one could misinterpret the film as pure propaganda in favor, in the end I believe that the 2-3 co-stars who were opposed lead to it, showed that the film wanted to demonstrate the impact of such violations or even satirize such a situation, rather than propagandize in favor. The actors and co-stars are very good actors, big names, but I would like to go deeper into the role of Tom Hanks and continue the film further since it closed very abruptly and left the rest to the viewer.

        "review_detailed_main": "Movies about technology run amuck have been around since before movies talked. Working backwards, we might mention \"Ex Machina\" and \"Transcendence\" (both from 2014), \"Transformers\" and \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (both 2007), \"I Robot\" (2004), \"The Matrix\" (1999), \"Gattaca\" (1997), \"The Net\" (1995), \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986), \"The Terminator\" (1984), \"War Games\" (1983), \"Demon Seed\" (1977), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968), \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951) and even back to one of the last films of the silent era, \"Metropolis\" (1927). That short but representative list is a mixture of the classic, the underseen, the forgettable and the just plain bad. Then there's 2017's \"The Circle\" (PG-13, 1:50), which is based on Dave Eggers' 2013 novel of the same name and uses one young career woman's work and life experiences to imagine where continuing rapid advances in technology and on social media platforms (and the corresponding decline in personal privacy and security) might take us as a society.\n\nMae Holland (Emma Watson) is a young woman stuck in a dead-end job, until a college friend named Annie (Karen Gillan) gets her an interview with the world's premier technology company. The Circle has the popularity of Facebook and the innovative spirit of Apple \u2013 and Mae is thrilled to be working there\u0085 at first. Mae starts out (as many Circle employees do) in CE (Customer Experience \u2013 what the company calls their customer service department). As she works hard to get the average satisfaction rate for the customers she talks to on the phone as high as possible, she becomes overwhelmed by the corporate culture at the Circle. Not only do the (mostly youthful) employees enjoy the creature comforts and enjoyable diversions that have become a major feature of the modern workplace (especially in the tech sector), but she soon learns that the social aspects of working at the Circle are virtually all-consuming.\n\nThe Circle basically runs the lives of all of its employees \u2013 and knows everything about their lives. Mae is expected to update her personal social media accounts regularly and with all sorts of fun and social activities. While working, she's expected to constantly correspond with all of her fellow employees through her computer, spend her leisure time with them and attend every party and social activity held on the Circle campus, where Mae lives in a type of dormitory. Company social representatives tell her that it's all \"strictly voluntary\" and \"just for fun\", but neither of those claims seems very honest. The Circle is a creepy combination of a summer camp and a religious cult. Putting it in pop culture terms, this place feels like a cross between Tom Cruise's office in \"The Firm\" and The Eagles' \"Hotel California\".\n\nAt the Circle's weekly \"Dream Friday\" gathering of all employees, company co-founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) holds a kind of pep rally in which he talks about the corporate culture and plans for the future, brings guest speakers to the stage and unveils new products, a la Steve Jobs. When Bailey shows off The Circle's marble-sized \"See Change\" cameras, which can be placed anywhere and transmit anything to everyone, he sells it as a way to motivate average people to behave better and hold people in power accountable. At first, Mae expresses concerns about the privacy implications, but when one of the cameras results in her being rescued from a dangerous situation, she becomes the company's poster child for universal transparency. She agrees to be the first person to \"go transparent\" and wear a See Change camera 24/7, with viewers around the world commenting in real time on her every action and activity. Meanwhile, her drinking of the Kool-Aid brings her into the inner\u0085 circle with Bailey and company co-founder, Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt), but raises serious concerns from Annie, Mae's old friend, Mercer (Ellar Coltrane), Mae's parents (Glenn Headley and, in his final film role, the late Bill Paxton), and a mysterious Circle employee (John Boyega), and has serious implications for her life.\n\n\"The Circle\" raises important privacy issues, but does it through a non-sensical story. Examining the trade-off between the rise of technology and the decline of privacy is important, but doing so effectively requires characters who act like real people. The screenwriters, Eggers (adapting his book) and James Ponsoldt (who also directs), give us a cast of characters who not only drink the Kool-Aid, but who all have a hand in making the Kool-Aid and then serving it to others. If there were this many such people in one place in the real world, we'd call it an insane asylum. None of the characters even seem to understand or care about the obvious troubling and untenable implications of the Circle in their own lives. Other than one Circle insider, Mae comes closest to expressing concern about where all this is going, but she waffles repeatedly and sometimes does things that contradict her own self-interest. But don't count on the talented and accomplished cast to save this film. All of the main actors come across just as clueless and self-contradictory as their characters. Round and round they go, where the valid points in this movie are to be found, no one knows. This film deserves points for dealing with questions of privacy and accountability in our rapidly changing, increasingly open modern society, but then loses most of those points for its ridiculous script and disappointing performances. \"C-\""

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Circle\" emerges with a 6/10 rating, comfortably settling in the \"wasn't bad\" territory. The film boasts a stellar cast, with standout performances from Emma Watson and Tom Hanks, who inject life into a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked technology and surveillance. Its strength lies in the thought-provoking questions it raises about privacy and the consequences of living in a hyper-connected world. However, it falters in its execution, struggling to maintain a consistent tone and occasionally losing its grip on the narrative. The film's music and cinematography effectively build a sense of unease, but they don't fully compensate for its storytelling weaknesses. \"The Circle\" serves as a timely reminder of the ethical dilemmas surrounding technology but ultimately falls short of delivering a truly compelling cinematic experience."

It's so hard to see such a talented actress as Emma Watson bend and contort herself to play such a vapid coma, oversimplified, and underthought role.\n\nMy suspended a few hard eye rolls even to get this far in. This is almost a tropish caricature of what these producers feel a technology movie about data privacy should be. I get it, some of the scenarios are exaggerated to prove a point. The problem is, they all seem exaggerated to the nth degree which makes them just ridiculously silly. The producer should be embarrassed for creating something that they know in their hearts ranks no better than an after school movie."

As a corporation, The Circle wasn't doing anything that any other US corporation doesn't do. They engage in data mining, and want to know what you're doing every minute of the day. That isn't any different than Siri or Alexa, et al. It does shine a very brilliant light on corporate group-think, albeit it exaggerates. I've worked for companies like this, so it rings true to me."

There is some, but the public nature of all our acts changes who we are as social beings. Therefore, the former rules of story-telling are modified in consequence of that. This is not Mae's coming of age story as she rebels against Evil Corp--if that is your expectation, you will be disappointed. The story, as I take it, is about Mae's coming to terms, fully coming to terms, with a world where we are all transparent; and it is about the viewer also needing to come to terms with that. The bosses of the Circle are not villains, and even their hypocrisy is understandable. There is no hiding; all of us have to learn to bear scrutiny. Those 'off the grid' are destroyed, and even the gung-ho supporters of the company, aside from Ty and Mae, don't see the consequences of what The Circle is about. The viewer should note that tremendous good is also done by the company. The very disconcerting message is that we are headed toward a world of complete transparency: we can't turn back, but should we even want to? The world leaders as well will have to accept being transparent. The ethics will need to be worked out, but yesterday's moral principles will not serve us well. It may not be in the guise of a god, but social omnipresence is coming."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mae (Emma Watson) unexpectedly lands a job at The Circle - a social media company which seems to be an amalgam of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon etc. - but mostly Facebook (allegedly). She's carried away on a wave of optimism for the life-sharing potential of the software forgetting the importance of privacy.\n\nAnd it's privacy, and the way social media software can steal it from us, that's the theme of the movie. Some scenes are eerily prescient - particularly one involving voting and elections.\n\nSadly, a strong theme and some accurate predictions don't make a movie. We need strong characters who we care about. But Mae's motivations are confused, changing and contradictory and ultimately she loses our sympathy.\n\nThe other main character is the boss of the company. We could call him Jeff Zuckjob, but actually he's called Bailey and played by Tom Hanks. For such a character, a thin veneer of social largesse hides a deep obsession with what salable data can be collected, who would want to buy it, and how could they use it. What drives these people is power and ultimately money - if we're looking for Bailey's motivation: follow the money. But unfortunately the film just doesn't do that. We get no more than the vaguest of hints as to what really drives The Circle and what drives Bailey, so his character too ends up being unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the end, the exposition of the theme gets in the way of the story.\n\nIt's been suggested on here that a strong cast were sold on the importance of the theme before they read the screenplay. Emma, and particularly Tom with his age and experience, should really have fixed this before it got to the screen. But maybe that's not how Hollywood works these days.\n\nIf you're looking to see political issues cleverly woven into a movie, try Pelican Brief, or Erin Brokovich. Oh. Actually, both with Julia Roberts. I wonder if that's significant."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of the most difficul reviews for me to do; and I have done thousands of them. It is probably because I am on unsure philosophical footing about what the potential of mankind should be, as opposed to what it will likely become. For this reason alone; the ability to make one question one's values, the film deserves a rating of above average. The acting is pretty good. The entire cast does a good job, even though Emma's parents are a bit creepy. But then again, arent all our parents a bit creepy? And dont you think your kids will think you are a bit creepy when they get older? Not that we don't love our parents deeply and without reservation, but we certainly do not approve of everything our parents believe in or do. Nor do our parents believe or approve of everything we do. And our children will not approve or believe in everything we believe in or do. That is the way of the world from generation to generation. The film examines a company that would be the combined social network of all social networks currently in existance. Facebook plus Twitter plus Google, plus Yahoo, plus We Chat, plus X,Y,Z....and so on. The leader of the Circle, Tom Hanks, is a combination of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and every other multinational leader you can think of, but without the consummate charm of Tom Hanks. How could such a person fail to convince millions? But the deeper question here is not whether Tom Hanks and the Circle are good or bad, but whether we have any alternative scenario to this eventuality of singularity. Are we destined to be the Borg from Star Trek, but without all the uncomfortable hardware? Is total transparency possible and/or desirable? Emma practically drives her love interest crazy and to his premature death, yet she shrugs it off in a matter of days. Emma violates the privacy of her parents' innermost secrets without their consent, yet shrugs that off in a matter of days as well. It appears as if she has a very high opinon of her own existence in relation to the existence of others. Is she better than her love interest and her parents? Not likely. The film makes certain assumptions about equality and fairness that are highly unlikely and improbable. What are the chances that boomers, Xgens, Millenials and other age groups will have a consensus of what is acceptable in the social context? The chances are slim and none. The real question is actually whether or not a very few elite can totally dominate millions of the masses, and that answer is still up for grabs. The only difference between Tom Hanks and Hitler is that Hanks has much better tech to work with, and, of course, his much better personality. This is not a cult we are talking about, because cults tend to be small and secretive. This is something that is apparently transparent and on an enormous human scale. Nothing is more dangerous than something that is appealing to the masses that turns out not to be such a good idea. This kind of world would be appealing to extroverts, but horrifying for introverts. It would intrusive for those who like to keep secrets (wouldnt that be most of us?), yet appealing to those who have nothing to hide. Of late, the AI concern is about robots taking over the world from humans, but this film has a different scenario; it has humans in control of holistic technology. We might be better off with the robots in charge."

There's only one major flaw in this film, defining all its problems - it's just too short for the proposed contents - and, unfortunately, there was no way to make it work any better in this format. I never read the original book, and maybe I should - one thing that I've learned from this film is that the book is probably nothing short of a great reading. Unfortunately, as mentioned already, format of a movie theater film may never physically fit all the plot, drama and revelations that the book apparently had. I still revere the filmmakers for what they were able to do - fitting that many of the ideas and images of looming great new world into this short amount of screentime, in more or less sane order. Most probably, the book has enough material to fill a whole season or two of a well-made serial, totally worth watching... it feels like a lost TV opportunity - I can only guess that a short-term movie format gains took over, whatever they were. I shall say, that for me it was probably easier to recognize the essence behind the brief schematics that this film largely creates, as I am well acquainted with the tech world of Silicon Valley and understand much of what it's about - and what it's not. The film posts many more questions rather than suggesting definitive answers, and to me it's a strong pont, prompting users to start thinking for themselves... though, apparently, not many are capable of that anymore. My only wish here is that the filmmakers would unfold this film into full-fledged serial with the same actors - in my view, it would undoubtedly have a killer success on TV, also gaining much larger auditorium, thus having much larger impact on people's understanding of what we are heading into."

Tom Hanks (Eamon) and Patton Oswalt (Tom) fit well, though their characters aren't delved into enough; similarly with John Boyega's Ty, who is severely underused.\n\nThere are many things they could've went more deep into, especially the clearly harsher intentions of Eamon and Tom. I'm also sure Ty has much more intrigue about him that we don't see. Even with Mae's parents, it would've been nice to see more of their story.\n\nThis film also features the cringey/fake sense of improved workplace morale that these type of productions do; reminiscent of films like 'The Intern' and 'The Internship'. 2005's 'The Island' has a somewhat similar premise to this, but goes without the aforementioned and it makes for way more compelling viewing.\n\nWatson, Hanks et al. certainly raise my feelings for it, but I would've loved to see this take a much more in-depth, darker look into its world."

It's an idea movie without any dramatic drive; its protagonist is little more than a hapless leaf on a windy day. Emma \"You have to ask again?\" Watson is a lovely young actor, and occasionally quite good, but she's thoroughly miscast here. Talents like Paxton, Headly, Tom \"Don't ask\" Hanks, and Patton \"C'mon!\" Oswalt are equally wasted or misused.

He was very good at selecting the scripts of his movies recently and looks like he thought this would be a good one but the end result was not what he must have expected. I would say it was not what i had expected from him. This story had the potential to be a super good thriller on how the internet is trying to invade our privacy and how it could be disastrous if not used in the right way but nothing imperatively comes out of the movie.\n\nI would suggest to avoid this movie in theaters and wait for it to come in one of those online streaming sites like Netflix and you could give it a try since you are not going to pay anything extra for the movie."

Emma Watson plays a hollow character, and her character growth seems very artificial.\n\nMy recommendation to everyone is to skip this and go watch Black Mirror if by some chance you already haven't. Another recommendation is this years' Nerve, also a movie centered around modern technology, but rather well made when compared to this."

I find it hard to believe - the 'deer killer' is a good example of the judgement by social media that is becoming more prevalent.\n\nI find a lot of amateur critics home in on the same points, no depth to the characters, flaws in the plot etc without seeing the bigger picture. I believe that the film is deliberately trying to distance us from the main characters because the film is not about the characters but the power of social media giants and internet data hoarders.\n\nFor anybody interested in the future of personal privacy I highly recommend this as a thought-provoking and tense film to enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Techno-thriller The Circle would be more aptly titled Applauding for Platitudes: The Movie. Featuring numerous, embarrassing scenes of crowds laughing, clapping, oohing and ahhing at some Steve-Jobs-esque speaker presenting a rudimentary new idea as if it's a game-changer speaks to how the film feels about itself. Unfortunately, The Circle is not nearly as clever or important as it thinks it is. More Divergent franchise than Social Network, it's a slick, predictable sci-fi snooze. This story about a tech-company's (think Google, Apple) mysterious control and oversight over its consumers and employees is packed with talent. Written by acclaimed author Dave Eggers (Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius) and directed by talented indie director Ponsoldt (Spectacular Now, End of the Tour), it's a mystery as to what really went wrong here. The tone is a mess, trying to induce both laughs and chills (I think), but never landing either. In front of the camera is a plethora of prestige as well. However, other than Paxton, who gives a great final performance as a man with MS, there's not much to praise. Watson is aloof, Hanks is charming but one-note, Oswalt is out of his element, and Coltrane (the kid from Boyhood) answers the question about whether he can actually act (he cannot). There all stuck trying to make teenage-level, pop-philosophy more interesting than it is (\"Guys! Did you know privacy is important? And did you ALSO know that technology is infringing on that privacy?! We must be careful!\"). Maybe that's its goal, and maybe high-schoolers will respond to it as fascinatingly complex, but its onslaught of logical fallacies and unclear messaging just make it all fascinatingly confusing."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the technologically advanced times we live in, there is the struggle between embracing the technology and being all-consumed by it.  That is the central conflict of THE CIRCLE - should we become more consumed/monitored/guided by technology or is it already too invasive in our lives, robbing us of our privacy, intimacy and  humanity.  An interesting premise for discussion and could have been an interesting premise for a film.\n\nBut this film misses it's mark by trying to stand on both sides of this issue, never coming down on one side or the other ending up with a confusing mess that left me befuddled, bewildered and somewhat angry that I spent two hours in THE CIRCLE.\n\nBased on David Eggers novel of the same name, THE CIRCLE follows Emma Watson as she gets her dream job at tech giant THE CIRCLE (thinly veiled stand-in for Google or Apple) that is run by charismatic visionary Tom Hanks.  As she dives deeper into the THE CIRCLE, she must decide if Hanks is truly a visionary or a danger to mankind.\n\nThe trouble with this film starts with direction by James Ponsoldt (who also collaborated on the screenplay with Eggers).  The tone and direction of this film is uneven (at best).  Do we trust Hanks character?  Do we trust the Stepford Wive-esque employees of THE CIRCLE who have, clearly, \"drunk the Kool-aid\".  Is Watson's character's motives pure and innocent?\n\nWe'll never know the answer to all these questions as Ponsoldt starts digging into some interesting characters and situations only to abandon them for something else, then coming back to them in jarring ways that make no sense and really needed to be filled in better.\n\nTake, for example, Karen Gillan as Annie, a high-placed member of THE CIRCLE (at one point stating that she is part of \"the 40\" which, I take it, means she is in the inner circle).  She recruits and mentors here friend (Watson) to THE CIRCLE being gung-ho about the company and what it stands for and as enthusiastic about her job as anyone.  We then abandon this character for about 1/2 hour and when she returns she is \"rode hard and put away wet\", all glamour and spark gone, clearly burned out.   We then abandon her for another 1/2 hour only to find out that she is back home in Scotland, having \"got out\" of THE CIRCLE.  All fine and good - except we never find out what caused her to burn out, how did this change her and how did she get out.\n\nThe same changes go through Watson's character.  Her Mae goes from cautious to dubious to \"all-in\" at a moment's notice and I never really believed her throughout the film and when her character takes a 90 degree turn at the end of the film - for no apparent reason - the film lost me.\n\nThere are a couple of saving graces in the cast.  Bill Paxton (in his last film role) and Glenne Headly are grounding agents as Watson' parents and Patton Oswalt is interesting to watch as Hanks righthand man, twirling his mustache as a good villain should at the edges of the action, only to have no real denouement and he just sort of peters out, not really answering the question as to whether he is good, bad or misguided.\n\nBut the real let down for me was Hanks as THE CIRCLE'S leading light - Eion Bailey.  This is supposed to be a charismatic, yet ego-driven and flawed character a la Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Steve Jobs, but fails to do so.  Hanks is, quite frankly, miscast in this role and it feels like he is trying too hard to rely on his charisma with nothing underneath it.  And, like the rest of the film, his character's conclusion is sloppy, uneven and unsettling, never really answering the question - is he good/bad/dangerous?  He just sort of is.\n\nAnd that's all I can say about this film, it just \"is\".  It should have been more.\n\nLetter Grade:  C\n\n4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Mae's parents did a fine job, Bill Paxton was amazing (which goes to show that a great actor CAN make a difference in a weak movie) but the rest was just appalling. The dialogue between Mercer and Mae in the Circle's lobby was dreadful and cringe-worthy. I could not even look at how disconnected it all felt. Like I was watching outtakes from a different set. None of it was cohesive enough for me to even watch the film and feel for the characters.\n\nI don't like writing reviews, I really don't. This one however made me do it. Emma is a terrible actress, in this film she really excels at being mediocre at best. Sure, part of it might go to the writing and directing, but there has to be some sort of engagement from the actor into the role. In Emma I saw none. And when the movie solely focuses on the lead character's actions, for her to be THIS \"meh\", makes this movie a \"meh\" movie.\n\nI gave it a 3 out of 10 for good production values, decent music and for Mr. Paxton. Without him, it would have been rated 2 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Literally the only thing that needs to be said about this film is that Emma Watson is the star. Her career should have ended with the Harry Potter series as nothing she has produced since has offered any form of true entertainment value. Sorry scratch that The Perks Of Being A Wallflower wasn't too bad but everything else has been downright terrible. It's like you see one movie with Emma Watson in it and you've seen them all. I want to watch Colony also by her but am reluctant, same with Beauty and the Beast which I don't even know how she was cast for that.\n\nWhy do I not like her acting? She lacks human emotion. As if she has only experienced life through reading scripts and counting money. Ironic considering part of the meaning of this film. It may be expected for child actors/actresses to overdue facial expressions in a cute sort of way but when that carries on into an adult career, it's no longer cute but rather blatantly intentional thus destroying the mood. Every smirk or smile she makes looks forced rather than natural. As for her vocal performance she might as well have the script in her hand during the movie because her dull tone makes it seem like she's reading it out from a teleprompter anyways.\n\nAs for the movie itself and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The concept. The concept is the only thing that I took from this movie and thought hey that's interesting. The technology connecting everything part, the hazards and benefits. So they took a decent concept, threw in a washed out has-been (or three to be honest), slapped social media text all over the screen in a way that you could barely read them anyways (are we supposed to pause the movie during those moments), failed to dive into the concept more (could have been taken so much further), inhuman reactions to situations that occurred and finally killed it completely with a terrible ending to an overall mess of a plot.\n\nInstead of finishing this movie with a heart wrenching \"oh my gosh\" moment of awakening, like it seems you're are supposed to feel, I instead finished it feeling empty. As if I was hoping for a four course meal and instead got a piece of bread and butter. The climax felt really lame leading to a ridiculous reaction and an expected conclusion which again didn't offer anything of meaningful depth. Social media is good in ways but when overdone it can be harmful. Unplug. See the world through your eyes not a screen. Yawn. Great movie for 14 year old children who might be able to relate to the harm social media plays in terms of time management and connection but not really for adults with jobs and actual lives."

The same is with technology, if we ALL have our secrets revealed, they will stop being so much interesting. Nobody would care if you know everything about everyone.\n\nBUT..., this must be complete. There are no Bill Gates, Musk, or Bezos, that can be excluded. Everyone must be included in the society without secrets.\n\nTo have this type of society has two aspects. A very bad one, where every individual is totally controlled. And the other is that we lose every burden we have, related to the private/secret/social..., life. Being totally free of all secrets, we are pretty relaxed, because there is no difference between I and 'them', or secret/private and public."

There are many search and email platforms. And no one tells you on Facebook to post new photos everyday or where you went out to eat last night. The cognitive dissonance of people these days is insane. You literally share every detail on social media and then have the nerve to complain about privacy. While at the same time not realizing that you're the one sharing all that information. The whole premise of Google is evil makes little sense.\n\nI do agree, that the future could be cause for concern if Google does something similar to this but there is no evidence of that. I think, we need to all be more careful online and rely less on social media for socialization. The world then would be better and the movie fails to make that point. Instead, the movie really embraces the destructive forces of our current society as noted by the end. The payoff in the movie is somehow showing that if we new everything about the leaders of Google/Other tech co's then its okay if they know everything about us."

My biggest complaint is that it takes nothing new and wraps it in fancy paper and with a fancy bow. Tear off the paper and you have.. an empty box.\n\nOther than that it was great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before going to see \"The Circle,\" I checked the rating on IMDb. After seeing a surprisingly low 5.4, I thought, \"With that cast? It can't be that bad.\" (Then again, 2010's \"Valentine's Day\" happened, too.) To summarize the movie in the most efficient manner, I would say it was Hollywood's lengthy and failed attempt at a \"Black Mirror\" episode. Looking back on this movie, my favorite part is an exchange between our protagonist (?) Mae and her interviewer for her dream job. He's putting her through a lightning round of opinion-based questions, and asks, \"What's your biggest fear?\" We cut to an extreme close up (Oh boy! She's about to say something profound!), she pauses, and then replies, \"Unfulfilled potential.\" (Nailed it. Great answer. You've got the job.) Now I laugh, however, because that entire film was 2 hours of unfulfilled acting potential. They're good actors, but the dialogue, written in part by novelist Dave Eggers, was corny and ejected me from the world of participation in the film right back into mere viewership. Parts of this movie were mildly entertaining, and if you still want to go see it, by all means do so. I would recommend waiting until it's available on a streaming service you're probably already paying for instead."

She randomly gets thrown into situations where trust is being thrust upon her for seemingly no reason again and again.\n\nAdditionally, not enough time is spent critically on the dealings of the company. We see John Boyega's riled up enough to be seen seething in a corner to take it down but for some reason puts all his eggs into Emma Watson's basket, a woman he met once at a party who's special because she doesn't know who he is? Mmmk.

        "review_detailed_main": "You know, if a movie lets me down because of its plot, direction or characters, it's fine, I never get mad or angry at it. However, when a film has all of that and it still tries to trick me and every fan to go to the cinema by using a famous movie star (like, for example, Tom Hanks or John Boyega) on the main poster and trailers, for to only show them in four or five scenes ... Now that gets me frustrated!\n\nThe Circle is not only a very bad film but also had a marketing campaign extremely dishonest. I really feel bad for the cast because it has some brilliant actors in it. Tom Hanks is a legend, even if he only appears in a few scenes, he's incredibly charismatic and elevates his character. John Boyega (Kalden) is also great for a couple of moments that he's on the screen, but his character has nothing going for him. Emma Watson, well ... She's good. She's not brilliant nor perfect like she was in Beauty and the Beast, but she doesn't have a defining scene, a moment where she's truly able to shine.\n\nBoth Mae and the story have a similar route throughout the runtime. Both of them have a very interesting concept/premise, but their execution is horrible. Mae seems to be a regular girl, but the changes that her personality goes through are too extreme for me to buy them. The movie's plot follows that same path by having a really intriguing story that is taken to so unrealistic and implausible levels, that by the end, it can only be described as too dumb and stupid to be true.\n\nThe first act runs smoothly and it actually introduces its characters well, but the second and third act drop to a sleepy slow- burn, full of speeches in front of an annoying audience and with both plot and character development that doesn't make any sense. The ending has no resolution at all. There's barely a conflict throughout the film! They all agree with everything and when something goes wrong, they just go \"well, it's fine, let's move on\".\n\nIt's a very monotone movie since there's nothing happening, ever. I can only remember of ONE moment of stress or tension, whatever you want to call it. The rest of the film is just hearing people talking about some absurd stuff and watching them go absolutely crazy. It's filled with heavy exposition scenes, it's horribly edited (there's a bathroom scene that becomes cringe-worthy) and the script is just horrible.\n\nI don't even want to write anymore ... Not that I have that much more to say. Apparently, we can have BILLIONS of people connected at the same time watching a live stream ... BILLIONS. Yap ...\n\nThe Circle is one of the worst movies of the year and on top of that, it tried to lie to its audience by bringing in Tom Hanks to serve as poster and trailer's bait, even though he's just on the screen for barely a few scenes. The cast and the film's concept are the only reasons why it doesn't get an F rating. The plot's execution (script, editing and direction) is horrible. It's sleepy boring, it's incredibly monotone and its characters have nothing going for them. The ending is as dumb as the rest of the film: too stupid to be true."

At the center of this decision are a number of corporate conglomerates - Google, Apple, Facebook - take your pick. It's uncertain how close to home 'The Circle' hits, and how similar the fictional Silicon Valley company depicted in the film is, but it's definitely a thought-provoking premise.\n\nAs a film, however, 'The Circle' is more square. Despite the obvious star power of Emma Watson - who portrays a young, bright-eyed \"guppy\" at the organization and Tom Hanks - who plays his best idealistic-yet-devious executive set on securing as much control as possible - there are problems with the plot. Watson's Mae is a lower-class millennial trying to make ends meet while helping her family. She seemingly has a good head on her shoulders, but when she lands a job at The Circle, things start to change. Mae is written as such a wooden character, and while she was created in a way that should prompt audiences to really identify with her, it's difficult to do so. And this is sad, given the level of acting we know Watson is capable of.\n\nEverything is so dry, stale and boring. Billed as a futuristic thriller, 'The Circle' comes off as being very formulaic and unlike the innovative products that are at the center of the film. It kind of feels like what would happen if a board game came to life - 2D and fake. And sure, there is something to be said about the message at the heart of this film - assumably that we should think twice about using social media and technology, or at least acknowledge the concessions we are making to our privacy. But even this comes off as a throwaway talking point.\n\nThis film is a hollow effort from director James Ponsoldt, and audiences should stay clear of entering this 'Circle.'"

She didn't seem believable. Her delivery of lines was not strong. She reminded me of a person trying to act in a high school play that was not really into her part. This character's part demanded strength. Instead, Emma played the part of weak-willed victim. She should stick to playing Disney characters. Someone with some substance, more like Scarlet Johansson, would have been better suited for this movie's main character."

There is the inner echelon, the techno \"in crowd\" of a certain social status and its practitioners, and then there's the vast majority of the ordinary population, the \"out crowd\" who's existence management is perpetually woven into the ever evolving ubiquitous data grid.\n\nIn that context, this production does deliver . . . It's not really meant to have a standard beginning, middle, and then \"end\", more like a periscope into this potential emergent world. Many will become involuntary participants in, but are sold into this paradigm for convenience, cost savings, security, health and financial management and so on.\n\nWhat is most interesting, perhaps, is not so much the tech, which is already here for the most part, but the character studies of the people within this inner \"circle\", the passive aggressive pressure that they exert upon those around them to conform to their Orwellian double speak workers paradise, extending into every aspect of private lives, hovering 24/7 in a tech \"Utopia\" to continuously exert covert pressure to conform to the group think \"Circle\" paradigm.\n\nSome viewers may find this a bit frustrating, complaining that it's not really a standard beginning, middle and \"end\" (well, there is an ending of sorts, but of course no spoilers here), that's not really the focus of this production. The ending itself, such as it is, is momentarily clever in its own way, but not really plausible . . . The concept of the entire story, however, is already in various stages of implementation, here in the real world.\n\nIs it perfect? No, far from it, more plot holes than well aged Swiss cheese in some places, but overall, it does make its point via this dramatic vehicle.\n\nIt is well acted, Emma Watson delivers her character well, good production quality, the editing does weave together an eventstream that fits well with the intended context . . . I can can see going with 8 stars."

The main character Mae's decisions are so contradictory to her established personality, she feels very superficial and hard to relate to. Her actions seem to be without motive or any prior driving force.\n\nThe very apparent difference between a series like Black Mirror and a film like Circle, is that the former allows room for question of ethics and basic human rights. It provokes deep thought and discussion. I guess they intended to present a larger- than-life social commentary on the 'dangers of technology' but instead leave you absolutely disappointed with the poor writing and constant plot holes.

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I know it's fashionable to be 'down' on Hanks, but he was great, playing the avuncular 'visionary' here. I suppose that I was and am more interested in the philosophical aspects than filmography or whatever, and, on that level, this film is good fun.\n\nSure, the message is simple, but simple is good. One does experience a certain moral ambivalence about tech and its all-pervading, all-seeing nature...Google-bad, FB-bad etc. And of course they are.\n\nBut is every aspect of these companies bad? Are all the sequelae of their underpinning philosophies harmful? Are there good aspects of everybody knowing everything about everybody? And do those outweigh the harmful outcomes? If so, to what extent? On balance are secrets a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nSo, the key issue is not really about tech per se, but rather the issue of privacy. As always, the key question is whether one has anything to fear about being 'transparent' as Emma Watson's character is. I mean, if you do nothing bad, and think nothing bad, what do you have to fear from an Orwelian Big Brother? Why fear being watched all the time, if you are doing nothing wrong? And, if everyone is being watched, it allows us to see, find and punish the baddies, right?\n\nthe question is who decides who the baddies are? And who decides what behaviour is to be condemned? OK, we can say murderers are bad people. But what about people who do rude things with sex toys, as the parents do here? Who, ultimately decides what behaviour is 'bad'. And who elects, as our moral guardians, those 'deciders'? Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\n\nThis film answers that question with a poignant denouement.\n\nI think it's well done.\n\nOne thing I have learned about both film and book reviews is that one should never trust professional reviewers. Indeed, in my experience, the films to watch tend to be those that are slated by the critics. They just come across as resentful frustrated actors, artists, or writers. Trust real people."

Sure, the message they're going for comes across and manages to be a little affecting. We are presented with a scenario were almost nothing can be private anymore. Your everyday life can be seen by thousands of people all over the world. So, what really worked was the subject on surveillance because the filmmakers manage to show how it can go well and how it can go horribly wrong. It's true that we are living in an era full of social media. It makes you wonder how far it can go and if it's all for the better or not? That's what got to me. It did make me think that maybe we are spending too much time online. Sometimes it's time to step out. The thing is: There's a lot of other movies that explore this and most of them are better.\n\nI enjoyed how the movie looks and the soundtrack is alright. The problem is that the plot is just bland. The characters feel like the actors playing themselves. It's too focused on getting a point across that we don't have someone to care for. There is that part later in the movie were it does get a bit affecting, but that's basically it. Another issue is that it gets extremely exaggerated when it comes to what can go wrong with the ideas brought up. You have so much to work with and you bring it to such a level that it becomes unbelievable and almost laughable. I could not buy the fact that more people wouldn't think more clear throughout the movie. It made it even more difficult to care for what's going on. You are probably gonna find yourself waiting for the next Tom Hanks speech (Trust me, you get plenty of that) or wondering why John Boyega is in this movie. Emma Watson is OK here, I don't think she was given the right material though. They are all talents and I have nothing against them. But when these guys can't elevate the material given to them, then I'm sorry to say that we don't have very good direction. This is also Bill Paxton and Glenne Headly's final film roles. It was kind of sad seeing them here, but I will say that they both did great jobs with their supporting roles.\n\nThe best thing I can say is that it's watchable. The Tom Hanks speech scenes are fun at first, but after a while you realize that this character pretty much does the same thing over and over. Someone used a good word to describe \"The Circle\" and I'm gonna repeat it here: One note. This concept is interesting, but if you wanna catch peoples attention on the surveillance subject, then I think a documentary would work better. Yeah, it's a mediocre one. If you are on an airplane or something like that, then I'm sure this will due fine as entertainment."

She's the proverbial horse-led-to-water, shown the dark side of the company's aspirations and then, against all sense of reason, doubling down on her support for the new evil empire.

Having played Hermoine Granger so well I was apprehensive as to whether or not it would be possible to see beyond such a dominant and career defining roll but Emma sure did do this role justice and showed what a versatile actor she is and how drastically she has changed and developed her skills since her Hogwarts days. Tom Hanks as always, portrayed his character superbly. He expressed his characters business and entrepreneurial skills in a way which echoed those of the great, late Steve Jobs. This film takes us into a stark reality of the future we are rapidly heading into and explores the potential of technology and how it impacts our behavior and that of the people around us. Unlike most futuristic films, this is set in modern times and the technology is not so far fetched as to be inconceivable. The technology and it's usage is something we could be facing within just a few years! It is this which draws you in and makes this film so brilliant!! The heartbreaking relationship between Mae and Mercer really bring home the devastating potential of the way social media is advancing and the way in which it is used. The acting, setting and effects truly complimented each other. I highly recommend this film and ignore the negative feedback from others. If you give it a try you will be pleasantly surprised!! I have been impelled to read the book in which the film is based and takes its name from The Circle by Dave Eggers."

        "review_detailed_main": "***may contain spoilers but absolutely no gluten or lactose.\n\nA movie that makes you go hmmm.\n\nEmma Watson is known not only for her acting career but also for standing up for issues that she feels deserve attention. Unfortunately, the issues of her concern apparently do not extend to human rights violations by the major investor, the government of Abu Dhabi, in her latest movie, The Circle.\n\nGiven that the subject of the movie deals with a very complicated issue in the history of civil rights in the more enlightened parts of the world, namely privacy, the choice of that investor seems almost cynical. In fact, it seems suspiciously part of an ongoing campaign in recent times by many to whitewash Abu Dhabi's reputation.\n\nThe Circle is a bit of a mess, as far as any sensible narrative is concerned. The idea that the movie was forced onto the market prior to proper editing is supported by the fact that Tom Hanks also takes part in what amounts to a glib and ultimately ridiculous treatment of the serious issue of privacy rights in the tech age.\n\nWhether or not one is a fan of Tom Hanks, the thing that one could feel assured of on seeing his name in the credits of any movie was that a certain high standard of quality could be expected of the article delivered--and that kind of standard matters, in a world where hype has ever more might over quality.\n\nEven the most cursory glance on IMDb of Hank's career reveals a solid testimony of a dedicated professional acting talent--and this is precisely why one suspects that there must have been a huge miscalculation involved in the too early unedited release of The Circle. While I could not expect an Oscar standard performance from Emma Watson, I still expected more of Tom Hanks. After all, it's not as though he's just working for the money--hopefully--at this point in a long career. Hmmm.\n\nMaybe there's a director's cut hidden in the basement waiting on a time when the lawyers of a famous Silicon Valley search engine enterprise have lost their teeth. If not, then The Circle will only be famous for being Tom Hanks' worst movie, given his lukewarm presence--a rare event in his career--in a role that begs for a strong performance.\n\nDirector James Ponsoldt's previous work includes The Spectacular Now, a difficult but narratively balanced eventually-coming-of-age story, and Smashed, also a story about alcoholism that received excellent references from recovering alcoholics, as well as being a selection at the Sundance Film Festival of 2012. Based on the rendered quality of those two movies alone, the suspicion of a forced early release of The Circle looms even larger.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most about The Circle is the weak narrative, but there's also the fact that I still haven't yet seen an Emma Watson role that left any lasting impression on me. In fact, if it hadn't been for the names of Ponsoldt and Hanks, I wouldn't have given time to the hope that Emma might shine--as she could have, being in the company of two such solidly proved accomplished movie artists.\n\nThe Circle remains nonetheless worth watching, because the issue of privacy invasion certainly deserves serious public consideration, and if it helps younger viewers to consider the privacy effect of greater connectivity, then the viewers' time is well spent--as long as one manages to see beyond the investor's lack of regard for the same back home in Abu Dhabi."

Instead of denouncing The Circle, Mae fully embraces it. In the end, she leads society into the terrifying dystopia that the film warns against.\n\nHaving a protagonist whose actions contradict the central message of a film is a recipe for disaster. It sends mixed messages and ultimately confuses and alienates the audience.\n\nThe casting and look of the film are good, but the poor writing and lack of a strong, consistent theme keep The Circle from success."

She sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity. One of The Circle's other founders, Ty (John Boyega) is unhappy with the direction the company is taking and ropes in Mae to help expose the shenanigans.\n\nDirector James Ponsoldt co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers. The film is being marketed as a thriller. Em, it's not. This is the least suspenseful thriller since thrillers were first made. The Circle is marketed as keeping you on the edge of your seat. Well, it doesn't.\n\nEmma Watson brings youthful energy to her performance but even she doesn't break a suspenseful sweat. For the first time ever, Tom Hanks is pretty poor in a movie, just short of dialling in his performance. John Boyega is disappointing. This is Tom Hanks second time filming a Dave Eggers screenplay; last year's disappointing A Hologram for the King.\n\nOf note, among the cast is the late Bill Paxton. He plays Mae's father who suffers from MS. It is his last big screen outing and it's a shame that this is it. Kindly, the film is dedicated to him.\n\nAs far as this film is concerned; to borrow a quote from the late Bill\u0085\n\n\"It's game over man, game over!\n\nA very disappointing 2 out of 5 \u2013 to be avoided."

Connections were not made and omissions were not dealt with using visual story telling to help bring it altogether. The end product should have been treated as an outline so that a more polished and connected movie could be realised. Some sequences needed further development and fleshing out. That is achieved by not spelling out the plot to the audience but by using subtlety and telling the story partly visually. What a disappointment it must been for the great actors in this movie."

The film itself seems as though there should have had about 30-40 minutes more footage. The ending was abrupt. The reason for Mae's change of heart, though compelling...seemed a bit silly...you would think that people in charge of a large social media platform would be quick to amend any mistakes or errors that were started. Those users that were chasing her friend around should have already been informed and known that the guy wasn't doing what they thought. They should have made sure to clear the guys name, especially since Mae was their rep for the new products. Kind of silly. Anyway, biggest thing I saw was the awkward chemistry between the characters and what seemed to be a severely truncated story"

Just about every 2nd to 3rd scene in the film made me cringe inside. I kept thinking: \"why haven't I stopped this film yet?\" and it's only because I like to finish watching something I started, even if it's bad. I know that if I finish the film, then I can give it an honest review and here it is.\n\n'The Circle' should actually get a solid 1/10 but I'm giving it 2 extra points for Tom Hanks' great acting (as always) and the attempt at somewhat decent cinematography. Otherwise, the plot is jumbled up, the dialogue is so millennial, so exaggerated and so cheesy, it makes you want to curl up into a ball and hide from embarrassment for humanity. The message it tries to deliver is not very clear and certainly not a good one. Also, the possibility of something like this happening is almost 0%. If you're going to make a movie about the future, future technology and the future of social media, then put some thought into it and try to make it realistic so that people can go home and think about it for many days to come. I'd love to go through every single scene and analyze it in detail but I'd just get a headache.\n\nI believe that a complete and utter amateur made this film, then submitted it as a 'Black Mirror' episode for season 4, got an instant rejection and decided to release it as a feature film with a misleading poster (Tom Hanks doesn't appear nearly enough to warrant a picture on the poster) and a luring trailer, just to trick people into coming and hoping to at least break even or take a small loss on the whole thing."

Even after seeing what lack of privacy / corporate interest in her dad's illness (creepy, or what?), she seemed to have some vision of technological vision which she'd ditched as soon as she gained it.\n\nThere was criminal underuse of Karen Gillan, John Boyega who could have provided the other half of the story that wasn't told - the fightback.\n\nBut The Circle is a truly awful film.

But that's the problem; there were only a few moments like that. Whenever it tried to get deep, the acting and over the top nature of the film muddied what little quality was there, and since the film was nearly 2 hours, they had to shove in all these useless characters that offered nothing special to the story. They never made any real impact, except maybe the dead character, but other than that, they just made the film EXCRUCIATINGLY long. It would've made a fantastic short film if they had just cut out all the useless characters, and kept Emma, the dead character, and Tom Hank's character.

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps I went into the movie theater with very high expectations. Or perhaps \"The Net\" has imprinted on me too deeply at a very young age. Whatever the explanation, The Circle objectively fails to engage the viewer, to leave a memorable experience. Yes, the movie has all the ingredients for success, but it somehow fails to touch.\n\nThe first problem is the camera work. Watson's performance is more than worthy, but the camera fails to capture it in an engaging way. On the other hand, Coltrane (Mercer) is just appalling. Both the camera and Coltrane's performance make the scenes between The Heroine and her love interest(?) look cheap, and the line delivery wooden. All this is particularly bad in a scene of a fight between the two - a scene with a lot of emotion - that is filmed literally from outside the building! Most of the time in that scene, all you see is two vaguely familiar human shapes, and you cannot connect to the characters. Add this to the wooden dialogue of the scene, and it turns into a complete failure.\n\nThe script contains too many narrative roles rather than characters. It diversifies without delivering, and major key plot events are missing. Episodes of hacking that should feature in a such movie, are completely absent, even though the results are dramatic for the story. For some characters, sudden dramatic changes take place completely off screen, leaving the viewer rather bewildered, struggling to fill in the gaps. Another problem with the script is that it does not give The Heroine too much credit. It reuses expressions like \"let's take it a step farther\" and strongly suggests that a CEO of a company like Apple or Google would accept advice from an intern on matters that border national security or the definition of democracy. It is ridiculous and it turns the movie into a science fiction wannabe. It would have been much more believable if The Heroine would have discovered those things, struggle with them, question them and then act.\n\nBoyega (Ty) does step out of his Star Wars role. He is less intense and believable, but his character lacks depth and plays almost no role in the movie as a whole. Again, it's the script! One could realistically argue that the outcome would be the same with or without Boyega's character showing The Heroine an empty tunnel and provide her with a confused, fragmented story that is neither about the past, the present or the future, but a hodgepodge of memories and concerns that are not backed by the plot.\n\nAll in all, the idea had potential, the theme is a current one, but the camera work and the unfinished (?) script fly this movie right into the ground."

He presented very his main characters, their differences, their goals and feelings, something that made possible for the audience to relate to them. The interpretations of Emma Watson who played as Mae, Tom Hanks who played as Bailey, Karen Gillan who played as Annie and John Boyega who played as Ty were good and their combination worked very well.

The Circle, written by Dave Eggers, is the story of a young woman named Mae who gets a position at the prestigious tech company \"The Circle.\" I found the book to be rather interesting (although a bit of a downer). The book is so dense that I figured they'd cut a lot and change things around. The movie manages to keep just about all the dialogue the same, but it does cut some stuff that I felt was important. In the end it makes for a very messy movie that probably shouldn't have been made into a movie. Even with a star studded cast. I see The Circle more as a collection of ideas that are more or less likely in the real world. Ideas like full time surveillance are just too much of a scary thought. If you do chose to watch The Circle, see it as a cautionary tale."

If the TPTB think that they can use the technology to just spy and exploit the consumers, they are sorely mistaken ... we will 'spy' them as well, technology doesn't work ... one way. They hide the biggest lies (aka secrets) ... they have the potential to commit grave criminal acts ... under the cover of 'state secret' ... they are the ones to fear disclosures ... and the disclosure is coming for them ... either way, as soon as a critical mass of people will realize that their 'secrecy' is not a requirement for the public mandate they were given, and informations can be gathered legit and with respecting fundamental rights! This is the future that will most likely happen ... not the one in the most dystopian movies ... we will have either a 100% participative democracy or anarchy ... different variations of the slave state ... are a thing of the past not the future. People will not give away any right they rightfully conquered so far ... and revert back to a tribal system of government. The main function of technology is to bring ideological evolution not involution. I'm sure that at a certain moment in the near future ... a critical mass of world citizens will understand that technology is meant to serve, not to exploit ... and will take the correct political and economical fail-safe ... to see that purpose fulfilled."

I think Emma Watson, Karen Gillian, and Tom Hanks were cast well and did a good job. Some supporting actors were not. And a lot of great lines, even scary ones. Many too realistic, things I've seen in the tech industry, or which seemed perfect to be said by beardy founders lounging in a chair on a stage.\n\nBut, there is not much of a story there. The big conflict is out in the open almost immediately. John Boyega is tasked with excessively filling in the gaps when it wasn't needed, such that it damages the story and sucks all the tension out of what is left of the plot.\n\nI even liked, unusually, the digital message overlays.

Except this applies to Facebook and plenty of other technology. It's not a new issue. But these characters mostly act like a bunch of dumb idiots and, the super smart ones who are supposed to have people skills, have none. They telegraph issues 50 miles away. For example, I knew the movie was going to be a dud when our heroine just begins and the pair of social bunnies for the circle rattle off how she should participate more, etc. and then begin to mention things casually about her family that they shouldn't know. I mean like OMG!!!! How freaking weird!!!! Like.... OMG... this is like big brother!!!! This movie was written for people with a 2 digit IQ or for children under the age of 10. Perhaps they might need explanation about a world they don't yet fully understand and appreciate. But anyone high school or older will laugh at this comedy.\n\nEvery scene desperately tries to hit the viewer over the head with its point. And in case you missed it, they make sure to smack you over the head with yet more over the top behavior just to make sure you got the heavy question and moral issue they intend to raise! This movie is terrible and only watchable with a good drink and friends over so you can laugh at it and mock the screen like MST3K. Yes it is that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE CIRCLE (LOGAN AT THE MOVIES) REVIEW\n\nMae joins The Circle (media giant) as a low-level employee. A small act of rebellion throws her up the corporate ladder and she's soon in the driver's seat, navigating the company's biggest, riskiest plans involving internet privacy.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a warning advisory Big Brother cyber thriller combining plots from \"The Net\" (1995), \"The Truman Show\" (1998), \"Minority Report\", \"The Social Network\" to the recent \"Nerve\" and from a slew of Facebook-themed horror movies. We live in the digital age of out of the box, plugged in gadgets can be used as two-way a mirror. Whether we're freely making our lives accessible to family, friends and strangers, we're giving our privacy away without knowing what might happen.\n\nEmma Watson (hides her accent well) plays a sweet, intelligent and determined Mae, who gets a entry-level job with \"The Circle\", a huge and power hungry data-collecting and info-sharing company.\n\nMae attends a corporate gathering called \"Dream Friday,\" everyone's in an on-site auditorium to take in the wisdom of The Circle's co- founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), a Steve Jobs type alluring his worshipful flock with his warm, self- condemning humor and his grand visions. Eamon reveals a satellite connected camera the size of a small pebble that will cost less than pair of jeans he's sporting. Millions upon millions of these tiny cameras will placed in every spot in the world, without any government's permission.\n\nYet another step in The Circle's grand plan for total global transparency, everyone will always be under observation and wouldn't the world be a better place without secrets of any kind? In one of the film's more efficiently unnerving scenes, two disturbingly lively Circle managers confront Mae after her first week on the job and scold her for not participating in \"non- mandatory\" late night and weekend company activities customized to her personal life. I'm referring to her hobby of kayaking and her father Vinnie's (the late Bill Paxton in his final film role) MS. Mae goes from joking about drinking the company Kool-Aid to guzzling it, with out hesitation. She's so emotionally strained its almost hard to tell if she's playing along or messing with them as she buys into The Circle's ever intrusive game plan and becomes a rising star, especially after she agrees to wear a body cam 24/7 and share every detail of her life with anyone who has joined The Circle.\n\nJohn Boyega (Finn in \"Star Wars\") plays Ty, the inventor of The Circle's technology, who keeps showing up at the most fitting times to act as Mae's conscience. What's really odd no one seems to notice him at all, he's like a ghost.\n\nPatton Oswalt is Eamon's side hand as The Circle's COO. Karen Gillan plays Mae's best friend Annie, whose purpose is obvious the first time she appears on screen. While I love Tom Hanks the screenplay doesn't give away anything about Bailey's motivations.\n\n\"The Circle\" has an interesting premise and a stellar cast but even with that going for it, it seems lost in cyber space. Perhaps a more refined script and a more stable direction it would have faired better.\n\nRated PG-13 for a sexual situation, brief strong language and some thematic elements including drug use \u0095 I watched this on VidAngel there are a couple F bombs and A character's married parents are seen in bed over a video camera (clothed)\n\nI give it a C-"

A social commentary? A thriller (fail)? Drama?\n\nEmma Watson has grown as an actress but really don't believe she was the best choice as her attempt to play the wide-eyed innocent was too forced.\n\nIt's an OK watch for something in the background but keep the popcorn for something better."

Where a symbiosis of Big Brother (CIA), Big Business, and the Big Bad Guys (Mafia) form a unified Watcher's Association, whose logo could well be \ud83d\udc40! The CIA would be able to find anyone by tracing people who ogle a particular target. Big business ogles targets whose interests might be profitable to them. Ah! And the Mafia could ogle people for black mail purposes or for mining unremunerated creativity. A whole host of potential monetary projects could loom large. Needless to say, things could go South for everyone. And I say that it starts with computer safety and cell phone intrusion. Oh, and let's not forget...home surveillance. This movie was pretty well done. Enjoy! It's on Prime!"

You almost have to try your mind-reading ability and then give your best guess a lot of times.\n\nThe pacing of the story moves at break-neck speeds, leaving you to wonder how and why the characters did what they did, as fast as they did and made leaps in logic as fast as they do.\n\nThe acting, while good, is not enough to save the shallow, incomplete feel the movie has to it either. As always though, Tm Hanks steals the show - it's just a shame he had to be in this movie!\n\nAfter watching the movie, I can't figure out if it's trying to tell me the actions, events and opinions expressed by the main character(s) are good, bad, moral or immoral. I like to think the lead character is supposed to be a \"good\" person, but some of her decisions really leave me questioning her true motives. The end and her reaction to some key parts in the movie, leaves me wondering what kind of a heartless, *insert phrase here*, she really is.\n\nOn the more forgivable side, there are plenty of loose... err... sorta of poorly tied... ends. You're not really given much closure for a lot for elements and character stories.\n\nEither there is a lot of this movie that never made it off the chopping block, and is littering the recycling bin on hard drive somewhere, or the movie was really made this hastily and exposes its flaws for all of us to see.\n\nI know there was some larger message it was trying to relay and point to get across; it's obvious that it was trying, too hard, even. In order to appreciate that message though, there's just way too much clutter, poor writing, incomplete stories and unbelievable logic- gaps to get past.\n\nAntitrust (2001) was actually a much better movie, from the storytelling aspect, with a similar message and equally talented acting. Couldn't help but wish I were watching that one again, instead of this one!"

It has good performances from all involved and is directed well.\n\nI am one of those who hate film critics, because they take the enjoyment out of the film based on cynicle comments or one scene. This film delivers an enjoyable experience for a Saturday night date night with the Mrs without being bored. It should do better than critics reviews.

Every person with a little bit of brain can understand, just in the very first minutes, what is the message and what is the wrong part of it. I can do it by myself: \"hey guys, don't give away all your privacy to big companies!\". This doesn't make me the best deep thinker on the planet about the profound, complicated problems involved in such a difficult social topic. This movie is very poor on anything. Poor screnplay, poor acting, superficial examination and treatment of the privacy problem, unrealistic behavior of the characters without any reasons for the ways they act. So... a very important subject with heavy future implications treated in the worst, trivial and irritating way."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have not seen a laughable movie in a very long time. IMDB users rate this currently 5.3 perhaps only because people like Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. That is generous and I'm more inclined to agree with the lowly 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But seriously, from a major production perspective, it has to be perhaps the worst movie of the year. Almost everything was sadly wrong, or more accurately laughable. If it was made as a comedy satire, it might work but by taking itself seriously, it's like taking PeeWee Herman seriously. Emma Watson was a decent, popular child actress (Harry Potter series) but really doesn't have true thespian skills. Director James Ponsoldt makes a great Thanksgiving turkey here. Everything is wooden. Supporting actors are seriously bad. Karen Gillan plays her best friend Annie almost shines in her bathroom privacy chat. The most notable acting role was by the late Bill Paxton (he died before the release of the film) who played the protagonist's father. Tom Hanks can't save this film. The script is weak and tooooo predictable. Adding to the laughability is Danny Elfman's soundtrack who had a memorable Edward Scissorshand soundtrack but this one sounds like a xylophone played by a 6 year old. The problem is the soundtrack and supporting acting just gives a lack of seriousness. The stage presentations a la TEDx only worked for Tom Hanks in his initial SeeChange presentation which was fascinating but anything that follows crashes and burns. For a superior look at how we engage dysfunctionally with technology and social media, take a look at Black Mirror's episode \"Nosedive\" which I would rate a 9/10. Much superior and should have been made into a feature film. Not this dull turkey."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Circle is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time. A strong cast, headed by Emma Watson and Tom Hanks combined with the basics of a good story (a technology company that can't possibly be as good as it seems) should lead to strong results. Instead what is left is a mash up of ridiculous plot points and decisions.\n\nEmma Watson's character, Mae, is stuck in a dead end job when she is invited to work for The Circle, a hybrid of Google/Amazon/Apple corporation. Everything seems great at first, the campus is huge, and everyone is friendly. But Mae slowly is drawn deeper and deeper into the various different parts of the company.\n\nThe ridiculousness starts with the first new invention shown off, a camera that can be hidden anywhere, that transmits anything to the cloud to be stored, and can be had for $20. The idea that this kind of privacy depriving device would be not just legal but flourish to the point that they are everywhere strain belief. From there it only gets crazier. The Circle tries to butt its way into federal and then world politics. Employees talk as if they know what is best for the whole world.\n\nMae's decision making is also in question. She starts the movie questioning whether things are as perfect as they seem, but by halfway through the movie turns herself into a Truman Show by wearing a camera at all times. These decisions don't make sense with who we're supposed to believe she is, or other less trusting decisions she makes through the movie.\n\nThe ending itself is full of hypocrisy. Without totally ruining it, the ending basically says well, yeah, it's bad. But is it really?"

The ending comes as fast as her revenge to the big bosses. This movie is done for people until 14, because nobody who is older than that would show their personal lives uncut but if you have no secretes than everythin is better. The problem is you have no lovely community if you have 1 billion follower. There are many people who want to come as close as they can. Does the circle protect Emma? Not sure. Does it kill her best friend? Yes, but didn't she see that just some random people bring him to death? No. Why? Nobody cares. But she can solve all problems to make everything available for everyone. IF THE INFORMATIONS ARE IN GOOD HANDS. There are so many problems, about that but that would be in it's own a discussion. I hate this movie because of their sloppy message of privacy, big data and Influencer-Lifestlye. In the end nobody knows what the conclusion of the movie is... what were the E-Mails about? What happens to the parents? Does Emma find new friends?\n\nAnd please think of a good rating for this post, because otherwise my company will make me feel uncomfortable. Why not 100?"

Her female friend, played by Karen Gillan, did a far better performance.\n\nThere were quite a few plot points and ideas that were resolved but not to satisfaction. It was akin to a present not put together well: the paper ripped, the bow was not put on tight or centered, the tap was sticking properly, and the creasing and folds were off kilter.

It shows private surveillance in a negative light for the majority of the film, despite the fact that only a few characters oppose it. Every turn in the plot is unconvincing and frustrating, but admittedly surprising. The ending of the film is not satisfying in any way. In terms of cinematic devices, The Circle completes the bare minimum in order to have a plot. The sound-design, editing, and cinematography are bland. However, some choices in the visual effects were interesting, but very distracting.

Tom Hanks was doing a decent job as company boss having speeches and a very natural charismatic aura that kept my attention every time. Awkward is the word I would use Emma's acting here, I don't think she's good to play a young adult or teenager since it becomes too cheesy, remembering her role in \"the bling ring\".\n\nDialogs have been used to lose my interest in any detailed conversation, unexplainable mindchanging moments.

There are a couple of moments of ropey acting, even from the leads. The film hinges on a premise of fictional technology that sits on the cusp of what is real and what is not yet real, and rather than spoon-feed the audience as to what its all about the script instead relies on you having an awareness of what companies like Google and their parent Alphabet are already doing. If you are interested in technology then you will instantly draw comparisons between what is portrayed in the film and what already exists in reality.\n\nIf you are reading review of this film because you think you MIGHT enjoy it, then do give it a try because you probably will!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Circle (2017): There's something quite perfectly pitched about the release of The Circle. A techno thriller which has great message in it and brilliant star-cast (Emma Watson,Tom Hanks) and impressive trailers.But the movie is now one of the biggest disasters of 2017.So what went wrong? Plot: When Mae (Emma Watson) is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes, begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity.\n\nMy Review: There is a scene in the movie where Mae Holland introduces a new feature named Soul Search which helps in finding the persons anywhere in the world.She uses it to catch an escaped convict but when all the members force her to search her ex-boyfriend things go haywire.This is one of the best scenes of the year but unfortunately the only best scene in the movie.\n\nWith a strong plot in his hands,James Posoldt wasted his opportunity by making this bland film.With Emma Watson leading the way, and Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt, Karen Gillan, and John Boyega in supporting roles the movie is less likely to disappoint but it happened.The film is filled with intriguing questions about the balance of our social and professional lives and how they intermingle, and whether, with increased surveillance and the knowledge that we're being watched, our behavior would gradually improve. But The Circle is all foreplay, playfully prodding without providing a satisfying payoff.\n\nThe Circle literally plays as if it has been written by a bunch of elites that have spent a little bit too much time on their phones, decided that the world has become too dependent on technology, and now they're going to make a film that saves people from themselves. It's smug, condescending, and completely without incident.Dialogue too often drowns in exposition, a heavy hand taking over when a lighter touch is required.\n\nEven performances are not note-worthy.\n\nSO,The Circle is a major disappointment of this year which wasted a strong content.\n\nMy rating 5.25/10"

A capitalist democracy does not care what the individual does unless it infringes on another's freedom. Under communism everything can be an infringement against another's personal world but not freedom. There is no freedom under communism. Socialism leads to communism, just ask Marx..... This film attempts to confront a subject but it actually shows the opposite to be true. Typical left wing bullshit from Hollywood. Watch 1984 to determine if you use wrong speak or wrong thought just like Hollywood wants to determine who you are...."

The sub-structure of this film reminded me of the rhetoric of the \"Disfruita\" scene in Duck Season...I have properly labeled this striking parallel to The Circle for a various amount of reasons. First, The Circle was automatonic. Second, The Circle was auditory. Thirdly, The Circle was astounding. As with the Black and White features of Duck Season; the overall stability of the mechanized \"pelicula nueva\" deemed relevant the wide (positivity) \"mundo\" that encapsulates the audience. The delivery that the actors and actresses unveiled substantiated \"la verdad\" that most mimics the opening scene of The Circle. The colors and use of visual \"real-world\" cinematography escalated the emotions that carried The Circle to a necessary height; broadening the senses of the onlooker. As with the plot development of Duck Season; The Circle was quite a recollection of the inner thoughts of that under-fortiduous scene; whereby \"una mujer primitiva\" encounters \"un hombre primitivo\".

They tried to condense it into 110 minutes, stray immensely from the book and lose the original message intended. Mae's(Emma Watson) development as a person and how her personality changes as she joins this giant tech company is glossed over and you find yourself not caring about her one way or the other. While reading the book I couldn't stand her but I least at felt something. This was just bland and meh. I see why this movie came, went, and was forgotten when it was released.

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie Review: \"The Circle\" Rating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\n\"The Circle,\" starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks, asks an important question: it privacy a silly relic of the past? Mae (Emma Watson) gets a job at The Circle, a massive silicon valley company intentionally patterned after Facebook and Google. She settles into the company, which operates from an idyllic, park-like campus in a massive building shaped like a circle. Soon, she's assisting customers and pressured into joining the herd mentality of the Circle staff members.\n\nRun by Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), the Circle uses it's Facebook-like reach to \"help\" users by infiltrating every aspect of their daily lives, and is actively working to \"help\" more people by creating even more ways to invade their privacy. Their new initiative, \"SeeChange,\" involves placing miniature cameras everywhere. Eamon Bailey says the omnipresent camera system is designed to save people, but in a way that virtually eliminates any concept of privacy in public. \"Knowing is good but knowing everything is better,\" Bailey says at one point. But the new system, which Mae tests, exposes everything she does to a online audience, bringing embarrassment for herself and tragedy for those around her.\n\nUltimately, the movie fails on its promise as the story gets muddled in the middle when the story abruptly changes direction and Emma Watson's character becomes an integral part of the company. She must then decide whether or not to go along with the founder's schemes or expose them. I feel like the script needed another round or two of revisions to work out some of the obvious plot issues, and the ending is strange. I'll leave it for you to decide, but I thought the ending was a weird and somewhat creepy cop-out.\n\nThe Circle, directed by James Ponsoldt, is based on a book by David Eggars, and stars Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, and, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role, John Boyega. Released in 2017. Interestingly, Emma Watson's parents are played by Bill Paxton, who died before the film's release, and Glenne Headly, who died two months after the film's release."

The best moments in The Circle are the cerebral ones: Bailey's pep talks and the inner circle's brainstorming sessions. Mae's on-line odyssey \u2013 from obscurity to fame to desirous of a moment's solitude \u2013 might have been more interesting if it had been given time to develop. The Circle has a schizophrenic feel. In the end, it's not easy to decode what the precise bottom line is beyond the rather boring refrain of \"loss of freedom is what it is paid for greater connectivity.\""

Don't take me wrong, the movie isn't bad, but the unfulfilled potential (which is actually a line from the main character) is titanic. In conclusion, this movie has very actual topics and interesting questions, yet it fell short on the reflection and the answers."

        "review_detailed_main": "James Ponsoldt juggles with Emma Watson in the mixed messages ambiguous techno thriller.\n\nSet in the near future, Mae (Watson) is a typical desk office employee, until she gets a job a the biggest technologically established cooperation known as the Circle, ran by Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks, that right Hanks is involved). When she nervously joins the massive group of ambiguous 'circlers', she gets drawn in a plot and aim of enriching the world through use of ultimate surveillance and the death of privacy.\n\nBased off Dave Eggers novel, the Circle is full of potential with its intriguing narrative reflecting the current society values of technology, and social media and where this will take us in the future. But however this spins out of control in an obsessive, wooden, and hollow film trying to say something but not very successfully. Surrounded by a plot then another plot, then other small subplots, trying to keep the film 'connected' eventually falls flat on its face. At first the film becomes the start of every college movie, then right into a evil cooperation film, which then turns into prequel to the Matrix.\n\nWhat first majorly fails the film is Ponsoldt's directing, who clearly demonstrates ambition throughout the film, but struggles to keep it together with a poor screenplay and weak constructed scenes. When I say 'juggle' Ponsoldt seems to twist the direction of where the film wants to be. With is intriguing ideas, it first appears to be going against theses concepts, but somehow then creates a glorifying theme to it, which becomes very sickening by the end. The substance is creepy but the film does very little to express this, which makes the film confused in its intentions.\n\nCombined with he poor script is incredible wooden acting coming from the ensemble cast. With an A-list cast like this, what could go wrong. Emma Watson at first does well to play the suspicious outsider of the Circle, if that was her role throughout the film, she then become a blank changeable face, not the character that we trust and see this world of the Circle through. John Boyega is okay for the few seconds he is even present, and then becomes a extra for the remaining time. Tom Hanks is just having fun with himself and successfully so in the first lecture scene, but then is just there with no real life. I was hoping that Hanks could be the one redeeming factor but unfortunately his' role is so side lined his barely mentionable. The real poor contribution is sadly delivered by Eller Coltrane as Mae's childhood friend Mercer, who although is not an important character has some of the most lifeless scenes of acting I have ever seen, which is a real shame since Coltrane made his name in the magnificent Boyhood (2014).\n\nIts not frustratingly bad, just weirdly bad. Not 100% of the time though, the film does have some gripping moments which may still entertain once you get pass the creepiness hidden in the Circle. But this never lasts.\n\nIts hard to tell whether the film is achieving what it wants. If it wants to make a statement on technology, then it does successfully does so with a ending feeling of disgust, but if it is simply a film then it can become an easily unlikable film. 5.3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "...or have we created it already without actually realising it?\n\nFirst of all, it's probably a good idea to discount any IMDb reviews that rate this film less than 5, because these will generally be from people (I've checked!) who either think this is paranoid conspiracy nonsense that would never be allowed to happen... or who simply don't want to imagine it happening because they're so deeply embedded in the 'world' the film portrays that it would undermine everything they have been brought up and conditioned to accept without question. Upton Sinclair once said 'Never expect a man to believe something if his salary depends upon his not believing it.' The same can be said for this. If your life is so connected now that you could not cope otherwise, you don't want anyone pointing out the serious downsides of what you're buying into. And before anyone pipes up with 'But we do have a choice', they need to really think about what they're saying. Okay... you can choose to opt out of the hyper-connected life, disable all of your social media accounts, disable the internet on your phone. Go on, then - do it.\n\nGo on.\n\nYou have a choice.\n\nDon't you?\n\nDon't you?\n\nSo... maybe you don't, after all. At the time of my writing, this film was already seven years old. In seven years, the tech (and our dependence on it) has moved on enormously. Seven years ago, you didn't routinely see children as young as 7 or 8 going to school with smartphones. Now you do. At one point in the film, a medical technician mentions that chips are inserted into the bones of children at birth so that they can always be tracked. At that time, it was still a very far-fetched idea. Now, though - as the phone has become more and more an essential part of most people's lives - we have to ask how much longer it will be before that idea of chip insertion (at least in consenting adults in the early stages) happens. How much longer are we going to want to walk around all day effectively hindered - disabled, you might say - in our actions and movements by the need to hold onto a device? Just look around you now, when you go out. How many people do you see not interacting with their phone in some way... even if it's just to do that very old-fashioned thing and call someone up for a chat? Hardly anyone.\n\nThe film is good at showing how we've all be sucked in by the perceived benefits of this tech: instant access to information, wherever we happen to be (as long as there's good wi-fi or signal strength); being able to keep track of our loved ones at every moment of the day; being able to share every moment of our lives - the highs and lows - to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people, most of whom we will never meet or know properly. The ironies are there in all of those 'benefits': the loss of privacy, the capability of being tracked wherever we go and whatever we do. Never before in history have the creations of a few dozen middle-class guys in Silicon Valley been able to effectively control the thoughts, actions and lives - and yes, I do mean control - of billions of people. Aldous Huxley had it so right when he prophesised that we won't feel repressed by this level of surveillance, or by the tools through which it happens. Instead, we'll willingly accept them, pay large sums for them, cosset them, love them... and never be able to imagine our lives again without them.\n\nIf you don't believe that, then try looking at it like this. If your government made it mandatory for every person in the country to have a bracelet or anklet permanently attached to them so that their every move could be tracked and registered, wouldn't there be an outcry about invasion of privacy, and violations of civil liberties and human rights? Sure there would. But what do we have with the smartphone? And not only does it track our moves, it also contains all of our personal data, financial details, medical conditions, thoughts and feelings, beliefs... and those of our contacts, too. And we think it's great, and don't offer up any resistance at all. Shows how remarkably well this has all been sold on us, doesn't it? And 'sold' is the right word, given the business model of all the social media platforms. Your attention is their income. As the old saying in Silicon Valley goes: 'If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.'\n\nThe crunch will come, of course, when the networks shut down or are taken over - as has more recently been dramatised in the excellent 'Leave The World Behind'. What happens when hackers, intent on chaos, domination and destruction, take control? What happens when the satellites are taken out? What happens when the 'connection' suddenly... vanishes? As the Ethan Hawke character says so pertinently in the latter film: 'Without my cell phone and GPS, I'm lost. I'm a useless man.' These are fictions, of course. But what is good fiction for if not to offer us the ability to reflect on the facts of our own lives?\n\nThinking people everywhere - including those, like myself, who may have initially bought into all of this because of the positives it seemed to offer - will see this as a warning to us all. What we're embracing here could just be checkmate on humanity.\n\nEveryone else will just carry on, dismissing people such as myself - who have chosen not to have a smartphone - as dinosaurs. Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm tech-savvy and internet-savvy. But solely on my own terms, during my own set times, when I'm at home on my PC. Otherwise, I'm free of it. Free to enjoy my privacy. Free to go for long walks and experience the real world, to daydream, to think. To disengage completely. And the clues are there in some of the responses I got from friends when I shut down my social media accounts. 'What's wrong? Where are you?' The subtext is often 'What have you got to hide?'\n\nNothing. Rather, I have something very important and precious to preserve. My privacy.\n\nAnd my sanity."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Circle\" is based on a novel by Dave Eggers (who also co-wrote the screenplay). I've never read the book but there is a loose parallel here with Dante's Inferno; Virgil traveling down the slippery, spiralled slope of social media towards the entropic end of personal privacy. If that sentence seem heavy-handed, pretentious, and contradictory then prepare yourself for The Circle.\n\nThe Circle is a multi-national tech conglomerate consisting of Google, Facebook, Snap, Instagram and Twitter rolled into one; a not-underused concept. Even less creativity went into the one-dimensional characters from a soap opera checklist, featuring: 1. Mae (Emma Watson), a naive 20-something just starting her career; 2. her over-worked best friend Annie (Karen Gillan); 3. her obviously evil COO Stenton (Patton Oswalt); 4. her sexy, enigmatic crush Ty (John Boyega); 5. her salt of the earth parents (Bill Paxton and Glenne Headly) and of course 6. her artsy, childhood friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) drowning in unrequited love, whose sole purpose is to set up the most obvious twist ever.\n\nThe film flirts with high-minded allegory, yet wallows in hapless melodrama to pursue that lucrative YA audience. The result is a muddied, re-written mess, featuring stale dialogue, character arcs that go nowhere or flip randomly and frustratingly wooden portrayals. Certain scenes are SO contrived that it becomes wince inducing and the series of choices Mae makes are less naivety than they are blithe stupidity. The brightest points of the film are, not surprisingly, Tom Hanks' dangerously likable turn as CEO Bailey, (who seems to be an amalgam of Jobs and Gates).\n\n\"The Circle\" is an After-School Special masquerading as high-brow entertainment. It's pretentious in the worst way, portending serious societal issues, then shirking away from addressing them in realistic, useful ways in order to manipulate the audience. It's muddled, unsure of itself, and gives adolescent answers to adult questions. With this cast and this concept it should have been so much MORE than it is. But ultimately it just argues itself in circles, and lends nothing to the discussion. Watch 'Eye in the Sky,' 'We Live in Public,' 'Ex Machina' or even 'Wall-E' for entertaining critiques on technology's role in society. Or stab your eyes out. Either way do not join The Circle."

As a woman who kayaks alone in Northern California, I find the protagonist relatable. She could have been cast as a guy, but they did not (thankfully) change the plot when casting her as a girl. I like that - while the film is about young attractive people, they did not make it touchy-feely. Also, that they didn't' sugar coat some moments.\n\nI am not going to put any spoilers in it, I do recommend you watch it, you won't be bored."
