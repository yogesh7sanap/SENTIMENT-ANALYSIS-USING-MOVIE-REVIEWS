Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad, it just really wasn't as funny as it was supposed to be. I can honestly say that I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie.\n\nFor a movie of this type, then \"The Hungover Games\" takes on a variety of other movies, such as \"Ted\", \"The Hunger Games\" (obviously), \"Pirates of the Caribean\", \"Avatar\", \"The Hangover\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Human Centipede\", \"The Lone Ranger\", and so forth. It is meant well, I am sure of it, but the comedy just slipped through every crack possible.\n\nThe acting in the movie was adequate, and people were doing fair jobs with their given roles, they just didn't have too much of a script to work with.\n\nI used to love spoofs, such as \"Hot Shots\", \"Scary Movie\" and the like. Whether it is because I outgrew the genre, or because the spoof movies today are lacking what they did back in the 1990's, I do not know.\n\n\"The Hungover Games\" is good enough entertainment if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."

Caitlyn Jenner is also present, for some reason.\n\nVerdict\n\nWe went through a spate of these types of movies, Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans etc and let's be honest the one consistent thing about them is that they were all truly unconditionally awful.\n\nThe Hungover Games is the same thing, please allow me to break it down for you. Loosely splice two current popular movies concepts, throw in lots of current pop culture references and characters (All the things currently trending), incorporate humor befitting an 8 year old and boom you have yourself 90 minutes of stupidity off the scale.\n\nThe Hungover Games also slaps us with overwhelming levels of \"T&A\" which returns to the 8 year old mentality.\n\nNever mind Panto, this is where careers go to die.\n\nRants\n\nWho are these films for? I genuinely don't understand it. It's not loaded with easter eggs and neat references people will appreciate, the Avatar character for example is just a naked woman painted blue who contributes nothing and is only on screen briefly. The humor is juvenile but the movie rating is too high for children, adult's will find it infantile, there is no real plot, the cast don't even try, it's just all so truly terrible!

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is dumb. Just look at the name. Yeah, I know it's not supposed to be smart but it is supposed to be funny, and unfortunately this is not. I will say that it is better than abominations like The Starving Games, Vampires Suck, Scary Movie 5 and Disaster Movie, but that's like saying dog p*ss is better than cat sh*t. They're both awful and both leave a bad taste in your mouth.\n\nThis movie gets an extra point for potential. It's refreshing to see a spoof movie that isn't by the two that shall not be named, and some ideas in the movie do work. There's a plot this time: We follow the three Hangover guys (who bare a striking resemblance to their respective actors) on their Hunger Games adventure. I also like how the spoofs are limited to a certain character or group participating in \"The Hungover Games\", such as The Real House Wives, Ted, Thor, and a group of every Johnny Depp character of the past few years. Some of them are funny - I really wanted more of the Johnny Depps - but some just don't work. A team for gratuitous sex? I know it's making fun of the fact that a lot of movies have gratuitous sex for the sake of it but that's exactly what it's doing here, so it's like a spoof that's spoofing itself... and it's not nearly as deep as it sounds.\n\nI smiled a few times in this movie. The main cast was fine (the supporting cast had some horrendous actors though), and I like how the movie actually has a story and an attempt at coherency. But the number one thing I look for in a comedy are laughs, and The Hungover Games did not provide any. If you're smashed and with your friends and want to see a really dumb movie for some cheap laughs for an hour and a half then yeah you might enjoy The Hungover Games, but for anyone else, I implore you, don't watch this movie."

And for the most part, the storyline, or at least the first fifthteen minutes is also exactly the same as the 2009 Vegas Comedy. Just like in those movies, the fourth friend of the group is misplaced, leaving the first three to try and remember all the terrible things that they did the night before, in an attempt to rediscover him. I know this is a parody, but really? Word-for-word lines from The Hangover have been pilfered as their own. It's astonishing the true lack of any creativity that The Hungover Games possesses, whereas other awful spoof movies such as, say, Scary/Epic Movie seem to have some (very few) of their own ideas, here, \"writers\" Kyle Barnett Anderson et al, make it feel like they've photocopied Todd Philips' screenplay badly and then taken it for themselves.\n\nBut it turns out our three buddies have been transported to Hunger Games Land where they have to fight to the death with all the other favourable movies of the last seven years or so. This takes all those films you may have possibly enjoyed over the past few years and throws them in to one terrible mush: watch as the Ted bear has a penis, Katniss Everdeen has had her name changed to \"Katnip\" (HA!), and Willy Wonka is a homosexual. Add to that pops at race, some Human Centipede \"jokes\", underage sex gags and just a little bit of necrophilia and you experience an hour and a half of pure film diabolica. And for the people who defend the jokes for being jokes, perhaps if they were funny, fine, but otherwise it just comes off as offensive and downright lazy. The brow for this movie is so low that it's scraping along the ground.\n\nI'll end on the only two positives: The people who play the Hangover team are very convincing, and the film itself is shot quite nicely. Otherwise, please, do not go and see this movie. I would rather have been dispatched by a Hunger Games arrow to the face then to have seen this film. Run \u2013 sprint, even \u2013 away if someone suggests watching this piece of garbage.\n\n@JonnyJonJon1"

This is perhaps the only funny joke in the movie, seeing as it is itself completely without original thought.\n\nIt doesn't make fun of the Hungover characters, it just copies them and reenacts their mannerisms in the Hunger Games world. In the process, it also includes various other token characters from pop culture. However, these tertiary characters are fitted with poorly done costumes and for the most part equally poor actors.\n\nI must however admit, that many of the actors in the movie are above average for the genre. The story and whole setup is extremely lazy however. I have a hard time imagining anyone being particularly proud of this movie.\n\nThe movie leaves a lot to be desired, but I suppose it could be watched during a severe case of hangover."

It also features references to Jonny Depp being in heaps of films, The Human Centipede sand Avatar.\n\nThe story can be funny and can keep emotional resonance with the characters and also create a mystery reminiscent of Hangover Part II.\n\nWarning: Unlike other parodies made recently this film contains a bit of drug use, lots of nudity, violence and swearing.\n\nIf you like parodies like Airplane and Loaded Weapon 1, this will surely impress."

This is a list of the 100 lowest rated major release films....and I am a major glutton for punishment, as I've seen 95 of the 100 movies on the list.\n\nIt's not at all surprising that \"The Hungover Games\" is on the Bottom 100. After all, MANY similar brainless spoofs are on the list, such as \"Disaster Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Date Movie\" and \"The Starving Games\"--and they are more or less the same. This is NOT a compliment. Each tends to have a lot of very crude and juvenile humor and they are anything but subtle or intellectual...or entertaining. And, like these other films, the mashups simply make no sense...such as merging \"The Hangover\" with \"The Hunger Games\", \"Lord of the Rings\", \"Avatar\" and \"Snowpiercer\". The film abounds with sex toys, crude humor that falls flat and...well,...that's about it.\n\nThe biggest problem with this film and other similar stupid parodies is that they are way too broad. First, they are very broadly written--with little subtlety and with an emphasis on crude instear of being funny. Second, they are too broad in their focus and would be MUCH better sticking with ONE film or one style of film instead of parodying EVERYTHING...which is often illogical and frequently mindless.\n\nSo is this one any better than the rest of these Bottom 100 parodies? Well, there is a lot of gratuitous nudity. This isn't necessarily good....but at least it distracts from the 'humor'. In fact ANYTHING that tries to distract from the dopey jokes is a major plus. Heck, having Pauley Shore come out and juggle or read from the Yellow Pages would be a welcome distraction from the 'humor'! In fact, as I watched \"The Hungover Games\", I cannot recall laughing even once and it's no funnier than the other unfunny parodies on the Bottom 100. A worthless film in pretty much every way that was probably written by chipmunks...really, really DUMB chipmunks."

It was lame.\n\nA spoof film doesn't have to be tasteful or clever. It doesn't need good acting. It doesn't even have to make sense, it just has to be funny. But this is just boring. It felt like everything that COULD have been funny just ended up being stupid in- your-face nudity. Relying on dildos, curse words, pee, poo and breasts to make a scene funny just seems lazy. A lot of people are going \"But dude, it has BOOBS in it!\" Guys...if you think boobs make a movie good, you need to find a way around your parents' Safe Search.\n\nI'd rather go watch Sex in the City. And I HATE Sex in the City."

There was a least some attempts at humor and they actually tried to make an actual parody film that wasn't full of irrelevant pop culture references that weren't funny (well, sorta), but compared to anything Setlzerberg has made, I give this an E for effort. It doesn't help that like Epic Movie, this film also features cameos from Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp version) and Captain Jack Sparrow and those were even still dated, back when Epic Movie was in theaters, back in early 2007. If want to watch this on Freedrive, I'd say go ahead, just don't expect anything like Airplane or Scary Movie."

It's kind of like offering me the choice of taking a bullet to the brain or a bullet to the heart. Neither film will ever be classed as a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nI do get the feeling though that the makers of \"The Hungover Games\" are actually trying. They've tried to write a good script, they've tried to give it decent production values and even the actors seem to be trying. It's a little more than can be said of the stuff that Freidberg & Seltzer keep pumping out. It's perhaps a little disappointing then that none of the jokes in the film really seem to deliver and it all seems to land off-target. I didn't laugh once.\n\nI was sober when I watched this. Maybe to enjoy it the most you do actually need to be hungover! That's the only time I'd probably find some of this movie actually funny. A-plus for effort but C-minus for execution. Not great."

        "review_detailed_main": "Spoof films are extremely hard to pull off. The key is to be subtle, yet not so much so otherwise the audience will not understand the joke. It is imperative though to not make the gags brash and obvious. This is where the alleged comedy 'The Hungover Games' fails.\n\nThis parody stars lookalikes of The Hangover series and is supposed to be a follow on from 'The Hangover Part II'. The creators of The Hangover series had no part in this spoof and if they did, there would at the very least be something to laugh about. All you can find funny here is the incompetence of the Director and writers.\n\nIn the film the Wolf Pack or the lookalikes of them get drunk again the night before Doug's wedding. Unfortunately for themselves they are entered into the Hungover Games and must fight to the death against other celebrities and film characters to survive.\n\nThe only positive for 'The Hungover Games' is that in the opening text it informs us that this deathly tradition came about because of \"Hollywood's lack of creativity\". Now that I can agree with. Yet why mock the lack of creativity when the film you have possesses the same quality? It makes no logical sense but perhaps that is the point. As the film has no logic to call its own.\n\nThe many negatives for 'The Hungover Games' can be collated into a list, thus outlined below. Pop culture references are only funny if done in a tasteful manner or with some notable skill. I know it's exceedingly odd to compare this film to a Disney one and yet Hercules knew how to handle pop culture references and still achieve the key for a comedy \u2013 laughs.\n\nOther jokes are either scatological, racist, homophobic, sexist or all of the above. 'The Hungover Games' never knows when to stop in terms of the excessive nature of the gags and its relatively short run time still manages to feel far too stretched for its own good.\n\nIt's especially bothersome to watch when this comedy has less jokes than 2012's 'The Hunger Games'. I'm not sure how this was managed but its an impressive achievement none the less.\n\nEven the shots in the film are sickening to look at, filmed poorly and cheaply. People who took issue with the presence of shaky camera in the first Hunger Games film had better close their eyes promptly as well as covering their ears.\n\nI could go on and on about this films problems but I really do not wish to. In fact I would rather go and watch a comedy that makes me laugh to my heart's content. With every film I see, I feel that every single one deserves a chance. With Stolberg's 'The Hungover Games' I plead you to steer clear and not give it the benefit of the doubt. Film making this shallow does not deserve to be viewed by anyone of any age."

The aforementioned joke I made about reviving a corpse is appropriate since Jonathan Silverman somehow got dragged into this movie and his main claim to game are the Weekend at Bernie movies.\n\nThey tried to combine the Hunger Games with the Hangover, and then throw in just about every pop culture character from the time (circa 2014), you get this mishmash of ideas and its completely a waste. If you took the scripts from the two movies its spoofing, shredded them, threw them in the air and then taped together what you could catch, you'd have something funnier than this nonsense. The end credits alone are like outtakes from rejected Jackass episodes.\n\nHow does something like this even get made?"

Because it is.\n\nGotta admit, the first time I saw this I hadn't seen The Hunger Games so I was lost, but if you're someone who's in touch with pop culture and popular movies and you have a sense of humor, and most importantly - you know that this is a PARODY movie and nothing more or less - you can have a good time.\n\nI really hope parody movies don't die. Everything is cringey \"dark\" cancer and rehashes nowadays, taking itself way too seriously. At least parody movies like this is honest about rehashing things, and does a good job at being funny and easy to watch. Just have a beer."

        "review_detailed_main": "They really tried hard in this movie to create a spoof as close to the hunger games as possible. Some unexpected surprises are found, but that's to be expected from spoofs. I chuckled a few times, although the execution of some of the ideas in this movie just wasn't flawless (I overlooked that and rather tried to enjoy the gags)\n\nThe theme of being hung over didn't stick because through most of the movie, the lead actors acted... sober. The movie is also not recommended for children as there are plenty of nude scenes, adult toys, drugs, alcohol, under-age relationships forming (though also ending, thank heavens) and plenty of cursing and harassment. This movie is perfect for young and immature adults (like me)"

I actually love the idea of them, they're just lazily made.\n\nThis is no masterpiece and a lot of the time I'm watching this and thinking \"I could have come up with a better line for that moment\", but it's better than a lot of the worst ones like Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans though it's not quite the quality of Date Movie or Scary Movie 5.\n\nIt's sort of like the Parody movie's parody movie, the subgenre finally holding its hands up and finally laughing at its own shortcomings.\n\nWe actually have a pretty cool and solid plot where the many factions of modern popular culture battle to the death and the whole develops in a fairly interesting, linear fashion with some fun gags (\"this is a bad pillow\" had me laugh out loud) and we get a fairly satisfying conclusion even if it doesn't quite make sense.\n\nWhat did annoy me is how prudish they are about human sexuality. 17 is legal in the Majority of US states people! And this is after the ostensibly satirical \"gratuitous nudity\".\n\nIt ticks the box for something fun and crass that you won't need to think too hard through."

Back to the movie, there were moments that I was actually taken in by the action (seriously, I wouldn't pause to check my phone), it looked pleasant and not at all cheap, apart from some of the supporting characters wigs. The plot was pretty much coherent and there were some nice twists..and laughs! Raw, authenitically silly humor. Even when they weren't making a joke I kept being amused by the combination of characters, the romances and who beats up whom during the games. This for me was the best part, where the alternate realities meet. It is being offered on streaming services right now, so don't miss it!"

Watch it once for sure, with friends and fun! It's satire! Without giving anything away, I can say that the premise is silly and doesn't deserve a lot of criticism as this satire should be views in a manner more attune to the meta comedy of the fourth wall breaking in your face antics and Ferris Bueller and The Lizard guys who did Slammin Salmon."

The subtlety of the jokes were on point where I found some I had to explain to my roommate as they just went over his head.\n\nI thought Tenet would be the highest I would ever rate a movie, but The Hungover games has officially taken over the top spot. I personally guarantee you will bust a gut and come back for more. So grab your snacks (chicken amirite?) and get a cool drink, kick up your feet and get ready for an hour and a half of non-stop laughter."
