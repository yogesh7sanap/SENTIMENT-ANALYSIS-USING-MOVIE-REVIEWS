Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give the inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon.\n\nSOTY2 tells the story of 3 friends with the Kabaddi Inter School competition at the background - Rohan (Tiger Shroff) who joins the college for his girlfriend, Tara Sutaria. There is a spoilt brat, Ananya Panday, who thinks she can rule the college with her care-free attitude.\n\nDirector Puneet Malhotra (I Hate Luv Storys, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein) does not do justice to the area of direction at all. As the movie begins, you are greeted by glossy and candy floss environment of college (reminds you of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Student Of The Year 2012 ) with unnecessary insertion of songs. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written surely by a school kid. Art direction and Cinematography is excellent especially. Songs are poor. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over-top. Tiger Shroff does his best but could not do much with the lame script. Glam dolls -Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday are meant for making the film more attractive.\n\nOverall, a pathetic film in every sense."

For the first time, i enjoyed the ads more than the actual movie. Staring at the wall would've been a better experience i suppose. I spent the whole first interval distinguishing the two main actresses.

From the cast of the movie, the plot, the music, and everything are so boring to watch. The plot is a typical story we always heard of. There is nothing unique, different or interesting. The cast, especially, Tiger Shroff can dance well (we agree on that without a doubt) and he can do the stunts all right. But acting and emotions, he needs to work on that. (Sorry to his fans) Other characters couldn't make any impact on the movie either.\n\nAnd when Karan Johar selects cast for his movies he needs to think about it twice. He should think about the skills, not the parents/relatives of the actors or actresses.\n\nIf someone wants to watch the movie so badly, go ahead. If someone wishes to see a movie which is different and exciting, this is not a movie for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK first things first, some reviewers have said that the people who have disliked the film are jealous of Tiger Shroff? seriously? To Tiger's Credit he has done his job well, he's great at dancing and so in fight sequences but is it enough to make a great film? NO ! Sorry We are not in 80's where people would flock in theaters just to watch Amitabh Bachchan bashing a couple of goons. Audiences are becoming smarter and looking for better content.\n\nAnd there's no content in SOTY2. This is a recycled version of the landmark bollywood film 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander'. Just add some random songs, different situations or scenes but the film is more or less the same. The original SOTY was nothing great but Karan Johar knows the pulse of his audience. He knows how to get them in theaters. So he provided the right dose of entertainment, skin show and songs and people somewhat did like the first part.\n\nBut Punit Malhotra is no Karan Johar. He has missed the mark totally. OK I get it that they wanted to throw a fantasy world of students right in front of us which we can accept given if we are really entertained, but where is the content? The reason why Baaghi series work because Tiger does exactly what he's known for. He's loved as an action hero but sorry ! how can he play an action hero while playing a student? And even if he does, the situations are hilarious to believe.\n\nSecondly, both the girls are a waste. I don't understand about the appreciation Ananya Pandey is getting. All I could hear is the word 'duffer' from her mouth atleast 60-70 times in the film. She acts like a papa's princess which can be hardly called great acting. And for Tara Sutaria, oh boy! what were the writers thinking? The poor girl didn't even get a proper developed character so its hard to expect any great acting from her. She switches boyfriends in the film but is never really sure whom and what she wants.\n\nThe actor who leaves some what impression is Aditya Seal but then again even his character is riddled by cliches. Music is a Big Letdown. Not even a single song is worth remembering. Also the film drags in the portions between Tiger-Ananya-Tara. They just don't leave an Impact.\n\nOn the plus side, some scenes do make you laugh and they come mostly from Tiger's gang of friends. The scene at the pub in the first half and the second one when they ridicule Aditya Seal during the opening ceremony of The Dignity Cup. But they are very few and far in between.\n\nProblem of the film is predictability, the same story we must have seen so many times before which is why the audience has rejected this recycled piece of trash and rightfully so. And it's high time our producers should empower good writers who can deliver good stories and directors with better execution"

The prequel has that lightness and overwhelmingness depsite some flaws it had and now the SOTY team decided to go beyond their redemption by keeling a sequel for the audience.\n\nSo the story evolves around a middle class chap Rohan Mehra who scores a seat under the sports quota in Saint Theresa. Mridula a.k.a Mia is Rohan's childhood crush who is also a student there and Shreya, the most popular gal in the institution. Manav is the son of one of the trustees as well as Shreya's brother who has a cold shoulder with Rohan with the ambition of defeating him to become Student of the Year. How Rohan's ambitious dreams come true basically forms the backbone of the story.\n\nWhat was Punit Malhotra smoking before coming up with such a cocaphonous flick? The story was very predictable and too nepotistic because of what power and influence of one person can do to another person who doesn't have these traits. Dialogues were too \"dramabaazi\" meaning too 80's for such a delicate film.\n\nActing had some slight redemption but only for the newcomers.\n\nTiger Shroff acts basically like he is auditioning for a film for the first time just like his other films. Too much fighting and just seeing him kick ass and dance isn't going to make acting a redeeming quality.\n\nTara Sutaria was the only potential figure in the acting department because she had that natural glow of a college student and she was decent throughout the movie.\n\nAnanya Pandey was also decent and she didn't disappoint at all. She had that personality of a popular college girl with snobbiness which is something to look for in a popular gal.\n\nAditya Seal didn't do much besides bullying Rohan throughout the film and same like Tiger Shroff, same identities but opposite.\n\nSamir Soni, Gul Panag, and Ayesha Raza were fine as well but had short roles as they were educational figures.\n\nMusic was very average at best and no song stood out as such although Jawaani was a beautiful recreation but evrything else around was sub-par. Seems like Vishal and Shekhar overthought some things while composing.\n\nCinematography was well executed by Ravi K. Chandran who shot Dehradhun beautifully but transitionally, it was loose in terms of editing.\n\nOverall, too nepotistic and predictable\n\n2/5 - Grading Scale: F -53%"

'Tiger' was treated very bad during the entire length of the film. He was beaten a lot ... all the time. Though, thank God it never required any medical attention to be involved, even with the bones dislocated. He was made to jump around a lot, pretty unnecessarily. I don't think he was forced to dance unnecessarily, as he can be seen liking it. The best thing the filmmakers did was to keep him miles away from any study. As a student, apparently everyone wishes for such a year, though we are obviously fearful of repeating the class, but we are happy that these students can have it, due to such a well thought out script."

The trick is to go in blank and marvel at the lighting, the decor, the clothes and all the progress technology has made possible. SOTY2 is a new generation movie, a potpourri of characters, glamour, hot bodies and some sizzling dance and song sequences, without the needless story, lyrics or chemistry. There is little if any work done on the latter.\n\nThis movie is a grim reminder on the current spate in bollywood. When glamour, lineage and callousness prevails, substance and depth fall by the wayside.\n\nKJO revels in churning out movies as an industrial assembly line with little, if any changes. But this movie sticks out as a sore thumb, as the basic chemistry between characters appears missing."

        "review_title": "Folks in India hated this film. But if you're not Indian, will you hate it as well?",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are quite a few wonderful Indian films...so I know this movie-making powerhouse can make marvelous films that are every bit as good (or better) than the stuff coming out of Hollywood. So, why is it that despite the Indians making many marvelous films did Netflix purchase the rights to several recent Indian movies which are on IMDB's ignoble Bottom 100 List?! Who buys these movies? And, do they deliberately look for bad Indian films because they can purchase the rights for very little money?!\n\nI must admit right off that I never saw \"Student of the Year\". It has a below average but not terrible overall score of 5.3....not bad enough to appeal to me and my quest to see all 100 of the Bottom 100 List! But the film came out seven years earlier and the two movies aren't really related...so skipping the first is not a bad thing.\n\nOne of the things I noticed about the movie, and it wasn't the fault of the production crew but Netflix. The film is, of course, subtitled for English speaking folks...but NOT the songs! And, in most Indian movies, the songs are big and important production numbers that tell a lot about the plot. Boo Netflix for omitting these captions!! The sad part of all this is that the dance numbers in the film are amazing...even by Bollywood standards...a major plus for this film.\n\nRohan (Shroff) has dreams of winning some competition at school in order to be named 'Student of the Year'. Then, he hopes, to get the girl of his dreams. But there is competition...in particular rich guy Manav, who SEEMS like a really nice (and handsome) guy, seems poised to win. Can he manage to beat the seemingly unbeatable Manav and the rest of the students to win this coveted title? And, will this get him the love he hopes it will bring him?\n\nMany of the tropes in this film are familiar to Indian films. My favorite of these is the silly part where the woman appears...and suddenly a wind machine hits her and her hair blows...while NONE of the people around her has this happen. And, it did it twice. The first time, Rohan was dreaming and he saw her this way. The second, when she appeared for real in the movie. Another trope, and one I really hate, is that one of the characters is very stuck up and nasty...and changes by the end of the film. This was the case with Shreya. Another is the dopey looking sidekick for the hero...and in this case it's a short Sikh. And yet another is the slow motion...lots of slow motion. And, while these tropes are silly...they are common to many Indian films...so this cannot be why Indians hated this film. I think the real problem is that Rohan is a jerk...and that is NOT a trope anyone could enjoy. And, I found myself rooting against him...something the filmmakers did not intend to have happen. And, I also found myself rooting against pretty much everyone...again, I don't think the filmmakers intended this either!\n\nOverall, I did NOT hate this movie like the average Indian did. The production values are very high, the dancing is amazing and it's not that bad a film. Now I am not saying you should rush to see it...but you could do worse. Plus, so many films that never made IMDB's Bottom 100 are so much worse than this one. Bad in some ways, just not at all terrible.\n\nBy the way, for absolutely no reason,at about 53 minutes into the movie, Will Smith appears for a few seconds during a huge dance number. He looks like he has no idea why he's even there! I'd like to know more about this!"

Actresses have gotten dance sequences , romance sequences , emotional scenes , frowns, comedy .. basically they have shown they can pull of any scene.. and if you have seen Student of the year part 1, then you realise these girls are far better than Alia as a fresher..\n\nWith absolutely no story.. scenes are made up just to show games or dance sequences.. the young generation won't be disappointed with the movie.. ( basically target audience)\n\nI enjoyed Tiger Shroff's part only. He is such a talent. I hope one day he gets his due in Bollywood."

        "review_title": "Little India Directory Review: Student of the Year 2 (3 Stars)",
        "review_detailed_main": "There's a special type of courage so far unknown to the movie-going public that will be required to bear this imaginative piece of mega nonsense by Punit Malhotra who tries and succeeds to stray away from logic and realism in Student of the Year 2 that it will be impossible to go back to mindful comedies in this franchise. There's no going back from this.\n\nIn an over-the-top setting where a bunch of high schools lock horns with each other for an inter-level sports competition pretentiously titled 'Dignity' where the best player from the winning school's team will be throned as the 'Student of the Year', director Malhotra's characters are the unabashed, self-proclaimed stars. He has Tiger Shroff as the typical boy next door with a lower middle-class background and a dream to fulfill the dream of his uptight and arrogant girlfriend (Tara Sutaria), all of which will give you a heartache. Another two of his dreams is to get that throne in the sports competition and get admitted to the college of every student's (reel + real) dream. A college where academics do not exist. And where instead exists people like the obviously arrogant incumbent Student of the Year (Aditya Seal) looking to hit a hatrick this time and an equally arrogant, daughter-of-the-trustee (Ananya Panday) who wears couture and who would barf at the idea of flying coach. While Seal's and Shroff's characters compete with their abs and looks, Panday's maverick presence makes up for unwanted idiocy. Each of these characters, along with a few essential supporting ones like Shroff's and Seal's on-screen friends, and faculty who never touch a book or a blackboard, throughout the 150-minute ecstasy-filled colouring competition further make this is a blunder of Himalayan proportions.\n\nThere's so much colour in Student of the Year 2, I thought I was looking at a fashion show from the future. Shroff's character, currently just managing to make his ends meet, uses DIY techniques to style his threads but in the next sequence they are as good as to be used in walking the ramp. Every single character - including the extras - wear fashionable clothes that had me sitting in the theater wearing PJs and a loose tee, making me want to approach the style partner and say hello. Unfortunately, the film quickly scrambles to show you ads for Subway and a chips brand (Too Yumm!), which is slightly irrelevant considering they are pushing fashion textiles for the most parts. So I lost track.\n\nShroff flexes, jumps, leaps, flies, and sometimes falls flat on his face in Student of the Year 2 and there ends his performance as this aspiring young man who does not look one bit his character. While Panday and Sutaria do qualify as kids, their performances are strained at best, failing to add the charm that was present in the lead actors of the 2012 prequel which had more panache, pizzazz, romance, and fun. Harsh Beniwal as the designated joker and Seal who puts up an attractive show as a villain at the age of 17 should have won the award if there is ever one that celebrates worthiness. The little humor and the hunger for passive vengeance that is brought out by these characters are the only saving grace in this otherwise slipshod treatment of exaggerated high school life that is 3-fold worse than anything you have seen of this type in Bollywood, including Farah Khan's Main Hoon Na! (2004). During the viewing, I did wonder why Malhotra and his chums did not take a look at international films. Maybe a scene at the detention center or a professor actually teaching a concept in the background would have made me hopeful instead of a frame showing students sitting in a packed class and other where two characters assemble at the principal's (Samir Soni in a 50% comic role) office so that they could add some family drama into the mix.\n\nBut what poses as the biggest threat for this musical comedy drama's success is its waferthin and illogical plotline. The turns that it takes - with the women taking sides, blabbering to show they are cool, unbelievable sports performances with Kabaddi looking like a wrestling match - Student of the Year 2 goes overboard in everything that it tries to showcase. And it probably takes great pride while accepting that they are into exaggeration. Unfortunately for the audience, it does not work; neither in entertaining not making us aspire to be like these overzealous, fake characters. There's so much going on in student of the Year 2, it becomes difficult to keep track, with plot arcs often defying logic or continuity. It slowly turns into an unbearable piece of content that you would immediately want turned off. Since you chose to view it on the big screen, the only solution is to walk out.\n\nWhether it is the physique that Shroff has maintained or that Malhotra failed to digitally edit (like they did in Aanand L Rai's awful Zero (2018)) or that none of the songs inspire fun are some of the other factors that make this experience not worth your money or time. The film throws challenges at you one after another, treating you like a kindergarten kid who will clap and jump at everything glitzy and noisy. It is for that reason that I do not recommend Student of the Year 2. If you really like high school romance films, try the prequel and then forget about the genre in Bollywood unless someone more talented and experienced people than Malhotra come on board. But that's an ironic statement. Both Malhotra and writer Arshad Sayed (who surprisingly also gave us the fantastic Dasvidaniya (2008)) are to be blamed for taking this idea from Karan Johar and dismantling it, butchering it into a product that looks tasty and good, but is poisonous if you consume it. We need to stop promoting this cannibalization of the industry.\n\nSometimes there has to be a little realism or logic or even a bit of genuine emotions in the proceedings to justify a fantasy so ridiculous as this, but I guess that is something you already knew. Student of the Year (2012) at least had a mention of academics. And 7 years later, even as education boards in India dole our 100/100 to their top students, a film comes with a tag of nepotism without a second of studies that should have been fittingly named \"Spoiled Brats of the Year\".\n\nSave for the 5-second performance of Will Smith that you may miss if you don't pay attention to the half a dozen opposite-of-glee songs in Student of the Year 2 and a few one-liner jokes by the breakout star Harsh Beniwal (whom I would like to see as the lead if they ever make Student of the Year 3), this one here will tickle your fantasies that are best left untickled. Do something better with you time if you don't want to go window cloth shopping. TN.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Little India Directory (Singapore)."

Obviously thats the title \"Student of the year\" he did everything he can in every academic activity to show he is the student of the year...so i dont know what other story is everyone expecting from the title \"student of the year\"\n\nin my opinion, its not a bad movie, a good entertainer. Love for the girl he chose at the end - didnt show much chemistry between them on the screen. TIger - compared to all his movies he acted much much better. looking back from Heropanti to this movie and baagi 2.....He came long way. i dont think its fair for you to put down someone who came this far. Both girls - did a fair acting. i dont think anyone did bad acting in this movie.,"

This director should never be aloud to make another movie ever again. What was Karan Johar thinking producing this movie. The reason people relate him to nepotism is because of these situations. Supporting Tiger and Ananya because they are celebrities kids is what nepotism is about. Karan needs to start producing new actors/actresses who aren't already privileged. I've seen a lot of tiger shroff movies. He just doesn't have the lead actor persona. But becuase he is the son of Jackie shroff he gets and demands that respect which is also nepotism. In Hollywood you don't have that happening because actors are respected becuase of their talent. Tiger has given flop after flop and he's still doing lead roles because of this nepotism in Bollywood. It's not that Tiger doesn't have any talent. Tigers dancing and physique are amazing. He definitely worked hard on both and his talent as a dancer is one of the highest level in Bollywood. If he continues acting I think he should consider doing supporting roles. The casting was bad. But then again everything was bad.\n\nNot recommended!!!!!"

However, the chemistry between Tiger and the two debutantes doesn't quite warm your heart. And while it comes seven years after SOTY, the writing doesn't seem to have come of age.\n\nTiger Shroff is good when it comes to dancing and action but a little less in terms of acting. Ananya does a good job as the rich and spoilt Shreya. Tara Sutaria who plays Rohan's girlfriend Mridula has a lukewarm personality, but Ananya , who is cast as mean girl Shreya, has an X factor that pushes its way past the layers of gloss in SOTY 2. Aditya Seal is great in the action department but has nothing much to contribute to the film."

Somehow, the lead who is an outsider happens to be worse than the former. The screenplay, story and direction doesn't help. They're all worse tier. I cannot express enough how much disgusting this film is. Really, the makers should've been banned for coming up with something like this and taking the audience for granted.

The result is a disaster: an idiotic script filled with cringe-worthy dialogues, zero comedy, and painfully bad acting. The storyline is so weak and predictable that it feels like a waste of time.\n\nThe only silver lining in this mess was the song that played during the end credits, where Alia Bhatt and Tiger Shroff managed to create some chemistry with their dance moves. But even that couldn't salvage this wreck of a film. The performances were mediocre at best, and the poor script turned the whole experience into an ordeal. It's hard to believe this project ever got greenlit."
