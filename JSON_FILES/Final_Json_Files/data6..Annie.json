        "review_detailed_main": "'ANNIE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nModern-day adaptation of the 1977 Broadway musical (of the same name), which was based on the 1924 comic strip 'Little Orphan Annie'. It stars Quvenzhane Wallis (of 'BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD' fame), as Annie, and Jamie Foxx, as billionaire Will Stacks (an update on the Daddy Warbucks character, from the comic and musical). It costars Rose Byrne, Cameron Diaz, Bobby Cannavale, David Zayas and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. It was directed by Will Gluck (who also directed 'EASY A' and 'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS') and written by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna. I don't think it's nearly as enjoyable as the 1982 film version (which I grew up on) but the music is still good (and there's three new songs).\n\nThe story, once again, centers on a ten-year-old orphan named Annie (Wallis). She lives at the home of a mean alcoholic, named Colleen Hannigan (Diaz), with four other foster children. Colleen is very abusive to the kids, constantly making them clean her apartment, and only takes care of them so she can collect money from the state. Annie dreams of being reunited with her parents, who promised they'd come back for her (long ago). She runs into New York City mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Foxx), while running home one day, and falls to the ground in the streets. Stacks saves her from being hit, by a truck, and the incident is caught on video. The video then goes viral and Stacks sees it as an excellent opportunity to save his failing campaign. An odd relationship develops between the two.\n\nThe film is filled with corny jokes, and bad acting, and it's even more cheesy than the 1982 movie (which I still love, for nostalgic reasons). The music is great, still though (especially my favorite: 'It's the Hard Knock Life'), and the movie does have a positive and upbeat message for kids (like it's source material). It's other saving grace is Quvenzhane Wallis, who has some really powerful scenes (towards the end of the film). She could have delivered another award worthy performance, if her part had been written a little better (she is nominated for a Golden Globe though, but doesn't quite deserve it). For those reasons the movie isn't horrible but the 1982 version is much better.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/GmFPW994ONg"

        "review_title": "Not quite as bad as has been said about it, but an update that's more awkward than clever",
        "review_detailed_main": "Regarding the other versions of the classic Broadway hit, the 1982 film was one of my favourite films as a child and is still a personal favourite today while the 1999 film is also good and entertaining if a little short and sugary sweet in places. Annie(2014) certainly should be judged on its own merits and without any comparison as well as with an open mind. Seeing it without any prejudice, I do not think it is quite as bad as people has said but as an updating of the story and as a standalone it didn't work.\n\nThere are some good things here. The best thing about it is Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis as Annie, her singing is not brilliant but the energy, enthusiasm and feeling she gives to it is. She's consistently winning in the role and performs with much confidence and charisma with twinkling eyes and a bright smile, all this without falling into saccharine camp. Jamie Foxx has the best singing voice of the whole cast and is a likable Will Stacks, playing him with real authority and charm, coming across as appropriately over-serious to someone more relaxed later on. Sandy is also adorable and almost on par with the dog in the 1982 film, and I was charmed by the chemistry between Annie and Grace.\n\nUnfortunately that's it for the things that work. The girls playing the other foster kids try their best but they do come over as over-eager and they don't have much to do, not to do with screen-time but with how they're directed(the only place they shine in some way is Hard Knock Life). Rose Byrne is a mixed bag, she is appropriately kindly and shares a charming chemistry with Wallis but she has very little to do really. Bobby Cannavale underplays the villain role so much that the performance comes across as one-note while Cameron Diaz is rather painful to watch as Miss Hannigan(and this is without any comparison). She's a talented actress but plays the character far too broadly, so over-the-top campy and obnoxiously strident that it makes the rest of the toned-down performances dull in comparison. Regarding the singing, the only one who impresses is Foxx, the rest of the adults can barely carry a tune and the singing in general sounds auto-tuned and in an all-too-obvious way(Easy Street is especially bad in this instance), \"auto-tuned disaster\" sums it up very aptly. The lip-synching is incredibly amateurish too with the performers' mouths moving at a different tine to the music.\n\nThe songs in the Broadway stage show and the 1982 and 1999 films are marvellous, ones with very catchy melodies that are easily hummable and lyrics that you can recite without problem very quickly. The songs that are included here are arranged in a way to make them more \"current\" but instead they are stripped of their heart and meaning due to the many things added to and taken away from them, some of them changed to the extent they're barely recognisable(like one or two signature lines a song being maintained but the melodies being completely swamped by polyrhythmic harmonies and sounds and even vastly inferior changes in lyrics). Tomorrow just about gets by but Hard Knock Life irritates and Easy Street is completely butchered. And then we have the added ones done especially for this film and while they're \"current\" they're forgettable at best and largely uninspired in style and writing with lyrics so inane it's enough to make one cringe. For anybody yet to see the film they'd think that there'd be a jarring difference in quality with the original songs and the added ones but you know something is horribly wrong when the originals are changed so much that they're actually on the same level in quality to the added ones, that's how much they've been cheapened by the arrangements. The choreography is both sloppy and chaotic, flailing arms being the most memorable and frequent movement of the lot, and apart from Foxx and to a lesser extent Wallis nobody looks natural dancing it. For example I Think I'm Gonna Like it Here looked like it was completely made up on the spot.\n\nThe equally chaotic and music-video-like production values don't help, most of the musical numbers especially Easy Street were very haphazardly edited, and neither does Will Gluck's leaden direction that has inexperience stamped all over it. The script is weak, with crass humour, cloying cutesiness and the once memorable and engaging characters reduced to bland clich\u00e9s. The film does try hard to make the famous story relevant by today's standards, but by doing that the heart of the original story is lost and Annie's positivity amidst a harsh world doesn't resonate, which is really what the story and Annie's character is all about. Annie and Stacks's relationship never really grows, despite Foxx's best efforts if there was meant to be a character change for Stacks it wasn't believable while Miss Hannigan's back story suffered from some really clumsy and badly placed writing. The message is more cynical in alternative to heart-warming, handling the benefits of materialism idea very heavy-handedly, while the climatic helicopter chase is just ludicrous, completely devoid of tension and completely out of place compared to the rest of the film.\n\nOverall, Annie(2014) is not THAT terrible but while it tries hard the execution for this viewer was awkward and sloppy. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

A musical should have great singers; this did not. Foxx, the orphans and Quvenzhane were fine, but they were not great. Consider Dreamgirls, Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof and Oklahoma. Along with the actors singing in character, there were powerful voices. No one in Annie was a standout musically.\n\nRose Byrne did her job in Damages, but not so much in this movie. The remainder of the cast was competent; they had their occasional moments.\n\nThis rendition of Annie was okay. But, with a few cast changes and voice lessons, it could have been so much better."

The cast of children don't look like poor kids with a hard knock life, rather the clean well fed model kids. The orphanage has 7 or 8 kids rather than the original 25-30 kids and Cameron Diaz is pi\u00f3r casting for Hannigan compared to Carol Burnet who was great in the original. The whole thing seemed like a weak unnecessary remake where I struggled to find any area that is an improvement on the original."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Annie\" is a modern day retelling of the acclaimed Broadway Musical and 1982 musical film based on the show, which was based on the 1924 Comic Strip \"Little Orphan Annie\" which in the original show and movie, takes part during the Great Depression, telling the story of Orphan Annie - a pre-teenage hoping for a return of her parents, who disappeared after they left her on the steps of of an orphanage as a baby. In this version, which again takes place in the modern day, it is revealed in the early part of the film that Annie, played by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis (Academy Award Nominee for the \"Beasts of Southern Wild\") was left as a baby at a restaurant by her parents, and is now a foster kid, under the care of Miss Hannigan, played by Cameron Diaz. The Billionaire character \"Daddy Warbucks\" of the classic story, has been replaced by the character of \"Will Stacks\", played by Jamie Foxx (Academy Award winner for \"Ray\"), who is also a Billionaire from his cell phone business, and is running for Mayor of New York City. So \u2013 leading up to this film, the predicted expectations were of gloom and doom, presumably I think because this version does not take place in the original time line, and because some people's now negative views (not mine) towards Actor/Rapper Will Smith, who co-produced the film with among others, his wife, Actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and Rapper and Business Mogel Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter, whose sampled one of the Musical's more populars songs \"It's a Hard Knocked Life\" in his hit song \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". So what did I think \u2013 While I admit \u2013 the movie does became a mess to a great deal, it is not a total mess, and could have been a lot worse. A lot of songs that many of us love are there and performed well by the cast, some with variations, some of which are understandably, and some which may have probably weren't necessary. There are some new songs as well, including the very touching \"Who am I?\" - sung by Diaz, Foxx and Wallis's characters in the later part of the film. Some of the modern day jokes, just some of the humor in general works well, and some falls flat. Kids should like this version of \"Annie\" just fine. Adults - I think most who are fans of the original are going to be annoyed by it. I myself am I fan of the Broadway show and 1982 Movie. While I obviously didn't love this version myself, again, While it does become a mess to a great deal,it's not a complete one. My rating is for the music, and some of the humor \u2013 2 \u00bd out of 4 Stars (The \u00bd star is for the previously mentioned new song \"Who am I?\")."

I am a big fan of the 1994 film and I like this version about as much as that! -The story itself is different from the original somewhat, but the modern update called for some changes and I liked them.\n\n-The pace was good, but there is a slow point in the film that is noticeable.\n\n-The supporting characters, everyone but Annie, are a bit cheesy. And kinda goofy, but they are not too much over-the-top. There are a few elements like the characters that did feel geared towards younger audiences.\n\n-The acting is good though. I noticed that both Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz both acted will in their over-the-top characters. I will say the true star was Annie though. I can't spell her name, but she outshined Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in most of the scenes. Good work! -Now the music is pretty great! I liked the updated music and, although not every original song was in it, I really liked the new songs they added! -The film is also very funny! I laughed at most of the jokes made and them adding jokes poking fun at musicals was very smart.\n\n-It is rated PG for some mild language. Nowhere near as bad as like Rango.\n\n-So Annie has a few elements that feel younger or cheesy, but I thought it was very fun, entertaining, and I loved the music! I honestly would give it a good 7.5 and say that Annie is totally worth seeing in theaters!"

You really feel for her character and care what happens to her. The musical numbers were great. I actually liked Jamie Foxx's character Will Stacks and I am NOT a Jamie Foxx fan. But I feel that he was meant to play the role with his background in singing, dancing, and acting. Cameron Diaz took her \"Bad Teacher\" character up a few notches and created a diabolical villain!! She is so mean, nasty, and heartless. It was special to see how the characters progressed throughout the film and at the end. People can change! The soundtrack has an Urban NY flavor to it that I love!! I'm going to buy the CD or DL it ASAP!! Not fair to compare 2014 to 1982 as the times are extremely different now as opposed to then. But if I had to choose 1982 or 2014. I'd definitely go with 2014!! It is a shame if racism is lowering the rating of Annie 2014.

Yes, an updated version of Annie sounded awesome and yes, some of us had hope for it. And HELL NO is this what Annie should have become. This is perhaps one of the most ridiculous, over produced, annoyingly unoriginal remakes in recent years. With a cast like this film, starring Jamie Foxx, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Diaz and Rose Byrne, this should have been a very competent film but it is so bogged down with a ridiculous hip-hop shroud of the musical numbers and poorly executed dance numbers that it is hard to take this seriously. The biggest culprit is Will Gluck, the man directs this with absolutely no flavor. It isn't hard to make the story of Annie heart warming, not in the very least. It is one of the best told stories along with being one of the best musicals of all time. Even if you were asleep at the wheel for most of the production, you could still get something out of it. Gluck fails to do pretty much everything when it comes to direction. It is lazy and unoriginal. To be frank, the only reason why I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 10 is Wallis' performance. She was truly awesome as Annie and it is a shame that the film wasn't even a fraction as good as her performance. Overall, this is a film that will more than likely have you pounding your fist against your head for the entire duration of the film...oh yeah, it is THAT bad."

She is congratulated and returns to her seat, up comes another young girl also called Annie (played by Quvenshane Wallis). However this time she is visually different with puffy brown hair and ethnic background. Thus, the baton is almost passed on from the predeceasing versions of Annie in this wink allowing it to do whatever it likes. And it does.\n\nAnnie is probably one of the best known musicals in history since its Broadway genesis in 1977. Since then, it has had television versions, books and two quite successful film adaptations, now this \u2013 a further remake of the musical classic. But why was it is remade yet again considering its status? Producers of the recent incarnation, Will Smith and Jay-Z, took to its defence stating that it is 'a modern re-imagination of a beloved musical' \u2013 which is reasonably fair.\n\nIf there had not been any versions of Annie beforehand, and this was its first appearance, then it would be a musical phenomenon in the likes of Frozen's success. Sadly, it is not, and will through generations of viewings always be comparable and given prejudice \u2013 which is never a good thing in the film industry \u2013 hence the awful receptions it has received so far as well as the many one-star reviews.\n\nSimilar to the original story, the central character Annie, has a fairly hard knock life (no pun intended). Nothing seems to have gone her way since she was abandoned at aged-four outside a restaurant. Since then, she has been in numerous fosters homes throughout New York \u2013 but currently in the care of Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), who treats her unfairly and instead of kisses, gets kicked (still no pun intended).\n\nUpdated to the modern era, a phone business tycoon, William Stacks (Jamie Foxx), is running for Mayor of NYC and coincidentally meets Annie, and decided he should help her out. It all seems simple enough until you add the fact it is still a musical, and at every street corner, scenario and character development there is a catchy song around the corner lingering and ready to pounce. Of which, the star-studded cast all sing aloud (reasonably well, apart from the over-the-top Diaz \u2013 cringe).\n\nIndefinite to always live in the shadow of its former versions, Annie could still prove to be a fairly popular family-film over Christmas. But overall, it is mediocre at the very best."

For me, however, this was just yet another missed opportunity. I've been fond of Annie, the Broadway musical, from the beginning. When the 1982 movie version came out, I found it a disappointment; the casting did not deliver, the story was clumsily handled, and some of the songs were changed but not for the better. This second big-screen effort was a major disappointment for me too. The only bright spot was that Quvenzhane Wallis was a slightly better fit for the title role than Aileen Quinn in 1982, despite her not having red curls and freckles. Her Annie, a foster child rather than an orphan, is more adorable than cute. The rest of the movie was an attempt to update the story at the expense of many of the musical's original songs, some of which may grow on you after a while. I do think two of the new songs should have been nominated for Oscars, namely The City's Yours and Who Am I? I actually prefer The City's Yours to the original's NYC which it replaced. However, the new storyline also took on a bit more than it could chew, and was not more engaging. The rest of the cast were okay, although some players came off as too earnest. The saddest thought is that this may mean the last attempt to make an Annie for the big screen, which will really be a big shame."

I love the actors and actresses and all of the songs. I have watched it several times now. I love how Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis gives off the \"okay, I don't care\" act when things rise up against her character (Annie) in the movie. But as she walks away, you can see her true emotion of hurt or sadness show through. I think that shows what a good actress she is growing up to be. I love the modern take on the original songs as well as the new songs added. I think this is a very well made movie. I wish it had better reviews than it has been getting."

        "review_title": "It's a Hard-Knock Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is not recommended.\n\nAnnie, Will Gluck's musical film, and I am using that term loosely, is wrong-headed in concept and execution. After two vain attempts to film the successful Broadway hit, this latest version sucks all the life and last glimmers of hope that was so evident in the original production. Updated to present-day NYC, this new updated version Whereas, the Broadway musical had buckets of charm, a great score sung by talented performers that stressed comedy, and a book that clung to the nostalgic memories of the twenties, this debacle has anti-charm, alters the score with synthesized percussion and bombastic orchestrations, distorts songs so poorly crooned by non-singers (with the sole exception of Mr. Foxx who has some vocal talents and rhythm), and a dumbed-down script that resorts to food-spitting as high comedy (at least three times). It's just awful.\n\nThe screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna and the director never finds the right footing. In this Annie, our plucky heroine is not an orphan, but a foster child in search of her parents. She is still living with the self-absorbed Miss Hannigan, now a wash-up singer from the 90's pop group, C +C Music Factory. Daddy Warbucks becomes Will Stacks, a germaphobic businessman running for mayor. They meet and Annie becomes his photo opportunity until his heart is melted by this young ragamuffin. The film uses the original source as an outline, losing all the clever repartee and creating new dialog that is contemporary sounding for all the worse reasons. (Example: When looking for the dog, Sandy, to adopt, Stacks says to Annie: \"Don't pick that one! It's licking its own who-ha.\" Moments of this sophistication just can't express my total displeasure with this film adaptation.)\n\nGluck's heavy-handed direction is everywhere. No one can escape it. The director can't stage a scene with any musical flair. The dancing is sloppy, the singing merely adequate, and the acting settles into non-stop mugging. The wondrous score from Charlie Strouse and Martin Charnin is as diluted as the filmmakers. Many of the musical numbers are throwaway moments and never build to anything resembling entertainment. (Only one song, It's a Hard- Knock Life, at least, has some energy and fun.)\n\nQuvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis plays the title role and she does look cute enough to play Annie, but she has a limited vocal range and comes off as saccharine and insincere. The aforementioned Mr. Foxx has some style, but is given little to do except look grumpy and bothered until he transforms, due to his love for the little tyke, into a lovesick sap. As Stack's helpful crew, Rose Bryne is wasted and Bobby Cannavale is an embarrassment of riches. Coming off worse of all is Cameron Diaz playing Miss Hannigan. It would be unfair to compare her performance to the legendary Dorothy Loudon. Let's just say Ms. Diaz is just loud and leave it at that. (That she plays this beloved villain as cruel and seriously hateful only shows her misinterpretation of the role and serious miscasting of the part of Mr. Gluck.) Sadly, this film is one-stop- shopping to find these actors' worst performance in their careers.\n\nThe film has the New York vibe, but it seems to be in its own alternate universe, gritty but not too gritty, real, but not too real. The production design by Marcia Hinds is dreadful (Stacks' penthouse looks like a modern architecture horror inspired by George Jetson.), the costumes by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus are unflattering and do little to endear the characters, and the cinematography by Michael Grady is bland at best.\n\nPerhaps, I should stop here, looking toward a better tomorrow when the sun will come up once again. But this feel-good movie just made me feel all so bad. So, I will end with this warning: Taking your family to see this film is a form of child abuse. This Annie deserves to be alone.

I ask you, Mr. Director, why would you cast someone in a musical if they have no singing ability? Everyone else has incredible singing chops, though. The film is surprisingly watchable and is an example of a remake done (mostly) right. They could have cut a very slow, boring song about an hour in the film, but I guess all musicals need at least one so it gives the audience a chance to get concession refills. While it has been updated to be modern-day instead of Depression-era like the original, that's not a bad thing. No kid would want to see a movie about the Great Depression anyway. I did have one problem with this movie though. Apparently they name Annie's dog Sandy because he/she (I don't know the dog's gender; its never mentioned) has a lot of energy like a hurricane. Too soon, guys. Too soon. Grade: B. 7/10 3/5 stars"

The acting overall was pretty appalling. The lead was pretty good. The whole film is like vanity press when someone publishes their own novel. With the producers being Jay \u2013Z and Will Smith , the whole thing was contrived and uncomfortable. Perhaps they should stick to what they are good at \u2013 music production not film production.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's obvious that the studios know that family films are in demand and try their best to come out with something that will not only make money, but continue to return to it, ranking it in with DVD and streaming sales. Material like The Smurfs and the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have brought in the families to the theater, but seem to lack the drive to continue it's life after woods. The reason so is that they try too hard to seem more hip and cool then to tell a good story. The pressure is on to please everyone, yet why can't the studios just focus on the story rather then marketing?\n\nOur subject in point is the new Annie. The biggest point that Sony is trying to get across is that the classic story is now being transported to the modern era. I know Annie well enough as I participated in an elementary school production. The musical is very popular around children and I'm sure their gonna make their parents take them to this. Placing little orphan Annie in the current day has some possibility (not much, but some), but dangerous considering that most kids were already fine with the depression era setting. Let's see how well Annie can brighten my life.\n\nTen year old Annie (Played by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis) is a foster child living in Harlem with the mean alcoholic Colleen Hannigan (played by Cameron Diaz). She lives with four other girls that are constantly reminded by Miss Hannigan that no one wants them and that they will forever be without parents. Annie is the neighborhood optimist who always puts a smile on the neighbors and is always waiting outside of the Itallian restaurant that her parents left her at, promising to return.\n\nWill Stacks (played by Jamie Fox) is a cell phone mogul who is planning to run in the next New York mayor election. His public image is not good as he dislikes the company of other people. During an outing, he saves Annie from getting hit by a car. Though she runs off, someone shot the footage and it becomes viral. Will's campaign manager Guy (played by Bobby Cannavale) convinces him to meet up with Annie. Will take her out for lunch, only to be persuaded to take her in, saying that his rating will go up. The two bond while Guy and Hannigan plot to separate Annie from her new friend and possible new father.\n\nAs I mentioned, bringing the classic Annie could work, but not with how this movie is doing it. That's a shame because Wallis is actually a good Annie; she's spunky, full of energy and has the cute looks to pull it off. Sadly, she's the only thing positive I can say about this. Rather them coming off as progressive, Annie seems to be interested in not only turning all the songs into top ten hits, but the polishing the script so that there can be as many social media references as possible.\n\nSpeaking of the script, this has to be one of the most poorly written musicals I have seen. Emotional transitions come sporadically, the motivations make little sense and even the wants and needs of New York are materialistic. I don't think the Big Apple wants to be seen as this. The worst offense here is Cameron Diaz and Hannigan. Her acting here is legendary, spewing off attempted mean behavior and a drunk demeanor only to come off as forced and phony. I can't blame her, as the casting was not good. The sun comes not tomorrow nor anytime near this Annie.\n\nI'll give this two Sandy the dogs out of ten. Rather then giving a good reason, Annie serves a good reason why musicals should stick to their time period. Let's hope they don't remake The Music Man in modern day Detroit with hip-hop instead of a marching band."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was a bit skeptical after reading negative reviews of the film, but my 4 year old still insisted we go. I am ever so glad we did. In fact, we are scheduled to see the film a second time tonight with my niece.\n\nHere is my honest review.\n\nIf you hated the original Annie or if you don't care for musicals, then this may not the movie for you. As a person who was a huge fan of the 1982 version of Annie, I was so afraid that the film would overly mimic the original. Instead, the film was not, as critics claimed, a \"black rendition\"; It is a 2014 remake containing a multi-racial cast, with an African American lead actress.\n\nThe 11 year old Quvenzhane Wallis was just as spunky and memorable as Aileen Quinn was when she played in the 1982 version. Cameron Diaz is not Carol Burnett, so those who compare the two are not being fair to Cameron. Instead, I was surprisingly impressed by Ms. Diaz. She embodied the original role, while making it her own.\n\nEvery actress/actor, song choice, story line, etc. gave fans of the original a taste of the old, while presenting the timeless Rags to Riches story of Annie to a new generation.\n\nI truly enjoyed this film. I am thankful for the negative reviews, because my expectations going into the theater were so low. I wasn't the only person who enjoyed the film. The sold out theater, burst into clapping immediately after the show was over. I heard one woman say \"It was like seeing a movie and being at a play at the same time\". She could not have described the moment any better.\n\nGreat Movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure why the IMDb rating is so low, or why there's all the hate - unless it's purely racial. I took my two daughters to see it (8 & 11), and we all liked it and rate it a 7.\n\nGranted, I never saw the other two movie versions or the musical, or any version of Annie, period. I knew the general storyline, and know it's based on a comic strip. So maybe people get vested in a character looking a certain way. Whatever. I thought it was a cute twist to cast it this way (and no disrespect to Will Smith and Jada, love them - but I'm glad the lead wasn't Willow, as originally intended). Some family films, I have high expectations. Some, I just want a decent movie I can see with my kids. This filled the latter bill.\n\nI like Jaime Fox. His singing was passable, in key but not very strong. (He performed more strongly as Ray Charles.) I enjoyed his comedic and thoughtful bits. Quvenzhan\u00e9 is spunky and likable. Her voice was pretty good and clear in some songs, but others, especially \"Opportunity\", I suspected some auto-tuning...which then made me wonder about all the singing...Rose Byrne had a nice voice (and note - she was doing all her dancing in heels!). Cameron Diaz's voice is OK. As cute and likable as Cameron can be, she was great at playing trashy and despicable. Yes, she was over the top, but I think she was supposed to be the comic relief. I also enjoyed the Family Services worker (Kurtzuba).\n\nI think the movie did what it was supposed to - Annie was likable, someone you rooted for, the \"villan\" (Diaz) was repugnant yet you could forgive her when she got back on track, the somewhat jerky workaholic (Fox) softening up and learning how to have fun again made you smile, Fox and Byrne conveyed the affection they felt for Annie, we felt badly when Annie is whisked away by her \"parents\", and it had a happy ending. We laughed a lot. The songs, for the most part, added something and were enjoyable. (My oldest is singing \"Tomorrow\" to herself right now\u0085) This movie is not a 4.5. I've seen bad movies. This was not one of them. If you want a fun, clean, non-violent film family film you can take the kids to - and you're open-minded enough not to care about \"color\" in a \"traditionally\" white role - see Annie."

It shows that they can't sing and needed a lot of lip sync for their voices to sound good. Speaking of Rose Byrne, I thought she was going to have a lot of trouble with this role. I didn't think she was a type of person to do a musical and dance and sing. I knew that her acting was going to be great, and it was. I could really feel the connection between her and Annie. There was a lot of emotional parts of the movie. Annie was not only really connected to Grace but also to Daddy Warbucks, played by Jamie Foxx. Quvenzhanne Wallis wasn't bad in the movie. I didn't think it was as good as her previous movie, Beasts of the Southern wild. She was still good though. You see all these child actors that just read their lines off. Quevenzhanne did make me feel the anger and sadness of being an orphan and being betrayed. The classic songs were great and I really liked the choreography. Overall I gave the movie a 7."

Annie as a character in the older films seem like a strong, playful and full of heart girl as she wants a happy life for herself and the other orphan girls. Annie is smart a enough to see that life can be cruel but she tries not to let that bring her or the other orphan girls down as she sings happy songs to them and herself just to keep they spirit alive, but in this version she's a perfect little goody two shoes that has many friends across the neighborhood and seems happy where she is, and the orphan girls who seem like their having fun, and at one point she get's what she wants and everyone towards the end is happy and really it's really stupid as well.

He's a okay director, but I wouldn't call him a fantastic director as well. Now he directed this movie and now his weakness has started to shown, because he didn't do the musical and the other films justices and to be honest he should have done re-shouts and re-writes to this film.\n\nNow the songs in the original was know as classic music lyrics that has been sang people most of everyone and to be honest I found the songs in original to be very catcher and I'm not going to lie but at one point I started singing one of them. The songs in the new movie are so freaking annoying and have be remade in a bad way that this move actually stabbed it self for doing that. The songs sometimes comes out of nowhere and have no purpose in some scenes, and that's sad to hear.\n\nCameron Diaz plays Miss Hannigan and man is she missed cast for the role, she was over the top as this character and I know the character is supposed to by like that and Diaz could have pulled it off, but it didn't work at all, because as I said before the heart and story isn't there and Miss Hannigan isn't there as well. I feel really sorry for Cameron Diaz, because i know shes a good actress and can pull of great performances, but this one isn't sadly.\n\nThe only good things in this movie: Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis did a good job playing Annie. Will Stacks and Annie's friendship together was very cute and done very well, it's the only thing in this movie that actually got something from the original play and movie.\n\nOverall Annie the 2014 version is a movie that in 5 years time it will be forgotten as another Hollywood remake that went no where. This isn't as god awful as I thought it was going to be, but it could have been better, just like other Hollywood remakes."

It's a movie at the end of the day and it's just imagination. No particular color is needed to tell a fictional story that never happen.\n\nHere's what I liked\n\n1.The girl playing Annie is adorable and she does a great job of acting. 2.Jamie Foxx does a decent job of acting. 3.It felt like a remake that did not try too hard which worked out.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\n1.Script was poorly written and some scenes were hurried along and did not blend in well with the transitioning of the movie. 2.Cameron Diaz had some of her worst acting of her career as she did a horrible job of playing a drunk woman. 3.The supporting cast lacked any kind of charisma especially for an upbeat musical type of movie. 4. Some of the music bits were just kind of thrown at you and don't blend in well with the musical aspect that the movie is suppose to generate.\n\nConclusion\n\nI enjoyed this movie with my son very much. I did not expect anything special because the scripts in Hollywood have been badly written in the last 2 or 3 years. Go see this with your family but don't expect too much. I gave it a 7 because I think you will enjoy it as a rental with your children. Don't pay to see this movie because it's not worth it."

But if you have any wits, above a teenager, then you know this movie will be on DVD at some discount store barrel in the near future.\n\nThe story of Annie, which is known to most, is that an orphan that is stuck living with a care-taker that is more interested in money than the welfare of the kids. And soon the girl finds happiness through riches while impressing a well-to-do bachelor. It is a classic fairy tale.\n\nIn this 2014 tale, the child (Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis) meets a man (Jamie Foxx) that is running for mayor of New York and has a image problem. When Annie shows up on the scene, the ratings of Foxx goes up so he keeps her around his rich lifestyle. And all along the way we have a song and dance show that is revved up with the energy of a 'Red Bull' drink with a side order of espresso. But it was the songs and dance routine that made this show depressing.\n\nBetween Jamie Foxx 'spit-takes' and the almost continuous glued-on smile of Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, the staged songs were more of a choreographed induced tantrum that a musical number. And when they did the song while in the helicopter, it just became sad to the ninth degree.\n\nHere is a good way to judge most musicals. When leaving the theater you still have one or two songs that you cannot get out of your head. The message that I had in my head was 'Tomorrow'. But it was not the song, it was that tomorrow I will never have to think of this movie again."

It's SO much fun, and all of the actors/actresses are wonderful at acting and singing. I feel that the changes that were made were done so to reflect the times we live in...certain sayings from the original wouldn't be related to as easily.

It seems that only three or four of the original Broadway musical numbers were kept, I must check that, but I did enjoy the new, One Direction-era numbers and the few superbly mounted sing-and- dance scenes, despite the mediocre choreography. More of those, please, I was thinking.\n\nNow the problems: Where are the cute-uplifting-sympathetic moments?  Why didn't the makeover team heed the old advice: \"You gotta have heart?\" The movie comes across as a musical-wannabe instead of an all-out musical, giving half a nod of what made the original stage production a hit and partly oblivious of it, aiming instead to create another hit. A confusion of ambitions if there was one.\n\nPromising preteen Quvenzhane Wallis who plays Annie has a sweet, engaging and lovely voice and refreshing screen presence. But her most likely unintended black-with-an attitude air does not fit the persona of a vulnerable Annie that a rich, dedicated loner and lonesome billionaire would love, let alone adopt. Bah, humbug!"

So now I just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and an aunt of his and we all enjoyed this one as well. Quvenzhane Wallis-a native of the state I currently live in, Louisiana-is fine both acting and singing the title role. Most of the songs are either modernized or have some lyric changes. The arrangement and dancing for \"It's The Hard Knock Life\" is well done and many of the other numbers are pretty enjoyable though the last number probably could have used some more bombastic power. Still, this was still an enjoyable version of the classic story with nice turns also from Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Cameron Diaz, among others. So on that note, this version of Annie is worth a look."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's another day in the world of remakes as Hollywood churns out another rendition of a beloved film. This time it is in the form of a beloved musical that focused on an energetic, somewhat annoying, redhead named Annie. In this film, the redhead has been replaced with a lead who had twice the volume, and more of an attitude to lead the assorted cast. Now I'm not a die hard fan of the first film, but I will admit that the trailers did not paint a good picture for this film. A lot of doubts lowered my expectations of what was in store, but nevertheless I scoped out the latest holiday musical. So let's kick into Annie shall we?\n\nDirector Will Gluck has designed this rendition with a modernized twist, trading in the tap dancing numbers for ones with a little more hip hop kick. Fans that like a bass driven track will enjoy the upbeat dances placed throughout the film, while others will enjoy the slower paced tunes that have a bit more emotion, and instrumental work. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis has a majority of the numbers, and the girl has some pipes and attitude that bring her solos to life. Surprisingly even the talented Jamie Foxx has his own style in the form of an R&B like approach that is smooth, suave, and very fitting for most of his songs. The only thing that may make you cringe is Cameron Diaz's attempts at singing Hannigan's parts, which was only tolerable once drowned out by the chorus music. Regardless of which style, this reviewer feels your family, especially your young ones, will enjoy the autotuned spunk the soundtrack has, and the fun numbers that coincide with it. What does this also mean for the world? Another soundtrack that many kids will continue to repeat over and over again, hopefully not to the extent of Frozen's soundtrack, or so I pray.\n\nOutside of the musical numbers, Annie is a cute movie that is fun adventure for the young and young at heart. The young orphan's adventure spans the city streets of New York to capture the dingy, poor slums that many know the series for. I agree with other reviewers that the beginning part is dull, though necessary, as it sets the stage. Many of the numbers are thrown in to get the soundtrack started, and some of the scenes are pointless, in particular the school scene, as they are dropped in an instance. Fortunately, it doesn't take long for the young girl to run in Mr. Stacks (Foxx) who drags us out of the grey and into the HEEEEEEY! Once the two are united, the real fun begins as we take a ride in the luxury side. The incredible penthouse is just the first stop of impressive delights, with a technological set many dream about owning. Following the luxurious home come premiers, fancy restaurants, and helicopter flights all well built to actually have a purpose in the film. Unlike some films that develop backstories and characters with boring, often overdramatic, scenes of randomness, this tale keeps the adventure going as our characters are driven to new roles. While this keeps the movie going, there are some flaws to the editing namely some over sappy moments and a rather pointless dance number near the end that was a bit overdone. Also some rather big events in the movie are blown over, somehow the characters miraculously getting over their problems in a span of seconds. Like how realistic is that? How close to the original is it? There are many references to the old one, and the framework is there, but this rendition has enough of its own flavor that diverges from its predecessor.\n\nAnother important component to this movie is the acting. Wallis shows her talents once more, and brings the sass, smart mouthed edge to the role that was needed for modern day audiences. Despite her street smarts, Wallis still can bring out a vulnerable side to the character, though sometimes looses the emotion mid-scene and becomes a little monotone. Leading lady Rose Byrne brings her charm to the film, and her kind elegance enlightens the role. Her sweet disposition was perfect for the assistant role, and helps bridge all the characters together in a fun manner. My only flaw with her, is her jokes are always drawn out displays, of awkward comments that lack timing, or originality despite her good delivery. As for Foxx, let's just say the man saves the film, bringing well timed jokes, grand theatrics, and an attitude that makes the character of Stacks. Yet, the man also has the ability to span a variety of emotions from selfish ignorance, to concerned fear, showing he is a chameleon of acting. Unfortunately for Cameron Diaz, the woman is lacking balance in her latest role, falling into an overacted, and ridiculously silly. She puts too much emphasis in her lines, and did not play the drunk role well, rather just an uncoordinated mess with an ugly temper. Yeah Hannigan is supposed to be like this, but the old one has a much better delivery in my opinion. Diaz does get better as the movie continues on as her character evolves from the orphans lessons.\n\nModern day Annie is a fun adventure for the family, and has some great comedic moments that had me laughing. It is entertaining to see the exciting life the rich can lead, and even more entertaining to poke fun at modern day obsessions. Yes it is different from the classic, but if you give this a chance you can enjoy this simplistic, predictable film and the positivity it radiates. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Not even close, but take a peek at it when it hits redbox in a few months. My scores are:\n\nComedy/Drama/Family: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

Ultimately I found myself liking parts I didn't expect to like and hating parts I thought the movie would get right. The hated would, of course, be the music. The wonderful songs from the original musical have been raped here, updated to reflect today's soulless music market. Everything is drowned in overproduction and all that auto tune synth beat crap. I'm searching for an analogy for this travesty but the closest I think of is when a perfectly attractive and youthful actress starts butchering herself with plastic surgery and Botox. There was nothing wrong with the songs as they were and they should have been left alone. The few new songs here are wretched. I watched with my girlfriend and every time we were enjoying the movie a damn song would start and we would both groan loudly.\n\nThe cast and the way they interacted with one another was the best part. I enjoyed Jamie Foxx a lot, which always surprises me as I never know what to expect from him. His channeling R. Kelly in the musical numbers was a little cheesy, though. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis is hit or miss for me. I liked her but the forced smile throughout the movie felt a bit like mugging. Bobby Cannavale, Rose Byrne, and David Zayas are all good. Cameron Diaz was over the top and not in a fun way. The script is not impressive but there were some nice bits of humor throughout and (mostly) likable characters. The fake movie \"Moonquake Lake\" they went to see was the highlight of the film. Also, for a movie dripping with anti-capitalist rhetoric and (laughable) comparisons between the present and the Great Depression, it sure is very materialistic and shallow."

I had no problem at all with the actors being black, in fact, I didn't even think about it until I came on here and read the disgusting comments. All the people that grew up with the old Annie and are hating on this one need to stop because this is an updated version on the story that was made for the next generation.

        "review_detailed_main": "In this modernized adaption of the 1982 original, Quvenzhane Wallis (Beast of The Southern Wild) plays Annie, a ten-year old orphan who lives in a foster home with four other girls and their mean-spirited foster mother, Miss Hannigan (played by Cameron Diaz). Jamie Foxx plays Will Stacks, a business entrepreneur who sells these iPhone-like smartphones they call \"Stack Mobiles\", takes Annie under his wing where she has some of the most memorable experiences of her life. Surprisingly, I did not find his movie to be near as bad as I thought it would be. While it wasn't great, it wasn't as bad as many might think.\n\nThe singing was okay in some scenes, some of the actors, however, could really use some improvement. Jamie Foxx's singing was pretty impressive. I was amazed by how well he managed bring out his voice during his scenes. My least favorite scene, however, was when Annie and the girls sang \"Its a Hard Enough Life\". The dancing in that scene didn't seem very well choreographed and some of the girls' singing was a bit off. Quvenzhane's singing was quite adorable to watch though. Another thing that disappointed me was Cameron Diaz's performance as Miss Hannigan. Those scenes where she yells and berates the girls were quite obnoxious. Diaz seemed like she was constantly struggling to squeeze her anger out and it made her acting so laughable. The rest of the actors, however, did an alright job, especially Jamie Foxx\n\nThis movie is definitely not as good as the 1982 original, but it was still somewhat enjoyable. If you are a big fan of musicals, there is a chance you might enjoy it."

The singing sounded like computers were doing it rather than real people.\n\nNot only was the singing, script and acting terrible but the whole plot is based on modernising the original film so its almost unrecognisable. The plot is pushed forward through the means of product placement and social media to an embarrassing amount where they may as well have hired Jamie Foxx to stand on screen talking about Windows phones for an hour and a half instead. It would have been more bearable to sit through.\n\nAnnie (1982) was a timeless classic that did not need to be remade at and I had no hope for this film in the first place but this reached rock bottom.

I knew from the very first opening scene that there was bound to be a few nods to the past incarnations of Annie and that classroom scene featuring a \"red-head\" Annie gave a nice tribute to the original. Now, in spite of the catchy musical numbers that were done splendidly well by Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Quvenzhane Wallis, and her fellow on screen foster sisters, the film as a whole was a teeter-totter between \"embarrassing\" and \"amused\" throughout. Why? Because if you've seen John Huston's 1982 original or Rob Marshall's 1999 remake, at least they both had likable characters that were anything but an embarrassment. It wasn't like they threw in blatant product endorsements (fictional or real) just to make it better than its original stage production.\n\nCameron Diaz's termagant Miss Hannigan felt near-similar to the Bad Teacher persona she once portrayed back in that 2011 comedy (albeit toned down for family audiences) and her singing debut was subpar, but it was too obvious that it's her first time since she's never sung on film before, can't blame her. Not to mention her character seems to acknowledge aloud that people spontaneously burst into song for no apparent reason, which I found laughable and seems to make this film look more like a spoof semi-musical rather than a full-fledged one.\n\nWith producer Will Smith aided by music producer Jay-Z, it was pretty clear that the classic musical numbers sung in the original were in need of a 21st century revamp since most would already know some songs were themed to the 1930s Depression Era. To me, I had a mix feeling of wanting to listen to them again and other times skip ahead on the playlist. However, the song titled \"Opportunity\" was the real show-stealing number that I found quite interesting among all the recognizable song titles. Quvenzhane Wallis really stood out well as she performed it onstage and I applaud her for it.\n\nI know some audiences have criticized over a \"black\" Annie, but everyone felt the same way with Overbrook Studios' 2010 remake of 80s classic, 'The Karate Kid' (featuring Will Smith's son Jaden as the lead). To me, it doesn't matter who they are or what they look like, all that mattered to me was how they delivered splendid performances. The true chemistry that actually won me over was that between Wallis and Foxx and kept me intrigued. Various celebrity cameos certainly kept me amused as well as a few in- joke references to 'Twilight' and especially SNL's Bobby Moynihan, but overall, I can say that the film's heart was in the right place, but it could've improved on more than just multiple blatant product endorsements or clich\u00e9 moments since they have a tendency to hinder the film's main storyline."

The singing (except Jamie Fox) was awful. The plot was full of uninteresting events. The dancing was pitiful. I almost walked out. I guess I was too optimistic and kept waiting for it to get better. Shame on me. It's too bad that such a great classic was redone in such an uncreative way. Although Sandy the dog was a stray, it was groomed to perfection. That was the only perfection found in this movie. At least I got to enjoy some movie theater popcorn. I'm sure it will appeal to those 12 and under who don't know any better."

We loved it; I was nearly in tears (I said \"nearly\"). This is a wonderful holiday movie for the whole family; and I'm not just saying this due to a black-led cast; I've called plenty of black films bullsh*t, and many of my favorite films consist of an all white cast. I plan on going back with the grand kids.\n\nLord knows I'm neither racist nor racially sensitive (as I notice many black people to be), but who the h*ll is writing these reviews about a fun-loving kids flick; what's their agenda???\n\nYou should have seen the kids last night (a mostly white audience I might add) jumping and dancing to the music: Oh you should have seen them when \"It's a hard knock life\" came on; I sung and danced with them.\n\nIf you have kids, grand kids, or simply a kid at heart; do yourself a favor and go see this movie this holiday season, and while you're at it have yourself some popcorn, a Coke, and a smile."

I will never watch this movie again and Cameron Diaz role is extremely annoying...Very disappointed with the entire movie!!!! I guess my expectations were a bit too high and how did this movie receive awards??? no idea!!! My husband did not like it and my little cousins did NOT like it either. Please make a better musical movie maybe using different actors that can actually sing and act good."

Shame on you guys for ragging on a movie OBVIOUSLY made for kids to enjoy during the holidays. \"Overacting?\" \"Boring?\" \"Worst movie of the year\" Really? Here's how everyone should rate this movie, take your kids to go see it and let them tell you how \"God Awful\" the writing, acting, singing or however else you Debbie downers want to nit pick this kids movie. Is it the greatest kids movie ever, NO is it the worst movie ever, ABSOLUTELY NO... I enjoyed the movie with my family, specifically when it was meant for my kids to enjoy. That's all that counts. Would this be a movie I'd go and see by myself, no. But after watching, I really enjoyed myself. I tend to prefer really good dramas and this was a really nice change of pace. Well done! Please remember that this movie is a kids movie. Stop talking about race. There was one member here who wanted to point out reverse racism in the opening scene, when in fact that part of the movie was placed there purposefully to let you \"traditionalists\" know that Annie is a name, not a race lol. #IDIOTS"

Miss Hannigan as originally played by Carol Burnett was funny. Cameron Diaz is just plain nasty.\n\nHaving now read reviews - that I hadn't before I watched this - I would say the recent ones praising this movie are from the studio.\n\n(Noting so many positive reviews are people who have recently joined IMDb: suspicious.)\n\nThe earlier negative reviews are the correct ones.\n\nStay with the original version of this lovely musical."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike many other reviewers, I did not completely hate nor love this movie. Overall, I was disappointed and I did not consider it worth the cost of the ticket (my daughter wanted to see it). The reason that it was so bad comes from a failed attempt at carrying on the title of the musical Annie.\n\nThe musical bits were embarrassingly bad and completely out of place in the movie. The movie did not follow the traditional Annie story at all times, and where it did is where it was stunk the worst. I have never actually cringed in a movie that I was seeing in a theater until this one. Honestly, some parts of this movie would make a straight-to-cable B-movie look like great film making.\n\nOn the positive side, the non-Annie parts of the movie were not so bad. Nothing was particularly great, but it had the potential to be a typical Hollywood formula movie about the young kid being taking in by the kind adult, with happy endings, etc. The completely up-to-date take on life was relatively new, and at least a couple of bits were almost amusing.\n\nIf they had just dropped the horrid song and dance numbers and all references to the Broadway musical, this could have been just another kid movie. Children who have little or no knowledge of musicals, or the story of Annie, are likely to see this as a Disney Channel quality movie and might enjoy it. However, if you are not one of those children - then you have been warned!"

What they did to the music was on the verge of criminal they took a perfectly good score and turned it to trash. As for the acting we won't even go there. Rose Byrne tried hard to put some sort of light into her role but the rest of the cast just plodded as if they were thinking what the hell got into them to accept their parts. A lesson for future producers and directors if it's not broken don't try to fix it. Why change a hit."

Quevazhane Wallis was adorable as Annie. Is she the best singer? No, but she's got the spunk, determination, and charm that captures the character of Annie. Jamie Foxx is always good and so is Rose Byrne and Cameron Diaz.\n\nAs an African American woman, I got a little choked up finally seeing a movie with a talented young lady play in a role that I would have loved to see 30 years ago.

        "review_detailed_main": "Based on the hit Broadway musical about young orphan Annie (Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis) has lived a hard knock life in an anything but happy orphanage run by the ruthless matriarch Miss Agatha Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) . Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that they'd come back for her someday, it's been a hard-knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Colleen Hannigan . The scrappy urchin quietly escapes her orphanage and sets out through New York streets , when her path leads her to be placed in the care of eccentric Mayor Candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) . Everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks - advised by his brilliant VP Grace (Rose Byrne) , and his shrewd and scheming campaign adviser Guy (Bobby Cannavale)- makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in . Stacks believes he's her guardian angel, but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean it's the other way around. After a few days, Stacks realizes that Annie means more to him than life itself. But some crooks plot to do away with Annie and will stop at nothing to reclaim her . It's a Hard Knock Life . Family is the greatest gift of all ...\n\nBig budgeted rendition of the Broadway hit musical, stage play book by Thomas Meehan which was an adaptation of the comic strip \"Little Orphan Annie\" by Harold Gray and screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna as well as director Will Gluck himself . It was a major financial disaster , still it's an entertaining enterprise curiously directed and engagingly acted by a great cast . The plot is simple and well known , that's why various versions of the successful hit play have been adapted , dealing with a spunky young orphan is taken in by a Mayor candidate , much to the chagrin of the cantankerous woman who runs the orphanage apartment . The sympathetic little girl Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis plays pretty well the young , happy foster kid who's also tough enough to make her way on the streets of New York in 2014. Able support is provided by a notorious cast , such as : Rose Byrne , Bobby Cannavale , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , David Zayas and special mention for Cameron Diaz who gives the hilarious touches .

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a hard knock movie\n\nPopcorn, M&Ms and large drink... roll the film A classic story from theatre, film and the comics. The cute red-headed orphan with the red dress. We have seen the films of Annie, but this one has some obvious changes. Will the story and music work in this modern version?\n\nKid's Korner rating: 1.5 stars Parent's Rating: 1 star\n\nAnnie is the re-telling of the classic musical about an orphan who is given the opportunity to experience the world of one of the wealthiest men in the city. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild) plays Annie, a street-smart, foster kid in New York City. As a baby, she was left by her parents with the promise that they'd be back for her someday. The years pass by and her parents do not come to get Annie. She is moved from one foster care facility to another and is currently under the care of Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Through the inevitable twists and turns of the busy streets of New York City, she runs into the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Based on the advice of his company vice president, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his less-than-wise campaign manager, Guy (Bobby Cannavale), Stacks takes on the fostering responsibilities of Annie for the sake of growing public opinion. Their relationship grows beyond a political move to a deeper familial connection.\n\nFrom the beginning of Will Gluck's retelling of the classic orphan tale, he seems to have an underlying disdain for the original story. It should be explained that this is not a modern spin on a classic story, but a politically correct re-telling of Annie. Gluck manages to eliminate the heart of what made the original story endearing. Usually the music can make up for poor acting, but the modern spin on the familiar tunes did not translate well. Even with the quality of actors, the acting felt robotic and the chemistry between the characters felt manufactured and unbelievable. To go through all of the challenges of this film would take too long. The Kid's Korner recommendation is to go see Paddington or rent the original Annie instead.\n\nDad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did we think of the film?' We really tried to find something good about the film, but there was not much we liked about the film. The girls love a good musical, but this was not a good musical. The original has 'cheesy' by today's standards, but it was much better than this film.\n\nReel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about orphans? (John 14:18, James 1:27) 2. Why is family important? (Nehemiah 4:14, Ephesians 5:25)\n\nKid's Korner are shorter reviews written by Russell Matthews's kids perspective and based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews"

So what's next liberal Hollywood? the Sound of Music from the hood? There are movies that should be played by black actors and those that should be played by white actors. Sometimes those acting positions can be switched but definitely not in a classic like this. Certain movie classics like Miracle on 34th Street, the Wizard of Oz, A Streetcar Named Desire, To Kill a Mockingbird should be played by the people intended to play them or dare I say it, white people. Seems awfully dumb to reprise a classic simply to switch up the race of the cast in order to make money on it among a new group. Hollywood simply has no shame when it comes to making money and this is certainly no exception. Skip this one folks."

I guess it's that whole kid dream of being adopted by a wealthy tycoon and getting all the candy you eat. LOL WIsh there were more dancing, great choreography could have put this movie over the top. Quvenzhane was really endearing, a real modern Annie. Foxx was especially great when he got to use his comedic skills during the movie theater scene. The closing scene was a little forced but overall a great fun kid friendly movie for the whole family."

Several actors voices were dubbed for songs & All voices were auto-tuned. They had NO dance talent and the acting was awful. The original movie did not need to have good acting because they had all of the other talents that this movie does not have. I like the actors in the movie, just not in THIS movie. I would not suggest this movie to anyone - giving this movie 2 of 10 was stretching it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This new version of \"Annie\" has all the technological flash of 2014 and a soundtrack straight out of the 90's with the modern twist of auto tune. The little actress that plays Annie is fun, and likable. The entire cast manages to have moments of charm. The movie as a whole never manages to be charming though. That's because any time charm is built up it is savagely beaten over the head by the auto tune and drum machines of the songs.\n\nNone of the songs are endearing or recognizable to anyone that has seen \"Annie\" before, and to anyone that hasn't seen it before they're probably wondering how Bel-Biv-Devo and En Vogue inspired a musical in 2015. \"Tomorrow\" ,the signature song of Annie until Jay-Z's ghetto anthem made in 1999, sounds terrible. If Quevenzhane Wallis can't sing they should have dubbed her voice instead of using auto tune. I mean it's not like anybody in this movie looked like they were singing anyway. The lip syncing was laughable. The choreography for every song was people walking and looking at the camera. If there was a group around, the main characters sang and the others broke out into random white people dances. There were no big musical numbers until the end, and that was a big let down too. This \"Annie\" was an outdated update that has no character. It ultimately fails because the people making it were too busy making it look modern and flashy. They forgot that music and choreography are what people see musicals for."

It was full of charm, character, drama and some very fine acting ALL of which is missing from this latest version. First the character of Annie totally lacked the sparkle of the original played by Aileen Quinn Second the other kids where as dull as dishwater Third Miss Hannigan what the hell was that Cameron? Carol Burnett I think deserved an Oscar for her portrayal of the best character in the 82 Annie Forth Daddy Warbucks or whatever his name was in this Jamie Foxx please don't try singing again it was sooo bad, if in fact it was him singing Fifth Grace she was so dull in this I had forgotten she was in it until I thought back to the 82 Annie. This version was always going to be compared with the original and so I'm supervised it fell so short of it. I'm not even sure why they tried to update it when the 82 version is still just as appealing to the age range (girls 7 to 12) as it was then. I watched this 2014 version with my youngest now 17 and who had previously seen and enjoyed the 82 version. She was so disappointed with it she dug out the 82 Annie video and watched that to clear the bad memories of watching this new mess. So will it appeal to girls 7 to 12 who have never seen the original?? maybe but I don't think on anything like the scale of the original."

        "review_detailed_main": "Those that I've seen giving it low ratings are primarily doing so because Annie (2014) does not look like the original Annie and that's saaaaad. Those of us who watched and loved the original Annie (1982) can watch it again and again on Netflix. Annie (2014) is for our children's generation.\n\nAs soon as my children (especially my daughter) saw the trailer, she was excited about seeing the movie. I tried to get her to watch the original so she would know what this remake is based on, and she did not like the original. She gave it 30 minutes max...but she loved Annie 2014 from beginning to end. THAT is the reason this movie was redone. Whoever watches it needs to go into it ready and excited about seeing the new Annie or else you will have a problem with it.\n\nRegarding the plot--Ahhh...the movie is so sweet. It tugged on my heartstrings just like the original. It's not a brand new plot, just a modernized one. Only downside for me was that Wallis didn't have the same strong vocals as Quinn (the previous Annie). Wallis's acting was spot on though. This 2014 version also didn't sing \"Tomorrow\" to death like the first one, but I happened to like the repetitiveness of the song in the original version. This one focused more on Jay Z's version of \"Hard Knocks Life\". Given the modern feel, that worked. Overall, I thought it was absolutely beautiful.\n\nI feel like I should thank Will and Jada Smith for having the vision to do this movie, despite all the \"Annie should be white with red hair and freckles\" backlash and recent Sony issues. The casting was perfect. Jamie Foxx stole the show. He's handsome, can sing, and he's funny. Cameron Diaz was perfect too and laugh-out-loud-funny as Ms. Hannigan. Rose Byrne as Grace fit well, and it was good to see the actors I will always know as Adebisi (Oz) and Sgt. Angel Batista (Dexter). I loved the diverse cast.\n\nWhat made me happiest, above seeing a modern version of a classic I loved, is that my 7 year old daughter and I were able to enjoy this one together. Not only do I get to sing \"Tomorrow\" with her, but she got to see a child that looked like her on the big screen in a positive role. My generation didn't have that."

        "review_detailed_main": "http://whatdidgazthinkof.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/annie.html\n\nShould we remake \"classics\"? When the trailer was released in March, there was considerable debate... Maybe it's just me, but the original 'Annie'(1989) isn't on the same level of \"untouchable\" as Judy Garland's 'Wizard of Oz'. Regardless, with this new version Jay-Z and team have produced a film that is not only important, but fun and lively.\n\nIn the role of Annie is Oscar nominated actress Quvenzhane Wallis, who shines bright in the midst of her co-stars. The new Annie is still resourceful, street-smart and full of sass, now being portrayed as a foster child (rather than orphan) under the tyranny of Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). After a run in with mayoral candidate Will Stacks (the crooning Jamie Foxx), Annie finds herself in a new world of opportunity. Stacks thinks Annie will be the key to him winning the election, and Annie happily plays along for his photo opportunities. After all, she's on a bigger mission to find her long lost parents.\n\nAs you can see, the story you know remains largely intact. Will it achieve the status the original did? We all know the answer to that. This is light holiday entertainment; and there is nothing wrong with that. The dialogue fizzes with humour and the actors have fun with their musical numbers. Rose Byrne (from 'Bridesmaids', 'The Internship') and Wallis have a blast in a high-rise New York penthouse with \"I Think I'm Going to Like it Here\", and Diaz (though struggling in many of her scenes) tears up \"Easy Street\".\n\nDirector Will Gluck ('Easy A') handles the production in the best way he knows how (as a comedy rather than a musical), often opting for snappy editing rather than choreography. It's a let down the film forgets to accompany its fun new soundtrack with dancing to match. The film survives by letting its eleven-year-old star shine.\n\nWhich is exactly why this film is important. Strip it all away, and we have a talented black girl playing Annie. This casting has provided black children with the license to dream big! My little cousin proudly told her mother, that if her school were to put on a production of 'Annie', she would audition for the main role. As Quvenzhane Wallis sings an original song called \"Opportunity\" (watch below), we truly are witnessing her moment in the spotlight - a moment that many other children can now dream for.\n\nThere is a lot for everyone to enjoy here. The cameos are smart, the laughs are plenty, and Annie has enough charisma to light New York City. But because it's not a perfect masterpiece, the critics have been harsh. But hey, it's a hard knock life.\n\nAnnie is in cinemas now. What did you think of the new take on an old classic?"

Although I wasn't totally impressed, I do believe the film had its fair share of cute moments. You should know that this is nothing like the 1982 original. So if you're expecting the characters to be anything like Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney or Carol Burnett you will be extremely disappointed.\n\nOur new Annie is played by Hollywood newcomer Quvenzhane Wallis. As the lead, she is an admirable young girl with a perky attitude who helps those around her see the bright side of life. Annie lives in a Harlem apartment with her mean, snotty foster mother and four foster sisters. Hoping to reunite with her parents, she goes to an Italian restaurant called Domani where her parents abandoned her leaving behind a note. While rescuing a stray dog, Annie's life gradually changes for the better when Will Stacks a billionaire and mayoral candidate agrees to take her in to help further his chances of getting elected. Although not right away, Will eventually warms up to Annie and the two develop a strong bond.\n\nQuvenzhane Wallis is absolutely adorable as the lead. The movie is definitely worth watching for her performance alone. The four girls were cute at times but they don't have much to work with as far as screen time and dialogue. Cameron Diaz was far from believable as Miss Hannigan. She's no Carol Burnett but this is by far one of her worst performances ever. Jamie Foxx was goof and quite comical as the cocky, future mayor and cell phone mogul. Many of the scenes he shared with Wallis later on in the film are heartwarming and fun to watch. However, there are certain plot points that the film could've done without. The dancing scene between Bobby Cannavale and Cameron Diaz was just plain dumb. The singing was bad and it had nothing to do with the theme of the movie and therefore seemed pointless. The \"auditioning parents\" scene was just as bad. Auditioning random strangers to pretend to be Annie's parents was a horrible idea. Perhaps Mr. Gluck could've brought out the worst in Miss Diaz's character through better directing and dialogue. Not to mention the whole \"I used to be a bright star\"/member of C&C Music factory was a complete joke. I mean talk about unbelievable!!!!! Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne,Bobby Cannavale, Cameron Diaz and David Zayas are all good actors. But they don't have much to work with to really shine. Aside from a few catchy tunes, cute kids and an impressionable lead actress, \"Annie is good, but not great."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It's the hard-knock life for us.\"\n\nI have very fond memories from my childhood of watching John Huston's musical, Annie, and singing along to the lyrics of \"Tomorrow\" and \"It's the Hard-Knock Life\". It was one of the films I rewatched the most as a child along with The Goonies and the Disney cartoons. So despite hearing some negative reviews, I still was excited about getting to watch the Annie remake for nostalgic reasons. One of my favorite films of 2012 was Beasts of the Southern Wild, so my expectations were even higher when I heard Quvenzhane Wallis was going to play Annie. Wallis is a force to reckon with and the perfect choice for Annie. This remake (which actually turned out to be more of a modern re-imagining) was directed by Will Gluck, whose latest films (Easy A, Friends with Benefits) I actually enjoyed. So all these elements combined, drew me into wanting to see it despite the very negative word of mouth. My expectations weren't matched of course because Annie turned out to be a very flawed film, but I didn't hate this musical either. Wallis's performance was strong enough to keep me engaged with the story despite all the cheesy dialogues. The biggest disappointment for me however, were the musicals which felt too produced and at times those scenes felt more like a music video clip from MTV than anything else. The story is clich\u00e9 and familiar, but at the same time it remains family friendly and it has a few emotional moments thrown in as well. For a flawed film, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit, but that was probably due to the nostalgic factor and my love for Wallis.\n\nThe cast of Annie is pretty solid, although there were some performances that didn't work at all. Cameron Diaz is miscast in the film, playing Miss Hannigan, the guardian of the orphan girls. She goes completely over the top and got on my nerves almost in every scene she was in. She is a great actress, but this sort of cartoonish role which she's played many times in the past, never works for her. I find her obnoxious every time she plays these exaggerated parts. The same could be said about Bobby Cannavale who never sells his role. I know that the weak screenplay was responsible for this, but the rest of the cast didn't turn out that bad. David Mayas, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Jamie Foxx are solid, but the standouts in this film were Wallis and Rose Byrne. They both bring a unique sweetness and charm to their role necessary for a musical like this. Byrne is a talented actress, and she is one of the best things about Annie. Unfortunately, the music never works and the screenplay is uninspired, but I still found most of the film entertaining and tolerable. I've seen a lot worse this year."

        "review_detailed_main": "You know what needed to be remade? Annie. But not just any remake. No, it needs to be a modernized, hip hop infused remake that focuses on materialism. Well, if that's exactly what you wanted, that is exactly what you got! The bad thing is, this is exactly what Annie didn't need. The modernized take on Annie follows an orphan who has a chance meeting with a billionaire mayoral candidate, but that meaning changes both of their lives. This remake falls into the category of pointless. The original from 1982 and even the Broadway musical from 1977 are more than enough, and the original can be considered a classic of sorts. Well, the film has been made, so its time to break it down.\n\nFor starters, the acting is subpar. The opening scene mocks a redhead and freckled girl representing classic Annie who does a joyful tap dance to rolling eyes in front of a modern classroom. She then gets booted off stage for being \"uncool.\" Enter Will Smith's replacement \"Annie\" who then takes over and of course the class loves her because she's into hip hop culture and \"cool.\" The child actors are expectedly bad, most of the adults are given nothing to work with, and then there is Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan. There is absolutely no excuse for how horrible she is. She's just too nice, pretty and bubbly to play a heartless woman. It was like she put up a ''bad break-up'' mood to act cruel, and it didn't work. You cannot put a friendly-faced actress to perform as Ms. Hannigan: in the original, Carol Burnett nailed perfectly into the part. This is a poorly written film that bounces around all types of tones, with pacing that moves things quickly until the musical numbers kick in, which feel very out of place and bring things to a screeching halt. Which brings us to the music... The film \"modernized\" the classic songs by changing the beats of the songs to a faster tempo hip hop beat. If it sounds pointless, its because it is. By the time the credits do roll, there isn't much that sticks in the mind except one insanely horrible performance.\n\nNothing more to say, if you're gonna make a black Annie, you might as well fully commit and make all the originally white characters, black, just saying. \"The Wiz\" (1978) it's a good black rendition of \"The Wizard of Oz\". And don't come with nonsense like racism or anything like that.\n\nPS: If you liked the performance of Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan, go watch \"The Mask\" instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "I ought to start out by saying, that out of all the movies that came out last year/2014 this was the movie I saw most advertised. I mean for several months when I went to the movie theaters, they would always be showing this movie trailer. They even advertised this movie during Thanksgiving, having parts in the parade looking like this new movie coming out. I'm sure a lot of you noticed how advertised this movie was for months before it came out.\n\nThe movie finally came out before Christmas. When the movie came out, I saw so many reviews. There were lots of reviews from the critics, most of the critics reviews were negative. I noticed all these IMDb reviews, numerous negative ones about a modern adaptation of Annie. There are also numerous positive reviews of the film, some of you who really loved it. I wondered if I should see it. Also, in terms of Box Office. Despite being well advertised this movie made a lot of money in the box office, but it did not make $100 Million or over that, but it came close at $85 Million. So, it was a widely advertised movie but not like it was one of the Top 10 movies that came out last year in terms of revenues. We can wonder how much more money it would have made if there weren't those numerous hacks online for revenge?\n\nSo, I was wondering if I wanted to see this movie? One of my older sisters basically begs me to see this. She told me she saw it and loved it, and said something like she'd watch one of my favorite movies which also came out last year which I feel is way under rated called Earth To Echo. So, I didn't see this movie in the movie theaters but I just watched it after renting it from RedBox. I wanted to share my review from what I personally thought about this movie after watching it.\n\nFor one, we basically all know the story of Annie. Annie is a very common play/musical. I can remember way back in 7th Grade when my friend participated in the play Annie. He even had a big role as Daddy Warbucks and shaved his hair to go bald for that role. It was a very entertaining and happy play. While seeing this film, I thought that it didn't look like we were watching a modern version of Annie, but it looked more like a cute girls movie and more of it's own story than following the original Annie story.\n\nI thought while watching, that this movie seems mostly like a movie for little girls. I can imagine there being numerous girls Elementary School Aged who are obsessed with this movie and dancing like Annie. I'd think most boys the same age would think of this movie as too girly, remembering how boys act that age. Like this probably isn't a movie boys would put on during a sleepover, but girls would.\n\nHere are some of my other thoughts. I'm sure a lot of you can agree with me on this, but I felt like a lot of the movie focused on the music, dancing, and magic and focused less on the plot. It didn't seem to focus too much on the plot until like the last 3/4 of the movie which at that point the movie started to get good. But, a lot of the movie seems like you're watching a long music video or just entertaining moments where all those scenes could be put on YouTube individually. You see scene after scene where it's another song and interesting choreography with the characters.\n\nI also felt like the characters in this movie were so unrealistic. I mean they acted mostly unrealistic that their performances were laughable, especially Miss Hannigan played by Cameron Diaz. She was just flat out annoying and so unrealistic that her performance was totally laughable. Not like the actors in the movie were bad actors, but just possibly not the right ones for the role or the writers made their characters as so unbelievably unrealistic, but they probably did this to make the movie more cute and it also makes the movie funny.\n\nBesides all this, the movie was somewhat good. I mean, the movie was cute. We might like watching the songs on YouTube. It seemed to have good messages that were shown more in the music than actual plot. But, most of all despite seeing how this movie could have been better it still is a movie that is somewhat entertaining and just makes you feel really happy inside watching. It has a happy mood. I'd almost give it a higher rating than a 6, especially during the last 3/4 of the movie where it started to get pretty good. But, there still are a lot of things wrong with this movie even though it was well thought out of in terms of performance, so I'll end it with a 6. But, the most positive thing about this movie is how happy it will make you feel inside."

If you have kids, nieces or nephews and would like to have a fun movie night with them, this is a movie that is recommended.

He doesn't connect with the poor and running behind for mayor. Grace (Rose Byrne) is his assistant and Guy (Bobby Cannavale) is his campaign adviser. While rescuing a dog from a couple of bullies, Annie is almost run over and she's rescued by Stacks. The incident becomes a media sensation and she moves in with him.\n\nI really like the start with the Orphan Annie fake out. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis is cute enough although I don't think she's that precocious or that great of a singer. Hannigan is not that bad of a foster mom aside from the drinking. They live in a nice house. She's more self-destructive than anything else. Jamie Foxx struggles to be a cold-hearted millionaire. It's a tough balancing act to be lovable enough and not mean-spirited even as he is trying to be cold and mean. He doesn't have much chemistry with Rose Byrne. The new songs are overproduced and lacking in heart. The old song are catchy but it feels like karaoke. It's not good but it's not completely horrible. It's a dream come true for materialistic little girls but not much fun for most others. There are some fun references like the Phil Lord and Christopher Miller fish Twilight movie-inside-the-movie. However, there are not enough smart references and not enough real heart. The movie gets more and more boring as it fades."

I know that I shouldn't be saying this, but I found the little girl a bit annoying and the over happy storyline, also got on my nerves. Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz wasn't that bad along with Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale but I really struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when the characters burst into song. I know that it's made for the kiddies and that they will be singing along to the tunes so from that point of view, the movie did work, but for entertainment for an adult, it really wasn't a good updated version of an all time classic. The cinematography, which is primarily set in New York, was filmed well and choreography was decent but I'm not a big fan of musicals so I should have known that I wasn't going to enjoyed it. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: Now that all of these big stars are having kids, like Jay Z who produced the movie, they all want to make songs and films that the kids can watch and listen too, so I can understand why the film was made. Although I didn't really like a majority of the songs, I did like Opportunity, which was quite an emotional song, but the rest of them made me cringe. Anyway, I think that you can tell that I didn't enjoy this movie but I can understand that there will be a certain type of audience that will watch it time and time again. I'm sure if I had kids, I would be seeing this movie from another point of view but I just couldn't get into it. \n\nBudget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $134million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/musicals about a young girl who lives in a foster home and gets taken in by a millionaire mayor candidate so it will boost his votes. 2/10"

In fact, I put them on my playlist while I'm at work. Well back to the movie, Compared with 2014 version I like the original version more.. because more emotional and more attractive, especially at the climax where She was being chased and climbing up the bridge. In 2014 version, they made a climax in different kind of way. Anyway, there's nothing wrong to see it. I gave 6 out of 10 for this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 2014 remake of the classic musical Annie is sufficient but a missed opportunity to truly reinvent the tale and become a modern day classic.\n\nAnnie had a slim chance for true greatness, being a remake of a dated musical garnered toward children. It was bound to be cheesy and saccharine but Annie did not also have to be the bland and saturated cash cow product delivered to audiences.\n\nIn the Jay-Z, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith funded remake, gone is little orphan Annie of 1982 in lieu of little foster Annie, played by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. Daddy Warbucks is not some intimidating tycoon but Will Stacks, played by Jamie Foxx, a self-built CEO of a cell phone company. Other than these main character differences the remainder of the story stays relatively intact and is simply set in a modern environment of Manhattan.\n\nThe film Annie is severely faulted in almost every aspect. Will Gluck's screenplay has all the obligatory parts to satisfy mindless viewers but lacks all the charm and awaredness of the magic that would make it great. The remake adds nothing to the tale nor takes any risks or daring to make the story its own.\n\nThe opening song in Annie is a hybrid of the classic musicality of the original and quickly spins into a funner composition tweaked with the sounds of New York. It is refreshing and a novel arrangement setting in the misleading emotion of hope but immediately the film regresses into the old song and dance. Worst of the musical numbers, by far, would be Easy Street and Hard Knock Life. The travesty of Annie is the spineless way in which it shies from true modernization. With such musical talents listed as film producers of Annie it is absolutely inexcusable and simply lazy for the musical arrangements to be so uninspired. Yes, the film is set in modern times and modern New York but otherwise it is a carbon copy of the original. And yet it is worse because it is artificially molded and uninspired to appease the masses enough to get their dollar.\n\nHollywood has an abysmal track record when it comes to translating musicals to screens and Annie is no different. Once again namey actors and autotune are cast in lieu of true performers with singing ability and it is painfully apparent. Further, the editors of the film could not be bothered to attempt to redeem the paltry lip syncing of the actors involved nor make the segues into the musical numbers be anything but abrupt.\n\nThe only moments that made Annie even moderately sit-through-able would be the charm, sass and charisma between Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. Besides these scenes everything else is a distraction of hum-drum nonsense, making me think Gluck and company have absolutely no litmus test nor taste for what is good in this film. Unfortunately that is not enough to redeem the film because for every magical moment in Annie there are about ten that are atrocious.\n\nCheck out our WEBSITE for all the reviews of the recent releases."

The critics appear humorless and without a sense of whimsy or fun.\n\nThis is based ultimately on a comic strip that was turned into a stage musical. Where, exactly, is the criticism coming from that says these characters are underdeveloped? For a comic strip turned stage musical, then updated to 2014, this is a perfectly designed romp (with one major exception I'll get to). It was funny, the characters perfect captures of their respective types (comic strip, folks; comic strip), and the overall experience one of fun.\n\nOK, yes, we could have called in a Dostoyevsky clone and made this an indecipherable mood piece, but why on earth would we do that?\n\nThe one odd note. The choreography. Not only was it leaden and uninspired, there were obvious instances when characters were exiting their dance segment only to be caught by the camera as (1) they were exiting (smiles gone), while (2) others in view were still dancing.\n\nWe took children, sports-loving boys aged 10, and they loved it. Perhaps the ultimate test of a musical."

Part of the beauty of the original film was watching the cold exterior of this character being replaced with the emotions of a parent! This film will quickly be forgotten, whilst the original will remain a timeless classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Annie\" was a character in a fictional cartoon strip called \"Little Orphan Annie\" by Harold Gray. This strip was very popular back then during the Great Depression not only because of its story of red- haired, blank eyed Annie, her dog Sandy and her benefactor Daddy Warbucks, but also because it would have commentary on various political topics.\n\nIn 1977, a musical entitled \"Annie\" based on characters of the cartoon strip debuted on Broadway. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical and ran for six years, giving us very popular songs like \"Tomorrow\" and \"It's a Hard Knock Life.\"\n\nIn 1982, a film version of the musical \"Annie\" was released with Aileen Quinn as the redhead orphan girl. It also stars Albert Finney as (Daddy Warbucks) and Carol Burnett (as Miss Hannigan). This film had mixed reviews but was the 10th highest grossing film of 1982 nonetheless. An Emmy-award winning TV movie version of Annie was broadcast in 1999, with Alicia Morton (as Annie), Victor Garber (as Daddy Warbucks) and Kathy Bates (as Miss Hannigan).\n\nThis recent incarnation of Annie updates the story of the 1977 musical from the Depression to modern times. It was also surprised audiences with the radically unconventional casting choice of having African- American child actress Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis as Annie!\n\nAnnie is one of the foster children under the care of mean and drunk has-been musician Miss Hannigan in her apartment in Harlem. Mr. Will Stacks is a wealthy cell phone magnate unsuccessfully running for mayor of New York City. One day, Mr. Stacks saved Annie from being hit by a van. When a video of this deed was uploaded on the net, the ratings of Stacks skyrocket in the polls. To gain further media mileage, Stacks proceeded to take temporary guardianship of Annie. However, as Annie and Stacks grow more and more fond of each other, fate seems to have other plans.\n\nAdmittedly it took some getting used to at first, but little Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis eventually convinces us that she was a good choice to be Annie. This girl first gained attention as Hushpuppy in the Oscar-nominated indie film \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" in 2012, which was filmed when she was only six years old. In fact, Wallis was even nominated for Best Actress, the youngest ever with that honor at the age of nine. As Annie, Wallis was sassy, spunky and spirited. Her singing voice was good enough in her solos like \"Tomorrow\" and \"Opportunity.\"\n\nJamie Foxx was made to deliver some lame lines, but overall he was both dapper and funny as Mr. Sparks. He also got to show off his smooth singing voice in the song \"This City's Yours\" which he sang while Stacks was touring Annie over NYC by helicopter. He shares a good chemistry with Wallis as their dramatic scenes hit home.\n\nCameron Diaz can split opinions about her over-the-top performance as Ms. Hannigan. She plays a hateful character, but personally, I liked the way Diaz played her. The writers also added the cute touch she was once a soloist in C+C Music Company! Aside from her solo song \"Little Girls\", she also shines vocally in the song \"Who Am I?\", which she sings with Foxx and Wallis.\n\nRose Byrne was very sweet as Grace, Stack's loyal personal assistant. Bobby Cannavale was slimy as Guy, Stack's ruthless political adviser. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Nash, Stack's imposing but kind driver. David Zayas plays Lou, the owner of a neighborhood store who has a crush on Miss Hannigan.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting it to be really bad because of the very negative reviews given it. However, while watching, I found it generally charming and delightful, thanks to the charisma of its stars. The modern pop hiphop arrangement of the songs and the updating of the storyline with gadgets and social media, were both very cool. This film is mainly geared for young audiences, hence the simplistic storytelling by director Will Gluck. Little girls especially will really like it. 6/10."

The Disney TV-Movie was charming. This was beyond a mis-step and is a plummet down a chasm of idiocy. This musical has great songs that will make it a great musical for years to come. The attempt at updating the songs dooms this film to a dismal failure."

        "review_detailed_main": "Annie (Quvenzhani Wallis) is the well-known orphan, living in Harlem with the meanest foster mother ever, Ms. Hanigan (Cameron Diaz). She longs to find her true parents, who abandoned her at a fire station long ago. So far, her search has led nowhere. One day, Annie is nearly hit by a car but a gazillionaire, Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who just happens to be running for mayor, snatches the young gal out of the way. Someone takes a photo, for this is the modern age, and posts it. Sensing a great campaign boost, Stacks' manager (Bobby Cannavale) persuades Will to find and invite Annie to lunch. Once they meet, her orphan existence is so precarious that Mr. Stacks, very reluctantly, invites Annie to live with him, at first as a strategy for the election. With the help of Stacks faithful assistant (Rose Byrne), Annie is soon living the high life and, perhaps, changing Will's life direction. Meanwhile, Ms. Hanigan is miffed that Annie is living large, compared to her, and plots to trick Annie back into the poor house. Can she succeed? This film has the best cast and the concept of a African American Annie movie is so wonderful. Foxx sings, dances and charms while Wallis does the same, pint size. All of the other cast members are just terrific, too. However, the script and direction are so uneven, that even these fine folk get shortchanged as the flick stumbles again and again. Also, anyone loving the musical should go prepared to find every song shortened and, almost, afterthoughts. What a shame since the music is most wonderful. On the plus side, the sets, costumes, and photography are quite nice. All in all, this viewer was a bit letdown at her showing. Nevertheless, Foxx and Wallis make the movie better than the material."

        "review_detailed_main": "Will Gluck's Annie remake has all the motions it needs to be successful, from a great cast of actors who have proved to be capable and talented before, nice cinematography thanks to the likes of Michael Grady, and extremely slick editing by Tia Nolan, who matches every song with a finely-trimmed, briskly-paced compilation of shots that effectively churn out a delightful rigor to the project. However, the film lacks one thing that would pull it up to the level of recommendation and noteworthiness and that is a soul. The film, despite having strong components here and there, looks, feels, sounds, and moves not like a giddy adaptation of a classic story, but a micromanaged studio project that lacks authenticity in its emotions and beneath its candy-colored textures lies heaping amounts of artificiality, like a falsely-advertised supplement or sports drink.\n\nThe classic story of Annie needs no reiteration, but here, writers Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna tweak things slightly; the film focuses on Annie (played by Oscar-nominated Beasts of the Southern Wild actress Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, making this film the first to showcase an African-American Annie), a young orphan who lives in a foster home with several other young children and is commanded by her mean-spirited, often hungover foster mother Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Despite having such a dour situation, Annie keeps a positive outlook on life, clinging towards the idea she'll meet her biological parents one day, holding a letter written by them and a locket showing half of a heart as her memories of them. One day, Annie is racing down the busy streets of New York when she trips into the street and is almost hit by a speeding car, only to be narrowly saved by Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), a wealthy politician campaigning to win the mayoral race. Immediately after rescuing Annie, Stacks and his bumbling crew (Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale) suggest using Annie has a pictorial staple to Stacks' so far ho-hum campaign; having Annie on board would presumably liven the emotional element sorely lacking from Stacks' campaign and would reinvigorate his image with positivity and sensitivity.\n\nAnnie doesn't mind essentially being used because she finally gets to leave the clutches of a needy, controlling foster mother, and we can quietly hint that she knows she has the ability to reach Stacks in his heart. She's too young to truly understand the corrupt and often dishonest nature of politicians, and sees everyone through eyes of earnestness that many kids do. Her free-spirit is her best friend in this case, and the film follows the relationship that unfolds between these two opposites.\n\nFor starters, the music in the film is greatly hit and miss, but the energy it provides is always welcomed, predominately because it disrupts from the mediocrity of the exposition and acting. The music provides the life of the film, and I'll be damned if the new rendition of \"It's a Hard Knock Life\" wasn't arguably the best film adaptation of that song that I have yet to see (yes, I did see the 1982 and 1999 versions as well). However, other songs like \"Easy Street\" and \"Who Am I?\" are smothered by grating autotune, which only heightens my comment about the rampant artificiality with the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the songs of the film provide for momentary escapism in a film that is otherwise grounded in boring and often cheesy safeness.\n\nReturning to my point about the acting and exposition, Annie's coffin-sealing nail is how lame its performances are. Everyone from Foxx, Byrne, and even Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who showed promise in The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete and Pompeii this year, feel like they're slumming their performances in search for a hefty paycheck. Nobody seems to be committing to anything worthwhile in the film, and any evident optimism is crushed by a safe, antiseptic screenplay. The only soul with some heart here is Wallis, but even she seems bored and unchallenged at times, and how couldn't she? The perky eleven-year-old who was awarded a nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards for a complex and natural performance in a sleeper hit just two years ago is now being asked to comply with obvious and somewhat manipulative emotional material brought forth in a remake of a remake of a stage-play. I'd be bored out of my mind too.\n\nThe other performer here showing some heart is Diaz, playing one of her only villainous roles in recent memory. While over-the-top and a bit too manic at times, Diaz still effectively manages to pull off an incorrigible character, and proves that her liveliness can handle just about any type of material. With that, Will Gluck's Annie will likely be what many parents will treat their little tikes to over the holiday weekend and the first couple weeks of the new year; meanwhile, Big Hero 6 is starting to wind down, playing to more and more empty seats and need I remind you that Netflix and Redbox have made finding and watching older films easier? There are not only more thoughtful options for your kids, but there are healthier ones too, and while Annie isn't as bad as some of the loathsome, \"fast-food filmmaking\" I've panned in the past, it's nonetheless burdened by its own cloying motions and rampant silliness to really pass for something much higher in rank.\n\nStarring: Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale, and Cameron Diaz. Directed by: Will Gluck."

Props to him.\n\nMy only quarrel with this movie is that the \"Tomorrow\" song scene was horribly directed. I mean it was bad. That song is special and should've had way better visuals and direction. \"It's a Hard Knock Life\" and \"I Think I'm Gonna Like it Here\" we're done ok, but \"Tomorrow\" is so bad that it took off points overall for the film's like ability in my book.\n\nOutside of that, it's a positive movie, funny at times, somewhat heartfelt, and the story was interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly rather watch the good old fashion Annie, the re-make just shows you that writers and producers are running out of ideas. Also.. I think they made another Annie to not discriminate blacks. There's no need to keep proved equality involving blacks and whites. It's 2015, we have a black president. Another thing,it ruins a good classic film. The re-make is for my generation of people but if you're like me, you appreciate classics and not always what's new in style. Movies are getting lame year after year. However, there's always at least one good movie a year that appeals to me. (Thinking outside the box)\n\nExample: Shirley Temple show/movies, classic, never was a re-make . 1930's filmed Benjamin button: best movie , it was different and no movie the same. Filmed 2008"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by saying that it definitely is not like the original in the sense of how it's \"upgraded\" to a modern time. A time filled with technology and remixed versions of songs. But regardless, I found it heartwarming and sweet. It's quirky and fun and my toddler loved the songs. A lot of musicals nowadays are overwhelmed with the \"trying too hard\" thing, but this one is fun for kids, while still interesting for an adult.\n\nOf course, the acting is cheesy at times (particularly with Cameron Diaz) but the real concern is how people expect a musical to be any different? Particularly one with characters like Miss. Hannigan who has an over-the-top personality, back-flip dancing orphans (or in this case, foster kids), etcetera.\n\nI wouldn't listen to the hate, I truly enjoyed this movie. Yes, it's no original \"Annie\", but still a good family movie."

I have seen the two previous version several times, and there was no need for another, especially given the treatment this time around. Can you imagine a hip hop version of the Sound of Music or My Fair Lady? Some respect should be shown to the originators of these pieces of work. This Annie is merely a distortion of an iconic show and it appears the public agreed it wasn't worth the effort.\n\nWhile the part of Annie is played by a very talented girl, other roles were so bad that it is doubtful any actor could have made it palatable. I particularly disliked Miss Hannigan in this movie, and her version of Little Girls was plain angry. And the movie completely destroyed \"I'm Going to Like It Here,\" especially with the new lyrics. Annie was never a perfect musical, but compared to this version, the original sure seems that way."

        "review_detailed_main": "A great deal of prejudice (yes, there really is no other honest word for it) kept me from seeing this movie until recently.\n\nFirstly, I only moderately liked the original 1982 Annie, so the thought of remake had little appeal. Secondly, the casting seemed off. Sure, these are great actors worth seeing in any other production, but Annie is pretty defined by her milk-pale skin dotted with freckles, and as-hopelessly-white-as-Bret-Dennen red hair. Not to mention Daddy Warbucks defined the stereotype of a rich white republican businessman. What next? An Irish Nick Fury, a Native American play Bruce Lee in a bio-pic, or Jackie Chan cast as Zorro?\n\nObviously, it seemed, this was a case of art being sacrificed on the altar political correctness, or some other some other nefarious motive. Negative reviews from critics affirmed my doubts, and I felt justified in avoiding this movie. In retrospect: how small of me.\n\nWhen finally seeing this production on Blu-Ray, I was amazed. Quvenzhane and Jamie are fantastic, the supporting cast also put in great performances. The tired 1930's script has been updated to be more realistic and believable. This story draws you in and makes you care. Yes, this feel-good family fare with a predictable happy ending, but it is executed flawlessly. Humor and drama is blended well, and it has the tone of future classic. You will want this in your library, because you will not mind experiencing it again as you show it for others that were also duped by the critics and doubters.\n\nCritiques: It would have been nice to hear more of Mr. Foxx's amazing voice talents (we only get a small sample). Producer Will Smith made some good calls in casting (and avoiding another After Earth disaster), but should have done more to distance himself from the film. Maybe to the extent of asking DreamWorks or Disney to distribute under their label, which would have assured greater success at the box office."

        "review_title": "The new Annie looks great but doesn't sound or feel quite as good.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Purists might rant and rail, but Annie was pretty much due for an update. The hit musical was first staged on hit Broadway almost forty years ago, and was set even further back - in 1930s Depression-era America. Setting this new movie adaptation in the present day is a really smart move, as is the decision to cast a little girl who's definitely more representative these days of the poverty-stricken and forgotten souls in America. But, good intentions aside, this remake of Annie strikes more than a few false notes. The script and characters have been overhauled, largely for the worse, and the new songs mostly fall flat when they should soar.\n\nBright, bubbly Annie Bennett (Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis) is an orphan left in the toxic care of bitter wannabe rock star Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Every Friday, Annie visits the local Italian restaurant where her parents left her many years ago - hoping to, one day, find her family again. Instead, she stumbles quite literally into the path of wealthy politician William Stacks (Jamie Fixx), who realises that Annie's charm will greatly boost his prospects on the campaign trail. With the help of his personal assistant Grace (Rose Byrne), Stacks brings Annie to live with him. As the pair slowly become friends, he discovers that there's more to life after all than making money and closing off his heart.\n\nThe smartest thing Annie did, after Will Smith's daughter Willow withdrew from the then-vanity project on account of her \"intuition\", was to cast Oscar nominee Wallis in the title role. It sends the right message - that a child living lost, forgotten and deprived on the streets isn't a ginger-haired moppet but the kind of African- American girl who really does get lost in the system these days. Wallis doesn't have the strongest set of pipes, but she's incredibly charming (if somewhat stiff) in the role - dragging most of the mediocre script in her effervescent wake. She even turns one of the new R&B-infused songs, Opportunity, into something of a show- stopper, making up for her lack of a belt with plenty of emotion and drama.\n\nBut the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to her potential or charisma. Annie may be intended as an updated tale for a new generation, but instead comes off as painfully old-fashioned and clich\u00e9d. The lessons of social inequity and injustice folded into the Depression-era setting of the stage musical disappear into a heady and unironic celebration of capitalism. There's some innovation to the soundtrack - the noises and bustle of the city form the percussive backdrop for a few numbers - but none of the songs really stands out beyond Tomorrow, the blisteringly optimistic earworm of an anthem you already knew anyway.\n\nThe adult cast members work hard, but don't have much to work with. Foxx has the finest singing voice of the entire cast, and he jumpstarts the otherwise boring Stacks with some of his own electric personality. But his backstory is mostly bland and predictable. Byrne is super- sweet but largely wasted as Grace. Diaz, on the other hand, appears to have wandered in from another movie altogether. She plays Miss Hannigan in so loud and outsized a fashion - a pantomime creature trapped within her own delusions - that she manages to be both fascinating and incredibly annoying to watch. The less said about Bobby Cannavale as Stacks' uber-slimy political adviser, the better.\n\nAnyone harbouring nostalgia for older versions of Annie, be they the stage musical or the TV version starring the glorious Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, will be disappointed by this awkward new adaptation. It tries so hard to be hip and flashy - with Annie becoming a social media sensation and her friends receiving shiny new smartphones instead of parents - but winds up losing track of the heart of its own story. There's something sadly ironic about a movie that's meant to radiate optimism and good cheer but winds up being faintly depressing instead."

I also found that all of the singers in the 82 version could actually sing! In fact Aileen Quinn who played Annie has had a very successful career singing after the musical. The adult cast for this version also can not compete at all with the 82 version! You had Tim Curry, Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, heck you even had Geoffrey Holder who was the 7-Up guy who always laughed \"Ha Ha Ha Ha\" in the commercials! Speaking of the orphans in the 82, ALL of them could sing! This version, it sounds all dubbed in! In fact the girl who played Annie in this version CAN'T sing at all!\n\nYou can believe the Oscar hype all you want but the 1982 version had better songs, better cast, and was actually script-written for the time period of the comic. This is just a sad attempt to make blacks be noticed in Hollywood."

Honestly, i prefer this version to the 1982 version and Quevenzhane is an amazing singer and performer. She's also a good role model for little girls to look up to. The people saying that she can't sing or dance are being so unfair and that makes me sick to my stomach!

The genius of Carol Burnett's Miss Hannigan (1983) was that she was actually a likeable figure of fun and the children had the upper hand over her, Diaz completely missed this in her interpretation. As well as lacking anyone with real singing talent, no one could actually dance either. Anne Reinking, as Grace (1983) provided some great dance sequences. Jamie Foxx's Daddy Warbucks just seemed strange living on his own with no servants but taking in a little orphan girl. Can't think of anything else to comment on as unfortunately I only got half way through and then I switched off."

A bit slow at the beginning, picking up speed later. I liked the cast, although it would serve the character better if Jamie Foxx could manage to produce any readable facial expression, but I am probably asking for too much. What I really found as odd is how much all the plot is centered around phones, media, social media etc. I am not sure what is target audience for this movie? Are children aged 5 to 10 really that involved with all this? Teenagers - sure. But this movie is not made for teenagers. Well, my daughters, 8 and almost 6 missed this bit (and quite a bit it is!) completely. And believe me they are not different from their peers at school. As for me I found it just annoying. Same (or worse) with the details of political campaigning.\n\nAnyway, when I asked my 8 y.o. how she liked the movie, her reply was: \"Awsome! but I liked the one with a red head better\".

Well, we sat down together last night to watch the original, and we BOTH had a hard time staying engaged throughout the whole thing. FDR and the New Deal? War bonds? Because the 1982 plot was set in the period of the comic's popularity, not the actual filming date of the movie, there were a lot of references that never did make sense to me growing up. The new movie, set in modern New York City, was relatable for today's kids (criticize all you want, but there are NOT ENOUGH positive non-Disney human characters out there, no matter how much people call it pandering). The script had its share of small flaws, and no one can ever outdo Burnett and Finney, but Wallis was adorable and very likable in the lead role... her personality was believable and not over the top, and oh yeah, she's black, though I don't think my niece noticed."

The main actress that was in charge of butchering Annie for everyone, did a decent job. Everything else, from the other actors, the music, and script, right down to filming it was all so bad it was unbearable. For a movie to make me want to crawl into a corner and cry for the people who made this, due to the fact that it was so bad that they will not be paid instead they will be hated by every living person on earth, a movie needs to be really bad. That was this movie. There was nothing good about it, I cannot say anything positive about the movie other than when it ends you will feels nothing but relief then a long, long, long period of regret."

I loved the original Annie and was slightly skeptical of any remake attempt. Also, understanding how hard it is for some to progress past their own biases and possible prejudices, I wondered how a black Annie would be perceived. I must say that the writers, producers and actors did an amazing job retelling this classic. There is zero focus on skin color within this story, which makes it perfect for people of all ethnic backgrounds to enjoy. This is a perfect family movie in which everyone we have attended showings with, have given a high rating. I am amazed that anyone would think a remake should look exactly like the original, which was released in 1982. We all have the right to have varied opinions of this movie. That being said, I think some negative reviews have been written by individuals stuck in the year 82 or quite a few before."

I've noticed that with modern films or TV shows, a lot of the time child actors REALLY over-act, which is what happens in this film, a lot of mediocre drama-kid acting; which I guess annoys me since you'd think as we improve with time, that the standards of acting would also improve or at least.. Not stoop too low. It's also weird how with modern movies we just NEED to auto-tune singing, and badly at that. Why not just hire someone who can actually sing? Just listening to this new rendition of 'Tomorrow' makes me wince. Any warmth and spirit seems to have been sapped out of the movie with it's new modern setting, everything comes across as being really superficial, and even though the characters are nice, you never get to the point of really liking them.\n\nI'm giving it a 3 because the movie does still have structure, the characters are consistent throughout and there's no continuity inconsistencies.. But then again, all their key story points have already been laid out for them with the original Annie."

Apparently no one in Hollywood has a heart to become a foster parent, since they continue to misrepresent foster children - which is a horrible crime - foster parents and the foster system.

The 11-year-old playing Urban Annie can sing but is a weak dancer! However, some of the songs are almost \"thrown away\". I just didn't like some of the lead actors. A cell-phone magnate is a far cry from an industrialist or real estate tycoon. As it was set in the present day, it lost all all of its 1930's period charm. No Punjab! I suppose that today's orphans might be called Foster Children? \"Opportunity\" is the only decent new song and several familiar ones are missing. Jamie Foxx sings surprisingly well. Cameron Diaz does Miss Hannigan as an ex-pop star and there are only 4 kids. What happened to \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile? It plays over the end titles. Otherwise, it stands alone as a \"different\" musical remake and it seemed like a cheaply-produced TV movie. A penthouse view is not The Warbucks Mansion. Annie's parents are still alive but never show up! Very disappointing but it was a box office success! It only played 2 months past its Christmas Debut. For another bad \"remake\" see \"Annie-A Royal Adventure\", from many years ago."

I enjoyed how Jamie Foxx as Will Stacks easily fit into his role as a least-likely mayoral candidate, and made it believable. Cameron Diaz took total control of her role as the foster care mother, Hannigan that. Bobby Cannavale as Stacks campaign manager, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, as Stack's drive, David Zayas as Lou, and the rest of the amazing supporting cast really owned their roles.

This movie is poorly written, poorly directed, and shabbily edited. Oh, and the music goes from just plain bad to unbearable at times.

It might've, perhaps, worked better as a flat out drama - though then they'd get hate for changing things, I guess.\n\nAs noted, the onscreen talent stopped this from falling far down my ratings. Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne are two actors I enjoy, I found them satisfactory in this - could've been better, could've been worse. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis is more than decent in the lead, while David Zayas is solid.\n\nCameron Diaz is, however, truly awful - and that's coming from someone who likes Diaz; she's very good in films like 'Shrek', 'Knight and Day' and 'Bad Teacher' but this is certainly the worst I've seen from her - it's a shame that she went out with this as well as the dreadful and overall inferior 'Sex Tape'.\n\nDespite me rating (most of) the cast themselves, I don't think the casting itself is anything praisable. Foxx, Byrne and Diaz are not three actors I'd immediately think of if I was making a musical - a few of their songs are a tad ropey.\n\nPoor, all in all."

It was definitely made with the younger generation in mind, but those of us who aren't so stuck on it not being like the original (although the original was definitely one of my favorite movies of all time) will appreciate it as well.\n\nFirst, let me get the obvious out of the way - Cameron Diaz's character was horrible. And I mean horrible in a \"who's idea was it to cast her?!?!\" kind of way. She overacted and was just overall a bad fit for this character. But Quvenzhane Wallis, Jamie Foxx, and Rose Byrne were amazing. They owned their characters and seemed to do it so effortlessly.\n\nThis movie is set in modern-day New York, and it's definitely a 2014 version of Annie, with all of the modern technology that entails. I don't know that it will become a classic as the original Annie did, but it's definitely a movie to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a shame many have to offset a movie ratings with exaggerated numbers to attempt to get a reasonable rating outcome for some movies.\n\nI still don't get why IMDb allow 1 or 2 ratings out of a perfect 10.\n\nThere are some very poor so called movies in the world, however, we have to get off of the dumb 1 ratings because a movie has personal issues with some movie opinions.\n\nOK, a 1 out of 5 would make sense for someone who totally hate everything about a movie.\n\nYeah, I get it.. different faces and a breach away from the original Annie musical, OK, then we take away points for originality.. Well how about individual character acting, OK, then we slam points off for poor acting.. What about the feel and plot of the movie? Was it entertaining, maybe funny, interesting?\n\nI'm making the point that Annie falls far short of originality, however, entertaining and acting was not sub-par worthy of a senseless 1 out of ten..\n\nI have seen too many movie ratings ruined by people personal 1 out of ten ratings which should be more of a 4 or 5 out of 10. And I also know the reverse of some people like myself who may rate a movie 10 just to offset those ridiculous 1 out of 10 ratings.\n\nAnyhow, the movie was good for an updated version of Annie, great entertainment for the family. It definitely deserves better ratings than a 3 or lower.\n\nI recommend this movie for great family entertainment and a twist of the original Annie."

I watched it because I liked the first one.\n\nYes it was a remake, but don't go see the movie trying to compare it, that just ruins the experience. Go see the movie as a new movie to take the family out together and enjoy.\n\nAs far as the acting, I saw nothing wrong with it, have you ever seen a grown man try not to cry in front of his kids. I actually know someone who says stuff like \"sand got in my eye\" or \"allergies are bothering me today\", so Jamie Foxx's role in my opinion was good. Same with Cameron Diaz, you were not suppose to like her, she plays the sloppy drunk foster parent that didn't give a darn about the kids. So not sure what peoples issues are... Then other criticism I have seen is that they are black...SO!!??!! I don't see a problem with that either Sony made a choice and went with it, and I think it worked well.\n\nI am not a movie critic, or \"movie buff\" I took this movie for what it was, a modernized Annie, meant to be an enjoyable movie for the family.\n\nI watched it the first time alone and if asked I would watch it again.\n\nI hope this helped someone. I will be enjoying it again on Christmas with the family."

They had a wonderful time.\n\nFirst of all I truly enjoy musicals on the big screen, secondly I am a huge fan of Cameron Diaz fan, I can't believe her role almost went to Sandra Bullock. Cameron was perfect for this role and it was absolutely fun to watch her bring back the 90's.\n\nThe plot while predictable was paired with a modern day twist which was highly unpredictable and amusing.\n\nI never knew Jamie Foxx had such a beautiful singing voice. I will return to the theater to see this movie again before the new year and I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available.\n\nThis really is the perfect holiday family movie. Hopefully you will not allow the multitude of bigots on IMDb prevent you from enjoying this amazing moving. I suggest checking the poster's history however, when people make statements such as the previous Annie \"Was so beautiful and fair\" or \"How can we believe he is rich with that ghetto accent\" their racism shines through like a meteor in a dark alley. These folks have a pattern of giving low ratings to all movies with African American leads. In fact, many of these comments are almost laughable. Um, how can we believe Jamie Foxx is rich? Perhaps because he IS actually rich in real life and by the way he didn't grow up in a ghetto. It is nice to fact check outside of one's tiny head prior to posting. IMHO"

But I admire this update for trying to stand on it own, and trying to be better than the other versions.\n\nQuvenzhane Wallis is quite charming has the main character, and does not try to be overly cute to sell the movie. Cameron Diaz who I thought was gonna be miscast as Ms Hannigan, but was surprisingly good, after a string of bad performances, this might be her comeback. Rose Byrne was also great. But Jamie Fox who was good, but in some scenes I thought his performance was like he was in different movie. But other than that an entertaining film, a good update to a classic musical."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm in my early 40's so i'm one of the ones that actually remembers the original Annie and honestly, i can't exactly say that i was the biggest fan of the original. Maybe it's just me, but i thought it was 'ok' at best.\n\nWe first saw the trailer for this movie over the summer and at first i was thinking, \"really?...Annie?\"... but the more the trailer played, the more i was able to actually feel that there was a very different VIBE to this movie than the original, so yes - i was sold and wanted to see this based on the trailer.\n\nAfter actually seeing the movie in its entirety with my seven year old daughter, what i came away with was a BIG smile on my face and such an upbeat and inspirational feeling that still has me gushing today. My daughter can't stop talking about this movie either.\n\nThere was definitely an upbeat kinda VIBE throughout this entire movie that never quite leaves your side and should somehow be cast as an extra it's that good. It's also gone through a much needed makeover and is suddenly very up to date and modern (which is a lot of fun to see happen) The acting, i thought, was pretty spot on - keeping in mind that these characters are supposed to have a bit of animation to them (it IS a children's musical for crying out loud).\n\n\u0095 Jamie Foxx once again shows his flexibility and endless talent in his role as Willie Stacks. The man can do it all.\n\n\u0095 Quvenzhan\u00e9 is absolutely perfect for this movie and i might actually be more grateful that little Willow Smith 'backed out' of the lead of this movie opening the door for 'Q' than any thing else cause i can't see anyone else nailing this role down as perfectly as she did.\n\n\u0095 Cameron Diaz, i thought, was a lot of fun and i even enjoyed her singing - not going to win any awards any time soon, but the moments she had were again, spot on for what the moment called for (and that's important to understand for a movie like this).\n\n\u0095 Rose Byrne was ... 'proper' :-).\n\n\u0095 Bobby Cannavale reminded me very much of a modern day John Larroquette - the kind of guy that just knows how to be the perfect, lovable D-Bag... you almost feel bad for loving him the way you do - but you still do.\n\nThe music, another major highlight to this movie, was also nicely done and scores a big assist to singer/songwriter Sia who did wonders for this movie. With some new songs added (see 'Opportunity' and 'Smiles' to name a couple) and a few changes to the originals, the soundtrack is already on my daughters Christmas list. Don't discount this as this helps change the entire tone of the movie.\n\nAll in all, i thought this movie was a perfect storm. It had a lot of intangibles working seamlessly together. I gave this movie a nine because it was a lot of fun, it was very upbeat and inspirational, had good music, a good message, and a lot of cute laughs.\n\nNormally i would highly suggest seeing this movie if you had kids, especially any little girls - but - I think even as an adult without kids, this movie can still find a way to creep into your heart and make you love it just the same.\n\nRecommended!"

We've watched several versions of the movie (1982 awesome, the 1995 \"A Royal Adventure\" not so awesome) and this 2014 version is definitely a modern adaptation of the story. My daughter is now 9 and she can relate to the modern changes (social media, hip versions of the classic Annie songs) so she truly enjoyed the movie. After reading so many negative reviews I was not sure I would enjoy it but I LOVED it. Don't go to this movie expecting a replica of the 1982 movie. This is completely different but still very entertaining."

I think it was about two songs too long but overall they did a great job at paying homage to a classic while bringing it to kids today. The theater was full of folks who clapped at the end and at various other parts of the movie. Wallis was love able and funny and the whole cast really fit their parts. Overall, great job.

I feel bad for the cast of this film, because I think the reviews are going to stop people from going to see it; We almost didn't go see it, because the reviews were so bad. We talked our kids and their friends into seeing another movie, but then we were late, so we ended up going to see Annie. They all loved it-- boys and girls--and it was so sweet to see them bopping around to the music. It was special for me because this was the first musical I ever saw live in the theater. I was worried that I was going to hate the re-write, but I loved the modern changes they made to make it relevant to a whole new generation. It wasn't perfect and there were a few changes I would've made to dial down the cheese factor a little, but the way the reviews were written it sounded like the worst movie ever: bad singing, bad writing, bad re- writes of the songs, bad acting. Was there something political behind all those awful reviews??? I've sat through a lot more mundane kids' movies through the years with my children that didn't get ripped apart like this movie. I thought the casting was perfect, the singing sounded authentic, the chemistry between the cast was apparent, and the songs were just as catchy as I remember it. At the end, I even had a \"little pollen\" in my eyes, and the audience clapped during the final number. I haven't been in a movie where that has happened in a long time. This movie is for kids and the kid in all of us!"

I also liked the additional music that Will Gluck added. Being a New Yorker at heart, I liked every glimpse of what might have been New York. There are a few things I didn't like, especially Cameron Diaz who was over- over-the-top as Miss Hannigan to the point where I found it painful to watch her. Wallis is an adorable little girl but her strong suit is neither lip syncing nor dancing; that she shines anyhow is a testament to her loveliness. Because I've been deeply involved in politics, I found the premise believable in its fantastic incarnation. ANNIE is what it is: a charming movie for the light-hearted, with tuneful songs and a lively pace. I am deeply puzzled as to what has made reviewers react so negatively--fortunately I did not read a single review before I went, and I had a very good time."

Quvenzhane Wallis was the perfect choice for the role of Annie: she captures the cheerful pluck of the original Annie without seeming cheesy - no small feat! Her performance really shines. Cameron Diaz is a bit over-the-top as Miss Hannigan, but her updated rendition of \"Little Girls\" was well done. There were plenty of laugh-out-loud parts for both kids and adults, and the singing was interspersed well with regular dialogue. It did bother me that the music sounded incredibly over-produced at times.\n\nThe original Annie was an Irish-American girl at a time when prejudice against the Irish was quite active, so the choice to cast an African-American actress in the role captures the spirit of the original perfectly. As for people who want there to be more class analysis - the original was a rags-to-riches fantasy and this follows in its footsteps. If you want an analysis of income inequality, consider seeing a different film."

We took our teenage daughters to see the movie because their friends enjoyed it so much.\n\nThe movie was fun, filled with humor, and really appealed to all age groups. The chemistry between Mr. Stacks and Annie were spot on. Not only were both of them good singers, the movie did a great job developing their relationship. Considering the obstacles the studio had to face (revising the script to make it current, without taking away the essence of the original play). I believe they did a superb job. Some of the parts had me laughing and nearly crying. There are not too many movies that affect me that way. The jokes were perfect for the 35+ crowd, teens, and little ones. We all left the movie feeling a little \"lighter\" with a smile on our faces. The critics need to lighten up a little, I did not see one person leave the movie without a smile on their face. Kids are pretty easy to please, but you know it is a good movie when you see some of the parents tempted to dance out of the movie theater."

The real problem they have with this film is that it features a Black lead, unlike the first Annie film. It's not like Annie is a REAL LIVE PERSON: this is a fictional film we're talking about. Kids truly don't care that the \"new\" Annie is a Black girl. But you know what? Critics don't have a problem with movies like Cleopatra and Exodus being portrayed by a White cast members, do they? The only reason why I didn't give this film a 10 is because I would have appreciated more dancing. People, please go see the movie and decide for yourselves. It's good, clean fun!"

The characters were played very well and little Annie was super cute and a great actress. Mr. Stacks was such a funny, hygienic, character, and my family and I had a good laugh about it on the way home.\n\nThe movie director did such an amazing job of having a 21st Century Annie movie, one that is still relatable and good quality. This was not an easy task, and they accomplished it with flying colors.\n\nI recommend this movie for anyone who wants to go see a family-friendly and family-ordinated movie that will make you laugh, maybe cry and appreciate your family and loved ones so much more."

I thought the choreography was excellent in the musical numbers. For the most part the casting was spot on, though i'm still not sure about the Cameron Diaz part. Maybe a better character actor like Kristen Wigg or Melissa McCarthy could have given it more meat. All in all though, we both thought it was excellent entertainment. It never got boring and the story flowed from start to finish. It was clear that Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast had fun making the movie and that came out in the performances."

I wanted to do something special with my 16 year old grand daughter for Christmas eve and she wanted to see Annie. Hadn't realized that the Smith's and Jay Z was tied to it until we got there. I was so pleased and warmed by the movie that I came home to look at the reviews and WOW...I am saddened by what the \"professionals\" are saying. I am glad I saw it before reading the reviews!! I enjoyed it I enjoyed every character, every song, the energy between the actors and young Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis did a believable and excellent job as the New Annie!!!! This was not a 1930's version of the character but a millennium version and a Good one. I see the issue and it is an issue that America has had for a long time and no matter how you try there is a number of Black millionaires and a couple of billionaires; so brace your selves for the changing landscape and most importantly Black folk support these types of changes and is a trillion dollar business!! Thanks Jay Z, Jada and Will Smith for pooling your resources and bringing to the big screen a film that I could and did enjoy with my precious gem!! Looking forward to the next one!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "People tend to like classics just because they are classics. People tend to stand by it even if the original is not as good as newer versions. Set aside biases when watching this movie. This Annie was not better than the original 1982 Annie, but it was darn near close to it. When people talk about making a modern adaptation to a story that was originally set in the 1930's, it's natural to be skeptical. I'm going to tell you right now: Whenever you think of a classic story adapting to fit a modern age, Annie shows us the right way to go about it.\n\nInstead of the freckly, curly-afro, pale-skinned, red-headed Annie, we are given a brown-skinned, bushy haired Annie with a reddish tint, which I found to be a good supplement. Normally, replacing a white girl just to make the story more appealing to African Americans doesn't always work, but for Annie, it does.\n\nWe all know this is a children's movie, so the story fills 2 hours out to meet the clich\u00e9d happy ending people seem to be so against nowadays. I think that's what I liked most about it. It was modern, but it used a classic story-telling scheme that never fails. It's so much more than I can say about the recent slew of children's films that lose me with \"randomness\" as they try to break \"stereotypes\", \"twist\" everything, and fail to push social agendas as a result. This movie focused on story-development and had the story I wish the original Annie had.\n\nI also like the fact that the music was modernized. Don't get me wrong, I love the old songs. But I like the fact that those in charge did not take the songs that mattered out of the movie. I also like the fact that they added songs that fit better with this new story. And I'm thankful it was a musical and that they didn't pull a \"Great and Powerful Oz\".\n\nAs awkward as it was for Jamie Foxx to be singing in this kind of musical, I kind of liked the little duet he had with Annie in the helicopter.\n\nWhat I appreciated about this movie was how they brought the character Annie into a modern life without taking away the heart of Annie, which is a lot more than I can say about the 1999 version\u0085\n\nAnnie, as we know, is a spunky little girl, with a clever mischievous mind. The 1980's Annie was spunkier, I'll give her that, but this new Annie was more perceptive and intelligent. Somehow, they managed to use her new personality quirks to charm the audience in a whole new way. But she was definitely just as strong, positive, and confident as the old Annie.\n\nIn comparison to so many children's movies today, I felt the concept of the characters was pretty interesting. They didn't rush the introduction of ANY characters and gave us time to grow and learn about each character. Each character had a story, and many stories were a little different from the original to fit with a more modern society.\n\nThe performance value was low. First off, the acting wasn't too good, but every actor/actress did the job. Cameron Diaz was no Carol Burnett, but she did the job of showing us a new Miss Hannigan in a modern world. Would she have been my first pick? No. But she sure does know how to give a mean, tired-looking scowl. The shrieking in every sentence made her seem like an over-exaggerated wicked witch, but nonetheless she moves the story along. I mean, she is the only person who manages to show emotion on her face in this whole entire movie\u0085\n\nI probably would've chosen someone else for Will Stacks. Someone I know is a family man, like Eddie Murphy or Cuba Gooding Jr\u0085Jamie Foxx? Not entirely a comfortable fit for the movie, but he and Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis had chemistry. I think he really did fall in love with Annie\u0085Even if his acting had a funny way of creating that feeling on-screen.\n\nThe new Grace with the British accent\u0085I guess gives a nod to how interested Americans have become over the U.K.? Ya know, with all of U.K.'s biggest artists dominating our charts\u0085\n\nAnother noticeable down-side to the performance value was the literal performance of the songs. While I'm glad the songs were in there, the immaculate dancing and singing was not matching up to par with the original\u0085And let's face it, half of us went to see it for the musical numbers that remind us of the \"good ol' days\". I didn't care that Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis was not a singer because neither was the original Annie. But auto-tuning is definitely not the way to combat the vocal stretch.\n\nOverall, though, I was very pleased with Annie. This is not for people who like a whole lot of action, but for people who like touching stories that are appropriate for the whole family. It stuck to traditional story-telling, which left it solid and without holes. It served to brighten our day and make us smile at the sweet tender moments of childhood."

The major shift is that the cast is diverse, Annie is a little black girl. She is in a foster home who desperately wants to be reunited with her parents. With sprinkles of modern references of social media and modern lingo, this Annie will win your heart. The great thing of his film is you do not have to be familiar with the original Annie, it stands on its on and reminds you that the sun will come up tomorrow. It gives you hope and optimism for a better world to come. The exact message we need during these days full of negativity."

Without pretensions of being a classic, or overcome any previous version this Annie is enough to fill fun and emotional expectations. Obviously has the proper classification suitable for all public, classification that was not properly applied to Into the woods that could have been PG13. One of the best productions of the cinematographic industry this Christmas."

I thought Cameron Diaz did a good job in the role of Ms Hannigan, but I personally liked the performance of Carol Burnett in the 1982 version the most. I thought this version was modified just enough to stay true to the original but add something fresh and new. Bottom line is if you are looking for an entertaining family film. Look no further.

I will be watching for her in the coming years to see how much she grows as an actor. The second time I watched it I watched it with my grandkids (ranging from 2 to 9 years old) and they thoroughly enjoyed it. For those who are more cautious there were a couple of scenes that we did fast forward because of the content. Cameron Diaz as Hannigan was very entertaining."

I thought Cameron Diaz was not the greatest choice to play Miss Hannigan. Carol Burnett played that character so well in the 1982 movie; however I eventually warmed up to the Diaz Miss Hannigan. I was a little disappointed with the way over-produced music, but there were a few new songs that were pretty good. Overall, if you go into this movie not expecting it to be a remake faithful to the original movie or play, and simply enjoy the story for what it is, you won't be disappointed."

I have been a massive fan of Annie ever since I saw Sheila Hancock play Miss Hannigan on stage in London when I was 10, so I was a little nervous of how they would modernise the story for 2015. It need not have worried, this was a joy from start to finish. The story of little orphan Annie living with the tyrannical drunk, Miss Hannigan, who is taken in by a rich benefactor has been re-written to reflect life in the 21st century complete with references to internet, tweeting and all that goes with the technology of today. The title character played wonderfully by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis was a fresh new take on this well established role. Daddy Warbucks has been replaced by Will Stacks, a mobile phone magnate, played by Jamie Foxx, who brings humour and tenderness to an otherwise maniacal work driven role. The songs, while although recognisable as the originals have been reworked and reflect the soundtracks of today. This was a wonderful foot tapping, eye moistening, feel good version of an old favourite.....and it was produced in part by Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, I hope they have more in them like this."

        "review_detailed_main": "My daughter and I saw this film for the first time over the holidays. We saw several of the holiday blockbusters, and this was by far my daughter's favorite (over the \"Hobbit\" and \"Into the Woods\"). I thought it was the best musical and best children-oriented movie of the season. I wasn't sure how they would treat the music, as I grew up with musical theater and with the classics in Annie. I was very positively impressed with how they managed the time difference of the original story (early 20th century Depression era) with the needs of contemporary kids (for the twelve year old set, the 1970s is history, much less the 1920s or 1930s!). They kept most of the classic songs from the musical, and they updated some of them to be appealing to contemporary kids. They added what were to me a few new -- and very appealing -- songs. Instead of using the Broadway \"big sound\" for the music, they kept it more close and intimate, although still plenty big and moving. So, they made use of the film venue to bring you into the music and story more intimately than you can do on stage, where the stage is so far away. It was very effective and produced a wonderful musical and film experience! The performances of Foxx, Wallis, Diaz, Kurtzuba, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Cannavale, & Zayas were spectacular, all. Now we have the DVD at home so we can see it all the time. They made the story uplifting and fun rather than dark, as it sometimes can be. We highly recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoyed the \"old\" version of Annie that I grew up with, and expected this one to be a typical, falls-short-of-the-original remake...probably with an ethnic twist. This was SO not that! I actually liked this version *better*. The songs were excellent--some were catchy, others actually kind of touching. (I got the soundtrack right after watching the movie.) One song in particular really knocked my socks off, and it's new to this version--but I won't spoil it for you. The 80's version of Annie was far more campy than this one. The \"updating\" was not gratuitous but simply necessary (to keep it relatable to a modern audience). The actress who plays Annie is excellent-- amazingly so for a girl her age. If you like rock musicals, I'd say give this one a shot. :-)"

When the weather is bad on a weekend my daughter and I will stay home often times and watch movies. Annie is on rotation and has been watched numerous times in my house. Every song that comes on, my daughter pretends to be Annie and I'm Will Stacks. LOL. There are so many songs that we love in this movie, I really can't say which one is the favorite. We have our own dance routine to match Annie and Stacks's ensemble at the end. Truly a great family movie and a joy to watch. Really, words do no justice to how much I enjoy this film."

But after a few minutes I was engrossed. I loved Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis as Annie - she has pizzaz !\n\nThe costuming and set decorations were super and I thought it was well cast. The storyline and songs were great. The singing ability of the actors was fine - it suited the movie and gave it a \"down to earth\" appeal.\n\nSure there are a few holes in the plot, and some parts could have been done differently, but does that really matter? It's a movie meant for enjoyment. Take it for what it is, without comparing it to earlier versions.\n\nI'd especially recommend it to those who aren't familiar with the originals."

My 9 year old son watched it a second time and my 4 year old is singing along to the songs. I could not get either of them to watch more than 4 minutes of the original.\n\nThis movie is so funny! There are many reasons this is much more watchable than the original today for me. This movie and its director have an attention for small details that are off the track of the original but make it amusing to watch and in tune with our current culture. Hilarious and relaxed comedic personifications and character jokes that need not be but are and are very fun to watch.\n\nIt is the personality of the movie that I like, it took everything I do not like about the original, chiefly the negative agency and removed it, leaving the best and adding the better elements of story resolve for a greater lift.\n\nIt is not a grandly orchestrated as the original perhaps but does not need to be. It is not the original and it operates by a different set of intentions of which it astoundingly does very well.\n\nWhat the original accomplishes with archetype this current version gets to realistically.\n\nThis is a re-watchable title."

I think it is easier for children today to identify with and I thought the fact that it was made with black characters provided a positive role model. I thought the little girl that played Annie was adorable and a great example of keeping hope alive in dreary circumstances. Great family movie!"

I'm a huge fan of the original 80s version with Aileen Quinn and I thought this remake kept true to its spirit while putting some new spins on it. I thought the songs were fun and catchy (including the new ones). The chemistry between Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx gave the movie an emotional weight and yes, I did cry towards the end. I generally don't like remakes, but this movie hit all the right notes for me. Keep an open mind and don't let the critics warp your impressions."

Beyond some of the stars not having great singing voices and one or two meh songs, it was very good fun film.\n\nI watched the Lego Movie and I think this film is a far more funny and entertaining and rewatchable film.\n\nThis is a rare case of an old classic that has been updated and it really works. There are going to be people out there who will hate this film just because they remade it, but I say give it a chance because it is very good.\n\nPS. I would sack the guy who did the marketing of this film. For this film to have so many funny lines and moments and not be able to show that in the trailers shows this guy failed. My niece loves it and has already seen it 3 times and is still laughing and singing along."

Yes, the story line changes a little bit. Yes, there are new and different songs. But they really work.\n\nIn this version, the characters have more depth, and issues around the foster care system are admitted. It's not got the fairy-tail, long ago, far away feeling of the other versions, because it's set in the here and now. Yet it's triumphant at the end and gives you hope for the future. I absolutely loved it.\n\nI guess if you really loved the Carol Burnett version, something like this might seem too tame and too different. But if you have an open mind and would like to see one possible retelling of the story for modern times, I recommend this version of Annie."

Also when Annie was told by the fake parents that it was Stacks who set the whole thing up. Those were pretty big parts of the movie for me. The scene with the dog was made so short in this version and then the dog just pops up in Annie's bed and they don't give you any story to it.

I didn't think Cameron Diaz was that bad as Hannign but I do think they should of cast someone who was a better singer. I LOVED Stephanie Kurtzuba's small role as the social services person. She was hilarious! I was also impressed with Jamie Foxx. I thought he did a really good job with the role.\n\nI also liked the new songs especially Opportunity! Overall I really enjoyed. The theater was packed and everyone clapped at the end!"

It had more charisma, and the story-line was better - especially the use of backstory on the characters. It helped us viewers engage more with the characters and feel sympathy, hatred, happiness or love towards them. The acting and screenplay was a lot better - its the 21st century now, and Zach Woodlee did a fantastic job with the choreography. Furthermore, the singing was better, and the actors and actresses did an amazing job. I loved this musical so much, I have seen it 3 times!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1982 Annie is one my top five most perfectly adorable movies of all time. To me it has a special place in the above ten star category, like fifteen stars. The story, music, choreography acting and flow were perfectly done. So, trying to compare the newer versions is difficult.\n\nThis version of Annie is modernized, with cell phones and all kinds of electric gadgets. I didn't mind the modernization, it was fun to see the story in a different setting with enough new plot points to keep me wondering what going to happen next. The colors were brilliant, a real feast. The dance choreography is comparatively sparse, particularly \"Hard Knock Life\". There are additional songs, one of which (a rather quiet solo by Annie from her super-modern bed) I thought was a welcome addition, the others forgettable. The costumes were beautifully done. The movie as a whole was fun. My little nieces (6 & 12) watched it twice with sound full blast.\n\nWhat makes this version a ten star film rests on Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis being an absolute perfect Annie. No red hair, but well, her acting is adorable, funny, and lighter than air like the best young dancers. She out-sparkled even the very sparkly Aileen Quinn (Annie, 1982).\n\nJamie Foxx as Stack is an extra bonus, a very funny \"Warbucks\". Taylor Richardson who introduces the movie as \"Red-haired Annie\" set the stage perfectly, so let me recommend seeing her more extensive role in Jack of the Red Hearts(2015), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. The rest of the cast fine, but nothing to stand out or criticize."

It is always uncomfortable when there are changes made to something beloved. However, in this version of Annie, the character of Annie is well cast and Quvenzhane Wallis embodies the role well. She plays well against Jaime Foxx. Bobby Cannavale is hilarious and also well cast. I would like to have seen better casting of the Mrs. Hannigan character, but who can compete with. Carol Burnett? This is an easy, feel-good movie that deserves its one respect and deserves to be enjoyed in its own right."

I hope that to many that will seem like missing the point, and not just because of the original being a long running newspaper cartoon series.\n\nI find the music to sing. The familiarity of the old music and the new music, too. The only real flaw of the 1995, for me after seeing this, is that it included music when it would have been better without.\n\nArmchair tourism. Most stories have elements that are not too clear. North of 96th Street, yes. Try to follow the final chase with Rough Guide and Google Maps, I could not understand it too well. Two bad guys drive to a bridge in New Jersey via the Henry Hudson Parkway, then the George Washington Bridge, then south to Liberty State Park and then to the bridge. Why not the Holland Tunnel?
