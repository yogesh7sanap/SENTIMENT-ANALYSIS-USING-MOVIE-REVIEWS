        "review_detailed_main": "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar review :\n\nWelcome to the world of Archie comics!!\n\nMost of us have read the series and invariably, would draw reference to all prime characters of writer- director Mansoor Khan's second film after the blockbuster Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Come to think of it, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar was a clever adaptation where Aamir Khan was Archie Andrews, Ayesha Jhulka was the gentle and kind Betty, Pooja Bedi was the haughty and snobbish Veronica while Deepak Tijori perfectly defined Reggie Mantle.\n\nIt is first time we got to see such natural characters - college going kiddos and their usual lingo - in a movie so realistic yet magical. Aamir Khan was truly outstanding in the lead role and I fell in love with Ayesha Jhulka and became her fan for life - going to the extent of watching her later duds from Kohra (1993) to Double Cross : Ek Dhokha (2005) in theatres. Pooja Bedi oozed sex appeal in her most memorable performance ever and Deepak showed his grey side in a role coveted by Akshay Kumar at one time.\n\nMansoor Khan's direction was of high calibre and he deserves kudos for taking an inter-college cycle race to such level of excitement in the film's grand finale. The climactic slow motion shots are simply amazing. Jatin Lalit's musical score was another winner with 'Pehla Nasha' topping the charts. My personal favourite is 'Jawaan ho yaaro' imaginatively filmed as a college skit.\n\nJo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar released at the right time for me as I had just passed my school in May 1992 and was waiting to enter college life. I saw it with my school buddies at Matunga's Bijlee Cinema and was simply blown away. I went again the same week to relish it more. The film surprisingly, belied my expectations at the box office and turned out to be just an average grosser performing well in cities but flopping in the interiors. This was clearly a multiplex film in an era when there were no multiplexes.\n\nThe film got its due at the Filmfare awards function winning the Best Film for 1992. It inspired many Karan Johar flicks in coming years starting with his debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and going right till the recent Student Of The Year 2 (2019). But then, Original is Original boss!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

        "review_title": "from Orkut's JJWS-Community-Owner; JJWS is the Best Aamir Khan Movie of all time. - Aamir's Career-Best film !!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "I give JJWS 10/10,100/100,1000/1000-----\"The victory of the underdog\" theme makes for great entertainment. a true classic; it has that Aamir stamp all over it. This is a movie I've wanted to write about since ages. I seriously think its one of the most understated movies of Hindi cinema. It clearly hasn't received its due credit. This is the story of a family;family of a father & two young sons;about the bond between them;story of a small town life. JJWS is so real. Life of a small town boy .... who initially is Carefree & fun-loving;goes to the extent of causing a lot of trouble thru his actions; BUT eventually,he takes a u-turn,turns a new-leaf & Decides to take revenge in a very special-way...he also starts respecting both his Father & ever-supportive Brother......I love that scene {just before final cycle race} where Sanju starts crying & talks to Ratan - feels bad that Ratan couldn't take part in the race because of Sanju's tussle with the villainous Rajput-champ...Victory at the end wiping out all his past-antics----JJWS is complete.The characters just live with you in day-to-day life.The vision of the director is so fantastic,and never has he had to sacrifice entertainment to fulfill it.JJWS covers so many different aspects of a teenagers life and the movie has been so tastefully done that one can easily relate to the theme being portrayed.I say this because I grew up watching JJWS and have seen it almost 60 times and each of those times i have discovered some new aspect of the movie. The attention to detail is immaculate and this is the hallmark of a good movie. One of the most interesting aspects of JJWS is the background score. Not for one moment do you feel that the music doesn't belong there and has been inserted there just for the heck of it (as is the case with most of the movies of the time). The training montage(when Sanju prepares for the final cycle race), the music when the race is going on, the music when the Rajput boys go through MalRoad (shouting Vir Bahadur Ladke Kaun...) and for that matter every second of JJWS has remarkable music complementing the stellar performance. The way the song 'Pehla Nasha' captures the feeling of your first crush cannot be described. Jatin Lalit have really done a wonderful job. Last but not the least the way human emotions have been portrayed in JJWS is beyond comparison. I will never forget the scene in which Sanju(Aamir) tells his father that Ratan has had an accident. The acting by both the actors doesn't go overboard and there's no melodrama; the scene finds its place among the best in my mind.In my opinion JJWS was way ahead of its times in Hindi cinema and has been denied its due credit as a result of internal politics in Bollywood.What really makes JJWS compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative. Most of the characters are etched out well. Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie.....The coldness between Sanju & his dad is brought out in the movie pretty well. Secondly, between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually. Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him, until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life. Thirdly, between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju.....who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of......but are still so close to each other. One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie. Three cheers for Aamir who has defied his chocolate-boy looks to emerge as the most-varied actor of his time.----- The biggest thing for the people in the town is the inter-school sports competition held every year. Ever since his cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput, Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them, through his obedient older son Ratan; Model's model student, in studies, sports and character and the pride of his father. there's one student who can win laurels for his school.....the honest, hard-working Ratan who's the \"gem of Model High School\". Ratan is determined to win this race this time......but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang, he falls from a cliff and is badly injured. Model High's only hope.....Ratan can't participate in the race now, and Model has to be content with its usual \"pyjamachaap\" image. Sanju, is a happy-go-lucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father. When this sudden tragedy occurs to Ratan, Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend, brother, son and athlete. The stage is now set for a tale of friendship,love,family,sports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan. All the performances are in top form.Aamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju. You can't help but love him in this sweet role. Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan. He put in a very sincere performance. you can't say that that was his first movie.he looked like a seasoned performer. It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS. Overall the movie was excellent. Amazing story, great performances and sweet music, well-defined small-town cinematography,nice melodious songs.....all-gr8-gripping-cycle-race-scenes . From start till end this movie keeps you glued to your seats. Performance...a top notch.Aamir Khan,Mr perfectionist, was totally remarkable.He is the soul of this film.From his starting non-serious attitude to ending maturing person was tremendous. The bike race is symbolic-especially for Sanjay, who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it. His understanding of his brother matures during the movie. This is a Must See if you enjoy Aamir Khan movies !"

Both movies are based on Cycle Race and are coming of age movie but that's it. Director Mansoor Khan himself has confirmed that he became aware of Breaking Away only after Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander was released and likeness was brought to his attention.\n\nActing done by cast, screenplay and attention to detail director has given to this movie is awe inspiring. Mansoor has directed i think only 2-3 movies in his career and this is his best followed by Qayamat se Qayamat Tak.\n\nIf i had to pick one sports movie from Indian cinema to show to someone this will be it. Not even Lagaan, which is good too but more feel good.\n\nJo Jeeta Wohi Sikander is like that crush of yours from school days, which brings smile, longing and happiness in your heart whenever you remember her.\n\nBRILLIANT MOVIE.

        "review_detailed_main": "Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar review :\n\nWelcome to the world of Archie comics!!\n\nMost of us have read the series and invariably, would draw reference to all prime characters of writer- director Mansoor Khan's second film after the blockbuster Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). Come to think of it, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar was a clever adaptation where Aamir Khan was Archie Andrews, Ayesha Jhulka was the gentle and kind Betty, Pooja Bedi was the haughty and snobbish Veronica while Deepak Tijori perfectly defined Reggie Mantle.\n\nIt is first time we got to see such natural characters - college going kiddos and their usual lingo - in a movie so realistic yet magical. Aamir Khan was truly outstanding in the lead role and I fell in love with Ayesha Jhulka and became her fan for life - going to the extent of watching her later duds from Kohra (1993) to Double Cross : Ek Dhokha (2005) in theatres. Pooja Bedi oozed sex appeal in her most memorable performance ever and Deepak showed his grey side in a role coveted by Akshay Kumar at one time.\n\nMansoor Khan's direction was of high calibre and he deserves kudos for taking an inter-college cycle race to such level of excitement in the film's grand finale. The climactic slow motion shots are simply amazing. Jatin Lalit's musical score was another winner with 'Pehla Nasha' topping the charts. My personal favourite is 'Jawaan ho yaaro' imaginatively filmed as a college skit.\n\nJo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar released at the right time for me as I had just passed my school in May 1992 and was waiting to enter college life. I saw it with my school buddies at Matunga's Bijlee Cinema and was simply blown away. I went again the same week to relish it more. The film surprisingly, belied my expectations at the box office and turned out to be just an average grosser performing well in cities but flopping in the interiors. This was clearly a multiplex film in an era when there were no multiplexes.\n\nThe film got its due at the Filmfare awards function winning the Best Film for 1992. It inspired many Karan Johar flicks in coming years starting with his debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) and going right till the recent Student Of The Year 2 (2019). But then, Original is Original boss!!"

        "review_title": "Most understated movie of Hindi cinema",
        "review_detailed_main": "Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander is a movie I've wanted to write about for a long time. I seriously think it is one of the most understated movies of Hindi cinema. It clearly hasn't received its due credit. In my opinion it deserves its place among all time greats like Lagaan.\n\nTo start with the movie covers so many different aspects of a teenagers life and the movie has been so tastefully done that one can easily relate to the theme being portrayed. Except for one song which could have been edited (the Diwali song which i always skip), the whole movie is flawless. The performances, the direction and the storyline is par excellence. I say this because i have easily seen the movie more than a hundred times and each of those times i have discovered some new aspect of the movie. The attention to detail is immaculate and this is the hallmark of a good movie.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the film is the background score. Not for one moment do you feel that the music doesn't belong there and has been inserted there just for the heck of it (as is the case with most of the movies of the time). The training montage(when Sanju prepares for the final cycle race), the music when the race is going on, the music when the Rajput boys go through Mal road (shouting Vir Bahadur Ladke Kaun...) and for that matter every second of the movie has remarkable music complementing the stellar performance. The way the song 'Pehla Nasha' captures the feeling of your first crush cannot be described. Jatin Lalit have really done a wonderful job.\n\nLast but not the least the way human emotions have been portrayed in the movie is beyond comparison. Aamir Khan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Deepak Tijori, Mamik, Ayesha Jhulka, Pooja Bedi and all the other actors in the film were excellent. I will never forget the scene in which Sanju(Aamir) tells his father (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) that Ratan has had an accident. The acting by both the actors doesn't go overboard and there's no melodrama; the scene finds its place among the best in my mind.\n\nIt must be realized that this movie came out at a time when Hindi cinema was probably at its lowest ebb what with a 50 year old Amitabh Bachchan acting like a 20 year old and dancing behind trees. Even movies which were considered the best of that year like Baazigar cannot be seen today. The clich\u00e9s and utter nonsense(for lack of a better word) make it unbearable. Compared to this Jo Jeeta still holds its own. In my opinion the movie was way ahead of its times in Hindi cinema and has been denied its due credit as a result of internal politics in Bollywood.\n\nI would like to end by quoting the opening track of nasir hussain productions: \"Kya Ishq Ne Samjha Hai, Kya Husn Ne Jaana Hai Hum Khakh Nashinon Ki, Thokar Main Zamaana Hai\""

This goes to prove that films are directors medium.A average script with an above average director can make ordinary actors perform like stars. Hats off...Mansoor. What to say about Aamir.He is a true genius and now he has shown his facets as citizen khan. My best regards to him for his future career."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had been told that this was yet another Mansoor Khan film that was a Hollywood ripoff - this time of the film Breaking Away (1979). So I was avoiding seeing the film. But finally I did see it and yes it is a ripoff, but strangely enough it still manages to please. Aamir plays the irresponsible Sanjaylal - the goof off younger brother of Ratanlal (Mamik) and son of Ramlal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). He goes to the local school in Dehradun, a town full of elite schools populated by rich boys and girls. The local car bike repair shop girl Anjali (Ayesha Jhulka ) loves him but he is lusting for Devika (Pooja Bedi) the sorority girl equivalent in this film. There is inter-school rivalry spearheaded by 'Deepak Tijori as the hero of the rich guys and Ratanlal as the hero of the poor guys. The cornerstone of this rivalry is a bike race that Tijori has won for two straight years. But dirty work is afoot and Ratanlal is injured. Will Sanjaylal be able to take his brother place and bring glory to the school and his father?\n\nThe film is predictable but still manages to hold one's interest and the sports scenes are quite well done. This film is from an era when extras were juts that - extras - no one other than the main players looks at all like a college kid! But the main actors do a decent job. Aamir is fun as the scamp Sanjaylal - I have always liked him in his 'scamp playing the wide eyed innocent' roles. The ladies are very forgettable, Kulbhushan Kharbanda is great, Deepak Tijori is an adequate other man. The films is well directed and has one great song - Pehla Nasha, and other okay songs. If it were not so blatantly ripped off one could actually go - hey this is not bad at all. But it is still worth a watch and will keep you engaged."

It remains minimalist, in the sense that it does not opt for glamour or exotic locations. It is very charming in its realistic depiction of youthful life.\n\nSo, we have college gangs taking over each other in sports, and amidst all the heated competition, several instances of romance. A story designed to win. The songs were hummable, with obviously Pehla Nasha standing out.\n\nPerformance wise, I simply loved Ayesha Jhulka, for me she was the screen stopper. Pooja Bedi was very charming too; and gave an earnest performance. Deepak Tijori was fantastic as always. Deven Bhojani was too cute. I was not very impressed by Mamik and Aamir though, who did not seem to give their best to the role.\n\nOverall, a very feel good film from the nineties, an era of romance and drama. Can be watched without regret."
