I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.\n\nJudging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.\n\nFrom a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.\n\nI thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.\n\nBut for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.\n\nIn typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.\n\nAll-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family."

Love, Care, Share, Being Human. Simple, sweet, innocent. His eyes and expressions are enough. Never seen image of Salman. As he has said no one clapped for his shirtless scene. HARSHALI as Munni (Shahida) is super cute. That innocence she has made our hearts to melt. Her sweetness steals the show. Without her voice she says everything. Understanding, the bonding between her & Salman is beyond perfection. NAWAZ as Pakistani Reporter Chand Nawab is mind blowing. How he helps Salman & Munni that's must watch in movie. KAREENA as Rasika is beautiful & played her part very well. Each scene is perfect. Story by V. Vijayendra Prasad is outstanding. All are just perfect in their respective characters. Or I'll say no one can do them other than Salman, Harshali & Nawaz. Perfect direction by KABIR KHAN. Aseem Mishra as DOP has shown Kashmir's true beauty. Love moments, fun moments, emotional moments everything is perfect. There is not a single moment in whole movie at where you'll think it is unnecessary. Movie will force you to think God, Religion, Country, Boundary no one can stop Love & Humanity. You will surely love Pavan & Harshali. Super natural acting by them. DON'T MISS IT. GO & WATCH BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN."

        "review_detailed_main": "After seven years of Mehreen Jabbar's Pakistani film titled RAMCHAND PAKISTANI (2008), revolving around an 8 year old kid and his father unintentionally crossing the border into Indian Territory, we now have our own BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN made on a similar kind of subject having an adorable kid girl from Pakistan lost in India, to be rescued by arguably the most popular Khan icon in India, Salman Khan.\n\nAs a preview article written a day before the release, I mentioned five potential USP's of BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN other than its plot or Salman Khan as: 1. The Director \u2013 Kabir Khan 2. Harshali Malhotra (the cute little girl) 3. Journey to Pakistan (reminding you of Tara Singh of 'Gadar: Ek Prem Katha') 4. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (repeating his solid support as seen in 'Kick') 5. And above all Lord Hanuman (as the divine saviour helping in the heartfelt task invisibly)\n\nLuckily as speculated, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN intelligently exploits the above five points only as its major strength and delivers a largely entertaining film with a decent first and an electrifying second half ending on an exaggerated yet emotionally charged note leaving a positive impact on the viewers. And all this, without any typical item number, specially focused love affair, romantic songs or overdose of action quite surprisingly.\n\nTo give you the details how the above mentioned USPs are well incorporated in the film, it begins with the first 10-12 minutes completely focusing on the adorable little girl, who straight away wins your heart with her innocent looks, smile and effortless expressions.\n\nWith Salman Khan being introduced as a true Bajrang Bali devotee, the 'selfie song' raises the spirits superbly. And then the film keeps progressing till the next hour as a simple but sweetly executed social family drama with all clean entertainment focusing on the cute little girl and differently innocent, immensely likable Salman Khan that was missing in all his recent blockbusters since WANTED. So the only minus to be mentioned in the first half remains a couple of average songs, particularly the 'Chicken' track that surely could have been edited out to keep the pace going. Post interval, where the film offers much more entertainment though its various sequence in Pakistan, you lost the count of creative liberties taken right from the border crossing sequence to the 'larger-than-life' climax, portrayed with all good intentions. Nawazuddin once again makes his much awaited entry with a bang, enacting a lifted sequence from a real life viral-video of a Pakistani reporter (having a similar name). Nawazuddin simply takes over from here till the end, winning hearts with his fabulous act of a kind human helping Salman and the kid girl without any hidden motives.\n\nIf watched with a realistic mindset, the film does have many 'impossible situations' depicting the relationship between the neighboring countries and the way Pakistan's police/military deals with the sensitive issue of catching a spy. But after few minutes of enjoying all the pleasant insertions post interval, one begins to think that 'to hell with whether this is possible or not, lets enjoy the proceedings on screen with the trio (Salman-the Girl & Nawazuddin).\n\nAs a director Kabir Khan brilliantly rediscovers himself from being an experimental director of KABUL EXPRESS to an entertaining commercial film-maker following the Raj Kumar Hirani school of thought, wherein everyone in the script has a golden heart. He extracts an extremely lovable performance from the charming Harshali Malhotra and also thankfully presents Salman Khan as the same old, big hearted, honest, childlike person hugely loved by one and all for their various reasons. In other words Salman actually acts this time with an author backed role performed well, answering all questions raised upon his recent performances strongly. On the other hand, Harshali is a real delight to watch with all perfect emotions and her scenes together with Salman remain the highlight of the film throughout, right till the last frame.\n\nSo here we have a film that can easily be called as the best among Salman Khan starrers in the last decade with an equally important message for the 'not so friendly' nations along with many well- written & brightly enacted supporting acts coming from Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Om Puri, Sharat Saxena, Rajesh Sharma and more. However as far as the leading heroine of the film is concerned, Kareena Kapoor needs to be applauded for accepting this kind of (unimportant) miniscule role and making the best of her limited scenes given like a true professional.\n\nBeautifully shot capturing the breathtaking locations of Kashmir, BB has an impressive background score by Julius Packiam and enjoyable dialogues written by Kabir Khan & Kausan Munir together, that stay away from any standard jingoism or clich\u00e9d preaching. Also as a surprising fact, the film's story has been written by V. Vijayendra Prasad, the story writer of BAHUBALI, setting Indian box office on fire since the last Friday.\n\nAmong the downers, we have its lackluster music unexpectedly composed by Pritam returning from a long break. In fact even the hugely famous qawaali originally sung by Sabri Brothers doesn't turn out to be that impressive in Adnan Sami's voice who is known to sing in much lower scales.\n\nIn all, BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN is a thoroughly entertaining film with its five USPs intact along with a clear message for the people of both India and Pakistan. Yes, it becomes too filmy with huge cinematic liberties taken in its border crossing sequences and the epic climax that is simply not possible in the actual scenario. But at times, such films seriously make you wish that may all the cinematic liberties taken on the screen somehow become true and we learn to forget our ugly past for the benefits of the generations to come at the earliest."

Its not Salman's type of movies but probably the best one.\n\nKK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots.

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint!\n\nAnd more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.\n\nThere is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that \"Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't.\"\n\nThe movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)"

A movie about an Indian who helps a Pakistani girl to go back to her country so she can be reunited with her parents. It teaches us that humanity is far above religion. In New Zealand this movie was a huge hit and after 5 weeks people are still talking about it. Brilliant performances, great script, excellent screenplay, crisp editing, great music and above average direction makes Bajrangi Bhaijaan the best movie of the year. It is sheer entertainment and I am yet to meet anyone who has disliked this movie. I am rating it 10/10 but honestly speaking this movie is beyond that. The true rating is reflected when a viewer leaves at the end of the movie with a smile and tears in their eyes. A very emotional movie.. It is one of the best movies to come out of Bollywood. Well done Salman Khan and thank you for entertaining us. Congratulations to Kabir Khan and the rest of the cast and crew. If you have not watched Bajrangi Bhaijaan please do, trust me you will not regret it.."

        "review_title": "Kabir Khan's Best Work To Date",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit, I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijan (BB) with a lot of prejudice. I am not a big fan of Kabir Khan, have not liked Kareena Kapoor other than Jab We Met. I am not a Salman Fan either nd despite that I watch all his Eid releases on first day.\n\nI had four hypotheses before going to the theater and I had made an outline of the review I was going to write. Generally it's a set template for a Kabir Khan Salman Khan film. Nonetheless, my predetermined conclusion of BB being a mediocre film was proved wrong.\n\n1. Kareena Kapoor will be unnecessary in the film \u2013 Proved True. Not just Kareena, the entire subplot of Salman's love interest was completely unnecessary. In the first half, a good twenty minutes were spent on establishing the love story between Salman and Kareena. As the film lasted 163 minutes, cutting fifteen of those minutes and a song could have made the edit sharper and more gripping. The role could have been played by any actress. Salman could have been a married or single man in the film. It would not have had any impact on the final outcome.\n\n2. Nawazuddin Siddiui will be brilliant \u2013 Proved True. And boy he was fantastic. His intro sequence is a straight lift from Pakistan's very own Chaand Nawab and as it turns out, his character is actually called Chaand Nawab. Nawaz comes on screen only in the second half of BB and took the burden of carrying the film on his gifted shoulders. His chemistry with Salman is something seen very rarely between male leads of a film. Immaculate comic timing, perfect body language and expressive eyes. I am not gonna say more but if someone is selling T-shirts saying \"I heart Nawazudding Siddiqui\", let me know.\n\n3. Salman Khan will not be able to emote as per the requirements of the role \u2013 50/50. Salman as an actor has limitations, we all know that. Have those precincts ever made any difference? No. Salman is not a method actor. He will never be Naseer or Aamir. I watch Salman Khan films to see whether he is better than his other films or not. In BB, the actor has put in a genuine effort to emote and get into the skin of the role. This is one of the best performances of bhai's career, if not the best. His demeanor as a simple villager is to the point, his performance towards the latter half of the film is strong. He has a very powerful scene in the first half at a brothel, where he struggled to convince on the emotions, but still did better than his other films. BB has no over the top action, or dances, or shirtless sequences or romantic songs. It is heavily dependent on the lead actor. Funnily, despite all the limitations Salman Khan has, I was unable to picture any other actor playing Bajrangi. BB did not need an actor. BB needed Salman Khan the star to deliver and he has delivered.\n\nThe good thing is that Salman is not the only super star in the film. The other one is Harshaali Malhotra, the child actor playing Shahida. Super cute, super charming and super convincing. It was a challenging role with no dialogs and the kid really showed her competence despite presence of some big names in the film. Darsheel Safari level stuff.\n\nKabir Khan is just a glorified, slightly more intelligent Farah Khan \u2013 Proved Wrong. This is where I was completely wrong. The problem I have had with other KK films is that they were on a pretense of being intelligent and logical social dramas, which in reality they were not be it New York or Ek Tha Tiger. They were more intelligent than Farah Khan, Prabhudeva and Rohit Shetty films, hence made the masses (read Salman Khan fans) feel that they are watching intellectual cinema. This strategy resulted in big commercial success for KK. That still does not mean that those films were good films.\n\nBB is different. KK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots. BB spreads across various cities and weathers and production design and art direction is always tough for such films. Credit to KK for utilizing the resources at hand in the best possible way.\n\nLastly, he has done remarkably well in treatment of the screenplay. He knew when to take creative liberty in best interest of the film (Armies of both countries being lenient on borders etc.) and knew when to make things look realistic (tunnels at the border, Samjhota express, Shahid Afridi etc.). He could have done better with the duration of the climax though by eliminating some unnecessary emotional manipulations.\n\nBB is not an Anti-Pakistan film. The filmmakers have tried being reasonable as much as they could without ruining the story requirements. They have shown good and bad on both the sides. The film also touched upon religious divide and there it has shown Muslims as the more accommodating of the two religions. What it does communicate strongly is the secular message of modern India.\n\nIt's a possibility that it will be a lesser commercial success than Kick or Ek Tha Tiger. BB is not a typical Salman Khan film. BB is not a typical Kabir Khan film. BB is a good film."

Harshali Malhotra also impressive without uttering a single line and she has a good chemistry with Salman Khan. The rest of the supporting casts are all good.

        "review_detailed_main": "Kabir Khan triumphs with a yet another winner with 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Khan delivers a film thats heartwarming, emotional & extremely entertaining. And Salman is exceptional, delivering his finest performance to date in the title role.\n\n'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' Synopsis: A young mute girl from Pakistan loses herself in India with no way to head back. A devoted man with a magnanimous spirit undertakes the task to get her back to her motherland and unite her with her family.\n\n'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a heartwarming tale about love & unity. Though a subtle father-daughter story at heart, the film is also an effective commentary on the India-Pakistan conflict/relationship, that exists even today. The narrative beautifully makes space for humour, strong emotions & also poignant drama.\n\nWhile the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters & shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan & the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist & the child, are undeniably engaging & moving. And the climax, though slightly melodramatic, that too leaves an impact.\n\nKhan, V. Vijayendra Prasad, Parveez Shaikh & Asad Hussai's Screenplay is excellent. It very believably blends many emotions & also courageously comments on the long-lasting topic of India-Pakistan. But its done effectively. Barring the slightly under-whelming climax, the Writing is consistently engaging otherwise. Khan's Direction is top-notch. He has handled the film with skill. Aseem Mishra's Cinematography captures the Stunning Locales of Kashmir, superbly. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film runs for over a 155-minutes. Music by Various Artists is lovely. Art & Costume Design are satisfactory.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence. He's restrained, affecting & absolutely lovable, proving once again that he's much more than a box-offer thunder. He's the soul of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on-screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing & walks away with some of the film's best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. Sharat Saxena is good. Others lend fair support.\n\nOn the whole, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' has its heart & soul at the right place. It wins you over completely, with its heart touching story. Strongly Recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is hands down one of the finest movies out of many I have seen this year. Simple, effective and mesmerizing. It brings all the superlative emotions out of you! (I am talking about the tears of joy). I have enjoyed previous Salman Khan movies because of their raw entertainment factor but that's just it. In more simple words they were mostly 'time pass' flicks to take your head off things. Bajrangi Bhaijaan on the other hand highlights a scenario where you just want to give most characters a tight hug as it make them seem so real! Salman Khan deserves much more attention for this film than what he has received. A splendid performance by him unlike any other movie he has done. The real winner her is Harshaali Malhotra with an impressive work. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as always was extremely natural. A righteously made movie with an important moral message for both countries and their rivalry. All in all, Kabir Khan have made up for past presentations with Bajrangi Bhaijan and it is a must watch! Salman Khan's journey to get Munni home will create wonders in your heart. It is one of those movies which I would buy on bluray and add it to my collection.\n\nI give it a 10/10 not because of any biases but because it literally gave me shivers and touched my heart."

        "review_detailed_main": "Years ago, I had watched \"Henna\" in which the hero enters Pakistan by crossing Indian Border in an accident. The heroine helps him to return India through the border getting herself killed across the barbed fences. The film is still remembered for its sheer beauty and a symbolic gesture on India and Pakistan relationships concluding humanity isn't confined to any border.\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" too plays with the similar theme in which Salman Khan enters the Pakistan Border illegally to take a six year old mute girl to her home who gets separated with her mother and reaches India. The Pakistani police suspects him of a detective and detains him. The rest of the story involves the attempt on crossing of the border to enter India and the support the hero receives from the Pakistanis. Just like \"Henna\" the film is a visual treat with an excellent views of Pakistani landscapes. The role of the child as a mute girl is brilliant and touches you deep. Her role far surpasses the roles of Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Nawazzadin Siddhiqui in a brief role of a reporter sparkles and give the film a leverage.\n\nBut in terms of script the film falls a bit short with much of the leverage given on different religions and the support given on the superstitions following the religions, which appears a bit misleading and preachy. Salman's role was pretty unbelievable, and his response to the situations seem pretty unnatural. Overall, the film is impressive in parts with mesmerizing moments created through the six year old child in the central role and the beautiful expanses and mountains of Pakistan captured in the screen.\n\nRating: 2 stars out of 4"

But I'm posting my honest confession for all those to whom it matters. This movie is not a typical Salman Khan masala movie but much more than that.\n\nI went with the expectation of watching my favorite hero Salman, but to my surprise. I found out that The lead hero of this movie is story. Then the captain of the ship Kabir Khan. Then that little angel harshali Malhotra. And after that Salman and Nawaz.\n\nThe first half could have been edited little bit but you can't blame a guy like Kabir Khan who has shot documentary films all his career. The second half of this movie is simply amazing and you keep getting connected with this movie. The climax and the overall movie is a masterpiece.\n\nNawaz was awesome as always. Harshali was treat to eyes and she expressed so many things without saying a single word. The surprise package was Salman Bhai's acting and the best thing about his acting was the honesty with which he lived the character of bajrangi. The concept of hindu-Muslim and Ind-Pak is essayed with purest of humanity without disrespecting anyone.\n\nGo and watch this film with your family. If you try to find mistakes, then not a single movie will come clean. But if you want to find out positives, then this movie is full of them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie gave a right impression right from the word go. From starting, the cinematography and the movie flow was very soothing and never went out of stream. It's really hard to believe that Salman's movie will be based on content. Hence it takes time for a viewer and consistent effort from director to believe it. Fortunately, this movie does all. Kept its movie theme intact and didn't fall into the trap of silly commercialization. Although crowd still goes mad when Sallu enters or shows his style. The movie had its limitations such as over extension of the story towards the end of second half, despite it maintained a decent pace. Many scenes were over-engineered but the sentiments were always preserved in a correct way. It showed a good angle of Indo Pak love relationship without any foolish sentiments.\n\nEveryone delivered an average acting performance with Salman and Nawazuddin slightly above the rest. There were few good Pakistani scenes involving Nawaz in which he nailed most of it. Neither Salman showed his standard stupidity nor the movie tried to structure like that.\n\nQuite experienced with Hindu-Muslim and Indo-Pak relationships, Kabir Khan made a good use of it. Direction was consistently good and effort was noticeable. He made sure movie doesn't loose its plot and becomes lovable.\n\nMusic was avoidable and anyways made no impact either ways.\n\nOverall, movie with good sentiments that never looses its plot."

        "review_detailed_main": "I appreciate the intention making behind this film but entertainment and intrigue value are less. Basically this film was not demanding such type of huge setup but due to star cast Director Mr. Kabeer Khan has to do it. There was just an idea in the name of story. Screenplay is very convenient but few scenes are undoubtly cute, realistic and fresh, like introduction scene of Kareena Kapoor. Dialogues by Kausar Munir, are OK. Film takes a cute start but that ended just 20 minutes, then it begins to stretch the scenes, which results slowdown of film. The baby girl is so endearing, cute and innocent that screenplay fails to convey that why any one will go up to the extent to go Pakistan just for reuniting her with family but her look convey and convince easily that any one can go. Credit goes to casting team. Flash back scenes bring smile on face. For showing main male protagonist innocent they made him stupid. Film has set in 2015 but he does not even know that going Pakistan is not a kid play, that means he never reads paper or watch TV, Which type of person he was? But he suggested good excuse in Dargah to misguide Police, this was his hidden expect, which was never even hinted before. It's hard to relate with him. Sometimes we feel pity for him and sometimes irritating too. This goes completely against Salman Khan image and personality. When makers found that film is slowing down, they suddenly made some Pakistani officer cruel otherwise they were like NGO people. Even being informed that an Indian spy is cut loose they try to make barricading with Police with stick then after some chasing they flashes gun too!? Second half is more slower than first half but pre climax takes a good start. Performance wise Salman Khan always suits more in action scenes rather than emotional but here he manages somehow to fit in emotional scenes too. Kareena Kapoor is in her comfort zone like bubbly girl. She is very good. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a God gifted actor. He can make you laugh, emotional in just a fraction of second. Hats off to him. The baby girl #HarshaliMalhotra is amazing. If she had not been there, the emotional quotient of film shouldn't remain same. Music by Pritam is good but few tracks slows down film pace."

Am I glad I did.\n\nThis is a fantastic feel good movie and if you see it in a theatre, the experience will be even better.\n\nI had the preconceived notion that Bajrangi Bhaijaan would be another Dabangg or Kick or something in his usual slapstick genre. How mistaken I was.\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan is a serious story, depicted in a very touching way. Everything about it is fantastic from the sets, the acting, cinematography, dialogues, you name it.\n\nSalman infuses healthy doses of subtle humour throughout. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is class as the small time news reporter and Harshali is the sweetest little girl one could ever imagine.\n\nAt the end of the movie, one gets the overwhelming feeling that yes indeed the people of India and the people of Pakistan do have the power to overcome all the hurdles and obstacles created by our respective governments and politicians.\n\nMovie making is a business at the end of the day and the primary objective of the producers was to make a film that would generate profits. This movie in fact conveyed a great message and is deservedly an absolute must watch. I go so far to suggest that it be compulsory viewing for all youngsters in India and in Pakistan. Let us the people achieve harmony between our countries."

Barfi? Black? I have forgotten those with the performance this 6 year old has given, and I know she deserves a Best Actor award for this movie Filmfare/Oscar just name the award, she is worthy of it and so is the beautiful movie. Salman, Kareena, Nawazuddin, and all other supporting actors done a good job. Kabir Khan has done a marvelous job doing justice to the movie.\n\nHarshali is the star of the movie and that is not an easy thing to do when one shares screen space with someone of Salman Khan's stature.\n\nWatch it alone, or with your friends and family, you won't be disappointed.\n\n10/10"

Both the movies deliver on both aspects, quality and masaala. Both the filmmakers have proved that a movie can be a huge box-office success without senseless stunts and unnecessary romance.

        "review_title": "Oh yeah, no second thoughts, just go watch it!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Salman, i knew it, i knew you could pull through such a amazing movie as well, my only question why didn't you do this earlier? Iam pretty sure most of the reviewers who are used to watching Indian movies are probably going to say the same thing about this movie, but for others who watch occasional Indian movies and mostly Hollywood movies, don't say this movie defies logic, don't say the movie has plot holes and any other crap coz i can list 100 Hollywood movies which has bigger ill-logical plot points than this. Enjoy the movie for what it is and it sure has got lot of depth in the script to make sure you do that.\n\nNow, that we have taken that out of the equation, let's talk about the movie. This movie is really fun to watch. We all know what to expect in Salman Khan movies and i loved this movie because it did not have any of that. And still movie is one of the biggest bollywood blockbuster, so what does that tell you Mr. Salman? You have people who are willing to spend their time and money even if you don't rip your shirt and just have over-the-top action scenes.\n\nThis movie has a lot of heart, yeah lot of scenes where you might tear up, but apart from that it spends quite a lot of time in getting the characters in your head. It was very easy to do that cos you only care about 3 characters in the whole movie. Hero, little girl and the tag-along friend, Siddiqui. Each of them have been given the right character development and a neat story to get you in grip with the movies wants to accomplish.\n\nSo when they show salman khan's past, you surely wouldn't be surprised how the movie is going to pan out. No surprises anywhere in the movie, again with such a premise how would you engage the audiences? With acting of course. Everyone has given their best, Salman, Harshaali, Siddiqi and Kareena Kappoor. Given their best and have articulated the scenes so clearly that you really want to say \"Oh man, that really hit me\". I was hoping at some point you will really see Salman lose his cool and start bashing heads and am gonna hate the movie for it. But it did not happen, although there were a couple of mini-fights, they were needed, i mean anyone with such a heart as Bajarangi would have done the same thing, so totally justified.\n\nBut remember it is movie of a actor who is used to staying in air longer than a commercial airline during stunts, so you can't completely show a docile and mellowed down character of such a shooting star. So in that sense, movie suffers a few flaws and i really don't want to get into everything but i would say some parts in the movie where people had said..\n\nKareena Kapoor: Everyone i spoke to was just saying she was completely dispensable, waste of money, even if you remove her from the movie nothing will change, etc. so for all those people, Yes, you are partially true, but do you really expect every character in every movie to be completely in-sync with the screenplay and involved in every scene? NO, that hardly happens and if not for her Bajarangi's mind would have been really narrow and maybe he might have never even started on the mission.\n\nHarshaali: Again every soul said she had done exceptionally well, it is not true. We are all humans, we would have accepted the movie if the girl was just a picture and Salman went in search of her. We like such sentiments and happy endings. I am not saying she was bad, she was good, but over-hyped. If you really want to see a child actor perform there are many movies (Taare Zameen Par, Kannathil Mutamital (Tamil)) those performances are worthwhile mentioning.\n\nMovie could have been shorter, it made the journey perilous for the heck of it. There could have been some scenes which could have been completely avoided and i also believe the parents were utterly underplayed. Their daughter is missing, i would have expected a little bit more screen time of them rather than some convoluted plot points. But that's my point of view.\n\nHaving spoken about these, the movie is worth watching and am sure i can watch this again and this will be in my list of top 10 best movies of Salman Kahan. Please continue making such movies at least once a while, i loved watching it and am sure you would not regret it a bit.\n\nThank you for reading, Ciao"

I am not a Salman Fan either nd despite that I watch all his Eid releases on first day. BB is different. KK has been vigilant about sense and aesthetics more than just looking into a mass appeal. This could be a new beginning for a successful director to becoming a good director. He has been helped a great deal by Vijayendra Prasad's story and a capable production design team of Rajnish Hedao. Vijayendra' a household name in South market, has brought an original story with a lot of room to attract cine- goers. Rajnish's team, well known for PK, Rockstar and Three Idiots, already has vast experience of multi- location shoots. BB spreads across various cities and weathers and production design and art direction is always tough for such films. Credit to KK for utilizing the resources at hand in the best possible way. This is probably Salman Khan's best movie, i went in the theater room with low expectation and when i came out, i was amazed!! They show so much positive stuff in this movie!! I guarantee that, when u leave, you will learn at least 10 new things about humanity. This movie is way too good! Nawazuddin was amazing in there as well who played a pakistani journalist, and we already know that salman is good, but in this movie he was good acting wise, but The little cute girl was toooooo good. I love this movie, i learned a lot more after watching this, and this is the kind of movie that you watch again and again, and you still love it each time. So people that have not seen this movie yet, please go and watch it, and enjoy!"

Totally entertaining and one that would make you feel good. The name makes the movie seem like Salman Khan's other movies but this is not unlike any other. This is definitely his best work.

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched this movie last night with my family and I've to admit this movie was really entertaining. Plot was something new that caught my eye. Like the trailer says,Due to certain circumstances, a young mute Pakistani girl is lost in India with no way to head back to her country. Lost in India, she ends up meeting Bajrangi, kind-honest guy who makes his life's mission to help her get back to her parents. For starters, there is no super-human action sequences(except for one scene but such scenes are seen in most of the bollywood movies even if it doesn't comes under the genre of action)or any item songs which is mostly seen in movies with Salman Khan as protagonist. I'm not really a Salman Khan's fan and I really didn't like any of his recent movies but this one was bit better compared to those films. Salman Khan did a really great job and his acting was convincing enough to make you believe or see him as a simpleton with a honest\\naive heart. Kareena Kapoor character doesn't have much to offer other than as Bajrangi's love interest. Harshaali Mehta aka Munni (young Pakistani girl) makes you fall in love with her eventually as the movie goes on, with her cuteness. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was brilliant and his comic timing is really amazing. Unlike other bollywood movies where Pakistanis are shown as merciless people who hate Indians, these movie was lot reasonable in that matter. Even though i found the ending bit clich\u00e9d as I believe it could've been better, i would still say its a good-entertaining movie to watch along with your family, as it would beloved by all age group. Thank you for reading :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Many naysayers believe that Salman Khan's films are illogical but with Bajrangi Bhaijaan, he has proved them all wrong. Yes, Bajrangi Bhaijaan does have a simple plot this time but well-executed differently in terms of direction, commendable performances and of course one and the only SALMAN KHAN's charisma.It is enthralling and has right entertainment potion from the beginning till the end.\n\nA Hanuman-god devotee and gem of a person, Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi ( Salman Khan) comes to rescue of an innocent six year old girl and swears to reunite to her parents in Pakistan.\n\nDirected by Kabir Khan ( Kabul Express , New-York, Ek Tha Tiger) Bajrangi Bhaijaan begins on a superb note capturing the exotic landscape of Kashmir and of course the grand entry of Salman ( always something to look forward to ) welcomed by whistle and clapping from the audience and what follows next is few comic scenes along with romantic track between Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor. Kabir Khan manages to bring out humour with each scene and chemistry between Salman and the cute girl sparkles the silver screen. If the first half is good, the second half is even better thanks to an amazing performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The supremely talented actor brings down the house with superb comic timings and you will love every moment of his acting. Hats off to Kabir Khan by keeping the movie entertaining with simple plot right from the beginning till the end. The film is thought-provoking and does not loose focus. Screenplay is crispy and will keep you engaged. Editing is loose and the film should be easily trimmed by 20 minutes. Cinematography is astounding. Art direction is convincing. Background score is amazing and gels well with the mood of the film. Music by Pritam is decent. Baring \"Selfie Le Re\", none of songs are chart bursting. Salman's fan will be surprised as the actor takes a different route to show his acting skills. The \"King Of Masses\" sheds his skin to get into the character of Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi. He is innocent, kind-hearted and yet powerful who beat up the bad guys when things go wrong. Harshaali Malhotra is an angel. The gorgeous child actor is superb with her expression. Who would have thought that this is her first film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is incredible and gives his best even in a small role. Kareena Kapoor looks gorgeous in each frame and does well with her sparkling performances.\n\nSalman's super stardom and well-defined content will make it sustainable at the ticket window and has good legs to prolong its splendid run. Good 3/5"

They just want to leave in peace. Whole story revolve around this central theme.\n\nWith such a serious topic along with lots of humour especially hats off to the director.\n\nPros: - Awesome Script - Excellent Acting - Compact Story and no non sense -Excellent message;\n\nReally love the movie."

Salman as Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi is the man with golden heart who takes the responsibility of returning a 6 year old dumb Pakistani girl to her home. He portrays the characters very well. Superstar Salman is missing along with his cheesy dialogues but well you can see Salman actually acting after years. He puts everything at stake and driven by his faith in Bajrangbali, he ensures that the lost girl makes it back home in one piece. Salman the one man army.\n\nHarshaali Malthotra with her winning smile, her large, playful eyes and a face that can melt the toughest heart is the soul of the movie. She portrays her character brilliantly. Her expressions will steal your heart. Even a die hard bhai fan will become her fan after watching the movie.\n\nNawazuddin as Chand Nawab yet again gives his best. The chemistry between him and Salman and a few dialogues between them is clap- worthy. Kareena as Rasika do not have much important role but she did her part very well. Even the small role by Om Puri was impressive.\n\nMusic is good. praises for Pritam. Except 'Selfie le le' and 'Aaj ki party' all the songs are good and they carry the story forward.\n\nKabir Khan has presented the story efficiently. Backdrop of Kashmir added extra beauty to this film.\n\nGo on watch it. It will surely touch your heart."

They all want to have 6 pack abs, luxurious cars, a big mansion, use-and-throw girlfriends like Aishwarya and Katrina, a huge fanbase and infinite power in the industry. All of this is usually apparent in all Salman Khan movies, but not this one. Here we have a pious, obedient and saint version of Salman Khan in the form of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.\n\nThe story is actually pretty good, although has a couple of plot holes in the form of factually incorrect information (like Brahmins always being vegetarians, Pakistani police slapping a civilian for being a Hindu, the army letting someone cross the border just because they asked it, YouTube quickly spreading Pawan's story as if it's a normal thing etc). It's the acting that covers up the problems. However, the idea used in this story is very mediocre. It's not a kind of a movie you'd hear someone say that it's their favourite. Because it doesn't have anything new to offer. What it makes up with is the visual appeal and character driven story.\n\nI'm not a fan of Salman Khan. Rather I hate that person. But this movie is undoubtedly one of, if not the best Salman Khan movies ever made. And that's actually saying something since Andaz Apna Apna also exists. It absolutely deserves the box office collection it earned."

        "review_detailed_main": "So this has been for coming for a long time but I have to put this out in the open. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the most dumb, unrealistic, over the top movie I have ever seen. I have seen most of Salman Khan's movies and I have LOVED it because Salman Khan's movies doesn't take itself so seriously. THIS movie on the other hand takes itself so seriously as if it has the most real situation in the world.\n\nThe movie revolves around Munni, a girl from Pakistan who gets separated from his mother and ends up in the lap of Salman. Now it is the moral job of Salman to get her back to her mother.\n\nI can't even begin from where the movie starts to become wrong. There are songs. There you go. For a movie which looks like an emotional journey of a man who is an extremely religious person to get an innocent girl across the border shouldn't have songs. No movie producer has the balls to not commercialize the movie which is based on a serious topic. There are stupid jokes. More songs. They cross the border by making a \"promise\"? How much more stupid can it get? Then there is the usual melodrama of people getting to know about this man's journey via social media and smart phones for some product placement. People getting together across the border to get Bajrangi across the border. And just when I think the melodrama is about to end the girl talks. Oh did I forget to mention that the girl was a partial mute? Well there was that and she starts to talk again.\n\nBollywood spent hundreds of years to come out of the stereotypical masala movie plots and here we are again. People are gobbling up this? I am amazed. If I talk about the acting. Salman is what he does. He plays Salman on the big screen. He never gets into character. He is just Salman, but there is his trick. He never takes himself so seriously that is why it doesn't seem to be a problem. But the premise of the movie makes it so obvious that Salman had to get in character to portray the role, to make it his own. Nawazudin Siddiqui continues to amaze me with his wide range of acting skills. Kareena Kapoor has reached a stagnancy. All she does looks forced and as if she IS acting. The girl who plays Munni has more acting chops than Kareena Kapoor, and that is saying something.\n\nIf you are a fan of Salman, you won't be disappointed. If you are a fan of no-brainer, masala, Hindi movies, you won't be disappointed. If you are the mature audience then it is certainly not for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I personally don't like Salman Khan movies because they have nothing extra ordinary in them. The last film that I liked was 'Wanted'(That too was a remake). But I have to say that this time Salman has delivered a good performance. The best thing about this movie is that you never get bored. The music is complementary to this movie. The innocence of Pavan (Salman) makes you emotional. The girl (Harshali) plays her role very well. Kareena has a small role in the movie but looks good. Nawazuddin is as brilliant as always. Kabir Khan has got it right this time. Hope that Salman comes up with new contents like this one in the future. \"JAI SHRI RAM\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start that I was never a fan of Salman. I neither hated him nor liked him and thought most of his films are garbage but boy, Bajrangi Bhaijan (BB) just changed my mind. Everything about the movie works splendidly- even the formulaic over dramatic climax (probably the only negative point of the movie) works like a charm.\n\nSalman is simply superb as the innocent and happy go lucky pawan. His powerful performance in this movie is easily his best (or may be equals that of his performance in Tere Naam). He isn't the over the top action hero and that works like a charm. Kareena does justice to the part she was given. And do we need to say anything about Nawazuddin Siddiqui? The guy is a gem and his chemistry with Salman is superb- his impeccable comic timing just leaves you in stitches (especially the scenes with his 'begum'). But the star who steals the show is little Harshali.The angelic face, the emotive eyes- it's just cuteness overload. All in all a great job by the casting department.\n\nComing to the movie itself, unlike Amir Khan's \"PK\", without being preachy, BB just breaks away multiple stereotypes- religion, caste and indo-pak relations. In a non-sermon way, the movie beautifully conveys a message of secularism through the character development of pawan from a RSS follower to an all-religion- embracing samaritan. Some might find the first half a tad slow but it nicely sets up the premise and characters and Kabir Khan just blows you away with the majestically made second half. The movie makes you laugh and weep at the same time and that's the beauty of it. No song seems forced and just go in flow with the movie. Even the humour is not forced and there aren't any 'comedians'. The one liners are witty and the humour is situational that is bound to at least make you chuckle if not leaving you in stitches. Background score by Julius Packiam is good and so are Pritam's tunes. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra is nothing short of phenomenal. Every frame reeks of richness and beauty.\n\nIn all, BB is the definitive bollywood blockbuster. Salman proves his mettle as an actor and Kabir khan delivers a splendid film. If not for the over dramatic climax, it would have been 10/10. Salman gives his fans a magnificent Eid gift and for the casual viewer, this is a movie you shouldn't miss.."

I cant believe that just 6 year old girl can act like this...really unbelievable..!\n\nKabir Khan once again proved himself & this is also his best work till date. He coated beautiful message in a entertainer.Hats of for him.\n\nBut i really want to know the man behind camera. The angels he used are just outstanding. Kashmir is the most beautiful place in the world & it looks more & more beautiful in the film.All credit for that goes to camera man.\n\nI think IMDb should use some special rating for such films because 10* are not enough to describe beauty of the film because it deserve more than that.\n\nOver all must watch movie.All people not only from India but also from Pakistan should watch this film at least once."

        "review_title": "an Offbeat Salman",
        "review_detailed_main": "What do you expect from a Salman Khan Movie? A movie with no script, the lead actor behaving as if he is doing us a favor by being in the movie, an item song which is modeled after every household item you could hold on to? Well! BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN will totally disappoint you if you are one of those hardcore bhai fans who walk into the auditorium screening this one, expecting to see all the above mentioned. This by far is the best movie Salman Khan has done in his entire career of 26 years and lets hope this is just the beginning.\n\nWhat works so well for the movie is that Salman Khan graciously sidesteps to give his little co-star Harshalli Malhotra center stage and lets her walk away with all the glory. He even steers clear of his regular heroism and lets himself get beaten up a couple of times in the movie which must have caused quite a fit among his fans.\n\nComing to the story, it revolves around Shahida (Harshali Malhotra) who comes to visit Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah along with her mother from Pakistan, so that her mother could pray that her daughter becomes normal. Whats wrong with her? Well! Shahida cannot speak. On the way back to Pakistan, Shahida gets separated from her mother and ends up wandering in Kurukshetra, and latches on to simpleton loser Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi (Salman Khan). Pavan is in love with Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) whose father (Sharat Saxena) puts a condition that Pavan should first make something out of himself and also get a decent house and only than would he allow him to get married to his daughter.\n\nThings take a turn, when Pavan comes home with Shahida who he mistakes for a lost Brahmin girl. Rasika takes a liking to the girl and tries to support Pavan in getting her back to her parents. In a quick turn of events, The whole family discovers that Shahida is a Pakistani, and a Muslim and also a non-vegetarian, and Rasika's father orders Pavan to get the kid on the next train to Pakistan.\n\nWith things getting worse at the embassy, Pavan enters Pakistan illegally and befriends Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) a reporter who helps him in trying to get the girl back to her home. All the while the Pakistan army is looking for Pavan as they think he is a spy........\n\nSalman Khan gives his 100% to his role as simpleton Pavan, you immediately start liking him right from the moment he appears on screen. This is the first time you actually get to see a character and not Salman Khan on screen. Full marks for Director Kabir Khan for achieving the impossible.\n\nHarshali Malhotra is the real star of the movie and like Pavan takes over the audience with her innocent looks and cute smile. She really scores in scenes where she makes faces when ever Pavan lands both of them in trouble because of his truth addiction and she completely takes over an emotional scene as well. All the while, without even speaking a single syllable.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui keeps you in splits with his role as Chand Nawab, the bumbling Pakistani Reporter with a heart of gold. Scenes where he and Salman Khan act as a couple (salman all decked in a burkha) are hilarious with Nawazuddin bagging the best one liners ever.\n\nKareena Kapoor proves once again that she is a versatile actress, no matter what the screen time is, she does make her presence felt. She excels in two of the best scenes in the movie, one where she reprimands Pavan over his staunch Hindu Brahmin beliefs which prevent him from entering a mosque to look for Shahida and a scene where she takes on her father threatening to go to Pakistan to look for Pavan.\n\nThe movie gets rid of traditional stereotypes and gives the audience a new perspective/vision of Pakistan, where we are shown people who are good, helpful and completely human. The scene where a Moulvi (Om Puri) who runs a Madrasa bids farewell to Pavan with Jai Shree Ram, as Pavan a Hindu Brahmin cannot bring himself to say Khuda Hafiz. And an exact opposite of the scene where in the climax Pavan turns and does a salaam to Pakistan would be taken as classic examples of bridging gaps between two countries/religions.\n\nStory by Vijendra Prasad gives enough scope for people to understand that people on either side of the border are human too and are no different from one another.\n\nScreenplay by Kabir Khan moves forward mostly in the lighter vein, scenes where Pavan and Rasika discover that Shahida is a non-vegetarian, scenes where Pavan calls Rasika as Behenji for first 30 minutes in the movie and Pavan's truth addiction all add up to a wholesome entertainment.\n\nKabir Khan's direction is top notch and he does have a winner on his hands. Taking a very serious message and sugarcoating it for an orthodox audience is one hell of a feat.\n\nYes, I would recommend this movie to everyone irrespective of whether you are a salman khan fan or not and yes I would give it 4.5 rating (the first for any Salman film)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I certainly expected more from this film, although it's enjoyable. The subject is very interesting, it's about humanity and about the common good that unites all people regardless of their religion and class. But the style is very masala-like, with simplistic comedy and above all and plenty of situations which hardly ring true. Salman Khan is both a strength and a weakness in this film. His familiar, starry presence is very good for the film, as leading a film is not new to him, but then his famous, well-known and quite unnatural acting style is hardly anything new and it even gets on the nerves. Above all, this isn't what they call an age-appropriate film for him as he is clearly much older than the part calls for and is therefore made to playact a lot like someone much younger, which I thought (or hoped) was over and done with in Hindi films.\n\nWhere the film does score is in its wholesome style, positive energy and humanistic message, which does well. More than anything, the film is phenomenally well shot, and some of the music is very nice. Other familiar faces in this film include Kareena Kapoor, who one would expect much more from in view of today's standard for leading ladies and the exceptional parts women play in Hindi films. Om Puri and Nawazuddin Siddiqui do well. The little girl is pretty and just adorable and does well enough to give the film much of the grace and emotion it needs. But all of it is not enough to make the film more than a one-time watch for me. The bond between the leading man and the little girl is not very credible, and the entire move to Pakistan is watchable but not quite convincing and it is getting dragged to no end at some point. More could have been done."

Salman khan at his career best performance in a different presentation. Harshaali is too sweet and cute everyone will love to take her home. She is far better actress than some actresses present in bollywood now. You know what I mean. Love u bhaaijaan. Nawazuddin siddiqi is as brilliant as his early works. He proves that dialogue delivery is the main thing for comedy in a very serious plot. In other hand inter-relation between two countries should be developed because it is shown that in Indian film the national flag of Pakistan is being kissed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan review :\n\nStepping out of the plex watching 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', here is an imaginary conversation between my son (a hard core Salman Khan fan) and self (a movie critic and if I may use the word 'Salman Khan neutral') :\n\nSon: Wow baba, what a great film.... Bajrangi Bhaijaan is Salmans best film ever.... A treat for his fans.\n\nMe: Beta you said the same thing when his 'Kick' released last year. Sorry, but I found Bajrangi Bhaijaan no different from his recent films...Salman makes a dramatic entry, dances his own inimitable steps, convincingly beats villains to pulp and still looks innocently fresh romancing a much younger heroine. How is Bhaijaan any different? Is it because he didn't go shirtless in the climax this time?\n\nSon (irritated): Come on Baba! Didn't you find any novelty in the story where an Indian takes a lost girl back to Pakistan to reunite her with her family?\n\nMe: Sunny Deol went to Pakistan in Gadar (2001) and uprooted a handpump there. You weren't even born then. Also, I found director Kabir Khan's 'Kabul Express' (2006) far more convincing than this one. Bajrangi Bhaijaan was unrealistic, gimmicky and emotionally manipulative..\n\nSon (more irritated): Baba, stop being overcritical now. Didn't you like anything about the film? How could you miss the positive message of unity and religious harmony besides promoting cross border peace at the right time when our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to build diplomatic relations with Pakistan?\n\nMe: Hmm. Agree with you on that. By the way, I am happy to know you read politics. As for the films positive aspect..well, Kashmir is beautifully captured on celluloid.. Nawazuddin Siddiqui impressed me in his short role. His introduction scene and the one where he calls Salman \"Begum\" is hilarious. I also liked the girls performance in the film. She was absolute natural.\n\nSon (cooling down): You mean Kareena aunty?\n\nMe: No I meant debutant child actor Harshaali Malhotra. Kareena should have been credited as a guest appearance. She was hardly there in the second half.\n\nSon: True. But anyway, heroines don't matter in a Salman Khan film....\n\nMe: Hmm, tell me is there anything you didn't like about the movie?\n\nSon (after a pause): To be honest, I found the music (Pritam) unsatisfactory and the songs too many. I also didnt quite understand why a Pakistani journo would go out of his way to help an Indian fugitive? But Salman more than made up for these flaws with his screen presence.....I know you will not give the film a complete favorable review but bhaijaan fans like me will award it a full 5 stars rating.\n\nMe: Ok beta, chill! Even I found Bajrangi Bhaijaan much better than Salman's previous outings like 'Bodyguard' and 'Kick' but its nothing to sing hossanas about... I wont tell you right now what my rating will be. You can read my review in a couple of hours and find out ur self.\n\nSon: Sorry baba, I don't have time for that. I am going back for a repeat viewing with my friends...hope I get the tickets though.\n\nBefore I can react, my son is already out of earshot...\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

The characters are chosen well. Hats off to the story writer. What a concept. Story is very grasping and you feel entertained throughout the movie. The movie shows you a very different side of \"Trust\". It fades away every boundary created by Man. I learnt that before anything else we are humans. Religion, Caste, Country, Food, Color everything comes nowhere. The little girl, \"Harshaali Malhotra\". has no doubt taken all the limelight just with her expressions. Kareena Kapoor was in a supporting role and has done well. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is another actor who is slowing gaining popularity in Bollywood. He seem to have very strong hold on emotions and adapts himself very well with every character that he plays. The locations are good and it shows clearly that if you have got a good story, it does not matter whether you are in India, America or a Jungle. Substance matters afterall. The best thing about the movie is that there are no items songs, no cheap comedy, perfect for Indian audiences who long for movies that can be watched with family. I wish Salman Khan and Kabir Khan make more such movies in future. Thanks!"

        "review_title": "Predictable but distinct among Salman Khan entertainers",
        "review_detailed_main": "Celebrations among the Muslim community at this time of the year mark the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. While several may join in the festivities at Mohammed Ali road, the rest look forward to a big weekend for Hindi cinema when almost every year, we are subjected to the abject mediocrity of several Salman Khan movies that make little sense but a whole lot of money. The trend continues in spite of his controversial hit and run case and what we have in Kabir Khan's ('New York', 'Kabul Express', 'Ek tha Tiger') 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a slight departure from the excessive over-the-top action by another angry young man. Surprisingly, Bhaijaan is perhaps the most sensible, poignant and overall entertaining film from the Salman Khan camp in recent years. However, the intellect of mankind be warned, it still remains in the league of implausible, overlong, at times ridiculous cinema that the masses adore.\n\nPawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan) is a devout follower of Hanuman and with all his earnest mannerisms, is quite credible as the innocent, small town lad. However, with his academic failures and non-accomplishments, he is sent to Delhi to his father's friend Digambar (Sharat Saxena), who could possibly offer him a job. He of course, has a beautiful daughter Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) who develops a fondness for Pawan. Kabir Khan then reminds us of 'Maine pyar kiya', when the father of the girl demands that her suitor make something of himself and prove that he is worthy for her hand in marriage. It's Salman Khan, so challenge accepted. Meanwhile, during one of his celebrations, he is followed by a mute child, seemingly separated from her parents. She refuses to let go of his company, somehow trusting him for his personality. She's a child after all. Things get complicated when he has to bring her back home and provide shelter while he investigates her origins. After a lot of predictable scenes that reveal her religious background to the devout brahmins, Pawan is forced to take extreme measures to send her back. His decision to hand her over to a travel agent like a DHL parcel is not only questionable but simply ridiculous even for an imbecile that the director projects him to be. It only starts getting interesting when the hero decides to take things into his own hands and deliver Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra) to her family in Pakistan. The series of events that unfold in a Muslim country such as Pakistan for a devout brahmin makes things funny and awkward but Salman Khan is good at such situations. This was his strength much before he took on the action roles. For the audience, a huge relief arrives in the form of the reporter Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), whose charming performance provides all the one-liners with exceptional timing and sincerity to Pawan's cause that adds gravity to the film's underlying story about a girl's separation from her parents. Nawab joins the duo in their attempt to avoid authorities and to find Shahida's lost paradise and in all the madness of the storyline, his respect for Pawan's sincerity and intentions is remarkably transposed in his performance. This has to be one of the most mellow, non-Salman performances by Salman Khan even though, he has attempted such characters before. Watching him not repeating the same punchlines throughout the movie that would have audiences whistling, is quite a relief this time. His rise to being a hero in the climax is the bane of this film. The exaggerated version of Bajrangi Bhaijaan being recognized for his efforts is overlong and frankly, facepalm worthy. Harshaali Malhotra has been much appreciated for her cuteness and innocence in the film. Much like any other child artist. However, her talent needs further testing in a movie where she gets to speak but at some points, her expressions of disapproval, grief, mischief are on point. Om Puri in his cameo is delightful and so is Sharat Saxena in all his seriousness. Kareena Kapoor was just there but that blame goes to the director for not giving her a character to work with.\n\nV Vijayendra Prasad is on a roll currently with 'Baahubali' and Bajrangi Bhaijaan's successes that owed a fair amount to his story writing. However, he is quite unimpressive here with a very predictable, slow paced story that couldn't offer any engagement were it not for a couple of solid performances. Factors that certainly raise the film above mediocrity are the locations of Rajasthan, Sonmarg and Zoji-La in Kashmir. Spectacularly shot by cinematographer Aseem Mishra, these scenes will be etched in memory for a long time. The music is definitely a burden of the film with not one song being a memorable tune. Bhardo jholi by Adnan Sami is an exceptional qawalli that was originally sung by the Sabri brothers. While Adnan does a good job with his own version, it's quite a blatant infringement. Tu jo mila by KK is a melodious tune, reflecting upon the poignant relationship between Pawan and Shahida. The rest of the songs are quite forgettable.\n\nThe film's predictability, over-the-top climax and mediocre music maybe the shortfalls but performances by Salman, Nawazuddin and Harshaali are outstanding in their own right. Kabir Khan left the best parts in the second half when the 3 of them team up in Pakistan, searching for Shahida's home. Their journey is long and tedious but entertaining nevertheless. The first half was too great a burden on the film. Yet, it is Kabir Khan's best film so far, not that he has such an impressive list and it certainly is Nawazuddin's best role in a big budget film. Salman Khan proves that he can get away from stereotypical characters and almost make us believe in his earnest, religious Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\n\n7.381 on a scale of 1-10."

        "review_detailed_main": "If one determines the entertainment quotient of a film from the number of times people clap while watching it then Salman Khan films will always rank higher. In the case of Kabir Khan's latest feature, the hall was deafening with rounds and rounds of sweeping applause, whistles, and general madness.\n\nStarting with reciting a warm story about a mute, Pakistani girl who gets lost on her ambitious visit to India, Bajrangi Bhaijaan focuses mainly on her adventurous trip back to her homeland that is piloted by a savagely honest young man named Bajrangi (Khan) who lives and dies by the name and values of Lord Hanuman. The narration is absolutely endearing as the protagonists take us on an emotional drive to the maximum effect that results in all of us shedding tears and creating an ocean.\n\nSomewhere in the film, a flaw or two with the plot does chafe the credibility from the setup, but it is all taken care with the introduction of a new character (Siddiqui) who is charmingly funny and really adds to the fun factor to the rest of the film. A tiny romance sub-story which reminds you of Khan's Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya (1991), Khan's religious innuendos which reminds you of a recent another Khan film (2014), and most of the songs picturized with ugly choreography are some elements that may force the viewer to turn his head.\n\nThe humor is brilliant. Just brilliant. Because at times you will find yourself in stitches, and it all comes out as situational; nothing forced. The film also addresses the enmity between India and Pakistan and does it rather graciously. It tries to add sentimentality into the situation and highly succeeds in it, giving form to a drama that starts and ends like a tearjerker. The climax is pure melodrama and realists may want to debate on it, but that is why it is being termed a true Bollywood film, which is actually not a bad thing at all, given the list of mindless potboilers that we see every week.\n\nThe little girl is just fantastic, and competes greatly with her senior co-actors. Khan's character and his portrayal are the best things that he has delivered in years, mostly because it suits him. Kicking goons high up in the air at the speed of light and asking people to form a chain of Good Samaritanship is not really enticing nor is it considered wow anymore. So when Khan dons the cap of a seemingly believable character, claps are sure to resonate.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Bajrangi Bhaijaan is faithful to the idea of Bollywood, which means that it has emotions, it has colors, and it has drama all in the right proportions. Adding to that, when was the last time you watched a Salman Khan film and felt good about it?\n\nVERDICT: 7 stars out of 10. Sit back and shed a tear.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

Its not entirely far from truth. this story was always a one line plot stretched for over 2.5 hours and really gets on the nerves towards the end. a Pak girl Jaise Kumbh Ke Mele me Bache Gum Ho Jaate Hai Waise Ye Pak girl train me Se Bichad Gayi. she meets Salman who is a simpleton living in Kurukshetra bordering mental retard. has anyone ever seen a Hindu bowing to every monkey he sees and even random guys dressed as Hanuman? Kabir khan is some sadist. the pak girl artist is cute but her character is not very likable in first half at least. she is shown to excessively celebrate pak victory in a indo-pak match and loves chicken. there is one really retarded chicken song that comes out of nowhere. i don't get it. whats the point of it? i mean do 6 year olds even know how to wear Chaddis? but then kabir khan has his ideas. Salman is ready to arrange a sum of rs 1.5 lacs to send the girl he just met , to Pak. who does that? the Indian agent who promises to send her to pak takes her to a brothel and salman beats them up and comes back safely in second half, he is able to cross the border with the help of some angelic Pakistanis who are forever ready to help him. even the army are willing to give him time to do whatever he wants (instead of shooting him at sight) in the parallel world of kabir khan . Nawazuddin as the reporter provides some laughs but even he runs out of steam bcos the climax just refuses to finish. there are 80s style co-incidences of kid identifying her mother ina video taken by Nawaz. and then the grand climax - the ultimate wet dream of mr Kabir Mardood Malaoon khan where he shows the angelic secular Pak crowd breaking the barriers of the border and chanting Bajrangi Bhaijaan and how even the army and the officers are all for Aman Ki Aasha. it is just that Indians are big whiners. Salman khan is sincere. its commendable that he was ready to submit himself to the director and not bring his \"Bhaigiri\" in this at any point. Kabir ditched him. no fault of his. but Nawaz was the show stealer wherever he had the dialogues. i am not excited about phantom as much as i was earlier"

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1991 a Raj Kapoor directed film Henna broke the barrier between India and Pakistan. The film shows the determination of a Pakistani woman Henna(Zeba Bakhtiar) to reunite an Indian, Chander Prakash(Rishi Kapoor) with his family back in India.\n\nIn this film we see the reverse, a Hindu man Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi(Salman Khan) is helping a mute young Pakistani girl Shahida(Harshaali Malhotra) who has been separated from her mother accidentally and finds herself on the wrong side of the Pakistani border.\n\nA chance encounter brings Pawan and Shahida together. From then onwards Pawan's life takes on a whole knew meaning, as he overcomes all odds to reunite Shahida with her mother.\n\nThe direction, acting and photography is superb. The background music and songs are enhance the film. Salman Khan gives a sincere performance as the title character of the film Bajrangi(meaning a devotee of Hanuman). Hanuman is a Hindu god and an ardent devotee of Rama. He is a central character in the Hindu epic Ramayana.\n\nNewcomer Harshaali Malhotra is adorable in her role as Munni. Actress Kareena Kapoor has a small supporting role in this film, but her acting as always is thoroughly professional. Sharat Saxena, who is now 65 years old, is holding up well for his age. Not to forget to mention the veteran actor Om Puri who is also 65 years old. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is superb as always. No matter whatever his role, Nawazuddin delivers an excellent performance. He is such a dynamic actor.\n\nVerdict: a superb film which the whole family can enjoy together.\n\nSalman Khan Selection: Maine Pyar Kiya(1989, film counted among the top 10 successful films of India), Love(1991), Saajan(highest grossing Bollywood film of 1991), Suryavanshi(1992 perhaps the only horror film he starred in), Veergati (1995 my favorite film), Majhdhaar(1996 a very underrated film), Khamoshi: The Musical(1996.

The commitment of this guy to find out the the home of this girl who can not speak, is matched only by his innocence and the girl's sweetness and longing for her home which is almost heartbreaking at times. The acts are played well by all, including , surprisingly, Salman Khan. Nawazuddin is brilliant as always, and the girl's part is played awesomely by Harshaali. Kudos to the director for delivering such a beautiful movie. The cinematography and scenes of Kashmir, Pakistan and India, through the deserts , woods and the roads of Delhi are also brilliantly done. It's a must watch."

The main theme of this film is a clear departure from other formulaic love stories and mafia baron movies, making it a strong case for cerebral depiction and brilliant portrayals based on moralistic purity of thought and action. The character of Shahida/ Munni played by a young Harshali lends innocence and injects pristine human values which cannot otherwise be expressed by an adult star.\n\nIt is a must see movie, at least for the not so brotherly people of India and Pakistan."

The film has a great plot and all the characters were well conceived. Kabir Khan, the film's director, has done an excellent job of telling a plausible story in the format of a Bollywood film. The songs were blended very well into the narrative. Kudos to the music director, Pritam, for composing an unforgettable soundtrack. Kareena Kapoor Khan has acted well in her brief part. But the find of the film is the child artist Harshaali Malhotra, who has now become a heart-throb. All in all, the film is immensely entertaining. My rating is 9/10. You must watch it, if you haven't already. Cheers!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie 'Bajrangi Bhaijan' is a classic, if you're a Bhai fan and is something for the fans to gloat about. Personally, I think the movie has a basic storyline which intrigued me as most of the Salman Khan movies are deficient of a good plot. I would suggest you to watch it once mainly because of some really good acting skills displayed by the great Nawazuddin Siddique and the cute little debutant, Harshaali Malhotra. The angel won many hearts without even saying a word till the end of the movie. The movie starts off with with a little drama which is overshadowed by the cuteness and innocence of Harshaali. Salman's entry is pretty ordinary as he plunges into the movie with the popular song 'Selfie le le re'. Salman's character Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi aka Bajrangi is a big devotee of Lord Hanuman and is shown as an extremely virtuous and naive guy who never speaks a lie throughout the movie. I think the movie never takes off in the first half and just sets the base for the second half which attracts the attention of the viewer. If you ask me, I was disappointed with the first half but the second half makes up for it later. Kareena's role in the movie is quite minute and the movie would be the same without her. I personally believe the Bollywood diva was just casted in the movie to increase its popularity. Unlike Kareena, the movie would never be the same without The Gangs of Wasseypur Star, Nawazuddin Siddinqui. He single-handedly takes the movie to another level with his entrance at the beginning of the second half. He energizes the whole movie with his awesome acting and his perfect comic timing. Nawaz is an expert in swaying away the minds of the viewers. I appreciate Salman as he controlled his urge to involve useless and theatrical action in the movie. The end was a bit melodramatic and histrionic but after all, a Bollywood movie is never complete without histrionics. ;) The movie ends well with glee and contentment spread in all quarters. I would rate the movie 3/5 and as I recommended earlier, it is a one time watch specially because of the endearing cherub, Harshaali Mehrotra. :)"

Similar is in the case of Bajrangi Bhaijaan, but the only difference, the film contains a beautiful storyline; which people usually don't find in any of his movies (last 5 years). This movie is an exception to typical Bhai movies in all departments. The film has got good direction, picturization, pleasant background score, very beautiful locations, good acting by all the Actors. This is a sheer masterpiece of Salman Khan or better say Kabir Khan. Kabir Khan, is the only director in the last 10 years who've made Salman \"act\" in a movie. Incredible job by the maestro. Little Harshaali deserves an applause for her beautiful performance as Shahida/Munni. She possibly is the cutest thing ever happened to Bollywood since a long time. Her chemistry with Salman is simply WOW. Nawaz does a decent job in the limited screenplay and has proved his excellence once again. Hats off to the Best actor of the generation. Kareena didn't get much screen presence, but the little she got; she utilized that fully with her beauty; not with acting. And finally, the Man, Salman, you'll get to see a different Salman in this movie, the one you've never expected of, the one who will make you cry, the one who will entertain you throughout, the best Salman in last 10 years.\n\nFinally, Go, Watch it for Kabir Khan and Harshaali, they are the HERO and HEROINE of the Film, Bajrangi Bhaijaan."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Bajrangi Bhaijan\" is a decent effort by Kabir Khan after pretentious \"Ek Tha Tiger\". However, it again has cross-border propaganda like his other movies. He has this keen eye for showing India & Pakistan liaison, which has been a fiery dispute since 1947, leaving many people dead probably every hour. People are susceptible and ferocious about this.\n\nPawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan) is a benevolent man with adoration for god Bajrangbali, meets Munni (Harshali Malhotra) who is lost in India when returning to Pakistan by Samjhauta Express. Now, Pawan has to take her home against all odds. The problem is that Munni is mute.\n\nThe story is meek and totally depends upon suspension of disbelief. It has all the clich\u00e9d and used ingredients like to be part of crores club. On the other hand, it portrays the humane side of Pakistan, how people are helping a person who has crossed lengths and is hell-bent to take a mute girl to his parents. It touches your emotional chords at the perfect time.\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" also refrains from touching any sensitive issues which can disrupt the communal harmony.\n\nHarshaali looks charming with speaking a single word and blooms with the subtle smile on her face. She and Salman have an impeccable chemistry.\n\nIt also has Kareena Kapoor Khan (Rasika) who fills the gap of being love-interest of Pawan and gives usual expressions as we see in every other movie.\n\nThe real scene stealer is Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Chand Nawab) a freelance reporter; he tickles your funny bones with perfect timing. Every time he appears on the screen, it looks that we are watching a different movie.\n\nThe cinematography is vivid as it pacifies your eyes when we see the landscape of Kashmir in aerial and long shots. The background score also flows with the story but in many scenes, it goes pretty loud with some gratuitous slow-motion scenes. Songs do not add anything but are a hindrance to the story.\n\nHowever, unlike Salman's every movie, this does not go over the top because Salman does not punch goons and lets them fly in the sky, does not leave a bicycle a centimeter away from the running train or drive a London number plate bus in Poland. This time he is no \"Devil\" and he transpires into heart and mind at the same time. He plays this part with ease and charm.\n\nA perfect treat for Salman's fans which gets melodramatic at the right time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a movie that is released for the masses. It is not meant to be an art film but an unabashed commercial movie with a singular motive to earn money. However, considering the mediocre quality of high-budget movies that have been released in recent years, this movie is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe story revolves around Bajrangi played by Salman Khan who is a strict devotee of Bajrangbali and is unwilling to lie, cheat, or commit any sort of deceit. Even though some of his actions might seem silly or naive, Salman Khan pulls it off. The innocence of this character is charming.\n\nShahida gets lost in India while returning to Pakistan. As she is just 6 and has an inability to speak, it is extremely unlikely for her to return to her home. However, on seeing the plight of this poor girl, the magnanimous Bajrangi takes it upon himself to return her safely.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Kareena Kapoor and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The latter plays a Pakistani Journalist who joins the quest to look for Shahida's home. It is yet another winning performance from this talented actor who manages to make every role seem effortless.\n\nThere are a number of flaws in the movie. On a lot of occasions, creative liberties have been taken. Salman Khan manages to cross the border without a passport which is impossible. At one point in the movie, he even beats up multiple police officers who were starting to get rough towards Shahida.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a sentimental movie that touches the heart, then this is the right movie for you. It is far from perfect, but the filmmakers should be credited to make an effort in improving the current state of Hindi Cinema. Also, the innocent, wide-eyed performance by Harshali, who has no spoken lines in the movie is also good."

As I am INDO-PAK relations move fan this one was a truly memorable one. The feeling I got after watching last years Haider was the same I got after watching Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and I wish this could be equally awarded at the film-fares as well. All the characters played their role very well , I know everyone is talking about Salman and Harshaali but the Cameo of Om Puri and role of Nawazuddin sidhiqui and Karina should also be appraised. Salman had done some intense roles like in Tere Naam and Bodygaurd but this one was different from those because as Bajrangi aka Pawan he looked very cute and innocent. The way he weeped and showed emotions was superb . I may wish that he would gain film-fares for his fantastic performance as well. Harshaali Malhotra is been applauded these days because she was really totally adjusted in the role of a mute girl seeking for help to get her home back. I am a bit of film critic and would have given the movie 9 points but for you Harshaali the extra point is rewarded to the movie by me. Not to forget the work of Kabir Khan who just like me loves IndoPak topic and makes the movies on them. The screenplay , direction , cinematography of the movie were just fabulous. The whole cast and crew had worked totally hard to bring down this movie and is congratulated by me for their work. I would like to give a extra appraisal to Salman as he came out of his regular type acting and did some unique one. So at last.\"jaise Hanumanji ke sine me tumko siyapati Ram milenge , Mera sina cheer ke dekho tumko Hanuman milenge.\""

The plot is really heart-touching and realistic with minor flaws. Bollywood is known to copy Hollywood, but believe me Hollywood would copy this film. The writer has tried to end religious hatred between Pakistan and India, and that is a good thing. One of the most important aspect of the movie is that it tells us the importance of Wali-Ulla's (pious people). It also shows that humanity comes first."

An excellent portrayal of co-existence of various beliefs and cultures in sub continent. Hero is a very simple, not-so-smart religious Hindu man in Delhi, who stumbled upon a lost 6yo Pakistani girl who is also mute, and out of sheer humanity took it upon himself to find her parents. Without any clue. In sub-continent that's his only option. No agency / institution can do anything because of the animosity between the two countries. If he dumps her, and he tried, she will fall into the wrong hands faster than he could cross the street. Now he has to somehow find her city, and then her parents, in an enemy country.\n\nThis movie shows the triumph of humanity. There is far more love than hatred between the people of the two countries. Movie highlights things like differences over food (hindus are vegetarians and Pakistanis are meat lovers, mostly), praying (how uncomfortable and guilty one gets stepping in other religion's temple, even if it's to seek a temporary refuge) and ever present political unrest. It also shows the sub continent cultural gems. Sleeping under the sky burning mosquito repellent, old school wrestling in dirt rings, larger than life India-Pakistan cricket rivalry, cruel yet incompetent police on both sides, greedy media, religious festivals in streets, shrines, belief in prayers, sporting mustaches etc.\n\nCasting couldn't be better. 6yo girl looks like younger sister of Malala. Too cute. Salman khan as Bajrangi Bhaijan is too awesome to describe. Karina Kapur is brilliant as a next door Indian girl representing the non racist and educated younger generation. Generation that stands up for their and other's rights. Jokes are hilarious. Sound track is awesome."

The cast mentions Deepti Naval..But not visible in the final cut.. Salman, thanks for BEING HUMAN on the issue & Kabir, your narration moved me to tears. Eid Mubarak to the entire team\u0085\n\nJai Shree ram\n\nVijay Kumar Goa"

        "review_detailed_main": "So here are some of the things I expect to see in a Salman Khan film \u2014 the superstar playing a charming, irreverent superhero; a largely incoherent script that exists only to showcase him as a superhero; a largely irrelevant heroine who needs rescuing from some foolish villains; low-IQ comedy punctuated by a few crackling one-liners.\n\nHere's what I don't expect to find \u2014 a coherent, emotionally satisfying script; Salman underplaying his super sized image; a heroine with spunk; drama that actually moves you; and tears! Yes, it happened. I have now cried while watching a Salman Khan film. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is simplistic, occasionally silly, and tiringly over-stretched. It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan preserves the larger-than-life Salman image but also allows it to evolve so that the star is not just a slick superman. Instead, he's a simpleton who teaches us that humanity stands above religion, borders and politics. Think of him as another PK, one that is human instead of alien.\n\nBajrangi's real name is Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi. He is called Bajrangi because he's an ardent Hanuman bhakt. This is a man so child-like and morally upright that he says Jai Shree Ram to a prostitute and insists on entering Pakistan without a passport or visa but with the permission of the security officer who apprehends him at the border. Why is he so keen to go across? Because a lost, speech-impaired six-year-old girl from Pakistan needs to be reunited with her mother. When all other methods fail, Bajrangi decides he will do it himself.\n\nIf you're reminded of Randhir Kapoor's 1991 film, Henna, yes the story is similar. But by making the displaced character a child, Kabir and his co-writer, V Vijayendra Prasad, have made the plot more potent.\n\nIn fact the biggest weapon in Kabir's artillery is the angelic Harshali Malhotra. She's refreshingly unaffected. She seems unfaded by Salman. Harshali has a heart-breaking innocence. For the viewer, it's love at first sight. You invest in her instantly and her tears wring your heart. Salman gets the requisite thundering action sequence. And yes, he does a shirtless scene. But it doesn't showcase his towering masculinity. Actually, he's being beaten up. Bajrangi is interesting because he's not invincible. Of course you know that he will eventually make miracles happen, but he also bleeds and breaks.\n\nSalman plays Bajrangi with aplomb. He's endearingly na\u00efve and sweetly vulnerable. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing a small-time television reporter, comes into the film late but is worth the wait. Unlike the character he played in Kick, he gets no flashy moments here. But he has a few terrific lines and he flies with them.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan has the most under-written part, but even she gets one good scene. And as usual, her clothes make an impression; her dupattas are just gorgeous. Om Puri playing a maulana in Pakistan is also memorable.\n\nWhere Bajrangi Bhaijaan trips is on length. The film is too long and the numerous songs don't do much for the narrative. The plot feels convenient and convoluted at the same time. There are scenes that make you groan. There is also an unapologetic lack of subtlety \u2014 Kabir goes full-throttle for your heartstrings, and once he's grabbed them, doesn't let go.\n\nThis is an overblown, old-fashioned, feel good film. But I recommend that you surrender, and keep a hunky handy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Salman Khan is known for starring in over the top total masala action movies. He is known as the big tough hunk who just beats up people and takes off his shirt a lot to try and show off his muscle.\n\nWell, in this film, Salman Khan broke out of that. This film is not a mindless masala movie, this film was a movie in which the makers used their minds. This film was an exceptional work.\n\nFirst off, this film is one of the few films about Indian-Pakistani conflicts in which their is no bias towards a particular country, Second, both of the countries are shown as good and bad in ways. So, the film handled that subject from a good point of view.\n\nSecond, the performances. Salman Khan, man, really showed me he can act if he wants. His performance as Bajrangi was natural, heartfelt, and simply great. You can tell he really enjoyed doing his role and gave his all into it. This I would consider to be his best performance right next to Radhe in Tere Naam.\n\nKareena Kapoor was pretty good, even though she had a smaller role.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui was hilarious, but at the same time, natural. He played the supporting role to Salman Khan really well. He did great and I think he has great future ahead of him since his last couple of films have had him giving very good performances.\n\nAnd who can forget the small girl (I don't know her name though). She stole the hearts of the audience and was adorable. She also acted pretty well and I think she handled herself very well.\n\nThe direction and story were also very good, and the songs and music throughout the film really helped to add some emotion and some fun.\n\nAll in all, this film was a very nice film that everyone should watch, People of all ages will love it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is warm, joyous, heroic, exciting, aesthetic and just plain fascinating. The cast is irresistible. Literally.\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I'm an old-timer who's seen around 4000, including most of the top-rated films of the last century. My wife and I fell in love with it. Our daughter saw it later and said it was the BEST movie she'd ever seen.\n\nWhen we saw it at its first local release (with what seemed to be an all-Indian audience, apart from us), the movie had an IMDb rating of 8.5. Given that tastes differ, that's about what I would have predicted.\n\nTo my surprise, the overall ratings dropped to 8.2 after U.S. voters started weighing in. I was shocked (and frankly, ashamed) that we as a viewing public were apparently not equipped to appreciate such a brilliant work.\n\nToday I went into the U.S. ratings and discovered (I think) what's been going on. The ratings from 2-10 show a usual sort of distribution, but OVER SIX HUNDRED VOTERS (more than half)rated it as a 1! Impossible! What that says to me is that some organized voting bloc deliberately tanked the U.S. ratings, probably for misguided religious, political or ethnic reasons. The result was that a pitifully small number of U.S. voters saw it at all.\n\nThat's why I'm posting my first IMDb review.\n\nWhat that group did was a shameful act of vigilantism. If it isn't too late already, go see the movie for yourself. If you missed it on the big screen, catch it on Netflix. Unless your ideas are hopelessly fixed in some direction or another, you'll love it."

I am a big fan of Salman Khan and love kareena kapoor. She is damn beautiful and amazing. For last couple of years she has proved her talent, her acting skills.\n\nLast but not least Nawazuddin Siddiqui. What an actor he is. extraordinary, fits in all kind a role and performs it beautifully.\n\nNow coming back to the movie Bajrangi Bhaijan. the script of the movie is very catchy, heart touching. beautifully written and crafted by Kabir Khan. Being as a Pakistani i totally agree with the last dialogues of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. We public of both nations Pakistan and India don't want war, we want peace and love among each other, there shouldn't be any boundary, any restriction and religious differences. Public of both nation agree on Jiyo aur jenay do, Aman ki Asha....\n\nDirection and cinematography is excellent. Salman Khan has given his best in this movie. No doubt he is a bajrangi bhaijan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui was marvelous, he played an important role. kareena kapoor beautiful as always. Last but not least the center force of the movie was Harshali (Shahida), the little kid. she was very adorable and cute. She played the difficult role, a role of a mute girl and played it brilliantly and touched the hearts of millions with her acting without saying a word, her emotions and innocence made it all.\n\nConclusion: Bajrangi Bhaijan is the besssssssssstttttttt movie of year 2015. A noble story with balanced flavors of love, peace, emotions and humanity."

Salman Khan as Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi with a sweet name called Bajrangi played a fabulous role. Needless to mention, little star, Munni (Harshaali Malhotra) done her role quite superbly with her cute gestures. Actress, Kareena Kapoor done her role as good as usual and she had to deliver a beautiful dialogue which she did it at her best, for it, got a lot of whistles in the theater. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Chand Nawab got a crucial role to play which he justified it at ease. Om Puri as Molana for a special appearance in the movie did really special in his short role. The songs are good, but the best ones were Zindagi Kuch Toh Bata and Bhar Do Jholi Meri. The captain of the ship, director Kabir Khan had drove the movie very smoothly with unforgotten humorous and emotional scenes. Nearing to the end of the movie had some scenes that cannot be described in any words, absolutely speechless, one need to witness and experience them."

Kabir Khan has succeeded in giving full justice to the well-written screenplay with his focused narration and excellence in handling sentimental sequences in particular.Now talk about performance of actor and actress first of all the performance of Salman.Salman is at his best here. As Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Bajrangi Bhaijaan),the Superstar enacts the god-loving, clean-hearted soul, with excellence.Child Artiste Harshaali Malhotra is adorable. Her on- screen chemistry with Salman, melts your heart. Kareena Kapoor Khan is charming in a brief, yet substantial role. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is top-notch, yet again! He brings the house down with his brilliant comic-timing & walks away with some of the film's best moments, as well. Om Puri shines in a cameo. And other are very good support in this movie .This movie shows the triumph of humanity. There is far more love than hatred between the people of the two countries. Movie highlights things like differences over food , praying and ever present political unrest. In this movie Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the Pakistani TV scribe nearly steals the show with his story on the little girl lost in border.Now talk about musics. The music of the movie are super .Three songs of this movie are best Tu Chahiye,Tu Jo Mila, and Bhar Do Jholi Meri . At the end of the movie Adnan Sami sing a Qawwali of this movie . Overall this movie is super ."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan is not a typical Salman Khan film which gives the movie a plus point. The plot is very nice however could be much more better if comedy part was removed. The movie is far from reality. I'd give it 9 stars if it was a realistic movie.\n\nThe story is about a young mute girl (Harshaali) from Pakistan lost in India. A devoted and kind hearted man (Salman Khan) undertakes the task to get her back to Pakistan and unite her with her family.\n\nKareena Kapoor fans will be disappointed as her role is very short.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui... well I don't need to explain him. That man has got real talent.\n\nFinally, the GIRL \"Harshaali\". The movie doesn't even worth a watch without her.\n\nOverall, you won't be disappointed or bored if you watch the movie but I won't consider it as a blockbuster even though it has broken many records. I'd still say it is an average movie."

The 2 hour 40 mins showcases love,friendship and peace in the most convincing way of two politically disturbed countries labeled as 'blood enemies' by the world.\n\nKabir has chosen the biggest 'Superstar' of the country Salman Khan in the leading role and made his script the 'Hero' of the movie. Salman has delivered his career best performance as simpleton, truthful, God-fearing 'Pawan'. Harshali Malhotra and Nawazuddin have done complete justice to their roles. If this was a Hollywood movie, they wouldn't have cared about having a heroine/love songs, hence Kareena was wasted.\n\nKashmir has been captured like never ever before. I personally feel, the most beautiful place on earth is Kashmir without any doubt and every Indian needs to visit our own paradise.\n\nThe climax scene is the best scene of the movie which is sure to have majority of the people with moist eyes.\n\nKabir Khan, you have made one of the epic movies with the Indo-Pak subject and Salman Khan thanks for the entertainment, you have been the true people's man who is being human!!"

He will definitely gain a lot of new fans after this movie. He has changed his image through the \"Being Human\" character.\n\nKabir has handled balance between 2 religions very well. While narrating a script where 2 religions and 2 countries are involved especially India and Pakistan, its definitely not easy. Well done Kabir.\n\nWe need more movies like this which shows human values and good message to the people along with entertainment.\n\nThumbs Up Bhajrangi Team..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan helm-ed by Kabir Khan takes you on a journey to Pakistan, without Visa albeit with plethora of emotions, exhilarating drama, high octane action, transcendent performances, mesmeric visuals, adroit craftsmanship making it a top notch motion picture. The last flick in which Salman Khan was directed by Kabir Khan namely \"Ek Tha Tiger\" turned out to be a blockbuster. So, when both these names decided to team up together for Bajrangi Bhaijaan, expectations were bound to be high. Generally, when you go to watch a movie with high expectations in mind there are chances of you getting disappointed but on the contrary Bajrangi Bhaijaan supersedes those apprehensions and engulfs you unto the movie right from its first frame. Is Bajrangi Bhaijaan at par/better than previous Salman starers? The answer is affirmative for the sole reason that this movie has its heart and soul at the right place. So numbed we are by the the onslaught of mindless southern remakes heavy with punchlines and raucous slapstick that an action film where the leading man (Salman Khan) doesn't loose his shirt automatically feels special. In this new film, Salman Khan is seen in a new emotional avatar who on his own travels to Pakistan to reunite a mute girl with her parents. Clearly this is a departure. As a standalone film, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is enthralling and most significantly an entertaining motion picture. On the exterior, it is a compelling sentimental story/thriller. But beneath the entertainment it offers, it carries a message as well. Loud and Clear. If the audience can see through the coating, great. Even if they don't, they will yet go back in high spirits. There are two conflicting factors in Bajrangi Bhaijaan ; Salman Khan's overriding principle of portraying silly antics on-screen and Kabir Khan's intrinsic liking for seriousness. But so overwhelming is Bhai's past aura that serious keeps threatening to slide into silly, and the moment you give in to that in-between space, the film becomes something that you enjoy to the core.Most of the time. Though, its a formulaic film yet it is not a typical Salman Khan kind of cinema. It ably brings the message of humanity, peace and human bonding to the forefront. How a person rigid about his religion can happily, peacefully co-exist with the unique ways of other religions. In fact, Salman's character is closest to #Being human (his charitable foundation) in this movie when compared to all other characters that he has portrayed in past. I could see a lot of moist eyes at the end of this movie which is proof enough that the movie tugs on the heartstrings of the audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a landmark film for it tries to bridge gaps between people of India and Pakistan without being preachy or moralistic. It is an extremely entertaining film but entertainment need not always be song-n-dance and popcorn- cola-jokes that don't last long.\n\nSalman Khan delivered one of his finest performances in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Khamoshi'. After that film, 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is the film that taps the acting brilliance of Khan. Credit must go to Kabir Khan to have taken risks by not falling in the trap of what-the- distributors-want in a Salman Khan film. There are two brief action sequences, no item songs and a brief romance. In other words, Kabir completely breaks the formula that makes Salman such a safe blockbuster bet at the box office. Enough scope is given to Nawazuddin to display his magical brilliance and the kid Harshali Malhotra delivers a stunning performance (without delivering any dialogue). Om Puri shines in a cameo too. The presence of a strong support cast enhances Salman's performance greatly.\n\nSomehow one can Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a must watch film that will stay in your mind long after its over. The egotistical politicians on both sides of the border will keep on stoking the fire of hatred. If you want genuine people-to-people contact and a chance to let Love do the talking, then this film will hold hands of peace in front of you. It is up to you if you wish to put your hand forward and feel the warmth of brotherhood. Take a call."

Nawaz Sir talent is wasted here. Salman is not fit to be in this. He is best for adventurous guy, tough like attitude, unsentimental type. You know the meaning. The songs and tunes throughout are annoying just pops anywhere and trying to fit in the viewers mind but badly badly failed. You need to be very loose in thought in order to approve this as a classic. To rate it 8/10. Seriously?\n\nYou see this is the problem in movie making. People think salman is super in it so the same roles are extended to TUBELIGHT and BHARAT. But it failed. Millions of rupees are lost for this futile attempts. You need to make some thinking prior doing a great job. Just money mongering is not Art. Salman is a star not a performer. 2/10 is for descent senior casts including that little girl.\n\nDear movie makers, in order to unite 2 enemy countries you need to be enlightened, not emotional fool. The movie seems like joke, not at all serious. It seems like mocking the real situations. If you want to make a funny movie then use funny agreeable jokes. Don't mock reality."

And he is refreshingly not the typical dude ready to throw punches in the air at any moment.He is the antithesis of a typical Salman Khan character; he is modest, peaceful and bows down even when he spots a monkey. Pawan meets Kareena Kapoor Khan when he comes to Delhi from UP to stay with his father's friend's family. The little girl in question, played by Harshaali Malhotra, is a scene-stealer from the very word go. She has an angelic face and expressive eyes, and good luck holding back your tears each time she sheds her own. Director Kabir Khan gives us some charming moments between Salman and her, starting with the bits when it dawns on him that she is neither brahmin nor kshatriya like he'd assumed. The film uses humor as a tool to address deep-set religious prejudices, like the one Pavan's landlord harbors against his meat-eating Muslim neighbors, or even Pavan's own discomfort about stepping into a masjid. There's also, conveniently, a romantic track with Kareena Kapoor, who, in only a few well-scripted moments reminds us just how good an actress she is, but who sadly seems content playing a largely decorative role."

Although with God's grace, she is saved instantly \u2013 but the fact that people sell and even buy such young children to sexually assault/ abuse & torture them is most shocking! How can such hotels/ brothels run in presence of police and administration is actually the question now!\n\nAlthough in this film the pimps don't take revenge from Salman for interrupting their business....like they did in 'Tere Naam' \u2013 by hitting him continuously against the iron tube...and making him lose all his senses!\n\nOverall \u2013 A must see- sweet film."

What can i say about Nawazuddin..he stole the show yet again by his terrific acting and hilarious comic timing. We just can't expect a bad or decent performance by him in any type of movie. Always a treat to watch him on screen. He is simply amazing! Kudos to Kabir Khan for his marvelous direction. Overall, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is the perfect movie for this Eid. A sure shot winner!

Most of the films deals with a boy and a girls love story, but Bajrangi Bhaijaan is not like that. Its also a love story but by true meaning of LOVE & HUMANITY. the child in the film fills your heart with love & cuteness.. And Nawaz is really awesome in the department of comedy. And finally the Salman Khan - what a performance,, claps claps.. Be it like a simple hanuman vakt or a emotional man ... He pulls it off. Its the best performance of Salman khan. Moreover its completely perfect teamwork. What a direction, kabir khan really deserves a standing ovation. And the cinematography of the film keeps u charged with awesomeness of Kashmir.\n\nIts a great noble film that can be watch at any time in any mood."

        "review_detailed_main": "For bunch of times. It's Salman Khan. Look what he has. A massive die-hard fans. A great family in business. A highest paid actor in business.\n\nNow narrowing the view to the movie itself. Bajrangi Bhaijaan was destined to be released on Eid. It supposed to be fun (checked), meaningful (checked) and touching (checked). BB has it all. Winner takes it all.\n\nTo assess the movie, I'd like to divide it into some part, based on area that I know best.\n\nFirst. Actor or casts. BB has great casts. First its own producer, Salman Khan. A contemporary leading actress, Kareena Kapoor Khan. A never-fail-us- again promising actor, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and veteran actor like Om Puri. Well, it should be blockbuster, na?\n\nMove aside to the story. Though it a bit irrelevant (in causal effect, of course) If Harshaali Malhotra (as Shahida or Munni) well- educated, it won't happen. And for Bajrangi devotee follower is no kidding. It implied that kid could see someone pure heart despite all the differences they had. I bet, as a kid, I won't even brave to follow some stranger with different religion. And BB brought it to the next level, two major clashes country, Indo-Pak. Since we know that BB has no focus on romance, we couldn't hope much, even Kareena in Gabbar is just a slight, not a good one. But in direction, it is just easy to follow. To sum up, the hero should be given to Nawazuddin instead Salman. But again, BB eagerly taught us that heart is an important thing than brain and desire.\n\nBajrangi kasam se, mujhe kehna tha sacch hai. I'm writing in a good form, and no regret to put it as 8. It just deserve that way, even some illogical event happened.\n\nSo that's it. sometime, you just be rewarded not because your bravery, simply because your pure heart. No kidding. We would live in that era rather than this. Who would do that in this era?\n\nThat remain questioned."

Finally after a long time,comes a director who did not uses SALMAN khan\"s super stardom to just cash in money at the box office,kudos to kabir khan for using the actor SALMAN khan in it which the audience haven\"t seen in a long time.Right from the first frame of the movie i got hooked to this beautiful journey of pawan and munni & enjoyed it thoroughly.Its the best commercial film that i have seen since 3 idiots. When it comes to character portrayal & building up characters,i really think Kabir Khan is no less than woody allen in any frame.Moving to the characters,the sole of the movie is definitely Salman and the little kid.Its the career best performance from Salman khan and he deserves all the respect and praise for this act.This movie will make u laugh and cry at the same time,especially the climax scene.Nawazzudin as chaand nawaab is terrific,but Harshaali steal the show all the way.Just surrender yourself to this movie and enjoy the sweet ride....and yes this time you did not need to leave your brain at home.Feel this movie and you will loved it to the core,SALMAN AT HIS BEST"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first review on IMDb, although I am a Movie Buff who watches Hollywood and Bollywood movies, i want to start reviewing with this Awesome effort at movie making which is called Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\n\nThe Movie is an all out family entertainer which will be enjoyed by the people of all ages. The Movie is high on emotion with story and a lot of good and honest performances from its lead and supporting casts.\n\nSalman is in rocking form with this movie and gives an honest and brilliant performance which is quite different from his usual movies(comedy and lots of action), he shines throughout the movie and in all scenes.\n\nThe Other major character is played by the little cute girl Harshaali Malhotra, she is very good in her role and performs very well and lights up the screen each time she appears in a scene, everything from her expressions and acting.\n\nNawazudding Siddiqui is another actor who is cast perfectly in his role and his chemistry with Salman Khan is magical and each of their scene together is great to watch and Nawaz has a pivotal role in this movie. His comic timing is also great, he should do a comedy film too.\n\nKaeeena Kapoor is beautiful and as her previous films with Salman Khan shares great chemistry with him in this too.\n\nAll the supporting casts Om Puri, Sharad Saxena and others have done a good job.\n\nKabir Khan has a Gem of a movie this time and has done a great job behind the screen, his best till date, the amount of emotion this film has, he has handled it well.\n\nThe Cinematography is brilliant and has captured the beautiful locations in the movie the way it should be and the background score along with the music is great and has all the songs which you will enjoy especially the initial selfie song, to the Qawwali as with all the other songs. The action is good and is at the right places in the film.\n\nPlease note: I am giving a 10/10 review to this movie(instead of 8), as to average all the reviews, so that this Awesome Family movie is not missed by any one and watched by all because this movie should be considered on the lines of all Major Family Entertainers of Bollywood.\n\nGo get entertained with this Entertainer."

This movie is surely an answer for those who use to say 'Salman Khan does not know acting'. This is a must watch for every film lover who likes to watch good movie, a family movie, a movie full of emotion, fun and a bit of action. The scene when Shahida(Harshaali) meets her mother and the last scene are full of emotions. I could see people crying in the movie hall in those scenes. Nawazuddin is superb with his journalist role.\n\nThere are scenes from Kashmir, Rajasthan that have been shot so beautifully that you would love to be there. This movie is such a masterpiece that you would not have expected from a Salman Khan movie.\n\nGo for it!"

I have personally loved his dancing style and was I glad to see that continue.\n\nKareena's acting played its part in the entire movie but she never was the lead... i preferred the girl's mom over her.

But once this film hit the theaters and opened with rave reviews everywhere I decided to watch this movie.\n\nAfter watching this movie, I was like WOW, That was unexpected, that too from a Salman Khan movie. This is movie with right blend of comedy, love, drama and whatsoever. This is a kinda movie that we have all been wishing from Bollywood. The incredible performance of Navazudheen Siddiqui is another highlight of the movie. Though we know Navaz as good actor from his earlier movies this movie puts him into spotlight.He\n\nEven though, the movie is highly dramatic, we enjoy each and every moment in the movie. Salman did good in his role and this film never had a moment of unwanted heroism stuff, like we always see in his other movies. Kareena Kapoor doesn't have much role still she did good.\n\nHarshaali Malhotra, the little girl, Shahida, is one of the cutest kids ever. Everyone would instantly fall in love with cute little girl. If the movie is a box office hit, it is a well deserved one.\n\nThis movie was released at a time when the tension between India and Pakistan began to rise again. We hear a lot about this tension in news and all everyday. I urge everyone, every Pakistani and Indian to watch this movie. It would surely help to strengthen the bond between us.\n\nA nice movie from Kabir Khan and crew."

But this movie is awesome. Kabir Khan did an excellent job in directing and writer V. Vijayendra Prasad, also the writer of Baahubali, did a fine job.\n\nThe acting was great. Salman Khan did a solid job as Pawan and this was one of his best movies and performances, if not the best. Kareena Kapoor was good in the limited screen time she had. Nawawazuddin Siddiqui was great as Chand Nawab and also a bit comedic at times. And last but not least, Harshaali Malhotra was the highlight of this movie. She played a Pakistani girl who could not speak and was lost in India.\n\nOverall this movie was amazing and shows man's determination and perseverance. There wasn't a dry eye in the theater at the end. Bajrangi Bhaijaan showed me that Salman Khan movies can still be at a high level. It didn't show Salman in too much action and fights, which was good. The only gripes I have with the film are that some scenes in the 1st half is a bit slow and occasionally boring as compared to the fast paced and entertaining 2nd half. Also, Kareena Kapoor is in the movie for about 30-40 minutes, so did she really have to be in the movie? Overall this movie is for anyone to watch and a great entertainer.\n\nFrom A+ to F, Bajrangi Bhaijaan gets an A-."

Specially Salman Khan and little Harshaali Malhotra was so good that their acting in this film can bring tears into your eyes and also make you laugh sometimes. This film also contains a good number of great songs. It can be said that this is one of the best movies of Salman Khan and a great starting for Harshaali Malhotra.The use of background music in different scene was outstanding as well. The ending of the movie was also very remarkable (some might say predictable but nonetheless remarkable).People who like to watch Bollywood movies I would suggest them to watch it because this particular movie totally worth your time and you will not regret watching it."

And I must admit Salman Khan should definitely win National Award for best actor for the movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan. I love the little girl Shahida (Harshaali Malthotra), She's beyond beautiful and her acting ability is outstanding.

Bhagat and editing by Aseem Mishra were good.\n\nOverall,Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an engaging entertainer that blends innocence,emotions,humor,brotherhood and patriotism in right proportion.\n\nVerdict::Minor loopholes in the screenplay & the lengthy narration keeps this from being called a perfect entertainer,but nevertheless 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is an engaging affair worth watching from the cinemas for its hearty storyline & genuine performances form Salman Khan and Harshaali Malhotra.Go for it!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijan - Is probably one of the best films to come out from the Salman Khan stable coz of the fact that it's unlike any of the typical Bhai offering smile emoticon Salman is excellent in his 'aam-aadmi' portrayal in this 'plot-driven' movie which is devoid of the usual 'over-the-top' or 'irritating' sequences which we are used to being served in regular doses in his usual blockbuster avatars. The movie benefits greatly from the 'superb' performance from the lead child artiste and an 'absolutely brilliant' performance from the ever-reliable Nawazzudin Sidiqqui who is the real 'scene- stealer' in the second half . Though we do have sequences where cinematic liberties are aplenty and logic takes a bit of a backseat, Kabir Khan deserves due credit for his presentation style which rarely goes 'overboard' or 'preachy' in-spite of the sensitive subject he had chosen. Pritam's music is another 'top-notch' factor in this movie which is 'sincere', has its 'heart at the right place' and deserves it's minor flaws to be ignored :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "To start things off, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is about a mute girl who gets left in India. Luckily, there is a huge-hearted man to help her get home. Acting: All four actors are really good in their roles. Nawazuddin outdoes himself - again. As Chand the reporter, he is terrific as a slightly-comic supporting character. As well as the little girl, she is adorable! Kareena Kapoor has a minimum role but does well. But finally, the real star...... Salman Khan! He produced this, so he knew this character, which help him perform a brilliant performance. The best thing about Bajrangi Bhaijaan is that every scene makes you want to watch more, like in the cinema, at the interval. Another thing to point about is that the film has a bit of all ; comedy, romance, drama, action. The most touching scene in the whole two and a half film is the last five minutes of the climax. Beautiful! Thirdly, the movie is very original, there is no movie like it in the Twenty-first century. Fourthly, this is a movie Salman has never done. He normally does the same action movie again and again. But , the choice to do this movie was his best in his career. Finally, songs like Bhar Do Jholi and Tu Jo Mila stays with you for the rest of the WEEK! But the film stays with you for the rest of the MONTH!\n\nOverall, all credit goes to Kabir Khan. Without him, the film would be AS good as it is. In basic words, let you and your family to watch this movie!"

I must admit, i have not enjoyed Indian cinema as of late, most titles are just trying too hard to provide viewers with entertainment, and they fail even at that. Salman Khan has proved once again, he is still capable of brilliant spot on acting. The chosen subject was a very delicate one. It is based on some harsh realities regarding IndoPak border and travel. It is truly unfortunate for the common folk who still have families and loved ones across these borders. One of the main reasons i voted this movie so high is cause of the cast. The little girl is so cute and sweet, you fall in love with her from the start right till the end. Even though she had no dialog in the movie, she did an unbelievable job of keeping you glued onto your seats for more of that cuteness. Costumes and sets were spot on, and did not feel misplaced for a moment. The director had a firm grip right till the end and knew his business. All in all this is a must have for any real fan of Indian cinema, and keeping in mind the senseless movies we have seen for the major part of the past decade, this one really is a gem. Thumbs up to Salman Khan and the whole Bhajrangi team."

So people that have not seen this movie yet, please go and watch it, and enjoy!even if you are a not a salman fan i am sure you will enjoy it.it deserved a standing ovation and it did get one from the theatre audience once the show was over!"

Out of curiosity from the plot I've read I decided to watch this movie without subtitles. The character of Shahida had moved my heart to follow her story. Her innocence melt my heart every time tears rolls down her eyes and I smile every time she felt happy. The character of Pawan was so moving and his sacrifices gained his respect from both nations of different religions. The character of Chand had spiced up the journey of Pawan and Shahida. All the characters of this movie had done their best roles and reflected a lot of moral values. I may say it is one of the best bollywood movie I've seen. I like the balance of the cinematography. I did enjoy watching the musical part of both countries, India and Pakistan. This movie should be included for international film festival.\n\nThis movies is a must to watch movie!!!"

It shows Pakistan as if it's a war zone, like how the Indian Media describes it, and gives Pakistan that orange tint, that is given to Mexico by the USA. The story is based on the Indian narrative of \"Sem2Sem\" (i.e. \"We are all the same\") and \"Politicians Bad, People Good\" kind of vibes. Like the only thing the differentiates this film from the other Patriotic Anti-Pakistani films is that, 1. This has a bigger budget 2. This film somewhat does criticise Indian minds too otherwise this is pretty much a watered-down version of those kinds of films and the only reason reason why this film deserves 2 stars is the acting and the actors.\n\nAlso to Indian directors out there: Urdu speakers don't just go around saying \"Janaab\"."

I like to request all our Pakistani and Indian brothers and sister must watch this film, it will help us to recharge our heart which full with love, we will feel human again. In end i like to leave message for cast: Lot of love to little Actress ( Munni) you are a centre point of whole story and you did a great job and Bollywood is your...!\n\nSalman Khan (pavan) i think this was the best film of you i watched, less action and lots of acting, wow !

Every character had a part and played it beautifully. The Dynamic Trio aka Nawaz, Salman and Harshalli were outstanding.\n\nI gave it 9 star out of 10, only because i felt the the 1st half was at least stretched for 15 mins.

I personally thought that Tere Naam was his best movie to date (one movie that I truly regret not watching at the cinema)..\n\nAs everyone does for every Salman movie, I left my brain at home expecting to cleanse my head of work stress.. But what I witnessed from frame one was entertainment with a lot of heart..\n\nIt's been a very long time since I've seen Salman portrayed as someone from planet earth.. Here's why; he takes punches, he wears normal clothes, he rides normal vehicles, he genuinely jokes, he emotes and, he talks like a normal person. Above all, he genuinely acted! Kabir Khan deserves a standing ovation for this achievement.\n\nNawazuddin, Kareena and Om Puri did their roles brilliantly.. But the real hero's were Harshaali and her mom (don't know her name and for some strange reason not listed any where).. Harshaali's mom did a brilliant job in every scene she had appeared. Although not a word spoken by Harshaali, her emotions were enough to keep the audience engaged for 2.45 hours.\n\nOverall, this movie is a must watch and I would say brilliant in every aspect (can't believe I said that for a Salman movie).. and above all, my dad kept awake all throughout the movie! :p\n\nOverall rating: 10/10"

Except the last 10-12 minutes!\n\nObviously an effort by the filmmaker to bring the two warring nations of Pakistan and India closer, the film had almost an utopian setting where the pakistani border rangers, pakistani maulana, pakistani people and pakistani journalists are all nice, decent, loving people! (How I wish this was true!)\n\nAn implausible story made with so much conviction. love and heart that the audience wants to take it as it is served! I took it too and thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\nPerformances by 'He-never-left-but-he-is-back-again' Salman Khan are totally-deliciously lovely and demands audience's belief! 'Munni' played by the most-cute-lovely Harshaali Malhotra is just super-cute-huggable- kissable-adorable character ever! I hope she grows up to a great actor and doesn't waste her life-career!\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui played 'Chand Nawab', a pakistani aspiring journalist who eventually becomes the 'catalyst' for the success of the story and its characters' motives, is just simply, awesomely, super-awesomely brilliant!\n\nNawaz does NOT know how to act! He doesn't need to! He just becomes the character! I would here on this day dated July 28th, 2015 announce that I think he is the greatest Indian actor ever!\n\nI think Amitab Bachan sahab, Dilip Kumar Sahab and my favourite Late Dev Anand sahab are the gods of acting! But I would rate Nawaz sahab higher them all! For the latter just doesn't act! He just becomes the character! His \"acting\" is simply flawless! I hope I get to work with him some day!\n\nThe gorgeous Kareena Kapoor didn't have much to do but what ever her character was, she did total justice to it! And she looked super-gorgeous! We all know she is a great actor but here she didn't have much to do! (BTW I love her in 'Omkara'. The cinematography by Mr. Aseem Mishra is just perfect! Perfect! Perfect! I don't think there is anything I can say which isn't obvious!\n\nThe film is crisply cut and there is no lag of any sorts!\n\nThe music of the film was however a big letdown! None of the songs except 'Zindagi' are memorable or has any repeat value! Super disappointed! About the direction by Kabir Khan is majorly brilliant! I have been his fan since 'kabul Express' and I have always liked his sensibilities! The same sensibilities were evidently visible here in 'BB' again. Except the climax which I feel is forced, way over-the-top melodramatic and to be honest, highly-implausible and bit cringe-worthy! But I guess he did it to serve the masses who probably all loved it!\n\nI too can appreciate the thought and the economics behind it but the logical chap inside me just won't understand it!\n\nLong story short- 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a great, fun, family film which everyone should watch! The performances are awesome! The story is soft and gooey and delicious! The visuals are stunning, fresh and crisp! The film has a bit of 'epic' feel at times but mainly hovers over the main character 'Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi' who is just adorable, and the lovely 'Munni' is far-far more memorable and adorable then the other previous 'Munni\"!\n\nMy rating: 7.5/10 (2.5 deducted for below average music and the last 10 minutes!)"

His perfect comic timing will get you on laughter ride. And last but important that little girl Harshita Malhotra as Shahida. The way she portrays a mute girl character is just flawless and her expression will touch your heart. I literally cried during watching one of her scenes. I think this is kabir khans one of best directed movie till date. Its not against any country, its just a movie with a really good script and cast that will touch you heart.

And this was the first time watching a Salman Khan movie in theater after a long time (after 1st part of Dabangg). Saw the little angel for the first time on screen.. she was totally adorable and then came the introduction of Salman Khan again gave me thoughts of the Masala movie. And I dint expect at all that this will turns out to be one of the best and lovely movie. The little Harshali Mehta outshines everyone in the movie and stole the heart of mine withe her brilliant acting without a single dialogue. Salman Khan did a wonderful job and he was pretty excellent in most of the emotional scenes and this would might turn out to be his lifetime best performance. Nawasuddeen Siddiqui was excellent in his role in the second part and totally he led the movie. A movie not to be missed.. Must Watch!!! This broke all my expectations, my initial thought was, this may fall down in the box office but it is turning out to be the India's biggest blockbuster"

No words for him.\n\nSalman Khan:- According to me one of his best was in Hum aapke hain kaun, Tere Naaam, Hum dil de chuke sanam. This movie will come in this list.He was best in all the forms acting/dance/fight etc etc.\n\nAnd finally Kabir Khan the director. Kashmir was well shoted and entire movie he did was well balanced and well directed"

The border crossing rail tracks and the fence and the trains were very clean and tidy which is slightly hard to believe. The wide photograph with back ground music at the start of the movie reminded me of Sound of Music. On the contrast it is still one of the best directed movies of Kabir Khan to fuse the tension between a two countries which is vital at this moment when USA as made a pact with Iran. Of course with the a child and a caring human being one can forgive all past follies and forget the tensions while we are enjoying this drama of human affection.Fulfilling a promise to one's higher power for a child is universally built in human beings across the globe and Salman khan has given his best ever in this role which surpasses all his past roles. His heart and his actions are very real and it is likely not just acting. Funny yet very emotional and the best . Must watch. The cinema hall was full with eclectic population of folks from different countries."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kabir Khan, who's last film was Ek Tha Tiger with Salman Khan, was a huge disappointment according to me. I loved Kabul Express and New York. So because of those two, I went to watch Bajrangi Bhaijaan. This is the best film of Salman Khan in past 2-3 years which contains heart-touching storyline, good performances and great locations. A dumb girl of Pakistan (Harshali) missed her train from Atari to Lahore, and reached Kurukshetra where Pavan Kumar (Salman Khan) met her. He then helped her to find out her native. When he came to know that the girl was from Pakistan, then he tried his best, but, couldn't do anything. So, he himself took an oath to take that girl from India to Pakistan. Will he get success, that answer you will find out after watching the movie. Salman Khan has delivered a mature performance. Not a single frame is here where you can tell that he's doing over-acting. Kareena looks so beautiful in her tiny role. Nawazbhai is again giving a tough fight to Salman Khan. He is too good in his role, doing comedy as well as emotional scenes. Om Puri is also there in a cameo. Others are also good. But, the main hero or you can say heroine of BB is Harshali. She is damn cute. No one can control his or her emotions in the last scenes. She deserves a big round of applause. Music by Pritam is good. I don't know why Tu Chahiye and Chiken song have been put in he film. No need of them. Selfie Le Le Re song is good for Salman Khan fans as they have to shout on his entry. Bhar Do Jholi is my the most favorite from this album, sung by Adnan Sami & penned by Kausar Munir. But, the perfect suitable song of BB is Tu Jo Mila. This song is able to make tears in your eyes. Dialogues are good. Especially of Nawazuddin, they are witty and enjoyable. One plus point of the movie is that unnecessary fighting was prohibited. Cinematography is awesome. Kashmir looks like a heaven. Kabir Khan has made a heart-touchy beautiful movie, which can able to make the audience laugh as well as cry in the end. Apart from that two unnecessary songs, nothing is going to stand in the minus point's list. So, Kabir Khan has made a very good movie with Salman Khan that everyone has to watch. Bahubali is so strong movie, standing along with BB. But, I'm saying BB is better than Bhaubali for sure. Those, who are confuse between Bahubali & Bajrangi, just go for Bajrangi Bhaijaan. After watching this, you will fell so proud that you witnessed this in the theater. Meanwhile, the collection is crossed the 100cr mark!"

The music of the movie is story driven not forcefully put. It pleases the crowd in all aspects, comedy,religious beliefs, sentiment everything is gathered under same roof. In the 160 mins movie you will not be bored for a while. Salman khan plays a different character with full of bhakti and innocence unlike his past movies,harshali aka munni is as cute as an angel. The two drives the film to win heart of the people with their chemistry. Nawazuddin has short though powerful as well as most important role in that film. He acts so naturally that even salman khan's magic fades beside him. Kabir khan uses kareena to support salman in the first half and her beauty at this age is still astonishing. Kabir has directed the film so beautifully end wrapped the story with scenic beauty so well that tear is sure to come at the last 20 minutes. Above all it is a gem of salman's life and film industry..... Don't even dare to miss it."

There combination is good. People should watch this movie again and again. I hope that movie will break all the box office records. Do watch this movie because its all about humanity. Such kind of movies should be encouraged in the bollywood. I have seen lot of movies but this movie brought tears into my eyes. The child star girl and Nawaz uddin Siddiqui has done a remarkable job. Salman has performed very well. This movie should be declared movie of the year. I am gonna watch it again and again."

        "review_detailed_main": "It takes great character to do something different. Firstly credit to Kabir Khan for a great film,the guy deserved a blockbuster 200cr+ movie in his CV.I was pretty impressed by the 'kabul express' movie made by the same director.\n\nComing back to my first sentence of this review,it takes great character to do something different.The reason I say this is because definitely salman khan didn't need to give a performance like the one he has given in Bajrangi. The last 8 years are witness to his stardom and ability to attract the masses and set ringing the cash registers and most of the movies in this time period were well putting it mildly,short of any great story or exemplary acting still each of those movies were good enough to cross the 100cr mark. This is why I say that Salman Khan has great character,He didn't need to act or rather didn't even need to do this movie where there is just 1 action sequence but still the man has come forth and done an incredibly great movie where we see a salman khan before he became a superhero without a mask or an alter ego. This is the salman khan Bollywood needs but might not deserve.Recent years suggest High on content movies don't do much business as compared to the original 'BHAI' films.\n\nGreat movie,great acting by the little girl,Harshali.I hope we see her in more movies. A must watch for people who haven't liked salman Khan for the past few years and to all the other movie goers too!!"

However I have not found a movie having no loop holes. 1.Pavan father should not have died like that. 2.Rasika role could be more meaningful. It seemed she was there just to make audience feel excited wanting some more. 3.The India Pakistan match showing the same match twice ;not worth it. 4.Pavan honesty and faith at the border could ruin the whole movie.Personally i don't like that height of faith at that situation.He must have been aware that the girl was more important than the truth.\n\nI wish the girl would be at last at Pavan's hand not in air.I felt it incomplete."

I almost hated the title, even the teaser and the selfie song. Watching movie on eid day is like a ritual among my siblings. After few scary thoughts i went to the theater and....... The rest is history.\n\nThe last movie which i enjoyed so much was 3 idiots.unlike other salman khan movies where there is little scope of story and has only dialog's, macho-ism.this one has a beautiful story and vice versa. Salman has done utmost justice to his role of a hanuman devotee. The little girl is undoubtedly the \"find of the year\". With only gestures and emotions she has outperformed many a-list actresses. Nawazuddin in the role of news reporter was class apart. Surprisingly his entry scene got more claps and whistles than salman's. All the supporting cast have done their part efficiently. Kabir khan's direction is excellent. Songs are treat to both eyes and ears. No shame in admitting that i cried during the climax.. best movie of 2015. highly recommended."

Honestly saying i couldn't stop crying after the interval and at the end i wasn't able to stop for 10 minutes. well the end isn't some kind of mystery to uncover or some great secret that u cant think of like that in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES or Hit-man . even though i imagined the ending in my mind and i was right about the ending... still i cried so much that i don't think another movie in the coming years will be this heart touching. it is the perfect movie for those studs who think that nothing can make them cry.

The movie has right amount of love, emotions, music etc. Salman's movies never looked so lovely like this. The reason that I really liked it so much is that because a little girl has overcome the stardom of Salman Khan in the film. It is not a masterpiece but surely it is one of the best of Salman.\n\nThe soul of the movie is Harshali Malhotra. She looks so adorable on screen that you fell in love with her when she appears on screen.Nawazuddin nailed it by his sheer performance.He is brilliant in every frame of the movie. I watched this movie with very less expectation and that's become the main reason for liking it. The songs are placed beautifully (specially that \"chicken song\"). I will specially mention the editing aspect. The editing is perfect (crisp). Kabir khan's direction is really good. After this movie I have high expectation from his films now onwards. (Phantom is on it's way)\n\nA must watch!! but don't expect it to be a masterpiece, just a nice work from Salman after a long time."

She's the Main Lead who despite being mute in the movie takes all the applauds for her amazing expressive acting, way to go kid......\n\nIts a tight slap on the face of a select few critics who are miser in rating Salman Khan movies. Remember he would not have lasted so long if he could not act! He can act, re. Maine Kyar Kiya, Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Tere Naam, Kyunki and Dabangg to name a few.\n\nAll artists have to re evolve themselves to withstand change, so has Salman, the choice of his movies these days reflect on him maturing personally. Entertainment with a Social Message is what he's focusing right now. Jai Ho had mixed acceptance, Kick received loads of love and now Bajrangi Bhaijaan has taken it to roof smashing heights."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching the Bajrangi Bhaijaan, I thought it is a typical Anti-Pakistan movie like Bollywood does make. Salman would enter Pakistan and fight with the whole Nation for just a single girl. But after watching the movie my Point of view has been completely changed by the idea of friendship between the two Rival and Neighbor Countries. The only scene i did not like from the movie was the fight of Bajrangi Bhaijaan with Pakistan Police. I thought of giving it a 9/10 Rating but after watching the whole movie I could not stop myself from giving it a 10/10 marks. The movie is a mixture of very emotional scenes and comedy scenes. The Brilliant acting by Salman Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui could make it a BlockBuster but the Emotions of the Little \"Munni\" made it a historical movie of Bollywood. I have no doubt in Saying that it is the Best move of the veteran actor Salman Khan. Even the Mr. Perfectionist Aamir Khan said that it is the movie which can defeat PK.\n\nThe Film contains so many scenes which can make you its fan. For example, when Munni celebrated the win of Pakistan in front of a patriotic family like a boss. When Munni went into Masjid instead of going to Mandir. The way Salman entered the Madrassah and left it. The way Pakistan Army gave Permission to Salman Khan to enter the country.\n\nThe movie is also historic as we get our very own \"Prem\" back at least for one movie. The cuteness of Salman Khan is having a very big role in the movie. The way he speaks Truth every where and even in Pakistan, continues to tell people that he is from India and has crossed the border Illegally by crawling through the wires and that he is the \"Bajrang Bali Bhagat\", has mesmerized the audience completely.\n\nThe Film is completely perfect and a must watch movie for all Pakistanis and Indians. It is also worth mentioning that it is complete family movie and you can absolutely watch it even with your parents. The Film is Perfect. The acting, expressions, emotions, comedy, action, story, music, songs, dialogues, locations, i.e. everything is perfect. I would highly recommend everyone to watch the movie with full family and enjoy as it is literally a \"One in a Million\" movie"

But then change is the only constant in life! Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi's simple, religious but stubborn and emotional character is depicted by Salman with ease, this movie will surely increase his fan followers many folds. Nawazuddin has taken himself to a different genre all together by now, he as the supportive and sensitive Pakistani reporter is simply awesome. But no words can explain the performance of the gifted child actress Harshali who has played the character of the mute and deaf girl from Pakistan lost in India. We have laughed with her, cried with her. The beauty of Kashmir and colour of Delhi have given another dimension to this movie by Kabir Khan. Karina also looks stunning, but unfortunately like any other Salman movie, actress here also has very little role to play. It also doesn't portray Pakistan as a completely evil nation, which is a good thing. The music by Pritam is descent even if not extraordinary. The best thing is you will never get bored during the entire length of the movie. However yes, there are few stereotype and melodramatic scenes - like Salman wants to cross the border without visa but with permission from Pakistani soldiers or the last scene, but when something wins your heart in straight sets you can overlook few unforced errors! 8/10 from me."

It's really hard to believe that Salman's movie will be based on content. Hence it takes time for a viewer and consistent effort from director to believe it. Fortunately, this movie does all. Kept its movie theme intact and didn't fall into the trap of silly commercialization. Although crowd still goes mad when Sallu enters or shows his style. The movie had its limitations such as over extension of the story towards the end of second half, despite it maintained a decent pace. Many scenes were over-engineered but the sentiments were always preserved in a correct way. It showed a good angle of Indo Pak love relationship without any foolish sentiments.\n\nEveryone delivered an average acting performance with Salman and Nawazuddin slightly above the rest. There were few good Pakistani scenes involving Nawaz in which he nailed most of it. Neither Salman showed his standard stupidity nor the movie tried to structure like that.\n\nQuite experienced with Hindu-Muslim and Indo-Pak relationships, Kabir Khan made a good use of it. Direction was consistently good and effort was noticeable. He made sure movie doesn't loose its plot and becomes lovable.\n\nMusic was avoidable and anyways made no impact either ways.\n\nOverall, movie with good sentiments that never looses its plot."

Determined to reunite Munni with her parents across the border, Pavan embarks on a cross-country odyssey, facing numerous challenges that test his resilience and unwavering spirit.\n\nSalman Khan delivers a career-defining performance, portraying Pavan with a perfect blend of innocence and strength. Harshaali Malhotra, who plays Munni, steals hearts with her expressive eyes and endearing presence. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads forms the emotional core of the film.\n\nThe film's narrative is complemented by breathtaking cinematography, capturing the diverse landscapes of India and the emotional nuances of the characters. The music, composed by Pritam, adds a soulful layer to the storytelling, with the anthemic \"Selfie Le Le Re\" and the soul-stirring \"Bhar Do Jholi Meri\" becoming instant classics.\n\nWhat makes \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" exceptional is its underlying message of unity and love, transcending political boundaries and cultural differences. The film tugs at the heartstrings, evoking laughter and tears in equal measure. Kabir Khan masterfully balances the emotional depth with moments of humor, making it a wholesome cinematic experience.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the quirky travel companion Chand Nawab, adds depth to the narrative. The film also benefits from its tight screenplay, ensuring that every scene contributes to the overall emotional impact.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is a rare gem in Indian cinema, a heartwarming tale that resonates globally. Salman Khan's stellar performance, coupled with Kabir Khan's directorial finesse, makes it a must-watch for those seeking a story that transcends borders and celebrates the universal language of compassion. With its five-star rating, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring spirit of humanity."

The areas of highlights are Histrionics ! Mr Khan enthrals us with his performance as an actor . Somehow , he reminds us of another great actor Mr Sanjeev Kumar . The character is multi faceted Innocent , naive , strong yet stupid , loving but has his bigotry , committed but has flaws in his nature, simple but strong willed , sticks to his own rules but doesn't bend or break them , can fight but chooses not to fight !!! We can go on and do an In depth analysis of this complex character who appears simple , that's just due to mastery of the portrayal of this role ! Everybody seems to be going gaga over the other two main characters in this film , they fail to notice the understated yet powerful performance of Mr Khan. People need to stop bringing in and highlighting the personal lives of the star of this film . Instead if they focused on the performance they will realise that here is one guy who can do it all and do it all with his own trademark style. The Director should get a particular mention here as he knew what he was doing and at no point he let the audience down at the same time gave us what he wanted to serve rather than what we expected , true hall marks of a visionary story teller. Mr Kabir Khan thanks a million for this wonderful journey which people call as a film ! You've done justice to the lead character and to the supporting roles without undermining any of their presence. The film world will look back in time and wonder at this Marvellous jewel called Bajrangi Bhaijaan. It's a true landmark in history of movie making. I wish you more and more success . And Mr Salman Khan , we wish that you could provide us more than an occasional glimpse of your true acting talent . You've proved that you are on par or even better than your two fellow compatriots ( Khans as well ) Thanks again for entertaining us . Wishing you and praying for even greater success in future Eid Mubarak Bhai."

I can't remember the last time a film made me cry, laugh, clap, whistle, all during the course of it. Finding it hard to find anything which is out of place in this movie. The emotional quotient in some scenes is too damn high. Salman Khan has essayed the role of Bajrangi with such finesse that it makes you wonder if there is a better actor than him at present! Plus you have the services of Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who after his introduction, takes the movie to another level altogether. Harshaali Malhotra (the cute kid) has done a remarkable job, despite being mum during the course of the movie. Full marks to story, dialogues and screenplay. The supporting cast also held the film together gracefully. Direction could have been a tad better, but with a film like this, the story and dialogues take center stage. Overall rating- 4.5/5. Not to be missed, even if you don't like Salman Khan after the recent incidents. Its not just a film, its a 'Statement'. You will actually feel warmth around you once you leave the hall. I did."

But for a cine-goer like me who judges a film by its sheer content, it is the best Salman Khan movie till date n one of the best to have come in recent years,such is the effect that after the end credits, while walking out, couldn't utter a word. Just kept thinking to myself within and exclaiming,\"What a movie,uff!\". Now after having watched the movie when I get to hear similar words for the movie all around, I am assured that I have a great sense of taste regarding movies.

        "review_title": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan: A surprisingly feel good movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "When a group of my friend insisted me to watch a Bollywood movie I had two choices. Salman Khan's seemingly mindless flick, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" or an VFX intensive \"Bahubali\". For my geek oriented mind the later was an obvious choice. But as it turned out choice was a myth and I was dragged to the theaters for Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\n\nNow, I am not a Salman fan. I like him as a guy, but despise his movies a lot. At least which came out from past few years. So when I went to watch this movie I had totally zero expectations. The formulaic approach of releasing movie on festivals like Id, I totally thought this was also going to be a mindless no-brainer and an insult-to-Physics action movie.\n\nSo believe me when I say that you have got to see this movie! It shattered most of my expectations and proved to be a game changer for his stereotypical role that had become of Salman in recent times. And I am not exaggerating.\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan is a story of a Pakistani girl who gets lost in India, and later meet Salman Khan, who after some incidents makes reuniting the girl with her family his mission.\n\nThe little girl a child actress \"Harshaali Malhotra\" is one of the cutest I have ever seen. She is speech impaired in the story, but what she lacked makes up by her cuteness and expressions that won my heart many times over.\n\nI was hooked right with the opening scene of the movie itself which I found commendable. When Salman is introduced in typical hero fashion (with a song) all those apprehensions about his recent kind of movie started to appear in my mind. But as the movie progressed those slowly faded away and what shaped till the end of first half was a movie I appreciated with my hands open. The character of Salman is that of the guy in Aparichit. A guy who doesn't lie since he believes he is a true devotee of Hanuman. Little does it helps him achieving his mission.\n\nThere are many good actors who are also introduced slowly, like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, whose presence provided big comic relief to the movie in later half. Om Puri also have a small guest role.\n\nWhat I loved about the movie is that there are situational comedy all over the film and yet it feels very serious. No character seems out of place or stretched. What I also loved about the film is that Salman isn't a larger than life character and story shows him as a common man. Well mostly. It was obvious that Salman would kick some behinds of people but it's only on one occasion in this film and if we spare some of the emotional drama that happens at the climax, this film was pure fun to watch.\n\nOn musical side, leaving couple of songs, every other song was good to hear. Song from Adnan Sami was a delight. Most of the songs was in the shape of background score which you can't miss due to its tie up with the story. I only found one bad song about chicken but that was just an exception rather than the norm. And this is where you can take a break to have some air. But buckle up after that since rest of the movie will be some ride.\n\nThis movie on some levels made be speechless. Probably because I had some other expectations. If anyone remember the film Lucky: No Time for Love, which came out exactly ten years ago. Lucky had Sneha Ullal in lead female role and was one of the rare Bollywood movies that I totally loved. Lucky had a similar theme to that of Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Salman met Sneha in a terrible scenario of war, and made reuniting Sneha to her family his mission. The film had a heart that touch on various emotional states of human mind on many levels. Bajrangi Bhaijaan greatly made me feel the same.\n\nBut while Lucky had failed miserably, Bajrangi I feel have the potential of being a blockbuster. At least I hope so since the taste I have for movies doesn't always appear to be a mass favorite. Not a lot of Salman movies have impressed me, yet Bajrangi felt like a blow of fresh air. Something which I would have easily missed because of my presumptions. This movie is a must watch because of its story, its music and its characters. Also because of the glimpses of Pakistan that it shows in the second half. Its a must watch for its good intentions and because of the little girl that made me smile without even a single dialogue.\n\nRated it so high since it's in Bollywood scale and for its intents."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gone are the days when movies starring Salman Khan used to be script-less and only for the sake of \"masala\" entertainment. \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is the best movie of his entire stay in Bollywood so far. At least among the movies I've seen.\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" comprises all the elements that should be in a quality movie. A superb storyline finds the protagonist, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), mute, traveling to Delhi, India for her treatment, getting off the train when she's about to head back to her home, Pakistan, to help a sheep stuck somewhere beside the halted train she was on. As soon as she's helped the animal out, the train begins to whistle and start moving. A fragile little six-year- old child, she fails to get on the train on time. The absence of Shahida is brought to notice to her mother only when she wakes up when the train has already traveled quite some distance. By that time, it was already too late. Shahida was alone in the darkness and she couldn't even cry for help.\n\nThe next morning she meets this man, Pawan Chaturvedi, a selfless follower of Lord Hanuman, who was fondly called \"Bajrangi\". Pawan interacts with this girl, gets emotionally attached to her, and is determined to get her back to home on all costs. But none of it would be easy. Travel to Pakistan was put a hold to for a month and the only way our \"Bajrangi\" could get our Pakistani friend back to her home was crossing the border illegally. What follows is a string of incidents that leaves the audience jaw- dropped. The pains Pawan had to bear just so he could get his dumb friend - he named her \"Munni\" as she could not say her actual name - is set to leave an impression on the viewers.\n\nPawan meets Chand Nawab, a Pakistani reporter, played brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, before attempting to cross border, who agrees to help them. Impeccable performances put forth by Nawazuddin and Salman was surprisingly easily overshadowed by the d\u00e9butante Harshali Malhotra, who, right from the beginning till the end, effortlessly managed to deliver all the expressions even the some of the A- listers of Bollywood fail to do - without nearly speaking a word! Kareena Kapoor was accurate in the otherwise limited screen space she got. Kabir Khan, the director, definitely managed to higher up his standard by a large margin since his lukewarm \"Ek Tha Tiger\".\n\nAnd the climax of the movie! Oh God, the climax! I do not want to spoil anything but it will certainly leave you speechless. For you won't have anything to say - you'll be busy taking care of something else with your face. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. Just an advice to the female audience - do not put a lot of makeup on your face before going to watch this film. (I can already guess you can make out what I'm trying to say.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie so much, and this too a Salman Khan movie. I am not really a Salman Khan fan. I did not enjoy the Dabang movies, I thought Kick was a time-pass and generally I find his acting to be a bit OTT.So Bajrangi Bhaijan was not at the top of my list of movies to watch. However, as my family wanted to see it, I was dragged along. I had no idea I would fall in love with the characters of this movie, and that I would actually cry. I am a fully grown man and I almost never cry in a movie, and I was crying several times during this movie! That is almost like magic.\n\nKabir Khan showed me he was a director to look out for in Kabul Express, which is quite an underrated movie. I could see his skill in pacing scenes, the comic timing and the interesting chemistry he could create between actors through snappy dialogue, humour and well edited scenes. This was not as well achieved in New York and in Ek Tha Tiger, but still I could see that he knows the pulse of a scene and how to create emotions. In Bhajrangi Bhaijan, which is definitely his best work so far, he gets the emotions, the timing and pulse of the scene just right. You laugh when you are suppose to laugh, you cry when you are suppose to cry, and you get angry when you are suppose to get angry. So few directors in Indian cinema have properly been able to manage the juggling act of Indian aesthetic of managing several emotional tones. Bhajrangi Bhaijan succeeds to a large extent creating a truly poignant and moving experience. And I would say the credit goes to Kabr Khan for making it work so well.\n\nThe very first thing you notice about Bhagrangi Bhaijan is the scale of production as the credits open, with stunning helicopter shots of snow snapped mountains. The cinematography and editing are top grade . As Salman Khan's first production this is a class debut production. All technical credentials are top notch .\n\nThe screenplay is the second thing that this movie gets very right. While the story is simple of taking a child back home to her mother, but what makes it interesting is the humorous situations and interesting characters. The characters are all lovable and humane people, Salman Khan as the innocent, kind-hearted and simple Bhajrangi Bhaijan is the most interesting character Salman Khan as played. You fall in love with the character. The situations and the dialogues are all funny and snappy, there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in the movie. The comedy is never forced or contrived, but works because of some genuinely hilarious situations and witty dialogue, supported by a director who knows the beats of his scenes.\n\nThe chemistry between the three main characters is what makes this movie so lovable. Salman Khan is unusually restrained, and is able to convey the simplicity and innocence of Bhajrangi Bhaijan. Hashali is super cute as the mute girl, and her lack of expressions actually works in her favour. The real star of the show in acting is Nawazudin Siddiqui as the Pakistani reporter who is proving that he was one of the best actors in India today, his witty dialogue delivery can make the most banal of charters a riot. Kareena Kapoor as Bharang Bhaijan's girlfriend is competent in a minor role.\n\nWhere Bajrangi Bhaijan loses a point is its lack of realism, which is a common problem in all of Kabir Khan's movies where he treats politically charged issues, particularly terrorism and India- Pakistan tensions in a light hearted comic manner. Bhajrangi Bhaijan takes place in a Bollywood fantasy world, where Border Security Forces and police officers are humane and friendly, where Imams in Mosques are religiously pluralistic, where Pakistani public are democratic and can overturn their governments decision, where Muslims do not hesitate to say \"Jai Shri Ram\" and prostate to the Hindu Monkey god Hanuman. Sweet, idealistic, and totally off the mark in reality. But when it is presented in such a heartfelt manner, with a sincere message of religious harmony and lovely humane characters, snappy dialogues and humour that you can't help but suspend disbelief. So I did.\n\nThe other area where the movie loses a point is in the regularity of the songs, in the first half of the movie I felt there were too many songs, and a few could have easily been avoided because it felt like a musical, especially the Chicken Song. Fortunately, in the second half there are lesser songs. Otherwise the songs are melodious, hummable and well integrated, but none were memorable.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to Kabir Khan's next Phantom, and the initial teaser seems to show us we may have another winner on our hands, and this time I won't have to be dragged into the cinema."

A devoted man with a magnanimous spirit undertakes the task to get her back to her motherland and unite her with her family.\n\n'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a heartwarming tale about love & unity. Though a subtle father-daughter story at heart, the film is also an effective commentary on the India-Pakistan conflict/relationship, that exists even today. The narrative beautifully makes space for humour, strong emotions & also poignant drama.\n\nWhile the first-hour, set in India warms up, with defining its characters & shifting between songs, its the second-hour that takes 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' to the epitome. The story shifts to Pakistan & the series of events that follow with its endearing protagonist & the child, are undeniably engaging & moving."

I have seen it three times now (I'm an American who lived in India for four and a half years) and it seems to get even better with each viewing. But, more than that, the film is a blessing from heaven that substantially neutralizes the enmity between India and Pakistan, between Hindus and Moslems. And it comes at a most important moment in history, when the likelihood of nuclear war in the world has its highest probability between these two neighbors. And the people who put this all together seemed to rise to the cosmic importance of the film. Certainly the chemistry between Salman Khan and the adorable Harshaali Malhotra, who plays the lost mute child, is something very special. With its airing on TV as well as in theatres, (not to mention DVDs) this film, I have read, became the most-watched film in Indian history. Deservedly so!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Gone are the days when movies starring Salman Khan used to be script-less and only for the sake of \"masala\" entertainment. \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is the best movie of his entire stay in Bollywood so far. At least among the movies I've seen.\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" comprises all the elements that should be in a quality movie. A superb story line finds the protagonist, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), mute, traveling to Delhi, India for her treatment, getting off the train when she's about to head back to her home, Pakistan, to help a sheep stuck somewhere beside the halted train she was on. As soon as she's helped the animal out, the train begins to whistle and start moving. A fragile little six-year- old child, she fails to get on the train on time. The absence of Shahida is brought to notice to her mother only when she wakes up when the train has already traveled quite some distance. By that time, it was already too late. Shahida was alone in the darkness and she couldn't even cry for help.\n\nThe next morning she meets this man, Pawan Chaturvedi, a selfless follower of Lord Hanuman, who was fondly called \"Bajrangi\". Pawan interacts with this girl, gets emotionally attached to her, and is determined to get her back to home on all costs. But none of it would be easy. Travel to Pakistan was put a hold to for a month and the only way our \"Bajrangi\" could get our Pakistani friend back to her home was crossing the border illegally. What follows is a string of incidents that leaves the audience jaw- dropped. The pains Pawan had to bear just so he could get his dumb friend - he named her \"Munni\" as she could not say her actual name - is set to leave an impression on the viewers.\n\nPawan meets Chand Nawab, a Pakistani reporter, played brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, before attempting to cross border, who agrees to help them. Impeccable performances put forth by Nawazuddin and Salman was surprisingly easily overshadowed by the d\u00e9butante Harshali Malhotra, who, right from the beginning till the end, effortlessly managed to deliver all the expressions even the some of the A- Lister's of Bollywood fail to do - without nearly speaking a word! Kareena Kapoor was accurate in the otherwise limited screen space she got. Kabir Khan, the director, definitely managed to higher up his standard by a large margin since his lukewarm \"Ek Tha Tiger\".\n\nAnd the climax of the movie! Oh God, the climax! I do not want to spoil anything but it will certainly leave you speechless. For you won't have anything to say - you'll be busy taking care of something else with your face. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. Just an advice to the female audience - do not put a lot of makeup on your face before going to watch this film. (I can already guess you can make out what I'm trying to say.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is a heartwarming and emotionally resonant drama directed by Kabir Khan, released in 2015. The film stars Salman Khan in a role that showcases his softer and more compassionate side, alongside a stellar supporting cast that brings depth and authenticity to the narrative.\n\nPlot and Execution:\n\nThe story revolves around Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi, affectionately called Bajrangi (Salman Khan), a devout Hanuman bhakt with a heart of gold. Bajrangi comes across Munni (Harshaali Malhotra), a mute Pakistani girl separated from her family during a visit to India. Despite not being able to communicate verbally, Munni and Bajrangi develop a deep bond that transcends language and borders.\n\nBajrangi takes it upon himself to reunite Munni with her family in Pakistan, embarking on a journey fraught with challenges and obstacles. Along the way, he encounters Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a quirky reporter who becomes his ally, and Rasika (Kareena Kapoor Khan), a schoolteacher who supports his mission.\n\nStrengths:\n\nSalman Khan's Performance:\n\nSalman Khan delivers a restrained yet impactful performance as Bajrangi Bhaijaan. His portrayal balances the earnestness of his character's mission with moments of humor and tenderness, showcasing a different facet of his acting prowess.\n\nHarshaali Malhotra as Munni shines with her innocence and expressive eyes, despite playing a mute character. Her chemistry with Salman Khan forms the emotional core of the film.\n\nDirection and Screenplay:\n\nKabir Khan's direction is sensitive and nuanced, capturing the emotional journey of the characters with authenticity. The screenplay, co-written by Kabir Khan and Parveez Sheikh, maintains a steady pace while seamlessly blending drama, humor, and social commentary.\n\nThe film's narrative is tightly woven, focusing on the human connections and relationships that transcend cultural and political boundaries.\n\nEmotional Impact:\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" tugs at the heartstrings with its poignant portrayal of compassion, love, and empathy. The bond between Bajrangi and Munni, despite their linguistic barriers, underscores the power of human connection.\n\nThe film explores themes of cross-border friendship, religious harmony, and the innate goodness of people, resonating deeply with audiences across demographics.\n\nSupporting Cast:\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui brings humor and warmth to his role as Chand Nawab, providing comic relief and camaraderie to Bajrangi's journey.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan as Rasika adds emotional support to Bajrangi's mission, highlighting the role of empathy and solidarity in times of adversity.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPredictability:\n\nWhile the film's emotional core is strong, some plot developments and resolutions may seem predictable, adhering to conventional storytelling tropes.\n\nSimplification of Complex Issues:\n\nThe film simplifies complex socio-political issues such as Indo-Pak relations and cross-border conflicts, focusing more on individual narratives than broader geopolitical realities.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is a touching and thought-provoking film that celebrates the universal values of compassion, humanity, and friendship. Salman Khan's earnest performance, coupled with Kabir Khan's sensitive direction and a strong supporting cast, makes it a memorable cinematic experience. The film's emotional resonance and thematic depth resonate long after the credits roll, reaffirming the power of cinema to bridge cultural divides and inspire positive change.\n\nFor audiences seeking a heartfelt story with moments of humor, drama, and social relevance, \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" remains a testament to the enduring spirit of compassion and unity in a divided world. It is a must-watch for its compelling narrative, stellar performances, and universal themes that transcend borders and languages."

It's truly challenging to tackle such sensitive subject and receive applause and love from both India and Pakistan. Hats off! I've watched it multiple times, and every time i get tears in my eyes with a smile, when Munni screams: \"Maaaamaaaa..\" . One of my favourite scenes is when Nawazuddin asks Salman if he's sure Bajarang Bali will help him in Pakistan.- a hilarious and touching exchange!\n\nReally, thanks to the Bajarangi Bhaijaan team for making such a wonderful, lighthearted movie!\n\nJai Shree Ram! \ud83d\ude03"

She is all alone and appears before him. He takes her along, take good care thinking she is a brahmin. Eventually when he learns she is a muslim from Pakistan, though he gets frightened but his humanistic ideals dont let him abandon her though he was a strict hindu religious man and an indian patriot. Later, movie goes through different heart breaking circumstances. Finally this man's deeds even bring ordinary people from two nations who hate each other together to stop this hatred. This is a lesson and the protagonist is an example for each one of those in Pakistan and India who considers themselves as true Patriots by hating the other nation. This movie showcases how we should prioritize love care,humanity and honesty above money , safety, fame... The protagonist of the movie is an example for being selfless above being selfish. This is indeed a movie worthy to watch."

I think it is the best impressive movie till now. \"BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN\" is a movie full of positivity , humor and emotion. It's a movie which symbolizes togetherness between the two nation and religion.\n\nTalking about the cast, i am truly speaking that i am speechless. I have never see in my life this type of outstanding performances or acting of actors/actress. I want to thanks each and everyone. Especially Salman Khan (Sir), Nawazuddin Siddiqui (Sir), Kareena Kapoor (Mam). The movie climax is something which I can't define in mere words, it is an overwhelming and unforgettable experience which can only be witnessed once you see this movie in the theaters and I am sure you will come out with damp eyes and a huge smile on your face after watching this movie.\n\nSo, I suggest everyone to see the movie and learn from it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bajrangi Bhaijaan\n\nCast:Salman Khan, Harshali Malhotra, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Om Puri Director: Kabir Khan\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan is a simple movie. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan has preserved the larger-than-life Salman's image and also allowed it to evolve. Thus the star is presented not as a superman but a simple human being.\n\nBajrangi's real name is Pawan Kuman chaturvedi. HE is called Bajrangi because he is a Hanuman devotee. He is a child-like and morally upright man who insists on entering Pakistan without a passport or visa but with the permission of a security officer who apprehends him at the border. He is keen to go across the border to reunite a six-year-old, speech-imparted girl from Pakistan with her family.\n\nThe biggest surprise in the film is the child artist, Harshila Malhotra acting as Munni. She has a heart-breaking innocence. For the viewers,it is love at first sight. Salman Khan is interesting because he's not invincible. Of course the audience are aware that he will eventually make miracles happen, but he also bleeds and breaks.\n\nSalman Khan as Bajrangi is endearingly naive and sweetly vulnerable. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing a small-time television reporter, comes into the film late but is worth the wait. He has a few powerful lines to his credit. Kareena Kapoor has the most under-written part, but even she gets one good scene. And as usual, her looks make an impression. Om Puri playing a maulana is quite memorable.\n\nThe only shortcoming of the film is that it is too long and the numerous songs don't do much for the narrative.\n\nOverall, it is an overblown, old-fashioned, feel-good film that teaches us that humanity stands above religion, borders and politics ."

Salman Khan has probably given his best performance and even in scenes where you can relate, cry and cheer for him! Nawazuddin is a great supporting act. Kareena Kapoor, Sharat Saxena and entire ensemble have ensured that they are supporting the storyline efficiently. But, I feel that it's Salman Khan who might be best thing in the movie. You still cry in the last scene no matter you have watched it for 25 time. It's sad that people don't talk much about Salman Khan's finesse as an actor but if he gets good script and great director, he can do wonders!\n\nSpecial mention to Mr. Kabir Khan, he is a wonderful director and story teller. I believe people should watch Bajrangi Bhaijaan, to understand how humanity and love crosses beyond boundaries! Great acting and direction!"

Bajrangi decides to help the child, whom he calls Munni, return to her family - which is in Pakistan. Facing borders and biases, lacking a visa, called a spy, can Bajrangi get Munni home - and return to India himself?\n\nWith Bajrangi, you meet a whole new Salman - this is not the shirt-ripping, ab-flaunting, dialogue-maro-ing Khan but a simple, innocent and honest man, who fails, gets tricked and beaten up - but never shaken from his purpose. With gentleness and no gimmicks, Salman puts on a polished, luminous performance - and is matched by little Harshaali, whose vulnerability and warmth are amazing."

I'm not Indian or Pakistani, but white British, so it was fun sat in a cinema full of Pakistanis, to watch a film that could have painted Pakistani in a negative light.\n\nJudging by the murmuring I could her there did seem to be some people during the interval that were not too impressed with the film - slow, boring, blah, blah - but by the end I think everyone left happy.\n\nFrom a white British guys perspective I thought it was a terrific film, and so did my wife and son. Great story, interesting characters, a ridiculously cute kid who stole the show without saying very much, excellent music, and some scenery that took your breath away.\n\nI thought Salman Kahn was great, much more three dimensional than I was expecting. Kareena Kapoor provided a massive dose of eye-candy and played her part well too, although it would have been nice for that part to have been developed more.\n\nBut for me the star of the show - other than Harshaali Malthotra, the little girl - was definitely Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one of the most mesmerising actors I've ever seen. He could read the label of a sauce bottle and have everyone transfixed.\n\nIn typical Bollywood style the first half was your typical setting-the-scene, which I thought was done very well, and it kept me interested throughout, but after the interval, as soon as Nawazuddin Siddiqui made his appearance, the film took off and didn't let-up until the end.\n\nAll-in-all a thoroughly enjoyable film for all the family.\n\n131 out of 159 found this helpful."
