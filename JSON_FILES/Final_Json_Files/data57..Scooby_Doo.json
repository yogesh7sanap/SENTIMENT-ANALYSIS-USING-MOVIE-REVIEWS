I think it's silly enough to be fun if you watch it sober, but if you're high - it's awesome. Just stack up on scooby snacks and enjoy the ride!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. \"Scooby-Doo\" has maybe the most effective farting scene since \"Blazing Saddles.\" Most fart scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States. Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the show."

I went back and played the LEGO Dimensions Scooby-Doo adventure world and this film is wacky cartoony fun! Mathew Lillard is the best actor to portray Shaggy Rogers maybe cuz he's my favourite character in this live-action version of the century! Overall even though it's not as good as cartoons but still better than Scoob that's why I'm giving this a 5/10! Have a great time with this one friends and family!!! XD."

After an acrimonious break up, the Mystery Inc. gang are individually brought to an island resort to resolve strange goings on . After two years separated, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are mysteriously united together to investigate an issue on Spooky Island. As Scooby Doo ,Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) along with the remaining group (Sara Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prince Jr , Linda Cardellini) are back to solve a case that takes place at an eerie island where occurs weird events including some monsters with nefarious purposes . A theme park affects young visitors in very strange ways . But it seems to be they are brought back as one for more than just solving a magical mystery . Meanwhile Shaggy falls in love with a tourist (Isla Fisher). The equipment members are going out to investigate towards the amusement park, whose owner is a suspect man named named Mondavarious(Rowan Atkinson) . He needs their help, figuring out why the vacationers are leaving mellow and sober . The Mystery Inc soon realize that they cannot resolve this enigma without help from each other .\n\nIn this entertaining picture there are comedy , tongue-in-cheek , slapstick, humorous moments, mild diversion and is pretty amusing. All are given an adolescent treatment which means no gore and no bad language just some old-fashioned likable scares , being funny watching humans meld into the CG characters . However , it contains bad taste when takes place a contest about fart jokes between Shaggy and Scooby. Of course , coward Scooby steals the spectacle as food-obsessed canine anti-hero with its grimace , faces and gesture .Many gags are good however the tale sometimes drags. Special mention to gags between Shagg and Scooby,they make a sympathetic comic couple . Movie combines live action with breezy computer generator animation on Scooby Doo creation , special effects are well done . The motion picture is regularly directed by Raja Gosnell who also filmed the follow-up . Kiddies may find the corny, flat humor and bemusing situations , but most adults will be disappointed , exception for the fans the classic cartoon series created by Hanna Barbera. Rating : average but entertaining and clearly aimed at the junior audience . Protagonists' antics might provide the silly smiles , but this cartoonist physical comedy is mostly ineffective . It's followed by a second part in similar style , cast and realization , titled \u00a8Scooby Doo unleashed\u00a8 with lots of fun and as amused as the first , and will be best appreciated by preteen enthusiasts of the cartoon movies ."

They should've stuck to the tried & tested \"old Fred Bloogs, the Lodger in the Shed scaring visitors away\" rather than indulging in face & soul swapping & brainwashing.\n\nThe pleasure of Scooby Doo is the element of mystery & the whodunnit. There was no real mystery in here at all & nothing to keep the viewer guessing.\n\nThe farting & burping scene seemed merely to appease the 3 year olds in the audience, the characterisations seemed a little too different to the originals & I wasn't convinced by 'Scrappy as Villain', but there was enough in the film to still make it a fairly good effort all round.\n\nA low 5/10"

I thought Scooby Doo a colourful film, with some good direction, and very good performances from all involved. The best of the cast were Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, and Rowan Atkinson is amusing as Mondavarious. The film is very amusing at times, especially the scene when Scooby dresses as a Grandma and the scenes in the haunted house. The actress of Mary-Jane is very sweet too. But I will say that the film isn't without its flaws. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the farting jokes are very silly. There have been complaints of the Scooby Doo model being charmless, but I disagree. He was quite sweet at times. The only character I didn't really like that much was Scrappy, then again I never did like him, not even in the animated series. Despite these flaws, this film is not bad at all, and I will award a 7/10. Bethany Cox"

        "review_title": "What were they thinking??",
        "review_detailed_main": "Hanna and Barbera are probably rolling in their graves. First of all, let me say that I'm a 25 year old guy (with bad taste) who's been a fan of Scooby Doo since I was born. I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back. I wanna know what the hell happened to his scripts. Although I can't see him as Shaggy (Matt Lillard was perfect in the role), perhaps if they had stuck to Myers' script, the film would have been good instead of the PoS it turned out to be. I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it, but after some of the stuff I had heard, I wanted to preview it before taking them (I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway - boy was I wrong!). Turns out it was no worse than the kids' endless viewings of \"Dumb and Dumber\" on TBS, so I had to sit through this piece of crap twice....what a waste of 3 hours of my life.\n\nFirst of all, the good things about the film. Matthew Lillard was phenomenal as Shaggy - the movie's only saving grace. The woman who played Velma was also well-cast, though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has. Rowan Atkins also gives a good, but small, performance as the owner of the amusement park. The special FX ranged from excellent to abysmally computerized, though Scooby was better animated than I initially expected. And the scene in the castle was beautifully filmed, with a roller-coaster ride of good effects (and one of the only jokes I found amusing - about drinking out of the toilet). The only other joke that I found great amusement in (which flies over the heads of children) is a reference early on to Shaggy being the stoner that everyone's always assumed he is. That's about it for the good qualities, so on to the bad (which I could write a book about).\n\nI could say that Gellar and Prinze were miscast, but after two viewings, I don't think that was the problem. The problem was that they were both badly written/directed. Prinze's Freddy went from being the self-assured leader he was in the show to an ego-maniacal buffoon. Gellar's Daphne became far whinier and self-involved than the character ever was (with the exception of \"A Pup Named SD\"), which made her far less sympathetic than she should have been. The addition of Scrappy to the cast was a forced and unfunny cop-out. The fact that he's probably the most hated cartoon character of all-time didn't justify using him the way they did (and I'm among his haters).\n\nThe script is awful. Bad jokes sporadically thrown throughout the film, which were vulgar and tasteless, made me consider walking out the first time I saw it - and I've never considered walking out on any film I've seen, no matter how bad it was. The farting/belching/peeing scenes were what both audiences laughed most at, though for the life of me, I can't understand why. For them to go to such juvenile lengths to draw laughs, it should prove how bad the script was. And it's a sad commentary on America's sense of humor...the majority of people in both audiences appeared to be around my age.\n\nAnd then there was the profanity. Daphne utters a line about opening \"a can of whoop-ass.\" Freddy says something about a \"byotch.\" And the villain says he would've gotten away with it \"if it weren't for you meddling sons of...\" (at which point he's cut off). I use profanity every day of my life so I wasn't offended, but it had no place in this film (and the kids left reciting Daphne's line).\n\nThe music is atrocious. With the exception of the David Newman score and around three songs (Simple Plan's \"Grow Up,\" Allstars' \"Bump in the Night,\" and MXPX's \"SD, Where Are You?\" cover) plus a clever cameo by Sugar Ray (who are far underused), the majority of the songs are insufferable rap songs. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against rap when you can understand what they're saying. But the rap songs here are garbled garbage. Where's Will Smith when you need him (doing the deplorable, almost-as-bad-as-this MIB II...)? Even the clever lyrics of Outkast's \"Land of a Million Drums\" (which plays over the end credits) can't justify the intolerable rapping. It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).\n\nIt's really sad that a generation of kids are being exposed to THIS variation of Scooby, rather than any of the classic cartoons - even Scooby and Scrappy-Doo (the most deplorable of all the series) was better than this. And it's sad that such a talented cast was wasted. It's sad that as a hardcore SD fan, I'd give this a two out of ten score (solely based on Shaggy and Velma's performances, otherwise it would be none out of ten). But the saddest thing of all is that they'll probably go on to do more sequels of this caliber..."

Plot wise it stands up fairly well too, they'd obviously put some effort into the story and film sets which are quite creatively located on a Halloween-esque theme park. I won't spoil much of the film, but it's a whole lot of fun. The ending was not the greatest in my opinion, but it was definitely unexpected.\n\nI feel like a lot of the negative reviews are unfair, some of the jokes are overly childish and don't land and maybe Sarah Michelle Gellar plays her role a little too much like Buffy instead of Daphne but even these critisms are mild to me. The CGI for Scooby holds up very well for a 21 year old film as well.\n\n7/10: It's good, kids will love it and there's more than enough content for adults and fans of the original series to enjoy too!"

Yes, it brings back characters folks loved as kids...but it also pokes gentle fun at the trops from the old cartoon series. It also featues an ending that is hilarious because it picks up on fan's and what they really want from a reboot...and it works very well...though I'll say no more because I don't want to spoil the film for you.

        "review_detailed_main": "The key to enjoying SCOOBY DOO is not to expect too much. The producers have billed the film as half homage, half parody; in truth, it isn't really close enough to the original cartoon to be called homage and it really doesn't go far enough to be called parody, and as usual Hollywood makes the mistake of trying to cover up the script's inadequacies with big-budget production values and expensive but actually so-so special effects. All the same, the film does have its moments. The story finds Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy splitting up due to ego conflicts--and then being unexpectedly reunited when the owner of a teen resort called \"Spooky Island\" invites them in to find out why his guests arrive as normal teens and then depart as, well, ZOMBIES.\n\nThe script is fairly mundane, but it does have a few zingers, as when Velma says \"Let's get jinky with it!\" And although the cast is a mixed bag, they work hard to bring it off. Freddie Prinze is wildly miscast as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar is not an ideal Daphne, but they play with tremendous energy; Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, however, are so dead on target with their performances that they create an amazing sense of deja vu. As for Scooby Doo, he is (of course) a computerized animation. And so are most of the monsters the gang encounters on Spooky Island. Although it works reasonably well, it isn't anything to write home about.\n\nI would recommend that parents preview the film before unleashing it upon their kids; some younger children may be unnerved by the monsters. The DVD comes with a number of extras that include some cut scenes--and they offer an interesting contrast with the film, for they are very satirical. Seeing them left me with the feeling that the film would have been much more entertaining if those scenes had been left in and the whole thing had been done with the same bite. As it is--SCOOBY DOO is neither a great film nor a memorable film. But we're all occasionally in the mood for some mindless fluff, and it fills that niche very well indeed.\n\nGary F.

It's just not ready and sometimes scooby looks absolutely uncanny and horrifying. There's a scene when a character kinda stretches their face and it looks terrible, the monsters look really really bad. Again cgi was just not ready.\n\nI really like the casting for all of the character besides Velma, like she did a good job playing the character, but I cannot see her as a nerd and not someone who could slightly change her outfit and be a fashion model.\n\nThere are scenes that just do not hit. There's a really long farting scene that completely stops the plot in its tracks and it's pretty lame. I don't understand the love of fart jokes in child properties.\n\nI really like some of the other jokes though, like \"My name is Mary Jane!\" \"Oh wow... like... that's my favorite name\" good one James Gunn.\n\nThis film is a fun movie to watch as an adult with some friends for nostalgia, this is one of the more accurate to the source material live action adaptations and I do enjoy it for this.\n\nOverall, this is a fun movie with some parts I do not really like, it's not too deep and it's kinda predictable, but I still enjoy it and the actors all feel like they're trying their best.\n\nHigh 4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a fan of the original cartoon I went to see this live-action version of \"Scooby-Doo\" in the theater in June, 2002 (Was it that long ago?). After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. But after seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.\n\nWhat most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. as Fred was acceptable while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne wasn't quite right for the role, although serviceable; I'm sure she got the role because of her popularity at the time. The addition of the winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane is a peripheral highlight. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002) and holds up pretty well.\n\nWhat disappointed me on my initial viewing? I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's \"The Flinstones.\" What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the \"Spooky Island\" segment, which comprises the 2nd and 3rd acts, which amounts to a full hour of the film. What's wrong with this large chunk of the movie? The whole \"Spooky Island\" set was just too cartooney for a live-action homage. It's hard to explain, but it just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the film's based on a cartoon (aduh).\n\nViewing it a second time, I had the same impressions of the film up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. How so? I still don't like the limitations of the \"Spooky Island\" set but I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but now I see that my feelings were pretty much universal. What's wrong with Scrappy-Doo? Scrappy rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of the \"Brady Bunch,\" of course).\n\nThe film runs 86 minutes, which is perfect for cartooney fare like this, and was shot in Queensland, Australia.\n\nFINAL WORD: This live-action version of \"Scooby-Doo\" is definitely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features cutie Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.\n\nGRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10 Stars)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Scooby-Doo is my favorite cartoon show of all time, bringing back sweet childhood memories when this show would air during the early mornings, after school, or on the weekends. Seeing Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma on a live adapted motion picture is a real treat.\n\nAfter the Mystery Inc. gang have gone their separate ways for two years, they each were invited to go to the whimsical resort Spooky Island, run by Mr. Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson). After they arrive, the discover that the resort affects young visitors in very strange and ghoulish ways, so it is up to Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby to realize they must reunite to solve the mystery.\n\nThis is an adventurous movie from start to finish, with a predictable, but fun-filled story. Scooby is filmed in CGI, but voiced by Neil Fanning, and Freddy Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini each did a creative job in portraying Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy, and each matched the original cartoon voices very well, especially Lillard's Shaggy and Cardellini's Velma. Fred and Daphne are my favorite characters in the movie; Prinze and Gellar did great in their roles and it is just interesting seeing them go from portraying characters in teenage comedies, horror/slasher movies and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to a cartoon-based film.\n\nThe special and visual effects were colorful and the island resort was a little too flashy, looking like it was ripped out of a comic book. A lot of slapstick comedy and humor gets a little too overboard or clich\u00e9, almost too childish at some point.\n\nSome movies are meant to be taken seriously and some are meant to just have fun with. Then, there are movies that are so bad and you end up not taking the movie seriously and not having fun with it. Fortunately, I didn't think Scooby-Doo was bad; it is a movie that is great for the entire family and just to enjoy. It is full of adventure and whimsical fun, but still having room to send a message of friendship and teamwork. So, sit back, suspend reality and enjoy one of the greatest cartoons come to life.\n\nGrade B"

Great scores - thrilling and spooky setting up for a very bright yet dark kind of tone. Very entertaining, comedic, dramatic and thrilling. Great cover of the original song. Huge fan of the casts and the ridiculous mystery aspect of this movie.\n\nStoryline was okay. Full with silly moments that tolerably okay. 1st act was my favorite.\n\nHighly recommended.

        "review_detailed_main": "There seems to be a genre out there that's been stirring the past several years, and we are beginning to see more and more of it. It is one that has decided to take a classic TV-series (animated or otherwise) and resurrect it into a modern motion picture. All-in-all this isn't a horribly bad concept, if the conversion is done to preserve the style and format of the original, or to take it and improve on it where needed. `Scooby Doo' is one such creation.\n\nThere is plenty that is flawed with this movie\u0085 but let's remember, it's based on a late 60s (and early 70s) animated series aimed at children. The series was plagued with it's own predictability and seemingly stenciled format that mirrored itself in every episode. Of course, the film is no different. But that's one of the things that I like about it. In fact, there seems to be some intent at pointing out this predictability in the movie itself.\n\nAs a conversion, they producers and writers did a very good job lifting from the animated series, the format, and structure of the original. Even exemplifying the character attitudes and pre-conceived notions we have of them. Without speaking to them, I believe this is what they had in mind, and if so, they did an excellent job. The costumes were well done, some of the action is cartoon-ish (in a good way), and the attitudes that would have been stirring in the characters the past 30-some years come to life here.\n\nI do have to comment as well that Matthew Lillard is absolutely FLAWLESS as Shaggy. In fact, he does so well, there are times you swear that the voice you are hearing is the original Casey Kasem from the original series (for those that remember it anyway).\n\nAs I mentioned, there is plenty that is flawed with this movie (hence the 2-star rating) but it's nothing to get all worked up over. And I won't get in to it in this review. If you care to find out, simply read many of the other reviews out there. I especially didn't like how the movie ended, but I'll admit at least that it was something that I wasn't expecting. Lest we forget that `Scooby Doo' is a vessel for entertaining children, even those who have never seen the series\u0085 And from what I understand, it does a fine job of doing that. There definitely is a kid-style humour throughout.\n\nIf you're an adult, and you enjoyed the series when you were younger, this movie may also be for you. As I've mentioned, it's a direct conversion of an animated series, to the live-action\u0085 and a good conversion preserving what you might expect from a `Scooby Doo' episode. There are a few jokes for the adults in the crowd too, including some VERY subtle humour regarding Shaggy's less-than-obvious recreational pastimes (you can about guess).\n\nI wouldn't recommend paying premium prices for this flick, but if you get to go with a movie-pass, or have kids to take to a movie\u0085 this isn't a bad option."

So first, we have a fairly classic Scooby Doo setup, with the bungled capture of the bad guy...only updated with bubble gum pop chase music? We then find out that Fred isn't realy the leader, but a big-headed-air brained narcissius? Daphney is an idiot (ok..that translates well). Velma is some sort of stuck up MIT grad? And of course Shaggy and Scooby are pot-heads.\n\nRIIGHT...\n\nThe gang breaks up...and in under five minutes gets back together? The island is haunted by demon-bugs bunnies who suck the souls out of kids and then use their bodies to rule the world? All the while pumping out today's pop hits?\n\nRIIGHT....\n\nAnd what's the frigging deal with Scrappy Doo? Yes he's annoying as all geddout, but he's not potty trained to boot? And he's a diabolical mastermind?\n\nRIIGHT....\n\nWell the bottom line is unless you're desperatly searching for the worst movies made in the past decade...Scooby doo should be left off any rental list. If you are looking for the absolute worst movie made in the past 10 years...Check out Tank Girl. It's truely deserving of a sequil.\n\nJason"

What material did they think they were working with?\n\nAnyway, I would never have watched this movie in my wildest dreams, (even with Rowan Atkinson in it!) but my 5 year old son got the DVD. The script is stupid, the acting from Sarah-Michelle Gellar and Freddy Prinze Jr insultingly lackluster and the sexual innuendo ever-present and offensive. For example, at one stage, Daphne (Gellar) makes it safely through a dangerous tunnel and starts half-moaning 'Oh yeah! Oh yeah!' If you closed your eyes you could be listening to 'Debbie Does Dallas'! I'm not the sort of puritanical parent that flips out if my kid accidentally sees someone's bum on screen or something, but one thing I am getting sick of is Hollywood making kids cartoons into teen/adult soft porn. Kids go to these movies expecting to see a big screen version of the cartoons they like and instead are presented with sticky adult material. My guess is that the producers know there isn't much genuine material to work with, so they just go for the sex card. This may work for the 18 year old guys, but as the parent of a small child it is incredibly annoying.\n\nOverall, the movie was shocking! Badly directed, horrendously scripted and nothing but a vehicle for Gellar and Prinze Junior's US teen appeal. When Sarah-Michelle Gellar came to Australia's Gold Coast to make this movie she complained about the food in the area. Well Sarah-Michelle, I've eaten Gold Coast food and seen your movie, and I know which one I prefer to do!!\n\nForget this film if you care about not offending yourself!!\n\nI rate it 0/10!"

I re-watched part of spy kids 2 recently (which was another childhood fave of mine) and thought it was complete trash. I didn't feel this way about scoobs. The film does more than take a mediocre cartoon and and put real actors in it, if anything i would say the film is a parody of the show like the Brady bunch movie (though not to as much of an extent).\n\nIt shows us mystery inc in today's environment and it makes them real adults. The film is genuinely funny to with plenty of adult humor (smoke pouring from the van while playing Rasta music only to be revealed as shaggy and scooby cooking was great) and all the slapstick humor isn't overly cringey.\n\nThe casting is amazing, particularly for shaggy and velma. Fred does come off as a bit douchey though and scooby can sometimes get annoying. The climax is admittedly pretty awful and the films is packed with corny moments but i would be lying if i didn't say i loved it.\n\nI'm not saying this deserves to be 10/10 and i can understand why people don't like it but i don't think it deserves so much hate either. 7 zoinks out of jinkies.

While Freddie Prinze Jr. is just in no way Fred, Linda Cardellini was a great Velma. They really proved the characters old-school style, keeping them as close to the old cartoon as possible. Which brings me to Matthew Lilliard. Could they have picked a better Shaggy? It's like the role was completely made for him! I give the movie 10 Scooby Snacks"

If you want to take your kids to a good movie, take them to see Lilo and Stitch or the upcoming Spy Kids 2. I am willing to bet that not only will they enjoy these movies more, you will too.\n\nSo why do I think it is so bad??? A lot of people have been bashing the actors. I think they probably did the best they could with a lousy script and directing. The CGI was horrible. I found myself so bored with this movie that all I could do was sit and find flaws to keep myself entertained. Daphne's feet disappear into a CGI floor during one of the scenes. In another scene she is running up a flight of stairs in tennis shoes and when she jumps down she is in go-go boots. How can you miss things like this?\n\nMany of the scenes are pointless and just filler (the fart contest, Sugar Ray, etc). This movie could have been 30 minutes long and you would get just as much out of it, if not more.\n\nPeople have said \"Watch it for what it is or don't go in with high expectations\". When people spend anywhere from $7 - $12 to see a 90 million dollar film - their expectations should be high. If you take the family, it will cost $30 - $40 with tickets and popcorn. So take my advice - if you really want to see this, wait till it's on video. Save your money for something worthwhile."

The story is really written by a fan because he sticks to the basic plot and adds some original ideas that enrich the characters. The sets are top and Mr. Bean as guest-star is nice, although he should have done more.\n\nThe deleted scenes and especially the opening credits should have included in the release because the movie is short (83 min) and those cuts are really funny!

In the movie, too much emphasis was put on each character which made them very superficial and fake. I believe the only two that did the parts justice were Shaggy and Velma. But they needed a better producer with a good script, with love and respect for the original Hanna Barbara episodes, NOT Warner Brothers.\n\nCommon sense is easy.

THIS was the only good casting in the whole film. She obviously watched the original cartoons. Hers was the only performance worth the price of a matinee ticket (if you pay full price for one, then you need to have your head examined). God knows, nobody else did. The WORST bit of casting has to go to Sarah Michelle \"Buffy\" Gellar. Are there no natural red-heads in Hollywood that they gave a bad dye-job to a bottle-blonde with only minimal talent? Just off the top of my head, I could recommend Elisa Donovan. Another bad idea: making Daphne into a \"Valley Ninja\". Do I have to point out how idiotic THIS is? Matthew Lillard does a fair/good turn as \"Shaggy\". Freddie Prinze, jr. however, is NO \"Fred\", even with the other bad dye-job.\n\nI agree with Leah Rosen of \"People\" magazine that only the VERY young (under 6) will find anything remotely funny about this yutz. This is one time where the mixing of CGI and live-action failed miserably. Putting it like this: The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle was far better. This is hands-down, one of the worst films I have ever seen. I feel sorry for Linda Cardellini, she deserved a better film to break-out in. She is WAY too talented for this pile of trash. She strikes me as the only actress who make Velma look HOT in that get-up (she has great legs)."

The cartoon has villains that are disguised as monsters but here there real demons! This inept bunch should be in over there heads. The two worst scenes for me are where Scrappy-Doo urinates on Daphne and the second would be the belching and farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. Not exactly like the cartoon!

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Scooby-Doo\" television cartoon series was part of my childhood in the seventies, but I cannot say that it was a part I remember with any great affection. For those too young to remember it, it revolved around the doings of four young people (of college student age) who collectively called themselves \"Mystery Inc\" and roamed across America in a flower-power camper van, solving mysteries along the way. The four were Freddie (handsome upper-class WASP boy), Daphne (pretty upper-class WASP girl), Velma (plain, nerdish, bespectacled intellectual) and Shaggy (spaced-out hippie). They were always accompanied by the title character, Shaggy's large and cowardly dog. (Scooby is officially a Great Dane, but I doubt if he meets the official Kennel Club standard for this particular breed).\n\nThe main reason why I disliked the seventies cartoon was that I considered it childish. Yes, I know I was only a child myself at the time, but children can be pretty unforgiving of books, films and television programmes they regard as having been aimed at children of a lower age group (or lower IQ group) than themselves. My main problem was that every episode was essentially the same. The mystery would always involve a supposed ghost, monster, or other supernatural creature terrorising the local population. Mystery Inc would begin to investigate and after a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from the creature (and possibly also of Daphne being captured and having to be rescued) the gang would invariably realise that the supposed \"ghost\" (or monster, or other supernatural creature) was in reality a flesh-and- blood human being who had assumed this elaborate disguise as part of some dishonest scheme. The episode would end with the villain being unmasked and arrested, normally exclaiming \"... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!\", or some minor variation thereon.\n\nOld television cartoons are generally best left to die-hard nostalgia freaks, but Hollywood frequently ignores this piece of received wisdom (as, for example, with the movie versions of \"The Flintstones\" and \"Josie and the Pussycats\"), and someone evidently thought that \"Scooby- Doo\" was a prime candidate for a live-action film series.\n\nIn the opening scene Mystery Inc are seen ridding a toy factory (owned, rather improbably, by Pamela Anderson) of a ghost which, of course, turns out to be a man dressed up as a ghost. After an argument the group split up, but are reunited when all receive invitations to a theme park named Spooky Island, where the owner, Emile Mondavarious, believes that his guests are falling victim to a mysterious curse and asks the gang to investigate. Which leads to a plot consisting of much screaming and running away from various monsters (and also of Fred and Velma being captured and having to be rescued). Well, actually it gets a lot more complicated than that, but if you want to explore these complications and discover the eventual solution to the mystery you will have to watch the film itself. I just hope it makes more sense to you than it did to me.\n\nThe original plan was for a knowing, self-mocking postmodernist take on the original, packed with adult humour, and a lesbian affair between Daphne and Velma, but the producers eventually decided on something more family-friendly. Some traces of the original plan survive; Shaggy's pretty blonde girlfriend is named \"Mary Jane\", apparently a drug reference (deriving from the mistaken belief that the word \"marijuana\" is a shortened form of \"Maria Juana\"). Freddie's nickname for Shaggy, \"the Shagster\", might seem to be another piece of adult humour, but is more probably due to the scriptwriter's ignorance of British slang. (The word \"shagster\" does not exist in the dictionary, even in Britain, but over here would be taken to imply someone with a high sex drive).\n\nWe cannot, of course, be sure how \"Scooby-Doo\" might have turned out had the producers stuck to their original intentions, but the result could not possibly have been worse than the film we actually have. The plot is witless, standards of acting are uniformly low and the CGI used to create the monsters and Scooby-Doo himself is ludicrously unconvincing. Even the look of the film, with its hard, bright primary colours, is unattractive. Although the film is supposed to be a comedy, there is very little humour worthy of the name, and attempts to generate laughter, including a farting joke and a urinating joke, generally fall flat. (You have to be Mel Brooks to make cinematic farting funny). Most of the time we are laughing at the film, not with it.\n\nPresumably a CGI Scooby-Doo was needed because no real dog would lower himself to appear in this trash, but human actors were obviously not so fussy, and none of them emerges with any credit. Rowan Atkinson on top form can be one of Britain's funniest comedians, so God only knows what he is doing here. Linda Cardellini struggles hard to look plain and dowdy as Velma when she is quite obviously neither of those things. The worst actor on display is probably Freddie Prinze, Jr. (acting alongside his real-life wife Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne) who makes Freddie into an obnoxious jerk. The cartoon character was always blond, so Prinze has to be forced into a blond wig as unconvincing as anything else in the film.\n\nI said that I found the original cartoon series childish, but compared to this film it looks like the last word in adult sophistication. I am not sure what demographic the film is actually aimed at (apart from those who think that \"your mom eats cat poop!\" counts as sparklingly witty repartee). Certainly not adults. Certainly not most children. Toddlers? Infants? Babes in arms? Is there an unexploited gap in the unborn foetus market? 1/10 (Only the fourth occasion on which I have given the minimum mark)."

He said that Scooby should look like a real dog and the animation is horrible, I would recommend the director to watch Shrek or Monsters inc. to see how you animate animal looking characters.\n\nSecond he said he wanted to stay true to the cartoon, and the movie is light years away from it. My final thought is: I understand that if you make a movie about a famous cartoon it's going to make money no matter how bad it is. But for once, studios, directors and producers should think more about what they are doing and not about the money they are going to make."

If you aren't 12yrs and under dont bother to see this movie. The humor of this movie has a childish tone to it and the story is a bit weak but kids really dont know the difference so they will enjoy it. Everything I laughed at none of the kids in the room laughed at. Sarah, Freddie, Matt and Linda did a good acting job dont get me wrong here it was fairly entertaining but i could have seen better so for teens and adults this isnt worth 10 bucks. Wait till it comes out on DVD.Cameos by the band SUGAR RAY & PAMELA ANDERSON didn't help the cause. Scooby Doo's voice was well done. Over all I'd give Scooby Doo (2002) a 5 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching some recent reviews about this movie on YouTube, I have realized how much hate this movie gets. Now obviously it's not perfect, but from what I can gather people mostly complain about these things; the monsters being real, the constant barrage of fart and burp jokes, and awkward script moments. To fully understand this, you need to look at the time the movie was released - 2002, and this film is definitely bursting with massive early 2000s energy. Because of that, they clearly weren't taking this movie seriously, after all its scooby doo, a kids show for gods sake, but you can tell there's still alot of effort that went into it. Especially the actors. The casting is by far one of the best things about this movie - you can't overlook how authentic Mathew Lillard is as Shaggy. And even though the rest of the gang weren't that perfect to their characters, I still think they were brilliant as them. I can't have seen anyone play them as close as to who we got.\n\nWith the monsters being real, this was the first live action adaptation of Scooby-Doo to the big screen, so it kinda would have been a bit lame and anticlimactic if if was just dudes in costumes. They had to raise the stakes a little to make it fit a movie setting."

I have seen enough kids movies (because i am bored out of my scull) and this one is stupid and pointless. I would be ashamed.

He just didn't look anything like the Scooby we all know and love. Sure, some of the jokes were a little crude, but it can be overlooked if you remember the show for what it was.

        "review_detailed_main": "When I was a little kid, I was a big fan of Scooby Doo, from the original cartoon, to the What's New Scooby Too show, to some of the animated movies. And two installments to the franchise that I practically binge watched as a little fella were these two live-action CGI hybrid Scooby Doo movies directed by Raja Gosnell and written by James Gunn (now famous for Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2). Then, after doing some research years later and finding out that it was supposed to be a PG-13 satire on the original cartoon but was soon bogged down by studio interference to make it more family oriented, I now see it as a laughable mess.\n\nRight off the bat, the story takes place after the Mystery Inc gang have split up, and then they are brought back together to solve the mystery of an island called...Spooky Island....subtle. Simple enough plot, and the film does keep it's idea afloat...but MAN is this film confused tone wise. Remember when I said that this film was originally supposed to be for teens before getting butchered for kids? Well boy, are there a lot of innuendos here, and without giving anything away, let's just say some of the material from the original script may have gotten in the final cut. The characters from the show are decent enough, and Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini and Neil Fanning do really good jobs impersonating Shaggy, Velma and Scooby...can't say the same for Freddie Prinze jr. and Sarah Michele Gellar as Fred and Daphne, as while they are trying, they come off more as bland stereotypes more than anything else. The best actor in the film is Rowan Atkinson, since....well, this Mr. Bean we're talking about, of course he's a riot.\n\nAs for the production design, while the sets look gorgeous and there was certainly a lot of effort put into making them shine bright, the computer imagery of Scooby and the monsters that show up in the film look dated even by early 2000s standards, as they look painfully obvious with how much they stand out like sore thumbs.\n\nOverall...I honestly have nothing else to say. This movie is just ridiculous, the jokes are confused, the characters are hit or miss, the cgi is dated, and while it does try to stay true to the cartoon, it just comes off as a case of not knowing whether to be silly or to be a straight forward adaptation of the show. However, I will admit that I do have some nostalgia for it. Not too long ago, me and my friend were watching this, and alongside getting memories of childhood back, it had me on the floor just from how crazy the direction was, as well as the innuendos. So if you're in the mood for a movie with a confused tone but some many laughable choices, this is for you. However, if you love Scooby Too so much that you refuse to see this...better watch Mystery Incorporated, cause that will give you a more mature take on the franchise without coming off as juvenile or insipid. As for me though....sigh....it's such a guilty pleasure."

Throughout the film, the actors never seem to decide whether or not they are taking the ridiculous plot and awful scripting seriously, and the result is terrible. If it happened to be done in a very tongue-in-cheek kind of way, this film could almost have tweaked a smile from me, but in the way it is portrayed it is uncomfortable for the audience as it seems for the actors.

The jokes are very obvious and the PG rating keeps things very clean and family friendly. Still, I was laughing a lot. Maybe it was my mood, but I kept giggling over all the jokes. It works mostly because the entire cast plays it straight.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar looks nothing like Daphne in the cartoon, but she is good. Likewise, Freddie Prinze Jr. looks nothing like Fred either, but he's OK. Matthew Lillard, however, is letter perfect as Shaggy. Also the woman playing Velma is right on target. And the CGI Scooby was just great...his expressions and body language provided lots of laughs. Great special effect and the movie moves quickly.\n\nMy only real complaint--did we really need a burping/breaking wind contest between Scooby and Shaggy?\n\nA very good family movie--I liked it a lot. A very guilty favorite all the way."

        "review_detailed_main": "An entertaining and campy delight- Scooby-Doo may not always age so well- but its meta take on its characters and source material and fun story from James Gunn make for quite an enjoyable experience. First off, let's just be honest and say Matthew Lillard is a perfect Shaggy, both in voice and in mannerisms. I also thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the cast playing the gang, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Rowan Atkinson can be a bit forced in his character at times, and the CGI is incredibly dated for all the CGI characters- thankfully Scooby being the least worse in comparison. Besides the awful CGI, the film can overdo it with its side performances at times, and it has its corny moments. The film is super fun to watch though, and it made me laugh quite a few times. I found the story pretty interesting- a darker take for a kids film for sure- but well thought out and crafted- which is also surprising. I also kinda love the fact that this film has a very similar plot to Peacemaker which writer James Gunn also wrote. I also enjoyed the fact that Sugar Ray has a cameo in this movie for some reason, so at some point you know on that island, Scooby-Doo had to fight Sugar Ray, which is in itself quite hilarious. In the end, Scooby-Doo isn't anything groundbreaking- but it is a super fun and enjoyable little homage to the cast of characters we all grew up with.\n\nMy Rating: 7/10."

Just when I thought it could descend no lower in stupid gross unfunny attempts at humour, it did.\n\nI expected better computer animation, but it looked phony. I guess we're spoiled.\n\nI disagree with the plaudits for Matthew Lillard's acting as Shaggy. I thought he was way over the top hammy.Freddie Prinze was wooden as Fred. SMG was fine as Daffy, although she is largely limited to an ornamental role in low cut short dresses. I wish I remembered the Velma gal's name- she steals the movie for me.I would watch her in a better movie.\n\nI also did not think it was true to the series. In the series, all the \"magic\" was explained as trickery. Not so here. Supernatural beliefs are so ingrained in Harry Potter, LOTR etc that the shabby voodoo here just slides by.\n\nPlus, I am far from a prude, but I thought the sex and drug references were a bit too explicit for the younger crowd.\n\nI did like the Harry Poter and the Chamber of Secrets trailer. Not worth $7.50 though.Send the kids. save your money for a real movie. Or stay home. maybe the Stooges are on TV, and they do fart jokes better. Or buy the Buffy DVD- season 2 was prime SMG- not so skinny they had to bury her in sweaters all the time."

What a surprise this movie was...granted there were times when you could actually feel you brain sizzling from lack of intelligence, there was a scooby doo plot, a scooby doo humor, and a scooby doo ending. The writers did a better job than I expected to not loose the feeling the old Scooby Doo series left you with. And the ending was a nice breath of fresh air, no cheesy bad guys here. The acting job by all but Matthew Lillard could have used a bit of improvement. I say everyone but Matthew Lillard since he even had the cracking voice of Shaggy down pat. The only down side to this movie was the choppy graphics used in the animation of Scooby himself. You would think for having his name in the title they would have added a few more cuts into their graphics so as not to give the viewers such a headache. Must have been the producers from Blaire Witch. All in all, I would suggest this movie to anyone who was a Scooby Doo fan and would like to kill an evening at home...and a few brain cells along with it."

I am not very familiar with the animated series but if it looks like this movie I would not like the series either.\n\nSome better things in this mess I would like to mention though. The dog (voice by Scott Innes) and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) gave me some smiles, the boss of the spooky theme park where the movie is set is played by Rowan Atkinson who gave me some smiles as well, and the movie is very colorful which, I think, is a good thing. Still, the story that even goes to taking over the world, other characters like Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini) and Mary Jane (Isla Fisher), the sometimes terrible visuals and the complete lack of nice jokes make this a movie to forget as quickly as possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "This truly was an annoying, unfunny movie to watch. OK I admit I never have been a big fan of the 'Scooby-Doo' cartoons but I at least expected this movie to be entertaining.\n\nIn the beginning the movie perfectly made fun of all the early old 'Scooby-Doo' cartoons. Every episode was always the same and every character always basically did the same in every episode and the beginning of the movie perfectly makes fun of this. As the movie progresses the movie becomes more and more unoriginal and unfunny and gets a totally wrong way too fast pace.\n\nThe pace is really the thing I had the most problem with during the movie. It was way too fast and the viewer isn't getting a moment rest. On top of that there isn't really anything good or funny happening on screen. The story is way too weak and simple and the use of music songs in the movie is annoying and makes this movie an annoying, busy, noisy mess.\n\nThe Scooby-Doo character in my opinion doesn't have enough screen time to regard him as the main character. On top of that he isn't very impressive looking. CGI-characters were even in 2002 at a point of looking realistic but Scooby-Doo is way too fake looking along with all the CGI-monsters in the movie.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar really is an annoying, weak actress. She really acts like an amateur in this movie. Matthew Lillard is a way better actor and he seemed like the only actor in the movie that could interact correctly and believable with the Scooby-Doo character. Also Rowan Atkinson is of course a talented comical actor and Linda Cardellini is perfectly cast as dorky Velma.\n\nAn annoying, noisy, wrongly paced movie. Still kids will perhaps still find some joy in this movie.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible? His impersonation skills were flawless!). The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting but were so 3-D rendered that they did not match the original 2-D versions very well. The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted. No mere disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise-- there's some evil genius at work. There were some minor plot issues with Velma, Fred, and Daphne having much greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons, but experimenting with such ideas is very cartoon-like. The set and cast worked very well. There's some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect, but the last bit that they did helped. If you're prudish about gas-passing and belching, there are about 4 minutes you can do without, but they seem very much in character."

(They used to be called the \"Scooby-Doo Detective Agency,\" by the way.) Matthew Lillard's Shaggy is pretty good... at some parts you might think it's actually Casey Kasem playing the famous cartoon beatnik! Also, Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a sexy Daphne, too! The CGI Scooby... well, he is all right, I suppose. He does act like the cartoon Scooby, and he is kinda cute, but I think the cartoon Scooby is cuter and funnier. The voice Scooby has in this is pretty poor-sounding, and it is no match for Don Messick's classic Scooby doggie voice.\n\nAlso, the plot is slightly interesting. They do have a few references to the classic Scooby cartoons, such as using some of the old Hanna-Barbera sound effects (like the bongo sound before Scooby takes off) mixed with the standard sound effects you hear on most recent live-action WB feature films, and Fred has his ascot, too. Also, they do have songs playing during the old chases against the villains, but for the ultimate chase, they use a rock version of the Scooby-Doo theme! Ironic, huh? Also, I find this a lot like a live-action version of Warner Bros. Animation's incarnations of the Scooby cartoons (Zombie Island, What's New Scooby, etc.) Also, there are SOME real monsters in it, too. And, of course... SCRAPPY-DOO is in it! He even actually PEES on Daphne! But thankfully Scrappy isn't in it much. I advise those Scrappy-Doo fans out there to NOT watch this film! Overall, a good film and you should check it out."

Hmm..\n\nI walked in, sat down, and saw lots and lots of kids. Lots. Oodles. It was packed. I settled down for what might be a somewhat ok movie, and wanting to see how Matt Lillard would do as Shaggy.\n\nI have to start with this tho, the Harry Potter \"Episode 2\" preview was the best thing about Scooby-Doo.\n\nHorribly Cast (outside of Matt Lillard, who did as well as he could with such a poorly written role), terribly acted, extremely poorly written, I could only suffer about an hour of this montrosity before I eventually walked out for of a movie for only the 3rd time in my life (Zoolander being the last one). As soon as they found \"the secret control room\" which showed that they were \"brainwashing teenagers\", I think I had enough. I understand they were trying to capture the feel of the cartoon, but even in that they sorely failed. The CG was shoddy, and the only positive point outside of Lillard's voice were a few unfunny guest cameos (just cool to see them in such a hollywood mishmash).\n\nMy conclusion: Worst movie so far this year. Avoid it like the plague. Oh, yeah, and Bourne Identity was excellent. 0/10."

Taking all of the fun and camp that made the cartoon so memorable, you get an empty, soul-less teenybopper version of the classic animated series. If you can't tell by the cast (Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, etc.) that it's going to be disgraceful, than with any luck the sight of the frightening CGI Scooby will turn you away.\n\nWhile Scooby may be the one with the title, he was never overbearing like he is in this flick. He does a little too much talking and is closer to Jar Jar Binks than the `real' Scooby Doo. It's tough to say that the once loveable pooch was annoying, but he was. The rest of the cast was OK. Past sins of their career temporarily forgiven, Prinze and Gellar, are fine as Fred and Daphne and Linda Cardellini does a pretty good Velma. The real star (and saving grace) was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. His dead-on take on everyone's favorite stoner was quite impressive, but not enough to save the sinking ship.\n\nDirector Raja Gosnell (whose unfunny credits include `Home Alone 3' and `Big Momma's House') doesn't do much to liven up James Gunn's lousy script. Let's think about this for a minute here: `Scooby Doo' is a trusted brand name and potential franchise and the studio in entrusting the director of `Home Alone 3' and the writer of `Tromeo and Juliet' to make this a winner?\n\nWhere did it go so wrong? Where did it break down? Was it the farting dual between Shaggy and Scooby? Was it the guest appearances by Pamela Anderson and Sugar Ray? Was it everyone's least favorite character Scrappy Doo (think Son of Jar Jar) as a surprise main character? Was it trying to make Scooby use `hip lingo'? Maybe it was the combination of all of these with the fact that this wasn't made for anyone over the age of 12 or anyone with a developed sense of humor.\n\nIf you were ever a Scooby Doo fan, avoid this one at all costs. Do not taint your good memory of him. If you've never seen it, this isn't the time for a poor introduction. Do yourself a favor and watch the cartoon first if you really have to go. You can wait for video if you'd like, but there's no reason to. While there's probably already a sequel in the works, one can only hope that this one will tank (a la `Lost In Space') and there's won't be another, but we wouldn't be so lucky, would we?"

The story has a great cast, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) character,she has had a wonderful career. And she's awesomely bad ass here. Who's helpless now, to Velma. The start of the story shows the scooby gang In action, meddling teens messing around. Daphne is always the damsel In distress and it's funny to see her proceeded that way. They then split ways after that. But then hear about an Island, that they have all been asked to investigate. The problem is, they are out of character at the start, it didn't feel right for them to have been split up. However when they get to the Island they all get back together. The farting scene was pretty poor. But the Villains were epic, and the different locations they found themselves in was funny. The musical band turning into evil creatures created for some atmospheric and tension through the film, it's ability to master action, comedy and mystery was brilliant hear. The Film had some great moments with Daphne, she's helpless, fearless and willing to fight for the Scooby gang, whilst Shaggy and Scooby hide away. Also, Shaggy finds himself a love interest, which was explored in the TV show at times, hear it is properly explored and it's good fun. The Story ends interestingly and the film is above average."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the great things about the original series is that the monster/alien/ghost/whatever was NEVER real. It was always some guy playing an elaborate prank. This got lost in the movie, sadly. Scrappy Doo as a villain? Hey, Scrappy sucked. If anyone should have been a villain, it was him. I loved this shot at his character. However, SMG and FPJr. were nothing like the original characters. Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma were all true to the original series. You can really see Lillard trying his ass off to make it right. Sadly, it doesn't ultimately work out. Too many of the \"rules\" of the series have been broken to make it a good rendition of Scooby Doo. SMG, FPJr., and the addition of real supernatural activity makes this a bad remake of a pretty good cartoon series. Sadly, the target audience doesn't care or doesn't notice these problems. Whatever. This movie and its sequels can make millions 'til the cows come home. It doesn't change the fact that they suck, and everyone who matters believes the same way."

        "review_detailed_main": "A few years after the gang broke up as a result of tensions that have built up between them, the gang finds themselves reunited when reclusive theme park owner Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) enlists the gang's help to solve a mystery at horror themed Spooky Island. Once there, however the gang stumbles upon a mystery that may have world ending consequences.\n\nThe film is an adaptation/parody of the Scooby-Doo franchise which despite originating in 1969 has managed to endure itself in the popular consciousness becoming arguably the most iconic Hanna-Barbera property (with Flintstones and Jetsons being contenders). The show has had numerous incarnations over the years and is still going strong. The Scooby-Doo movie straddles the line between being a straightforward adaptation meant for a family audience and a more cynical tongue-in-cheek parody like The Brady Bunch Movie or A Very Brady Sequel, and it's that identity crisis that brings the movie down and prevents it from fully standing on its own.\n\nOriginally intended as a more outlandish spoof of the Scooby-Doo franchise and made with a tone similar to the 90s The Addams Family and Brady Bunch films, the film's tone and target demographic were subject to very late in the game changes by studio executives which mandated a PG rating(in contrast to the previously approved PG-13) as well as a more juvenile and kid friendly tone. Having seen some of the deleted footage, it's clear the end product was not the movie the filmmakers originally envisioned. The deleted footage has a lot more de constructive elements to the material as well as slightly cheeky and more over the top approaches to certain characters and situations. While the cut footage wouldn't have elevated the movie passed being okay, it would've helped to differentiate itself from other slapstick heavy family films of the time like Cats & Dogs or Snow Dogs. Even with all the clear editing that the film has been put through, the movie still does have some of its more innuendo focused gags (which admittedly are the funniest parts of the movie) and doesn't mesh particularly well with the kidified tone of the film.\n\nDespite clear signs of post production interference, the film still has merit. The Scooby gang are all perfectly cast with Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Linda Cardellini all giving good performances with great chemistry as Fred, Daphne and Velma, but easilly the best part is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Lillard embodies the character quite well and apparently watched every episode of the TV show he could get his hands on to prepare for the role, Lillard's commitment to the character down to him copying Shaggy's vegetarianism that became a pre-requisite for Casey Kasem to continue voicing the character is uncannily spot on and helps bring the character to life. The titular Scooby-Doo is well voiced by Neil Fanning (even if it doesn't quite capture the Don Messick delivery), but the actually effects used to create Scooby-Doo feel more like a rough outline for Scooby than a finished effect. Despite less than convincing effects, it's integrated reasonably well, but probably could've used more time for added polish.\n\nScooby-Doo is a frustrating film because it's clear not just from the deleted footage but also the performances, costumes, and set designs that there's a clear passion and sense of fun as well as an understanding of the appeal and formula of the Scooby-Doo franchise. Unfortunately the movie compromises itself by trying to play itself as a kid's adventure movie while simultaneously being a knowing parody of itself and it doesn't quite stick either one. Despite that, there is a sense of fun to be had thanks to the cast's performance and chemistry and the knowing jibes that weren't left on the cutting room floor do still elicit some laughs thanks to their clear knowledge of the Scooby-Doo formula. A marginal recommendation."

This film version opens with a similar scene of a \" Ghost \" having his masked pulled off only to reveal it's a man screaming \" If it wasn't for those pesky kids I would have got away with it \" so thankfully we're not going to be watching a feature film whose only connection with its source material is the title , something like WILD WILD WEST , STARSKY AND HUTCH and THE CHARLIES ANGELS movies all suffer from this\n\nAs for the cast Freddie Prinze Jr and Matthew Lillard make fairly good jobs in their respective roles as Fred and Shaggy , though Sarah Michelle Geller is slightly to hard faced to be truly convincing as Daphene , possibly the sexiest cartoon character in history . Talking of sexy the major casting disappointment is Linda Cardellini as Velma . I'm sorry but Velma is a short , fat , plain girl with glasses , the sort of girl who ends up a spinster because no man with eyesight would fancy her while Ms Cardellini is far too hot to be playing these type of roles . as for the eponymous Scooby it's noticeable that Casey Kasem isn't doing the voice but that doesn't matter too much while people who complain that Scooby looks too much like a cartoon character seem to be missing the point . Duh he's a cartoon character what'd you expect ? Nice to see Rowan Atkinson appearing too , surely the funniest comedy actor for many a year\n\nThere might be some problems with the story but this is forgivable since we're talking about a twenty minute cartoon format stretched out into a ninety minute movie but this is an affectionate tribute and the story could have easily come from the classic cartoon series . It didn't win any Oscars but no one expected it to and as pop corn entertainment it works well enough"

I couldn't find a single shred of entertainment in this. I just sat there, my face expressionless throughout the two hours of this torture (except feeling sorry for Mr. Lillard killing his career on screen by doing the Shaggy voice).

        "review_detailed_main": "I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and I could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a visually ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.\n\nWhen I left the theater, I was in love with this movie. It's a Scooby fan's dream come true.The film's never ridiculous: a colourfull and coherent universe was built around the visual of the cartoon. It's a very rare thing but this time, an exact transposition of a cartoon is perfect and doesn't breed an example in visual bad taste.\n\nThe script intelligently breaks several rules of the cartoon in order to bring more deepness to the characters. For example, Daphne's tired to be the eternal \"stupid\" beauty in danger and Velma can't stand Fred's attitude anymore as he always acts as if he had solved the mysteries alone. But these efforts would have been vain if a \"dream team\" of actors hadn't been gathered around the hilarious Scooby. Even if the team's composed of five characters, they're all treated with the same importance, and that's rare enough to be underscored.\n\nMatthew LILLARD IS Shaggy: he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual Scooby is very impressive: when he's with him, you feel like if the dog was really on the set. The duo's perfect.\n\nSarah Michelle GELLAR and Freddie PRINZE Jr have a very communicative energy. It's obvious that they had a very good time playing the two \"beautiful and quite stupid\" characters of the team. Even if the role of Daphne was written with \"Buffy\" references, Sarah Michelle GELLAR succeeds in preserving the essence of the character: I never thought about Buffy when I saw her as Daphne.\n\nAnd the last but not the least, Linda CARDELLINI delivers an outstanding performance as Velma. She took the animated character and managed to make her more human, funnier and even touching by bringing all sorts of irresistible details and mimics as for example in the way she laughs or says that she's the most clever of the team. Great job for a great actress.\n\nI hope that no sequel will ever reach the screen if any of them is missing from the cast.\n\nThe story's quite simple but very well paced and entertaining. There are lots of cool dialogues and \"private jokes\" for the series' fans. All the gags are in the tone of the cartoon and always effective. I wasn't in favor of the use of martial arts through the character of Daphne but finally, kung fu fits in the universe of SCOOBY DOO as it's used with parsimony to bring a few more good gags.\n\nAs a conclusion, I would say that SCOOBY DOO's a terrific movie: it's fun, fast and very well acted.I found in it everything that made me love the cartoon and even more. Don't miss it if you're a SCOOBY fan: you won't regret it!"

It is plain senseless and full of crazy voodoo mumbo jumbo. The original Scooby-Doo series is somewhat logical, but this one screams a loud Wizards of Waverly Place tone.

        "review_detailed_main": "So, to me there are some spectrums here the movie is working with and if you are a person that like that side of the spectrums, I don't blame you but know it isn't for me. When I was a kid, I loved this movie. It was so fun, scary, and exciting. Now I'm a cynical adult that poke holes in movies and this one has not aged that well. This movie is very camp, and I feel like camp falls into a spectrum of over the top or serious. I think the movie falls into the middle of this spectrum and therefore I only see it as a flawed camp movie. Maybe that kind of camp is for you, then you\u00b4ll love it. A second spectrum is being original or staying true to the original. The movie once again leans into both and becomes this familiar, yet unrecognizable mash of ideas. Maybe you like this blend and you\u00b4ll love it. Personally, the movie just didn't speak to me at all. It felt highly rushed, and the small glimpse of personality is drowned by mediocre kids movie tropes and 2000s catering.\n\nMystery inc. Is broken up and the gang is doing their own things. Until they get a letter from a mysteries owner of an amusement park, where spooky things are happening. The gang still has a hard time working together and more and more puzzle pieces point towards something bigger than they are used to.\n\nI already talked about the camp and cartoon aspects but I\u00b4ll give more of a reason here. When you take a campy and over the top idea like this, you have to commit. You can\u00b4t have serious tones of you make it over the top or silly tones if you make it serious. This movie leans into the over the top of camp but never really commits to it fully. It feels like they were told by a studio or something to tone it down, make it more grounded and more relatable to kids of the day. These aspects really clash with each other and creates this tonal mess. Another aspect that is hard to work with is the translation of the Scooby-Doo IP. This is in its most famous incarnation a low budget cartoon show without much character development or plot threads. It\u00b4s small adventures every episode done in like 20-30 minutes. This movie tries to recreate that with an hour longer runtime and now has to add character to really characterless characters. Fred and Daphne now need to be different, which is in no way a bad thing, but it makes the characters that stay the same feel even more useless than they were in the original incarnation. Personally, I just didn't vibe with the changes and choices made to the universe.\n\nThis movie is catering towards kids yet has adult jokes. It has sexualization, and fart humor. It oozes 2000s in the most over the top way possible. It feels like a big mess without much direction and a huge amount of corporate meddling, telling people the movie should be hip. This is the biggest flaw of the movie to me. It feels so contemporary ad mixes things from an old beloved show with hip and trendy aspects.\n\nThe plot fells taken straight out of an older Scooby-Doo mystery. Here are the suspects, here are some clues, go. Yet the movie rushes itself and don't have a lot to work with. It gives itself the same limelight as an old episode that was 20 minutes and now stretches that to the absolute limit without actually doing much with the mystery that really isn't in focus. There are so many weird plot threads and ideas that just don't fit. Why didn't Shaggy save everyone when he had the chance? Why set up more than one suspect and not develop why they are that and then even make the suspects work in a lazy way? Why is the villain that dumb and destroy their plan so easily? Again the movie mixes mystery and then becomes this dumb kids action movie and the ending really hits that home.\n\nThe movie is just so busy and has so many things it wants to do but don't have the runtime or competence to do it. It\u00b4s glossing over so many aspects that are actually funny and interesting.\n\nThe humor is mixed. The adult jokes work, and some gags are great. The kids fart humor can for me be deleted completely as it really isn't funny. I\u00b4m normally not into grossout humor so I don't see it as fun.\n\nThe CGI has not aged well. The greenscreen work is really terrible and the creatures in this movie are so ugly. The monsters look so incredibly fake and bad and the stretch tool is overused in the movie. Scooby-Doo also looks terrible. He looks so weirdly proportional with his eyes being huge like an anime character. In general, not a fan of the special effects here.\n\nA few things I liked though. The cast is great and spot on. They really capture the essence of their character and they have so many recognizable mannerisms they translate to perfection.\n\nThe production design is also so incredible. The sets and practical stuff look and feels incredible, and the costuming is spot on. The main cast are translated so well with their costumes. And the mascots of the island all look so good.\n\nI think an aspect that keeps coming back to me is that the movie tries to do stuff but never really execute it well. It takes something like character development and rushes it, adds it for nothing, while other characters are just staying the same. The movie should have stayed simpler or gone in a more serious direction. And one more thing, the ending twist is dumb and poorly implemented with a little clue thrown in immediately followed by a reveal of who the villain is.\n\nScooby-Doo could actually have been an amazing cult movie and it kind of is for some. While it\u00b4s not camp enough for me to leave me with the camp scratch, it had the idea just poorly executed. It should have gone one of 2 ways instead of staying in the middle. I would have love to see this movie with less corporate meddling."

The gang returns to the hotel and they are attacked by the island demons who kidnap many including Fred, Velma and Mondavarious. The next morning, everybody is back but they are all possessed by demons.\n\nIt's a live action movie using a cartoon style of bright colors, silly action, childish humor, and ridiculous story. It's hard to say that this is a failure. It achieves exactly what they are after. I'm just not sure that it's particularly funny. I also don't know about including Scrappy Doo or giving him a douche personality. There are a lot of questionable things in this movie but there is enough wacky craziness to keep the 10 year olds entertained."

Could Rowan Atkinson be over this?? Well you'd be surprised by the time you get to the end.\n\nSo after this set up you'd think its the best family movie ever well no,its packed with fart jokes,the cast is good,the story is a bit creepy for kids to watch and everything about it is kinda silly.\n\nOverall its not one of those movies you'd watch again and again. But since were reaching the Halloween spirit,its not bad to watch for Halloween.\n\nIm giving it a 6 out of 10 because I love Scooby Doo as a kid and heck I still love the animated version."

Lol.\n\nBehavior is unusual for the main characters and their appearance is kitschy. Daphne engages in martial arts and as if she did something, she screams with her arms raised, also shaking her ass \"oh yeah\", Scooby and Shaggy in one scene belch and fart. As Fred's soul flew into his body, Daphne then replied with a stupid smile that he could walk naked.\n\nShaggy also hangs out with some kitschy doll on the island.\n\nScrappy: I think it's some kind of joke what they did with him. As soon as a group of main characters was driving through the desert, Scrappy pissed on Daphne with a malicious laugh (thank you very much for that stupid joke), and in return he was thrown onto the road. Especially Scooby would not do that as Scrappy's uncle and guardian. In addition, Scrappy is here and a villain too, disguises himself as Mr Bean leading Spooky Island and as soon as he is stopped, Scooby punches Scrappy in the face and flies straight into the rock wall.\n\nReally bad movie.\n\nI only recommend Scooby made before the 90's because they have a good atmosphere."

Is it funny? Yeah, most of the time. It's certainly more amusing than the show. Some bits fall flat, but they are generally successful. The flatulence competition is a bit much, but it sets up a really funny gag in the next scene.\n\nThe only legitimate complaint is that the film breaks the show's rule that the monsters are always fake. The other-worldly nature of the villain's plot is a bit disconcerting, but it doesn't really detract from the movie's enjoyment.\n\nIf you are a fan of the show, or even just a casual viewer, you should get a kick out of this.

Now yes, I would've liked for them to tone down the potty humor a little, but really that's the only issue I had with it! Yah, personally, I think the whole fart contest scene just went too far, it got overboard. The cast was great, each and every one were cast exactly right, they all looked exactly like their character! This movie just makes me feel good when I watch it. Is it gonna win an Oscar, no, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining and fun to watch! Some of the CGI monsters could've been designed a little better, they don't look horrible or anything, but it's kinda evident that more effort could've gone into that, but I think Scooby Doo looked just fine. Sarah Michelle Gellar is by far the best here, I just loved her performance as daphne here, she was so spot on, and shaggy was so accurately depicted, it was scary lol. The action sequences are satisfying, especially the haunted castle scene on the island. I think that castle scene is very well done, and it's bound to please viewers, especially if you were a fan of the old animated series. Overall I'm giving Scooby Doo (2002) a 7/10 rating. It's not flawless, but u have to remember that this movie was targeted towards kids and families. But seriously I love watching this whenever I feel bad or just depressed about something, it always makes me feel better!"

Dragged along by my seven year old daughter, who is entranced by thirty year old re-runs on Cartoon Network (and they haven't aged well, speaking as someone who used to rush home from school to watch it), I didn't expect the cynical, set-piece laden exercise in making money which was served up. The good bits: any time Scooby (and therefore Shaggy, who Matthew Lilliard gets to a 'T') is on screen (and it isn't as much as you'd think it would be, couldn't they afford the computer time?). The bad bits: the rest, boy does it draaaaaaaaagggggg. The plot is weak, isn't explained very well and is thus confusing, but never mind because here comes another set piece that has absolutely nothing to do with advancing the plot. Why does Velma change from dowdy and homely into sex vamp, and back again? Why is Sarah Michelle Geller completely unbelievable as Daphne - she's a fine actress, but she sure does need to get away from playing Buffy clones? Why did I want to punch Freddy Prinze Jr. every time he appeared?\n\nA cynical lazy Hollywood pic, lowest common denominator stuff, recycling ideas that weren't really that good in the first place and should have been left well alone. Already setting up the sequel at the end as well. Please, don't do it.\n\nWithin an hour of the film ending, my daughter was struggling to remember ANYTHING she liked about the film, bar -surprise- the fart scene. She was more entranced by the fast food she'd had afterwards."

The film brings to life the iconic gang - Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne - as they embark on a ghostly mystery at a haunted amusement park. The plot, while predictable at times, manages to capture the essence of the original series, delivering a fun and spooky romp that stays true to its roots.\n\nThe cast embody their animated counterparts with charm and humor, making the characters feel like old friends. The CGI rendition of Scooby himself is endearing, and his antics provide plenty of laughs. The chemistry between the gang members shines through, and their dynamic interactions add depth to the familiar characters.\n\nVisually, the film is a treat, with vibrant and imaginative settings that bring the spooky world of Scooby-Doo to life. The special effects, while not groundbreaking, effectively enhance the supernatural elements of the story. The film's pacing keeps the mystery moving along, though some scenes may feel rushed, leaving little time for the audience to savor the clues and red herrings.\n\nWhile the plot may lack originality, the film's heart lies in its homage to the source material, and it succeeds in capturing the essence of the original cartoon. The humor is light-hearted and family-friendly, appealing to a wide audience. The movie also pays tribute to the themes of friendship and teamwork, which have been central to the Scooby-Doo franchise since its inception.\n\nIn conclusion, Scooby-Doo is a delightful, if somewhat predictable, trip down memory lane. It's a fun and harmless adventure that successfully brings the beloved characters to a new generation while offering a dose of nostalgia for long-time fans. While it may not break new ground, it's a joyful celebration of the enduring appeal of Scooby and the gang, and a reminder of the enduring power of friendship and mystery-solving."

There are even some convincing moments (so to speak) and funny ones from Lillard and the computerized Scooby, but like the vein that this film came from- The Flintstones 1 and 2, Josie and the Pussycats, the cartoon versions are much appreciated over real (an exception in the Ninja Turtles movie, but that's another company). Kids will like it, I suppose, but they will vary too; it's somewhat surprising that for a PG movie they dig in some weed jokes and that kids will most likely be oblivious to them unless they've gone through the DARE program: Shaggy's love interest is Mary Jane, there's one shot where the mystery van is shown to have smoke coming out the top (inside Shag and Scoob are cooking eggplant), Led Zeppelin shirt, more junk food than could meet the eye.

After reviews like that and having seen every episode of Scooby up until the point that Scrappy made his presence known, I had to see it for myself. While there are plenty of slow spots, there are some outright funny parts. The flatulence contest, while very crude, definitely appealed to my less mature side. I was just about rolling on the floor howling. And what can you say when smoke is rolling out of The Mystery Machine and Matt Lillard as Shaggy (as one reviewer perfectly put it, it is as if he was genetically created to play this part) while grilling some bread shouts \"Talk about toasted!\" One would have to be very dimwitted to have missed this reference and not laughed (excepting the prude of the bunch). I really think Sarah Michelle should have been given large, flowing, red hair like the cartoon Daphne, and FP Jr. just doesn't have the build to quite pull off Freddie completely. Linda Cardellini as Velma, however, if perfectly cast and plays the part perfectly (not to mention she's far prettier than SMG). This movie combines plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor amongst a plethora of sight gags that makes it work overall, despite the shortcomings in casting. The CG Scooby I think works quite well as making the Great Dane look real might have made it just a little too difficult to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy the movie at all. James Gunn, screenwriter and co-writer of the original story and a good SF writer, does an adequate job at this, though I think parts of his humor fall just a bit flat. All-in-All, on the pywrit scale of 1-10, this one gets a 7. Not perfect, but ultimately watchable and enjoyable with plenty of good, gut-busting laughs. And an \"oh yeah.\" It's great to see that little Scrappy get his comeuppance."

It is a dumb plot of course, but filled with moments i am sure i would have loved when I was six. Maybe because I tried to revert my thinking back to when I was six, I was able to appreciate it the best I could.

        "review_detailed_main": "Hello Reader, you may have recently seen my comments on Scooby doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, I went back to watch the first film as I had previously not seen it. Scarred by my previous experience from the last movie, I was reluctant to see this film however it did not disappoint. In this review, I will look at the good and bad points.\n\nGood points are the film has lots of Mr Bean, there is no female shaggy, scrappy remind me of my wife when we first met. Bad points are that at not point in this movie are monsters unleashed, there is no scenes that contain potions that turn Scooby into a slug. Oh sugar! another good point is that there is another plot twist that the main bad guy is someone that they are not, initially Mr Bean who turns out to be Scrappy Doo. This left me and my wife gasping as to why this happened which lead to a passionate evening and lets just we were screaming scooby dooby doo. More Bad points include that there is no tits, (male or female). In the scene where daphney in wrestling, there is a no penetration and b there is no Mortal Kombat style brutality! In this film, velma loses her glasses but in an adaptation I watched on an adult channel, her glasses were found on another man's part, this left me thoroughly disappointed!!! Another bad point, is that fred does not remove his ascot from neck whereas in monsters unleashed he does and damn son that is a beautiful neck! Oh beans! Another good point, oh wait! I mean a bad point is that at no point in the film does Fred say \"Split up and look for clues\" However (this is a good point as the film appeals to a LGBTQaudience as velma teams up with Scooby and Shaggy instead of the typical Velma, Daphney and Fred original trio which portrays Fred as a rampant sex criminal as he is surrounded by two women!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen too many \"Scooby-Doo\" episodes on TV, (although under coercion from a sadistic pre-schooler who routinely threatens to whine at me with extreme prejudice if I don't recant and pass the remote), and I confess that I just don't get it. I don't even get the \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\" where old 60s & 70s celebrities appear as cartoon caricatures of themselves; just plain-famous folks caught in another impossibly dull Scooby-Shaggy episode against assorted pseudo-monsters. But, my 6-year-old loves it! He doesn't care an iota if Kurosawa didn't direct it! Now, a few asides are needed here\u0085 I have been to Universal Studios, Florida and applauded Doug Funny and `The Rugrats!' on stage. I actually went to a `Barney the Dinosaur' live concert and howled like a teenage \"In Sync\" fan when Old Barn came rolling out with his purple pot belly in gleeful kinesis! I have even enthusiastically interacted with Steve & Blue for clues\u0085 but this `Scooby-Doo' thing lacks anything remotely redeemable. I loathe the show's time slot\u0085I become perceptibly stressed with hives before `Scooby-Doo' marathons on the Cartoon Channel, usually a Sunday event, which inevitably conflicts with Yankee-Red Sox games. The social relations among the \u0091Scooby' Five, not to be confused with the Scottsboro 5, are void of any allegory or depth. The dog and his cohorts are rendered in a flat, two-dimensional graphic style reminiscent of `Steamboat Willie.' The animation is without depth or perspective, and the characters move around on perfectly still budget-friendly backgrounds\u0085yech! The characters (Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred) bring matching personas to their screen presence. And, Scooby has apparently evaded the evolutionary lottery of natural selection, which mandates that a palette, tongue and convoluted cerebral cortex are required for language acquisition! Scooby speaks, inexplicably, in limited English but with an annoying & incomprehensible `r-r-r-r-u-f-f' sound prefixing every utterance. Of course, only Shaggy and my son can understand this coded canine verbal-slaw. OK\u0085so I get the Scooby-thing\u0085it's pure silly nonsense played for yucks! I get the Scooby Snack-thing\u0085the dog is always hungry! I even accept that Scooby must never hump the guest star's leg, although my son occasionally springs a pre-school woody for Daphne Blake\u0085certainly a fertile topic for father-son dialogues about the male 'willy' and its various purposes. Regardless of this concealed erotic bonus feature, it still is an all time low achievement from the predictably banal imaginations of Hanna & Barbera. You will recall that they were also the creators of\u0085'The Flintstones', another \u0091one-trick-pony', flat animation series with the effect of a `pie-in-the-face' to any National Hope in growing a generation prepared to catch the Japanese in math & science! (Certainly, paleontology has a slight chance here from the splash benefits of the current cultural swell of 'dinophilia'. Also, a note here of apology to `Jay', my sushi-guru who won't even whisper his true \u0091Sino-nymn' for fear that I will lingually disfigure it\u0085 Jay, buddy, I know you guys have limited access to archeological digs around Osaka, et.al. Nothing personal. I don't even hold Hondas & `Dragonball Z' against you guys! OK? Keep that great \u0091California Roll' coming...it's pure art.) But, Lord! Deliver us from the purveyors of the bland, vacuous cartoon series that repeats and repeats and repeats\u0085then mercifully dies\u0085and resurrects 10 years later on 24-hour cable TV! (I'm praying that a \u0091round the clock `Scooby-Doo Network' does not rise up from the ashes!) But, wait! There's more! This fetid, animated pabulum is miraculously resuscitated at the brink of expiration as a full-length feature film intended to collect the box office proceeds that should've been paid originally to a hired assassin to put the whole dreary project team \u0091asleep'\u0085humanely. Oh well. I could be wrong. Maybe `Scooby-Doo' is really the charming, diverting visual poem that my son assures me that it is\u0085twice daily... and twice that again on Sunday. After all, he is Daphne-obsessed and worse things could happen at 6."

The animated gang, Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and yes even Velma have already made movies. A lot. All fully animated, all quirky and all brilliant. Now they are hitting the big screen as real life characters. I think the cast is perfect. More than perfect. They wanted a real life coupe, a.k.a, Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Geller, to play Daphne Blake and Fred Jones. Velma's character is fab too, just like the real cartoon. Not to mention Shaggy, he is the most life like. You can tell from the beginning that this was a high cost movie. But worth it man, worth it. Not enough people went to see this film. It's a breakthrough. You might be wondering, he loves it, he thinks it's the best, so how come he gave it a 7 out of 10, and entitled his review good, but not great. Well, the actual film is not that fab, it's worth buying, but it's not something that you would really want to watch every day, or even every week. 7 out of 10 is a suitable grade for a film as technological as this. But the plot is a bit iffy. The second is better. Just look at my review for that one."

It had funny moments that were bound to make kids laugh. And it did. 3.) It was memorable. When it came out on video, I immediately wanted it because I remembered everything about how much I enjoyed it. Being older now, my appreciation has decreased for this movie. The acting is OK, it doesn't commit too well to the original cartoon, and, despite being kids humor, I didn't find it that funny. But why is it that deep down, my childhood heart is telling me that I still like this movie? I guess there are a few reasons. All right, I admit I do chuckle at some parts, although I said before I didn't find it that funny. And I also like the creativity they put in it. I really liked the ideas of the monsters and what they do. And although the CGI isn't spectacular, it was still the beginning of the CGI reign, so they at least gave it a shot. I also remember seeing it in the the theaters, and Scooby's first appearance made the entire theater cheer. It was the first time seeing him on the big screen. He might not have been a cartoon, but it was still that great Dane kids knew and loved. So, overall, I guess it's a guilty pleasure. It'll keep kids entertained, so I recommend it as a movie rent for a weekend."

The plaudits for the character of Shaggy are well deserved. But, is there really a point to making Fred a vain, self centered air head? To transforming Daphne into a martial arts expert? To replacing Velma's nerdy self confidence with an \"I just wanna be liked by the cool kids\" self pity?\n\nMy 7-year-old daughter put it best, saying that the opening vignette (a mini-adventure unmasking a \"ghost\" in a toy factory) was better than the rest of the movie. For that matter, so are any of the reruns on the Cartoon Network."

Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr) is hopelessly inept, a far cry from the serious cartoon character. Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is nothing like the cartoon Daph I recall. Velma (Linda Cardellini) was not too bad, but all of them (except Lillard) struggled to emulate the original characters.\n\nEven the CGI Scooby is rather lame, and looked more like a cartoon than the original cartoon version did.\n\nThere are some funny scenes. The farting in armour scene had me in hysterics, for instance. And the scene where they reminisce about ditching Scrappy-Doo, years before, really paid homage to the fans hatred of that particular character in the cartoon show. I kept expecting to see Scooby-Dumb (remember him?) show up, but thankfully they didn't go that far. Finally, the soul-swapping scene could have been managed better, and was just there for a quick laugh.\n\nBut Shaggy (Lillard) was just so perfect that it made me cringe to see the rest of the cast, although the scenes with him and Scooby do work pretty well.\n\nIf you're a fan of the cartoon show, watch it for Shaggy and Scooby, and try not to watch the fill-in bits with the rest of the cast."

I think that he spoilt the cartoon version. Part of Scoobys charm is his ill formed English. If a dog could talk that is how it should be. However, Scrappy is too articulate and ruins the show. keep scrappy out."

        "review_title": "If not for Shaggy and Scooby, one of the worst adaptations ever",
        "review_detailed_main": "The summary pretty much sums up my feeling about this movie. Any classic Scooby fan will like this film for its entertainment, but not for anything to do with Scooby Doo, and here is why I feel that way.\n\nAfter watching about 30 episodes in one week, I performed a small role analysis on Scooby Doo once for a psych course, and things don't pan out well with the movie. Most of the time in the series, Fred was the one who kept the group together and was a natural leader. What some won't recognize is that when it came to getting his hands dirty though, it was a sign of fear on his part that the group was always using Shag and Scoob for the dangerous parts and maybe a little machismo in that he always went with Daphne. But Fred as a vain, self-centered, retard as in the movie? Hello, Fred solved half of the mysteries. It wasn't all Velma. Fred was the leader because of his likability. Here, Fred is not likeable at all and Freddie Prince was a horrible choice for the part. I like Prince as an actor, he simply didn't have the physique to play the part and his emotional spread wasn't there. I don't know who to blame, but I'm going with the writers since I think he's done better. Furthermore, I did NOT want him and Daphne to get together, as I always hoped in the cartoons.\n\nThen there is Daphne. For goodness sakes. Buffy is hot and a good actress, but Daphne was in no way a \"woman of the 90's\". In the newer Scooby Doo movies, they did a really good job of modernizing her, especially in Zombie Island (where the monsters were also real). She was an individual career woman and her wealth was underplayed. She was still able to be attractive without being a ditz. She had just enough vulnerability to make her endearing to Fred. But here she comes off much more self-centered (although not so much as Fred by a long shot in the movie) and a martial arts expert. Why would she even hang out with the rest of these misfits? The whole universe is thrown out of whack. To put it in the words of another favorite modern kids cartoon, it really WOMPED.\n\nNext, there's Velma. Her vulnerability is shown through her glasses dependence, along with a little comic relief. She is the intelligent one. Here is another place where this film upset me. They go to all the trouble of modernizing Daphne, and then they go and throw back Velma. Here was the woman of the 90's invented in the 60's, but in this film, she is prone to peer pressure and just wants to be cool. Well, Velma always was cool and sure of herself. She didn't need the accolade of others, she had her own intrinsic motivations. With the exception that Velma is totally hot in this film, they screwed her. The actress did an excellent job playing the part that was directed and we will definitely being seeing more of her, but the part itself stunk. I in no way pitied the character and wanted her to be liked, instead, I wanted her to just get the you know what slapped out of her until she came to her senses.\n\nFinally, there is Shaggy and Scooby. Yes, I saved the best for last. Lillard and Scooby were excellent. Lillard, although somewhat type cast when you look at his parts (and he needs to do more without Prince) is the key to this film. His interplay with Scooby is believable. The computer graphics are believable. But even here the writers and directors messed up a good thing. The drug scene was always an implication in the toons. It in no way needed to be anything more than that. Most children under 12 do not pick up on the drug hints in the cartoons. Well, there is no way to miss it her. Boo on hollywood for this one. Should have been PG-13, and then maybe they would have rewritten it a little to get back a PG rating, like getting rid of the drug parts. I don't remember weed smoke coming out of the Mystery Machine, do you? For that matter, they're sort of saying then that all of the kids did drugs if only second hand, which is sort of implied in the series as well, but it doesn't need to be in the movie this way.\n\nLastly, we all hate Scrappy. Can we agree on that one. I especially liked the handling of him on the Cartoon Network when they did the Scooby Doo Project. Velma and Daphne go running when they hear da-da-da-da---da-da. Velma tells Daphne, It's only Scrappy, and then Daphne replies as she is running, \"I know.\" Made me laugh and laugh.\n\nI know some other commenters didn't like real monsters. Well, that didn't kill this film. Zombie Island had real monsters and it was good. Witch's Ghost had a real witch and it was good. This had real monsters and it stunk, flat out. If I didn't have free tickets, I wouldn't see it. I have every Scooby available on DVD, but I will NOT be buying this on DVD unless it is under $12, and even then, I will only get it for Lillard/Shaggy and Scooby. Lillard's Scooby was even better and made me laugh more than SNL's parody."

Freddie Prinze Jr. convinces as Fred, the pretty-boy leader of the group. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne is something special \u0096 all push up bras, lip gloss, short short dresses and PVC boots. Linda Cardellini is the Velma you always suspected lurked beneath that roll neck sweater \u0096 a pillow chested nerd, brainy AND sexy. Matthew Lillard is perfect as the slacker Shaggy (probably the best of the lot with his spot-on voice and remarkable resemblance to his animated counterpart). Scooby, of course, is CGI - not the greatest CGI, but that doesn't matter because the character is so much fun.\n\nIn addition, there is a great performance from a creepy Rowan Atkinson and a sexy turn from gorgeous Isla Fisher as Shaggy's girlfriend.\n\nThe movie is funny, silly and scary (possibly a little bit TOO scary for some kids) and director Raja Gosnell handles proceedings well. At points the plot may become a tad confusing for youngsters, but this is a minor niggle. The set designs, costumes, effects and props are uniformly impressive - from the day-glo Spooky Island attractions to the demon creatures, everything looks great.\n\nKick back and enjoy this for what it is \u0096 a highly amusing, fun filled roller-coaster ride."

Any kid who likes Scooby Doo should definitely see this. I don't like Scooby Doo the television show but this isn't half bad. The only thing I thought was good was the acting by the characters. Matthew Lillard is a good Shaggy, and his performance was pretty good. Linda Cardellini, Freddie Prinze JR., and Sarah Michelle Gellar are all good as what they are given and they fill all of the characters with what they need to bring out. I didn't particularly like the movie, though. But you've got to think, this isn't my kind of movie.

And it does it by balancing the creepy with the goofy.\n\nThe movie version skimps too much on the creepy and still tries to rely on the humor that worked so well because of the blend.\n\nIn the end you have humor that ONLY works when it is referencing the cartoons and otherwise fails when it is trying to mimic the cartoons.\n\nStay away from it. Watch the cartoons, most of them land the jokes better."

Raja Gosnell is all the way unworthy of being called a filmmaker, and ever since he took on the job of disrespecting the classic Your, Mine and Ours, which was a childhood favorite, he was personally put on my hit-man list. Scoobys poor animation only makes everything worse. The humor wasn't funny, It was crude, childish, immature, and far off from respect of the original cartoon. I wasn't a big fan of it from the beginning, but even I had more respect for the series than this movie did.\n\nAnyone notice that throughout the film there's this certain chemistry between Fred and Velma. So I thought, that's weird, I always thought Fred and Daphne had a thing going for them. Then, without a second to spare, the whole romantic chemistry blew up in my face. At the end Fred went with Daphne, and Velma went to some loser that doesn't matter. OK, what's up with that, honestly?\n\nThat was my first biggest problem. My number one reason for despising this flick is a little pup named Scrappy. I've seen a couple of episodes with this son of a devil dog. I hated him, always have hated him, and always will HATE him! I thought surely they wouldn't be dumb enough to bring him into the story. Sure enough, they did, and from then on this became on of my most hated movies of all time.\n\nThe only credit I give to this film is that the leading actors did a good job with their characters, specially Shaggy.\n\n1/2/**** stars\n\nScooby-Doo (2002): Rated PG for rude humor, some language and scary images"

It was all there, but some moviegoers failed to recognize it.\n\nI highly suggest that everyone that made this false accusation tune into Cartoon Network sometime soon and rewatch an episode of Scooby Doo. Pay close attention to this beloved toon of your childhood that entertained you so much because somewhere in the growing up process you forgot it.\n\n(Also give Sarah Michelle Gellar a break she didn't have as many famous sayings and as interesting a character to work with.

It isn't as bad as Changing Lanes, but it could give it a run for it's money. If not for my love the Scooby-Doo cartoon, I would have walked out after about 30 minutes. And I have never walked out of a movie in my life. The only other movie i was ever tempted to walk out of was Changing Lanes. This movie has what I like to call \"Street Fighter Syndrome.\" What is Street Fighter Syndrome, you ask? I'll tell you. Street Fighter Syndrome is when developing a film of a popular staple of pop-culture and you take the time to cast people who look perfect as the characters, but don't give any thought at all to things such as plot, a good script, good directing and all that other unimportant stuff. (sarcasm) There are barely a handful of good things about this movie. The first 5 minutes are good, but it takes a nosedive soon after. Matthew Lilliard, Linda Cardellini, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and even Freddie Prinze Jr. are all good as Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred. The CG Scooby is even pretty impressive. Sarah Michelle Gellar looks very hot as Daphne. Even Velma is hot. Other than that, this movie has no possible redeeming values. The plot seems like it was written by Shaggy himself. You might like this if YOU'VE NEVER SEEN AN EPISODE OF THE CARTOON, you are a little kid, or you are like Shaggy himself. (\"Mary Jane is like my favorite name of all time.\" A direct quote from the movie. I AM NOT LYING.) But if you were like me, someone who had high hopes after many hours spent watching the cartoons, I hate to burst your bubble. If you want to see a good, funny movie go see Undercover Brother."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there's one thing that Hollywood likes to do it's to get a hold of something that's popular and try to milk as much money out of it as possible. Scooby-Doo is an unfortunate case of this where Warner Bro's rook one of television's most recognisable animated icons and turned him into a CGI monstrosity.\n\nThe film begins with the entire team disbanding due to personal conflicts. However this is somewhat undermined when they're all back together again two scenes later where they are reformed by Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) to investigate his amusement park on Spooky Island. Does the fact that the characters split up have any real difference on their dynamic? Not really. Every so often the characters will act insecure about themselves with Daphne wanting to be independent more and Velma not wanting to get picked last, but other than that there is no real difference on their dynamic.\n\nFor the most part the cast is pretty bland. Whilst Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar and Lynda Cardellini all look like their respective members of the scooby gang, they don't really get much to work with due to the script turning them into nothing more then very dull caricatures with extremely exaggerated insecurity issues that seem to come out of nowhere. On top of this the talents of Rowan Atkinson and Isla Fisher are also wasted also being given nothing in the film to do. The only exception in this cast is Matthew Lillard who matches the animated Shaggy in every way from his energetic movement to his great imitation of the green shirted stoner.\n\nAlso Scooby-Doo himself isn't dreadful. The voice factor Neil Fanning who plays him does get Scoobies voice spot on. Also just like Shaggy, Scooby is written with the same kind of stupidity and zaniness as his animated counterpart. But unfortunately all this is ruined by the ugly CGI. Whilst the animators did go through decent effort to bring the fast paced movements from the animated series to the live action adaptation, the CGI model of him just makes it unpleasant to watch. In contrast to the lovable 2D design, this CGI counterpart ends up looking as scary as the monsters that they were supposed to be fighting in the film.\n\nAlthough the film's biggest downfalls is it doesn't know what kind of film it wanted to be. According to Sarah Michelle Gellar, when she was cast in the film it was originally written to be a darker PG-13 comedy but it was changed to be family friendly after the casting. This unfortunately shows in the film quite often with the humour constantly shifting tones from family friendly gross-out humour like Scooby and Shaggy having a farting contest to stoner references like Shaggy falling in love with a girl called Mary Jane. Sometimes it's extremely mean spirited with Scooby at one point punching Fred in the face very violently whilst at others it's the child friendly slapstick with the standard over the top chases that Scooby Doo is known for. The film throws so many different styles at us, possibly in the attempt to appeal to all audiences, that it lacks any consistent tone.\n\nWhilst not the worst remake of a classic TV show that's come out (particularly considering the likes of Transformers and Smurfs that have come out since), this remake of Scooby-Doo remains a disappointment. It's not awful with some occasional laughs and it does have a decent soundtrack. But if you want to enjoy Scooby-Doo you'd be better off enjoying him on the silver screen"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was warned this film was disappointing, but nothing could really prepare me for how bad it was. Simply put this just could have been a lot better (and I am a fan of the cartoon too).\n\nFirstly it seems to be designed from a very narrow standpoint. People that loved the normal crew but hated Scrappy Doo may be just about catered for. However I can't help but feel the only characters accurate to the TV series was Scooby and Shaggy. I personally would have much rather seen the film simply about those two but they decided to include all the others, including Scrappy who is made a humiliating joke of on several occasions rather then being included in the crew. If the makers really hated the Scrappy cartoons (I seem to remember them being pretty successful at the time so obviously not everyone agrees with them) they should have just forgotten about him. If I had done this I would have happily forgotten about all but Shaggy and Scooby.\n\nWhile Scrappy is made to look pathetic, the other characters comical flaws are somewhat ironed out. Daphne has learnt to do martial arts (no surprise with her being played by Sarah \"Buffy\" Michelle Gellar), Velma is far less plain then she should be (putting stupid glasses on a really attractive woman is a very poor movie clich\u00e9 that never worked). Fred actually comes out even more cardboard then in the cartoons. However he does suddenly become an adept combatant with a chain near the end, which seems somewhat out of character.\n\nThe film seems undecided about how much is realism and how much is cartoon style. Switching from parody of cartoon events to attempts at originality and back like you're watching two different movies and switching channels. The soundtrack is also similarly confused, sounding like an awkward cartoon parody at some points and virtually empty at others. The plot is predictable, as are the jokes (and they are pretty slow to come too). Even the special effects are poor and unimaginative.\n\nThe plot...well the less said about that the better. You can see what they've tried to do with it, and frankly that was a bad idea to start with. It's a bad idea done badly. The plot holes would be forgivable in this kind of movie were it not for all the other flaws. The attempts to inflict Hollywood morality (The \"perfect\" people are totally perfect and the \"freaks\" should be ridiculed and laughed at) ruins most of what could have been good. All that is left are the two elements that were central and safe from being messed with: Scooby and Shaggy.\n\nOf the cast the only one I could say did a good performance is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar did pretty well too, but her character was ruined by the scripts and she was given way too much screen time for the character (obviously she was going to be a big draw, so you can see why they did that, the same with the kick boxing).\n\nIf you want to see this kind of film, but done well I'd recommend the new\n\nAustin Powers movie. True it's less of a family movie, but its pretty close in style to Scooby Doo, the only difference being that you will probably enjoy Austin Powers even if you find it somewhat disposable. If you want to see a modern parody of Scooby Doo (with no Scrappy at all btw) I'd suggest downloading the special the cartoon network did called \"The Scooby Doo project\".\n\nUnfortunately this is the kind of film most people will see regardless of what others say simply for curiosity (that's why I'm here). So unfortunately a sequel is highly likely. But you never know, if they just keep it with Scooby and Shaggy it could be very good. The odd brief moment of the two of them in this film showed an amount of promise."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a movie that makes Casper look like Chinatown by comparison, there is very little I can think to say other than this might be the most horrifying (in a bad way) kids' movie ever made. The movie combines all the worst qualities of not only Casper, but also Inspector Gadget (the stunningly base commercialism) and, yes, Howard the Duck. Am I the only one who can't help seeing the similarities here? A human-like, talking animal hero helps his friends save the world from invading monsters.... I thought of old Howard instantly the first time I set eyes on these CGI beasties. There's even a stunningly misplaced rock concert scene - with Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath lip-synching horribly. (Though I suppose we should be grateful for small favors in that McGrath isn't singing with Scooby.)\n\nThis movie, stopping in theaters on its way from the cartoon screen to a Six Flags near you, is astonishingly crass in how every scene seems designed solely for the purpose of creating a theme-park attraction: the obligatory stunt show (with personal 4-wheel mini dune buggys), the theme restaurant, the beach resort area, the horror-themed amusement park rides (I stopped counting how many different rides were momentarily shown), the nightclub with demon-head disco ball, etc. In truth, the \"sets\" looked precisely like they were designed to be easily and perfectly (not to mention cheaply) replicated for live attractions. And I couldn't help thinking that the main reason the effects weren't better (they really are not very good) is that good effects would be harder to convert to live shows.\n\nAs for the \"plot,\" anyone who can't identify the real villain (and I don't mean the filmmakers, thought that's true too) by the end of his first scene isn't trying very hard. And for a supposed kids' movie, it's hard to find a scene that doesn't seem to strain itself trying to add something that's decidedly NOT for kids under 10. I tried to think of the last movie rated under PG-13 that was this bad; it's EASILY sub-Grinch (that movie, for all its faults, had at least a much more substantial level of craftsmanship going for it); Inspector Gadget is probably the last PG movie I could think of that sunk to this level. Rowan Atkinson is in this movie for no particular reason; his abilities aren't remotely hinted at, and ten thousand actors could have each given an identical performance.\n\nThe theater where I saw this was populated mostly with kids under 8 and their parents; if the adults hadn't been restraining the kids from running around, I doubt that the movie could have held their attention very long. (And the occasional crying from smaller kids was hard to miss.)\n\nI felt like I'd been trapped in a Chuck E. Cheese run by Stalin. For what it's worth, only the efforts of Lillard and, to a lesser extent, Cardellini keep this movie from being a rock-bottom 1 - which I reserve for only the worst movie or two of the year.\n\n2 of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll be honest and admit that I only made it about 20-25 minutes into this movie before I gave up. That's right, if I'd been in the theater, I'd have walked out! I almost wish that I had been, because pressing \"Stop\" wasn't nearly as satisfying as storming out would have been. I still stormed out of the room, but that just wasn't the same.\n\nI grew up watching the cartoon, always enjoyed it, and even though I don't have much use for it as an adult, I still think more highly of it than of 90% of the other cartoons that I grew up with. Now, I don't particularly think that it deserves a movie, but I sat down to watch it with an open mind, hoping that it might at least revive pleasant memories of the TV show. Wrong!\n\nSight gags that work for an animated cartoon just aren't enough to justify an entire movie, yet that seems to be just what they were attempting with this film. Worse still, they just don't work without the animation. Stupid, unlikely, piano-from-the-sky type antics are ok when Wile E. Coyote is on screen, but not when a real actor is dodging them. And when I see a real person running from a ghost, I expect the ghost to be truly frightening, not look like a guy in a three dollar Halloween costume. They probably thought they were being true to the original show, where you could always tell that the bad guys weren't real ghosts. But then the characters were animated, so you could pretend that they were stupid enough to fall for it. With a real person, though, no one can suspend disbelief enough to imagine them truly being scared by that. Then again, it's hard to suspend disbelief enough to believe anybody would make this movie and think that it was good.\n\nAnyway, I gave it a 2 instead of a 1, but only because 5-year-olds might be able to enjoy it. Provided they aren't particularly discriminating. And even to them, I would point out that they can still catch reruns of the original show for free."

        "review_detailed_main": "Originally, 'Scooby-Doo (2002)' was set to be much more mature, commenting on the tropes of the television show that its now (young) adult audience had grown up with. While I don't think that James Gunn's (yes, that James Gunn's) original script should have been brought to the big screen in all its initially R-rated 'glory', it is a shame that so much of it is so heavily neutered, considering that its remnants of subversive satire are by far its most successful aspects. The final result, then, is a strange mix of the tongue-in-cheek, slightly cheeky and, sometimes, too 'edgy' for its own good and the supposedly kid-friendly, frankly infantile and altogether far less successful. This leads to some strange moments, such as a brief but noticeable sight-gag implying that Shaggy and Scooby are using the Mystery Machine as a 'smoke house' - which is a remnant of Shaggy literally being a stoner in the original screenplay - and a moment in which Fred, whilst in Daphne's body (due to a body-switching fiasco), makes a leery and cringe-worthy comment about being able to look at himself, as Daphne, naked while peering down his/ her top - which is a holdover, again, from the much more raunchy original screenplay. Still, not all is lost in translation. The characters are represented, generally, as the antithesis of what they were in the television show - or, at least, that's the intention. Fred, especially, is brought to life as a self-obsessed but ultimately somewhat incompetent 'leader' and his is probably the most successful characterisation. Daphne is represented as more of a capable, eventually 'kick-ass' character and, ultimately, is the one who 'saves the day', so to speak. While the casting of 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1996 - 2003)' star Sarah Michelle Gellar is an inspired way of trying to bolster this interpretation, much of her bumbling persona comes across as counter-intuitive and, somewhat, misses the mark. Velma is represented as the sort of repressed, insecure 'brains behind it all' who's tired of not being given the spotlight, but her character ultimately feels very 'standard' in terms of subversion - even if she is portrayed well. Perhaps the least changed character is Shaggy (because the Studio rightfully 'chickened out' of putting a glassy-eyed drug-addict in a leading role of a children's film) but, ironically, he is the most entertaining thanks to the pitch-perfect casting of Mathew Lillard; he's an absolute treat and it's a joy every time he's on-screen, as he brings his cartoon character to life and acts opposite his CGI co-star with an energetic, unembarrassed vigour. Speaking of Scooby, he's actually quite entertaining but the effects used to render him are somewhat dated; plus, he's the source of most of the 'kiddy', yet strangely crass, humour in the flick. Still, you believe he's there thanks to the pretty excellent interaction with his fellow cast members. To be fair, the feature does do a good job of feeling like a live-action 'cartoon', thanks to its slapstick set-pieces and colourful set-design. Many of its most cartoony moments are actually quite enjoyable to watch, even if they sometimes cross the line into straight up silly territory. The picture as a whole is a decent experience, one that's intermittently entertaining but usually just average. It stumbles slightly whenever its two mission-statements tug against each other too hard, often feeling like a film of two minds that perhaps should have taken a steadier step in either direction. Still, I think I prefer a piece that tries something different to one that plays it completely safe; that's what makes one this quite charming. It's not great, though, even if it perhaps could have been. It's always a relatively good time, however, and there are even a few chuckles here and there. In the end, it really is Mathew Lillard that makes it. 5/10"

The storyline follows the gang deciding to breakup after they don't feel they are equally getting credit for their crime fighting abilities. When things seem to be going astray they reluctantly get back together to try and solve one more major case. This movie is directed by Raja Gosnell (Big Mamas House) and stars Matthew Lillard (Scream), Freddie Prinze Jr. (She's all That), Linda Cardellini (Avengers), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) and Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers). The casting for this is excellent and they are put in some fun and entertaining scenarios. The writing for Shaggy and Scooby is excellent but the entire cast portrays their characters well. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. The CGI was really good and the film is actually pretty solid until the very end, then the final villain and CGI gets out of control and the movie falls apart. Overall this is an entertaining picture worth a viewing but I will say the sequel is better than this film. I'd score this a 5/10."

Not to give the film away. I can promise you that you will leave the cinema angry that they have betrayed the very basics of what Scooby is. This is a prime example of an over thought film. I was impressed with the Scooby and shaggy combo and convinced by the special effects but that is it. Anybody who is in their mid 20's grew up on Scooby snacks and a weird affection for the female characters (maybe only me then). I can't really complain as Spiderman, batman and superman (the three things I decided to be when I was four) have all been well done films.

        "review_detailed_main": "A sincere effort to have some fun with the old cartoon series, but the movie encounters some of the all-too-common problems of these cartoon-to-live-action remake movies. Making the leap from 2-D animation to 3-D reality is awkward at best, and proper casting can make the movie sink or swim. Also, it's difficult to point at just who your target audience is.\n\nScooby Doo was a great cartoon. The writing was clever, the characters were lovable, the action continuous, the \"mysteries\" fun (and easy) to solve, and the comic-chase routine was predictable but fun in a \"3 Stooges\" type way. It's apparent that the writer, director, and the cast all had fond memories of the show as well, and had a party doing this movie.\n\nMatthew Lillard and Linda Cardinelli breathe life into Shaggy and Velma so well, you'd swear these characters returned from your childhood memories. Not only do they look like their animated counterparts, but they capture the nuances of those characters (right down to Shaggy's laugh and Velma's nasally voice) as well. Many actors have tried to bring cartoon characters to live action movies; few have accomplished it as well as Lillard and Cardinelli did here. The animation of Scooby is respectable: he looks slightly different, but enough the same that it works. The CGI movements are well done, and fit his \"personality.\"\n\nHowever, Freddie Prinze and Sarah Michelle Gellar were miscast. Prinze just mugs for the camera, and Gellar looks more like she's doing a Buffy episode, complete with over-the-top fight scenes. Neither one looks or acts at all like their character (to their credit, both actors improved in the sequel).\n\nAlso, the movie tries to fill in gaps of where the gang has been, which just bogs down the story. There are some scenes far more scary than the original series would ever delve into, such as disembodied spirits being imprisoned, mind control, zombies, etc. If the target demographic was small children, these elements were too strong. In other ways, too, it strays from the theme of the old cartoon series.\n\nOn the positive side, the movie is cleverly written, although the plot is a little too complex for children to follow. There are good gags, some that kids would understand, and others for an older audience. Outside of the scary scenes, the movie has a lot of good natured silliness. The movie does not disappoint with the humorous mystery solution surprise (especially funny for fans of the original cartoon).\n\nIf you can overlook the movie's weaknesses, it should still be a decent watch for some goofy and nostalgic fun. The sequel, however, is a little more consistent with the theme of the original cartoon."

The film might be most enjoyed by children, if they understand Scooby already. However, in order to enjoy the film as an adult, it has to be seen in hi-def: you either have to be high or deaf!\n\nMost of the acting is pretty terrible. It was pretty much the ending of Freddie Prinze's acting career, as he's almost unknown in 2018. The writing was so-so as Hanna Barbera could've done better. The sets and costumes were honestly the best part.\n\nWith all the negatives, it still had a theatrical sequel and two made for TV sequels. Jay and Silent Bob did a better job satirizing Scooby in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."

I entered\n\nthe theater with a resounding *gulp* to prepare myself for the trial I\n\nwas about to endure. And lo and behold! Much to my rather\n\npleasant surprise, Scooby Doo was a helluva lot of fun. An\n\namiable, well meaning, largely juvenile film, Scooby Doo retains\n\nmuch of the grace that the original show engendered while adding\n\na dose of what I like the call the \"Brady Bunch Movie\" syndrome.\n\nThe Brady Bunch Movie was an exercise in self awareness, a film\n\nthat knew it was based on an awkward and fatally corny show and\n\nchose to good naturedly poke fun at that very fact. Scooby Doo\n\ndoes the same thing. And the actors are spot on. Matthew Lillard,\n\nin particular, is fantastic as Shaggy, the stoner cum beatnik cum\n\nfood junkie. And Sarah Michelle Gellar is alot of fun as the\n\neminently stupid Daphne who gives use Buffy fans a funny bit of\n\nBuffy action as well.\n\nGo and see this movie and put your brain in neutral; your inner\n\nchild will appreciate it."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I was watching Scooby Doo I could not help but think of another, very similar film I had seen a few years ago called Spy Kids. Now the only two reasons for remembering that one were that 1) it sucked and 2) it was directed by one of my favorite directors, called Robert Rodriguez. Where Spy Kids failed though, I saw Scooby Doo succeed. Not only was the film funny, due mostly to the effort the computer animated Scoobster and his voice (Mr. Neil Fanning), but it also made you feel happy. I thought the film was very charming and I was really relieved that there were no stupid or awkward scenes in the film (as I'd feared). This is mostly due (in my opinion) to the actors, who were very well cast and fitted their roles like a fresh set of gloves (by the way: I never seem to get tired of seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar playing a spoiled girl, or is it that I can't get tired of seeing her PERIOD?).\n\nI must admit that I needed a bit of time to get accustomed to the \u0091groove' of the film, but that does not mean I did not enjoy the whole product. And of course not everything was good in this film! I personally felt that Fred (die Prinze Jr.) was way too gay in the beginning and I thought that maybe due to Shaggy's way of behavior the film would have been better if placed in the 70's. But that is truly personal. Fans of the TV series for instance, might agree on these two points but come and introduce a whole list filled with criticism that could reach from the U.S.A. to Nippon whereas others would say: \u0091Scooby sucked' and yet others would say: \u0091Scooby rocked'. Despite all that, it is my opinion that younger children will enjoy this film and I even think that if you are 22 (like I am), you have an open mind and just want to be entertained (without any desire to think), you just might like this film. I won't watch Scooby Doo 2 in the cinema because although this film was fun, it wasn't that much fun. I'll wait for the rental instead.\n\n7 out of 10\n\np.s.: as far as the `What's up with the cleavage?' remarks go, have any of you walked on the street lately and looked around? It's hard to see any girl who is as buttoned up as Velma and Daphne these days."

Quite few jokes were raunchy as well as Characters behaviors. But thats what made this movie enjoyable. I don't think back when it came out or even now kids aged 11 or under would really understand alot of what is going on in the movie.\n\nBack to the review. The action is good, the comedy is great, the actors are all awesome in there roles, and the storyline is pretty engaging and found the pacing to be good. Also for a movie thats 18 years old still looks great today maybe even better then some of the other movies similiar to this type of content.\n\nOverall definitely would recommend this movie to older teens to younger adult.

By the way, the three of us agreed that \u0096 unless he wasn't necessary for the final development of the story \u0096 the most annoying character in the movie would be that stupid dog (sorry, fans)!

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most highly anticipated releases of 2002, the live-action version of 'Scooby Doo' was grilled by the critics, and perhaps unfairly so. Credit must go to the casting director who picked the perfect cast to portray Fred, Velma, Daphne, and especially Shaggy. Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy is dead-on, and he easily rescues any dull spots in the script. Linda Cardellini's Velma is also near perfect, and quite enjoyable as well as appealing. The computer generated Scooby-Doo is not half-bad, and the overall feeling of the movie is that great time and care was given to the special effects. Unfortunately, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze, Jr. fall flat as Daphne and Fred. Prinze, the king of bad movie choices, is particularly annoying. Their interpretations of the classic Hanna-Barbera characters are beefed up for this movie, and become tiresome. Sadly, British actor Rowan Atkinson (of 'Mr. Bean' fame) is totally wasted. His character never gets a chance to develop, which is a mystery within itself. While the plot could have been better, the film is executed very well. The Spooky Island atmosphere is eclectic and colorful, with an amazing amount of detail. While the script is not the greatest, the 86-minute flick does not let up for a minute. What makes the movie either appealing or pathetic is the fact that bathroom humor is sprinkled throughout the movie. It can be hysterically funny (Shaggy and Scooby-Doo's burping/farting contest is hysterical), but children who were expecting the cartoon humor will be caught offguard. Another plot screw-up is the idea of the five-some angrily splitting up in the beginning. The audience is fully aware that the group (dubbed 'Mystery, Inc.') will get back together to solve the mystery, so the first ten minutes of the movie is wasted as the viewer waits inpatiently for the group to reunite. If the movie bombed at the box office, is does not seem to matter, since 'Scooby-Doo 2' is due for a 2004 release. Hopefully, the writers will tie up some loose ends (and replace Prinze), and make the next installment of what looks to be an ongoing series, better than the first."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mystery Inc. gang should have remained in the drawn and animated world, because this live action event did not turn out all that great. Why? Well, because the CGI was just horrible and did the movie or the Scooby Doo franchise no justice at all.\n\nWhile the storyline was right at home in the typical and beloved Scooby Doo universe, the live action thing was a difficult pill to swallow. And I believe that the movie would have fared better with an entirely unknown cast list. It is really difficult to look at the actors and actresses who were in the movie with a proper light after having witnessed this abysmal movie.\n\nThat being said, it should also be said that that above ramblings is given from an adult's point of view. If you are a child, then this movie will be entertaining, especially if you love the Scooby Doo cartoons.\n\nAnd this movie is of course aimed for a young audience. I sat down to watch it as I grew up with the Hanna-Barbera cartoons on TV. So I wanted to see just how the transition from drawn animation to live action turned out.\n\n\"Scooby Doo\" as a live action movie is somewhat of an acquired taste. Personally, I plan to keep my memories of Scooby Doo to the Saturday morning cartoons."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed. You walk into this film with a level of expectancy. You want to see the same characters, stories, and clich\u00e9d moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do. The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clich\u00e9d moments are there in full force. Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film. As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon. It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film. There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player. Yet, I was expecting this. So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect. Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.\n\nTo begin, the actors. I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard. Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well. Here we have some \"C\" level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time. It just seemed a bit jumbled to me. Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner. Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me. He should have been used so much more to his potential. He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.\n\nOutside of the acting, there isn't much else going on. Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons. Not much originality was brought into this film, while it felt like the money that should have gone to the creative department, was spent instead on sub-par CGI. Scooby looked horrible. I believe there was one instance where I could literally see right through him. Then, you have these un-storied creatures that look like Donnie Darko's rejects. Coupled with an annoying Scrappy-Doo. There was potential in the CGI, but it seemed as if they low-balled and went with cheap CGI to appease the smaller child audiences. The jokes needed to be planted deeper into the series. I remember watching The Brady Bunch movie and laughing because the jokes just seemed to play off the taboo of the series. I believe more focus on this with the Scooby-Doo movie would have raised this review another notch.\n\nOverall, I felt cheap after watching this film. It wasn't a horrible film (though there was quite a bit of poor graphics and acting) because it gave you what you wanted when you walked in. It gave you a mystery, the clich\u00e9d and overused structure of the original series, and that final moment when the true villain is revealed. It followed a structure that I wanted, and I am \"ok\" with that for this film. Normally, I would have asked for better, but there are some cartoons that do not need their internal structure tampered with. Scooby-Doo was worth the one viewing, but I cannot say that I will ever be pleased to see it again. The fact that there was the horrendous farting contest in the center of the film destroyed the entire experience for me. That was the kind of humor I was not prepared for, nor did I feel it best represented the series. The Mark McGrath cameo also did it in for me, but that my friend \u0085 well \u0085 is another story. If you have never seen this film I suggest it once, but I do not feel that it needs a second viewing. Scooby-Doo is alive, but in an animated version that continues to create laughter and creativity \u0085 unlike this shoddy film.\n\nGrade: *** out of *****"

Waaaay too hot. But it's Matthew Lillard as Shaggy who steals the show. In looks, mannerisms and voice it's as if the cartoon came to life. Scooby is rendered somewhere in between cartoon and photo real, and though the effects haven't aged particularly well, it works here.\n\nOverall it's a colorful and breezy movie, but unfortunately the laughs are few and things drag when Shaggy and Scooby aren't on screen."

Plus points go to Matthew Lillard for, like, his spot-on Shaggy and cutie Cardellini as Velma. The CG Scooby works in a doesn't-do-much kinda way, and the movie has a suitably cartoonish look and throws in a couple of nice nods to the original show, but it all seems to have been put together without any real feeling.\n\nSaying that this is better than The Flintstones is like comparing Britney to Christina Aguilera.

        "review_detailed_main": "First off, I would like to begin this by saying I watched and somewhat enjoyed the cheesy 70's cartoon this film is based on. \"Scooby-Doo\" itself is not a bad film, but not a great one either. I personally do not think this film will appeal to anyone who never watched the cartoon. That is why I think Roger Ebert had such a difficult time reviewing \"Scooby-Doo\". That is also why I think people who hated the movie most likely never watched the cartoon. I admit that I thought \"Scooby-Doo\" would not amount to much either, but if you sit down and actually watch it, fun will be had.\n\nI think that what people do not understand about \"Scooby-Doo\", is that it is intentionally campy. Part of the fun of watching the cartoon was being able to accept the camp humor and cheesy plot lines. The acting in the movie is terrible as well, but it was done that way because that is what most films and cartoons that were popular at that time were like. What \"Scooby-Doo\" is trying to do is to recapture that 70's camp.\n\nSpeaking of the camp, the special effects in the movie are so laughably bad, that you can not help but praise them. The films humor consists mostly of burping/farting jokes and other slapstick. As I already mentioned, the acting isn't very good either. In fact, most of the actors seem seriously miscast, with the exception of Matthew Lillard, who plays Shaggy. Not only does he look the part, but he sounds and acts like him too. The same goes to Linda Cardellini, who plays Velma.\n\nNow I was born in 1985, which was nearly a decade after the cartoon was in its prime. I can't say that when I was younger, that I fully understood everything about this cartoon. I'm 17 now, and I have heard a lot about the cartoon that may change anyone's viewing of it, even my own. The characters are a lot different in the movie than they were in the cartoon. But I guess that was part of being able to successfully bring the characters to the big screen. Fred is no longer the all-out jock he once was, Daphne seems a lot dumber and less of a snob, Velma actually displays emotions, but Shaggy and Scooby are just the same.\n\nTo clear some things up, Shaggy and Scooby are potheads. Why do you think they are so hungry all the time? Also why do you think Shaggy said that he likes the name \"Mary Jane\" so much? The report of one particular deleted scene with Velma getting drunk and singing a love song to Daphne should also give a hint to her sexual orientation. Lastly, Fred and Daphne are dating. (This fact is helped along by the news that Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar are married in real life.)\n\nP.S.: You also won't want to miss the performance by Sugar Ray or miss the countless OutKast beats playing in the background either."

        "review_detailed_main": "... about as well as a soggy potato chip.\n\nLet's start with the positives. Linda Cardellini is great as Velma and Matthew Lillard is as has been said uncannily spot-on as shaggy. The Scooby CGI isn't half-bad, for the period. The Scrappy-Do treatment is incredibly satisfying for adults who found him an annoying Mary Sue.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne and her now-husband Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred just don't cut it, acting-wise, and this dampers the chemistry of Mystery, Inc. pretty badly. And the script doesn't make enough clever use of Scooby and Shaggy to really show off their chemistry.\n\nUltimately the film's problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be a \"wink-wink\" to adults who remember the show fondly or kiddie fare for the little tykes. It tries to do both and comes up flat. To this end, some of the racier innuendos were omitted from the final cut, though they wouldn't have redeemed the movie had they remained: they weren't very subtle or pertinent.\n\nThe movie needed a stronger Daphne and Fred, as well as a more determined showcasing of the \"nuts and bolts\" of the original series, with self-referential, double-layered humor. That's a pretty tall order, but it shouldn't be impossible working on the kind of predictable template Scooby Doo offers. Actually, it's the only way a movie based on such a franchise could possibly work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Scooby-Doo is mercifully short - at only 83 minutes - which is probably the best thing that can be said about it. Whatever the director and producers were trying to achieve by bringing Hanna-Barbera's classic cartoon to life, it's fairly safe to say they failed. Despite excellent character interpretations by Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini as Shaggy and Velma, the fleshing out of the Mystery Inc. team is disappointingly shallow. As is the irritating mission of self-discovery and angst each character goes through before discovering that (surprise, surprise) teamwork is best.\n\nThe film could be forgiven many of its foibles if only it was rib-ticklingly hilarious. Unfortunately it suffers from trying to cater both to a young audience, and also to adults who fondly remember the cartoon from their childhood days. Rowan Atkinson is cringingly unfunny as the strange proprietor of Spooky Island amusement park, and surely even kids are by now impervious to fart and snot jokes. However, the sequence inside the spooky abandoned castle raises a few hearty chuckles.\n\nThe trademark unlikeliness of the situations Mystery Inc. got themselves into in the cartoon doesn't transfer well into realism. The plot, which has a number of large holes, concerns the mysterious change in behaviour of college students who are holidaying at the resort of Spooky Island. And, it has to be admitted, that thanks to some great sets and the wonders of CGI, the resort looks like a pretty cool place to spend a vacation. The construction of the theme park has awakened some ancient (and quite scary, considering the PG-rating) monsters, so it's up to the team to unmask the villain and save the world. But the best way of saving yourself is to avoid watching this movie."

As a result, this inevitable feature-length incarnation of the eponymous Great Dane and his Mystery Inc. supporting cast has finally hit the big screen. Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini), and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) have suddenly split up after solving a case in a factory that manufactures Pamela Anderson dolls \u0096 insert your own joke \u0096 simply because Fred takes all the accolades for their accomplishments. However, they're instantly reunited after being summoned individually to the same destination: a haunted house-themed amusement park called Spooky Island. Requesting their services is park owner Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson), who has cause for alarm after discovering that someone, or something, is turning his college-age clientele into zombies. Disneyland, it's not.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo,\" directed by Raja Gosnell, is an uninspired mongrel that proves Hollywood still hasn't learned from its past mistakes in converting half-hour cartoons to megaplex fodder, the recent flops \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" and \"Josie and the Pussycats\" notwithstanding. (Nor has it gotten the hint that Prinze and Lillard should not work together again following the debacle that was \"Wing Commander.\") The inferiority of screenwriter James Gunn's lifeless mystery plot is clearly evident, it has to be camouflaged with a combination of inane dialogue, overuse of CGI, and a truly atrocious ending.\n\nThe task at hand is so crucial that Scooby and Shaggy find time on the side for an abundance of pot jokes and a lengthy farting contest. Yes, a farting contest. If Mystery Inc. can regularly afford to partake in such nonsense in between solving crimes, then, by God, I want their jobs. There is also a fair amount of cleavage on display courtesy of nearly every female in the picture from the extras to our heroines. Oh boy, flatulence competitions, drug humor, and big breasts. Always the reliable staples of quality family entertainment. Things sure have changed in the course of three decades, haven't they?\n\nIf there's anything positive that surfaces from this dreck, it's the fact that Lillard is dead-on with Shaggy's voice and goofy mannerisms. On the other hand, Prinze has the looks and charisma of a Ken doll as the egotistic Fred. Gellar and Cardellini portray whiny, two-dimensional personalities: Daphne continuously complains about being the damsel in distress while knocking out hulking bodybuilders, and Velma continuously acts jealous of Fred. It's a shame that Atkinson, who can easily act circles around this cast, receives less screen time than an insignificant voodoo master (Miguel A. Nunez, Jr., who's currently starring in another stinker, \"Juwanna Mann\"). The filmmakers' only concern seemed to regard how good the cast looked on screen. There's no reason at all to care about any of these characters.\n\nHowever, the treatment of the human cast is a milquetoast in contrast to Scooby's role. Something is definitely amiss when the famous namesake of a summer blockbuster movie does little more than act as Shaggy's computer-animated armpiece while failing to believably blend in with any of his surroundings. The best example of a film combining cartoon characters with real-life environments remains \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" And that was 14 years ago.\n\nWhile immortalizing pop culture phenomena worked for \"Spider-Man,\" it doesn't even come close here. Just labeling \"Scooby-Doo\" a pop culture phenomenon is absurd. It doesn't take Mystery Inc. to decipher why this picture is such a disaster. But to those titillated by lousy storytelling coupled with unfunny pot and potty humor, this dud's for you. 3/10"

I mean it is unbelievably bad, almost like they grafted in images from the original Castle Wolfenstein game.\n\nAs a result every time a human being interacted with a monster or Scooby it just looked ridiculous. It felt like the actor was interacting with the air. I would have been better by far to simply have had costumes and make up.\n\nThe unfortunate part is this overshadowed everything else, even the good things, like Lillard's near perfect Shaggy."

Plus I think that the CG dog kinda spoiled the whole experience even further.\n\nAnyways, the plot is pretty lame and the acting is quite poor. There doesn't seem to be any redeeming qualities about this title, with the exception of Daphne's gorgeous body.\n\nHollywood needs to adopt a \"Live and Let Die\" mentality and just stop remaking old shows that don't transfer well onto the silver screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating-3/10\n\nYes, I have given this movie the highest kind of 3/10 and that really shows this film is bad, but actually somehow a strong kind of bad. Scooby-Doo the movie is really not all that great and suffers greatly as it is basically created so only kids can truly enjoy it, and kids might not anyway. Adults be foreworn, this is not a funny movie and not that well done, fun time but definitely not good whatsoever.\n\nThe cast of the movie seem to have a great time and the characters do work well, only problem is it isn't acted well and stars such as Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar don't contribute enough or much at all to the cause. On a positive note I felt Matthew Lillard does well as Shaggy and his crazy feel is pretty nice to see not to mention the spot on voice he does in which he fits into the role well. I quite liked Rowan Atkinson's role in the movie, he isn't in it near enough but he does what you would expect of him, just gets brought down with the film itself.\n\nRaja Gosnell directs this just a little too fast and makes it feel too much like he asked some kids to help out, yet again only for kids this movie. The writing Is also the same story as the direction and it is just not well done, it does a better job than the directing yet still comes up with nothing to save this. I think it just feels too much like a typical adventure film and one that I feel I have seen before, even if this is distinctly Scooby-Doo.\n\nI did like the setting of the film and the location is picked perfectly for what they are trying to do, only problem is that the effects are pretty poor(OK it was 2002, but still designed a bit silly). I felt the animated version of Scooby was OK and actually with this Scooby-Doo truly isn't the main character, although he figures in the majority of the plot. If you watch this or have watched it then the costumes are one of the main memorable things, they are truly ridiculous and although yes the same as the cartoon clothes, just look insane in real life.\n\nI said before about kids enjoying it and they should, the jokes are crude in a child's kind of way and the characters are fun I would think for maybe a 5 year old. There is no doubt the producers wanted a family friendly movie here but I must add that this does have some more extreme versions of the things encountered in the cartoons so for scared little children, this could actually give them a fright.\n\nSo overall Scooby-Doo is a passable piece of entertainment and one film I will quickly forget, it is just too lousy and stale to be a movie that succeeds and although this did do well at the box office, don't let it fool you. It even spawned a sequel but again I will say don't let it fool you, for too long movies have been made with no direction or edge and this is among them, fun I can say yes but an insult to your humour, well a definite yes on that one."

Freddie Prinze is a miscast, but Lillard, Cardellini, Atkinson, and Gellar all work or excel as their characters. The writing is sub par, the story is disjointed, and the characters feel watered down. Maybe they're just too tame.\n\nEither way, this movie isn't exactly a waste of time, but don't be concerned about falling asleep and missing something, and I definitely cannot recommend paying for it above the level of a dollar or two."

Linda Cardellini (Velma) was close, but Freddie Prinze Jr. (Fred) and Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne) were TERRIBLE!! In the cartoon, Daphne was not a totally winy, baby nor was such a snob. I think t hat Gellar forgot to act and was just herself. As for Freddie Prinze Jr., I have never cared for him. The ONLY thing that saved this film was Matthew Lillard, who was so true to the cartoon Shaggy that it is hard to tell them apart.\n\nAside from the acting, the script was really pathetic! With all of the Scooby Doo cartoon episodes, I would have thought they could have come up with a better script than the one that made it through! I think that there should have been many, many more rewrites!"

Real and breathing\u0085 except, that is, for the computer-generated dog. I shall quickly mention the old and new fans of this popular dated cartoon. I do not know how they felt about this movie; I am not one of them. I hate the cartoon for it is not only tersely repetitive but pointless, full of irritatingly repeating clishays and dreary old style animation, which I am NOT a fan of. I only spent money to see this movie out of the interest of how these characters were brought to life. That, and a passive interest in the actors Matthew Lillard and Sarah Michelle Gellar.\n\nThe Positive \u0096 Totally within the spirit of the animated Scooby Doo (I am reluctant to say I have watched the cartoon many a time), the characters, voices and actions, as well as those irritating memorable lines such as `like' or `Scooby Doo, where are you?' were readily repeated. The most amusing performance, or the one most to my liking, was Gellar as Velma. She gave a very intense feeling of a bitchy material girl which suites the actress quite well. One comment on her though, WHY WAS THE PURPLE SO DAMNED PINK?! Her clothes should have been more of a blue purple then a pink purple\u0085 those idiots. Ahm. Right. Sorry but that just really got to me.\n\nThe Negative \u0096 Ok, no offence, I too am a computer freak, but the computer animation mixed with reality in supposedly `living' creatures is reeeeealy starting to get to me in the latest high budget movies. I am so proud of the latest Planet of the Apes for NOT putting computer graphics everywhere were makeup and costume get a little complicated. It looks stupid and ridiculous and just does not fit into the movie realistically.\n\nIn conclusion, the movie was enjoyable, but breezy and thoughtless, which, after all, is what it should have been like."

        "review_detailed_main": "I may seem cynical, but I know a bad film when I see one and Scooby-Doo most certainly is dis-pleasant, insulting, and horrifically bad. It's so bad, I can't believe Warner Brothers wanted to pursue the idea of a live action film, with the main character being the only point of animation - who is made into an awkward CGI character. In a good film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, that wasn't directly made for kids, still carried on like a normal film without going over the top. This is a test of a child's supply of catoonish antics, and a parent's test of sanity.\n\nThe saddest thing about Scooby-Doo is it pretty much paved the way for films based on an animated Television series to be made into full length films with the main character(s) in CGI. Later there would be Garfield, The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear just to name a few. I can't say that I've liked any of those films because they are simply awkward to look at. Something about a clearly animated animal functioning in modern society doesn't look or feel right. It's strange, and extremely out of place. It makes The Country Bears look fitting, and while that was a pathetic film, I can at least give it more credit for trying to use costumed bears rather than relying on an embarrassing and lazy technique.\n\nMy main question is for the director and crew of this film; who was the target audience for this film? Was it fans of the original series, likely in their middle ages by now? Was it now younger fans who did or didn't watch the series today? Either way, it disappoints for anybody, except a child between the ages of three and six (pushing seven or eight) who are amused by poorly animated animals in the real world, loud sequences just to showcase the film's no-limits style, and dopey characters that hardly pass as detectives.\n\nAnother thing I've began to question about Scooby-Doo is how much of it is true entertainment? Think about it, 20% of the show is logic detective work, 30% of the time the dog is a one man show, and the remaining half is the gang running scared. What kind of detective is that? I hope one day we get a lost episode of Columbo where Peter Falk runs scared from a crime scene. Sure, I'm comparing and contrasting two classics, one meant for adults and one meant for children, but what it boils down to is that Scooby-Doo was a shell of what it could've been.\n\nThe one scene I remember loving as a kid was the intro at the factory where the Luna Ghost captures Daphne. I was entertained by it back then, and still was mildly amused when I watched it. Still, one good scene followed by eighty-one more minutes of nonsense isn't a good film in my book. I normally say right here where the film could've been good, but I don't know if there was a correct way to adapt such an odd idea to film properly without going over the top. When in doubt, leave it animated.\n\nStarring: Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini, Rowan Atkinson, Miguel A. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Jr., Isla Fisher, and with the voice of Neil Fanning. Directed by: Raja Gosnell."

Being a 38 year old male, I was in the prime age group of Scooby-Doo (the cartoon) when it began in the 60s.\n\nScooby was my favorite cartoon. Why? Because Scooby was so cool. He was funny; I laughed my head off.\n\nSo when I saw Scooby-Doo (the movie) last night, I laughed hard and loud! There were kids all around me looking at me as if I was nuts! But Scooby was Scooby. That's who I grew up with and that's who I loved in the movie!\n\nWhy only 3 stars instead of 4? Why only 7 out of 10?\n\nThree things about the movie bothered me: 1)The fact that the 'meddling kids' were doing so much fighting amongst themselves, 2)Shaggy and Velma had love interest (why does Hollywood insist everyone have a boyfriend or girlfriend?), and 3)the villain was such a disappointment. Many familiar with the original cartoon hated the character, and as a villain in this movie - it made matters worse.\n\nIf not for those three things, the movie would have played just like a standard 30 minutes episode with every silly hilarious cliche.\n\nSo the big rotund movie critic who sits in a balcony blasted this movie saying that \"myself..., even at a very young age, [discovered]that the world was filled with entertainment choices more stimulating than \"Scooby-Doo.\"\n\nWhat arrogance!\n\nHe was right in saying that if you aren't familiar with Scooby-Doo you wont get the joke. Very true. But to insult people who did grow up with Scooby-Doo?\n\nHe also wrote (after blasting the movie) \"I did like the dog. Scooby-Doo so thoroughly upstages the live actors that I cannot understand why Warner Bros. didn't just go ahead and make the whole movie animated.\"\n\nDuh!!!! The dog IS the movie and everyone else is support!!! Also, why make it animated when that's what's on the Cartoon Network every day?!?!?!\n\nCritics are pompous.\n\nIf you love Scooby-Doo - this is a fun movie!"

This movie is an absolute S-tier masterpiece- up there with The Godfather and Citizen Kane. The deep and complexly layered themes all come together so well to form this masterful psychological drama. With elements of thriller, comedy, drama, coming of age, and romance so masterfully combined. This melodramatic masterpiece is yet another incredible film produced by the wonderful early aughts. The costume design is immaculate, the storyline is riveting, the character arcs are all so masterfully crafted, and the plot twist is so masterfully foreshadowed and played out perfectly. But, in the end, this movies strongest strength is its incredible CGI. Christopher Nolan could never. Marvel could never. And Disney couldn't even come close. I will end off this review with this: if you don't watch this film and marvel at the cinematic masterpiece you just witnessed, I think you need to put yourself on a waitlist for mental evaluation because there's something seriously mentally wrong with you. This movie made my childhood and it always lifts me up even in my darkest days. I wish the whole world could experience my joy and delight upon watching this film. It should be studied as the blueprint for a fine film. Nothing- and I mean nothing- will ever top this masterpiece. It was robbed of a Grammy. Daphne, Velma, and Mary Jane are baddies. Instant classic."

Come on folks, these actors/actresses did not do the actual characters any justice. If not for Scooby and \"Shaggy\" this movie would be a total loss. Today's children will probably enjoy this one, but those of us from the \"old school\" will sit back and say What Happened? The only other good thing about this movie was the plot twist involving Scrappy. If you wanna see it wait for the video store to start renting it, otherwise don't waste your money."

Matthew Lillard was perfect ion his role as \"Shaggy,\" and the rest of the characters did a pretty good job as well. I have read several comments about this movie here on IMBD and I am baffled. Obviously people either don't have a sense of humor and have never seen the cartoon. Honestly, I cannot imagine why someone would \"walk out\" of the movie. This is great comedy that the whole family can enjoy. The movie makes you laugh without having to swear, make dirty jokes, or make obscene or sexual references/gestures.\n\nI gave this movie 9 out of 10, the reason I did not give this great movie a 10 was because I was not very satisfied with the ending."

The mystery gang clears up a mystery right at the beginning of the film, but end up breaking up essentially and going their own way. Well they are reunited on an island where they have another mystery to solve and it is of course rather wacky. The cast is good, they do in fact remind me of live action versions of the cartoon characters. However, Scooby is computer generated and looks a bit off. Granted this movie is a bit older now, but even back then I think they could have done a better job with the way he looked. I do not think a real dog would have done the trick though as they to often look off too when made to look as if they are talking. An interesting villain of choice in this one as it may not come as a total shock, it was still a funny surprise. There would be a sequel to this film that would not be nearly as successful which is not surprising in that this one may have performed well at the box office, but is generally hated by critics and a lot of the audiences too. Still, while it was no work of art as I have said, I still enjoyed it for what it was."

The dialogue and performances were not as entertaining nor as magical, in some places it was downright embarrassing and lame. While the basic storyline line and the predictable moral underpinning remained decent enough, the movie didn't really hold up well consistently. The sparkle just seemed to dull over time. Perhaps the nature of the animation industry has matured and grown up further or the audience requires more than just Saturday morning mind-numbing animated/live action adventure, or this reviewer has just grown or lost childlike innocence or Sarah Michelle Geller's Buffy persona has faded with time effectively allowing the more objective experience to wash over the screen. Regardless, animated movies, and live-action have progressed significantly in the past eight years. The bar is much higher. And this movie apparently hasn't held up well in the meantime.\n\n6/16/02 (8/10): As an adult without children, it may seem strange for me to make positive comments about this movie, but I enjoyed the mindless, fun entertainment. This movie is based on a cartoon and as such, its transformation onto the screen must be understood in that context. The characters and Scooby Doo appear as huge, live cartoon characters. The children in the theater audience as well as some of their parents seemed to enjoy the movie and some actually laughed. This movie really struck a cord with a early morning cartoon crowd which I believe is a great measure for success. I mean look at what the Sunday comics section is like. This movie version just glorifies the colorful, brilliance of live animation and what live actors can do when they try to imitate art, literally. Why can't critics judge this movie on the basis of what it really is? A cartoon of a million scenes. Thank goodness for live animators (I mean living and breathing actors and actresses)."

But when i got to watching it, I realized that that was completely how fred would be if he was real: egotistical, god's greatest gift in his mind, etc. sarah michelle gellar did an ok job, but that character just wasn't daphne. linda cardellini was good as velma, but again, that character just wasn't quite velma. matt lillard did great as shaggy, even with the voice. i hope casey kasem is proud of the good job matt did, since casey's shoes can't be too easy to fill. scott innes, the guy who voices scooby on all the new scooby movies that are coming out on video, is ok, but not great. didn't he ever watch scooby? if he did, he would know scooby doesn't start every word with an r. anyway, the plot was cute, some of the characters were true to the show, while others could have been a little better. the villain is hilarious. all in all, it's decent, even to a die hard scooby person like me. and by the way, the references to shaggy being a pothead are SOOOO not nice!"

Then I saw the other trailers and they didn't help either,but after finally seeing the movie in theaters and again on home video. I came to a conclusion that Scooby-Doo is not a bad movie but a clever send up to the original series. The premise is that the mystery Inc. gang have broken up and gone there separate ways, but they are reluctantly paired up again to solve a case at a theme park in titled Spooky Island, which is like if Tim Burton took over Disneyland and made it his own. Now I know the characters are not as fleshed as they would in normal movie but what really works is the adult humor. This movie was clearly made for adults who grew up with the series and older teenagers who want to see a clever satire to the old show. I gotta admit I am a fan of old-school scooby-doo,so it was nice to see a movie that makes fun of it's self and yet homages it at every length. Now there are some obviously dumb moments like the cross dressing scooby and pointless celebrity cameo by Pamela Anderson but there are some generally funny moments, like when Fred is transformed into a hip-hop zombie, it's actually really funny to see Fred act like even more a tool than he usually is. The drunk Velma scene was very funny and surprising. Hell, even the evil plan is pretty f'upd, there plan is to to suck the souls out of a person, so a monster can climb into to there body and take over them,which is actually pretty neat. Scooby-Doo is in my opinion a first rate satire that honors the original show while making fun of it at the same time. For me it's a underrated classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Scooby-Doo gang are now veteran mystery solvers. Fame, if not fortune, has hit the group. However, things aren't going so well for our heroes. Fred has become egotistical and takes credit for the group's success. Velma feels under appreciated. Daphne resents being the one that is always the damsel in distress. They decide to split up leaving Shaggy and Scooby all alone.\n\nTwo years later Shaggy and Scooby receive a mysterious invitation to Spooky Island, a scary amusement park. The park's creator, Mondavarious, requests their aid in solving a mystery. It turns out that all the college students coming to the island leave as brainwashed zombies. Shaggy and Scooby initially turn the invitation down, but relent with the promise of all the food they can eat (of course). At the airport they discover that the rest of the group has been invited, too. Thus Mystery Inc. tentatively reunites to solve the puzzle of Spooky Island.\n\nI went into this movie very skeptical. In fact, after watching the first 10 minutes I thought, \"This is really going to suck.\" However, the movie picked up and by the end I really enjoyed it. I thought it was about as close as you could get to putting a live action version of the cartoon on screen. For the most part, it is faithful to its origins. Characters try to run away and spin out in mid air. Scooby and Shaggy beg for Scooby Snacks. A villain complains about \"meddling kids\". It's pretty much everything you'd expect.\n\nWhile most of the cast is mediocre, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and the CGI Scooby-Doo really make the movie. Lillard nails the Shaggy character so perfectly that you'd think the cartoon was based on HIM. His voice and mannerisms are dead on. He also works perfectly with the CGI Scooby-Doo. Scooby is cartoony yet hilarious. He's just like the cartoon character as well. While acting rather human-like, he's still not above chasing the occasional cat. He's also guided by his stomach rather than his brain. One funny scene features Scooby getting a phone call. A creepy voice says, \"If you want all the hamburgers you can eat, go into the dark and scary woods where nobody can see you and meet me there.\" \"OK!!\" he enthusiastically responds.\n\nThe movie had my attention most of the way through, and that's a major feat. Luckily being kid friendly didn't mean they had to compromise on humor. There are some humorous references to rumors of Shaggy being a stoner and such that pass totally over kid's heads but the adults catch. Jokes about Scooby drinking out of the toilet, cleaning himself at Don Knott's party, and other such dog-related humor bring a lot of laughs, too.\n\nBesides that, this film had great sets and a fun soundtrack.\n\nI don't know which Scooby-Doo cartoons these writers saw, but they must have seen something different than I did. I never remembered Freddie being an egotistical chauvinist. I didn't remember Daphne being the constant damsel in distress. I didn't remember Velma being ignored in credit for the captures. And I certainly didn't remember Scrappy Doo being an evil little pip squeak that everyone hated. Annoying? Yes. Misguided? Yes. Hated? Maybe only by the adult fans of the series, and that really shows up in this film. The characterizations of these characters are the only parts of the film that are unfaithful to the cartoon. This ties into the ending as well which I don't want to spoil here. I'll just say I found it a little disappointing.\n\nMost of the cast is pretty mediocre. Freddie Prinze Jr. stands out as the most miscast of the group. I could never get over him being blonde. It just didn't look right. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a lot of fun in the movie, but I never thought of her as the definitive Daphne. Lillard was just so perfect that he made the rest of the cast seem out of place.\n\nIn the end Scooby-Doo could have been a total disaster, but winds up being some fun summer entertainment. Scooby-Doo has its problems, but it is still probably one of the better live action cartoon adaptations to come along."

But I do love this movie and the second movie with the characters, probably my favorite versions of them as well. I do find it funny though that eventhough Scooby Doo at least from observation is more garnered towards kids, this particular movie feels like it's more garnered not just to kids but to adults as well and teenagers due to it's mature themes and the story\n\nSome scenes are quite dark even for kids but thats what makes Scooby Doo 1 an awesome movie. The whole demon monsters possessing people and with Scrappy Doo being behind it the entire time plotting his revenge on Mystery Inc is a nice touch. Definitely loved the whole ' Spooky Island' theme park thing as well which would actually make for an awesome real park\n\nEveryone as well cast and did a great job, humor was great, it's witty and clever, cant understand the hate or why it has a low rating on this site but oh well. I keep forgetting Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean is in this movie which makes it even more awesome."

They captured the spirit of Scooby-Doo and managed to capture it live. The cast is great, each of them playing their roles wonderfully. I will say, Cardellini fits the personality of Velma but it would have been nice to see them cast someone more in line with Velma and not another super skinny, traditional beauty but that's such a tiny thing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is still fun for fans of the gang. Should still be fun for kids too. Was a fun little treat and definitely recommend this over the more recent Scoob!"

I still doo... sorry, do. I used to, and still, watch every day when I get home from work. So I was skeptical about a movie of my favourite hound being turned into a computer animation. But still, for me,...it worked! Matthew Lilard was great as Shaggy. Freddie Prinz Jr. wern't bad as Fred. He was a little 'up himself', if you will. Daphnie seemed a little like a spoilt brat but Velma, along with Shaggy, was the only one to survive the transition to the big screen. The plot, they separate after a big bust up then get back together to solve the BIG mystery, was a bit o' good writing. The best bit is in the airplane then the plane (watch for yourself. I don't want to spoil it!). But it did lack teh polish to make it great. If they had made Daphnie like she was on the show and not like Angelica of the Rugrats then she would have been lovable. The same with Fred. But still, it is a good romp. Just unplug yer brain fro an hour and a half and enjoy the fart jokes! Rooby Doo!!!"

When it came out in 2002 I was 7, and this is easily one of my favourite films. Still is to this day.\n\nI came over to imdb to leave a review because I found out they are remaking a live action scooby doo movie next year (we're gonna ignore those straight to dvd teen actor ones) To think they could better this version? HA. And that cast? Jees. Who wants to see a remake entitled 'Scoob'."

        "review_detailed_main": "I do my review of the SCOOBY-DOO live-action films with SCOOBY-DOO and then, SCOOBY-DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED and then, I will do the reviews for the two prequels, SCOOBY-DOO: THE MYSTERY BEGINS and SCOOBY-DOO: THE CURSE OF THE LAKE MONSTER.\n\nBefore I begin my review of the SCOOBY-DOO franchise, I'm going to tell a little bit of history, now, shall we begin? Development for a live-action treatment of Scooby-Doo began in 1994 by producer Charles Roven. Originally, the idea was to make a film with a much darker tone, essentially poking fun at the original cartoon series, much like the Brady Bunch Movie and was set to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.\n\nShaggy was set to be a stoner, Velma and Daphne had a side relationship and there were many references to drugs. Several rumors about these aspects in the original cartoon series were passed around by fans of the show and were to be incorporated into the live-action film.\n\nThe plot revolves around the Mystery Incorporated, a group of four young adults: Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley and Norville \"Shaggy\" Rodgers and a dog named Scooby-Doo who solves mysteries. After a two-year disbandment, the group reunites to investigate a mystery on a popular horror resort called Spooky Island.\n\nThe movie was not well received by critics, but it was enough to spawn a sequel released in 2004, and a telefilm prequel, aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009.\n\nThis movie is a really great film and critics did take this the wrong way, but they did like some of the things done right and some of the fans really liked this movie.\n\nThe story is amazing and to the script writer's credit James Gunn, who directed Marvel's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and the film does stay true to the TV show. The Mystery Machine is really amazing and fantastic and if they changed it to different colors and it would have not been the van from Scooby-Doo that I know.\n\nThe acting is just amazing. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays Fred Jones and he really does great in his performance. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the role of Daphne Blake and she did really amazing and to this day, the two actors I just mentioned are married. Matthew Lillard pays the role of Shaggy Rogers and he is funny and over-the-top during this whole movie and it was really amazing. Linda Cardellini plays Velma Dinkley and she is really fantastic in her performance.\n\nRowan Atkinson is Emile Mondavarious and he does a really great job. Isla Fisher plays the role of Mary Jane, Shaggy's love interest and she does a really great job as well. Neil Fanning provides the voice of Scooby-Doo and the CGI is really amazing on him and they made him look realistic.\n\nThe music by David Newman is really cool and the visual effects are well done and it is spectacular to see how the creatures look on screen. The production and costume designs are really cool also and is fantastic.\n\nThis film is just spectacular and overall, I love SCOOBY-DOO and it gets a 7 out of 10, because I really give this film an amazing rating.\n\nThe DVD features on this film is amazing and you have an audio commentary by the director and producers, a commentary with the cast, a two-player game that is very challenging, deleted scenes with optional commentary and those deleted scenes should have been in the movie, the behind-the-scenes documentary is really amazing and fantastic and I think it gives you a damn good look into the making of a movie that I enjoy. There are also featurettes on the movie as well including The Mystery Van and Daphne's Fight Scene.\n\nThere is also a music video by Outkast called \"Land of A Million Drums\" and that is so freaking cool as well as the soundtrack trailer for the movie's soundtrack.\n\nThe DVD gets an 8 out of 10 and I have the sequel on the same DVD, but that is Disc Two, which is my next review."

There are some gross jokes, but I think artistic license is allowed and helps make the transition to the big screen. Recommended to kids and parents alike. My rating: 8 (***)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Scooby Doo and I'm glad they made the movie based on that cartoon. The old cartoons are a howl to me except when Hanna-Barbera added Scrappy-Doo into the fray. WHAT A JOKE! The first mistake was getting rid of Fred and the girls. All of them had their weakness: Freddy; having such a big ego, Daphne; prissy and accident-prone, Velma; always vulnerable without her glasses, Shaggy and Scooby; GHOSTS and FOOD!!!!! But is one of the good weakness of those cowardly two some. When they got rid of the important three, I didn't like the show too much even when they brought back Daphne it was still weak. When I saw the episode when all of them return to help out the team, the magic had faded thanks to Scrappy Doo. When they had \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" it was a little better after they did \"The Flintstone Kids\". The pride of Scooby Doo was back in the time of the gangs' younger days. When I read that Warner Bros. was doing the live version of Scooby Doo, I was thrilled and could hardly wait. The choice of casts members for the movie was \"far out\" as Shaggy would say. The choice for Velma was great: Linda Cardellini, The Price is Right contestant in'97 , she was awesome. Matt Lillard does well as Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers. Freddie Prinze,Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar rounding the top cast as Fred and Daphne was fine. And Scooby Doo being animated was a riot. So when I saw the movie for the first time, I just thought it was the corniest thing I ever saw. When they finally regrouped after their differences, I knew there has to be a catch. Since Scrappy Doo ruined the genere, the movie will be considered his punishment. I think two more with be helpful and the last one should best be a little more surprising. I don't care what critics say about this movie, I LIKED IT! SCOOBY DOOBY DOOOOOOOO!!!!"

I loved Sarah Michelle Gellar's sassy and black-belted Daphne, and Freddy Prinze Jr. did very well as Fred. Seriously here folks, this movie seems to have a really bad pre-reputation. It could not have been better. Yes, they may have four well-known actors, but after seeing the movie it was not soley to rake in the cash from their reputations. They are all extremely GOOD; the cast could not have been better. I have found that there are the different depths of humor, the obvious cartoonish humor that always gets the kids, but there is also a lot of humor in the dialogue that will get the teenagers and older.

If you are inclined to see Scooby Doo, don't let any negative reviews turn you off to it.\n\nThe cartoon series was never deep, but this movie does add some depth to the characters by exploring their relationships (as much as possible in what is essentially an action/comedy). The movie is aimed squarely at those who have grown up with all iterations of the cartoon. There are elements and plot devices taken from the original \"Scooby Doo Where Are You?\" as well as the cartoons with celebrity guest stars and the Scrappy Doo cartoons. It is cleverly devised to play on your fond memories of watching this stuff as a kid.\n\nThat being said, it does pull out a few modern movie devices from the current state of its genre, which is hardly surprising. Fred and Daphne are reinvented slightly to create a group dynamic that fits the movie. Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma are exactly as you would imagine them. Shaggy and Velma are given expanded personalities in ways that work pretty well. Shaggy's character in particular has a lot of heart, which holds the movie together very well.\n\nI honestly do not know what a six-year old would think of this movie, but I would recommend it to other Gen X'ers who grew up watching the cartoon when they came home from elementary school every day. If you liked the cartoon, you should find this movie fairly entertaining."

These movies have AGED LIKE A FINE WINE and make me miss my childhood. Great writing and you feel like you're watching Scooby Doo but ITS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE. This movie is awesome, funny, and has great writing that leads to great jokes and a great plot. My only problem with this movie and Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is Freddie Prince Jr's portrayal of Fred. Every other character is straight from the cartoon and played by and written to a T of their character. Freddie Prince Jr. Is a bad Fred and I can see how his acting career has gone downhill after this movie. He's not the book version of Fred, and couldn't have been worse. Other than that, these movies are GREAT."

Velma was sooooo Velma. The characterizations of Fred and Daphne were a bit off, but I think that's because Fred and Daphne are boring, so they had to do something with them. I've seen criticism of SMG playing Buffy, I didn't see that, playing the BuffyBot now that I'd believe. They played homage to Daphne's knack for being kidnapped, to Scooby Snack Bribes, to Scooby's amazing ability to become a suitcase!\n\nWhat really sold me though was Scrappy. I can't tell you how much I hate Scrappy. Glad to know the Gang wasn't all that fond of him either. My niece (13) and nephew (5) protested Scrappy's portrayal, but it sold me the movie, lock, stock, and Scooby/Shaggy in a barrel.\n\nBottom line: If you are a fan, you will love it...if you aren't, then why bother going in the first place?"

I was even him in a school play :) i was very excited. Now when i heard they were making a movie, and actual movie with him I have to say i wasn't looking forward to it at all, i figured that would mess it up as they have so many others from when i was growing up. But oldest daughter however was and is a HUGE fan of the show, and Scooby so when the movie came out i figured i would take the kids, grin and bare it and let them enjoy it whether i did or not... but i have to say I REALLY DID ENJOY IT. Scooby was just as i had always imagined he would be and the character of Shaggy i honestly didn't think they would find anyone who could pull that off, but i was so thoroughly impressed with Matthew Lillard as Shaggy he nailed right down to the walk, I love him.. he was to me the epitome of Shaggy exactly what i had in my mind. The others did well also as i didn't think they would pull if off, but to my surprise they did a geat job they worked well with one another and complimented one another as well. It was great to see something that was so endeared as a child be something my kids could have that love for now. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see it or who is a true fan of the old show. They didn't ruin it, they did it justice."

There are certain aspects that you will only get if you are at least a bit of a fan, but I went to see it with two friends that weren't and they had a good time. If you hate scooby doo though definitely do not go and see it ( i guess that's pretty obvious). Basically it was great fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like man, this film rocks! Atlast, I watched Scooby-Doo a few days ago and it's great. Definatly a good big screen version! There's laughs, action, and all the ingredients to live up to the cartoon. And Scoobys just as loveable as Cartoon Scooby. He looks cute, acts cute, is cute! I don't agree that this is only for under tens, I'm fifteen and I loved it! If your interested in seeing it then go see it!! The only problem I have, and I wanna get this out of the way, is that is could have been a bit longer to reach the 1 and a half hour mark. This didn't spoil the movie at all though and the movie remains hilarious to the end credits and beyond...\n\nThe action scenes are great and remain funny and frantic just like the series and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing these 2-Dimensional characters jump to life in the form of such fantastic actors! And they did a great job to say that in the entire film they had to react to CGI effects that were added later! This was done incredibly well! Now then, a look at the cast...\n\nScooby... Scooby is brilliant and you can't help but love the cute hound as usual! He is hilariously funny, looks authentic and realistic while still remaining comical. Also his eating antics remain and are hysterical! With Matthew Lillard adding just as much humour!\n\nShaggy... Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy and has done a damn good job too! His voice is spot on, he looks identical and is one of the funniest guys around! I heard that Mike Myers was originally set to play Shaggy but he dropped out, well good! Myers is great in the Austin Powers films but in Scooby-Doo? I don't think so. Lillard and Scooby have great chemistry to say that Scooby wasn't actually there and was added later! It takes some talent to be able to do what Lillard and crew have done and they've done great. If there's a sequal, Matthew Lillard better be in it!\n\nDaphne... Sarah Michelle Gellar IS Daphne and brings a new feisty element to the character. She even kicks ass in the finale! Bringin' some Buffy moves with an extra kick of fury! She also looks great in her many outfits!!! I always liked Daphne, and for one of my favourite actresses to play her...well it was a real treat!\n\nFred... Freddie Prinze Jr. is a good choice as the leader of the group and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him, he also brings a more funny element that the cartoon version may have lacked a little. While not a central as Scooby, Shaggy and Daphne, Fred is still a good character!\n\nVelma... Not having seen Linda Cardellini in many programs before, I was pleasantly pleased with how good she is at playing Velma. I think she's definatly a rising star and has been given a great oppurtunity in this movie! Jinkies!\n\nScooby-Doo has an excellent cast, who don't dissapoint and bring laughs through the entire duration. I just hope there will be a sequal, starring the same cast and that there won't be a long wait! A great movie that I can't wait to own!\n\n9 and a half Scooby-Snacks out of ten! (would have been ten if it were slightly longer)."

But still I actually entertain from this movie.\n\nThe plot of the film is that the Mystery Gang Scobby-Doo, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and Velma (Linda Cardellini) are invited to a island theme park by Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) however things are not what they appear to be. Also we are introduce to Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) N'Goo Tuana (Steven Grives) and Voodoo Maestro (Miguel A.Nunez Jr) As the plot goes on\n\nI like how they added the theme song because come on everyone has heard \"Scooby-Doo where are you\"? and know that theme by heart just having that theme more than once really does a good job. In fact a lot of the music in the film is enjoyable and the songs they feature in it have that special it factor.\n\nAs for the acting, it is actually good Matthew's performance as Shaggy is just superb as he study the character very well He just shine as Shaggy, Sarah was very good as Daphne, Linda did well as Velma and Freddie did look the part of Freddie. But yeah the movie does feature some good acting just got to be more open mind about it. As for Scooby Doo I enjoy the C.G.I. Scooby Doo the cast did a great job with interacting with Scooby Doo to make it believable so props to them\n\nHowever what I didn't like about this film was the fact that it had moments that make you \"What were they thinking\"? and it really should have been left out of the finish film but again who knows it could have been a lot of worse which is why I'm glad I got it on DVD so I can skip the parts that didn't serve any sense.\n\nBut still as a fan of Scooby Doo I got to say this is actually a funny movie and it is quite entertaining plus well thought out comedy bits that gives that cartoon feel to the film so yeah give this movie a chance you might be surprise\n\nI give Scooby-Doo a 8 out of 10"

Not being allowed multiple comments for one entity, you have to pick and choose certain things for whatever you're going to give an opinion on. Many people are perhaps too harsh on some films and others too sentimental about their raves.\n\nI was shocked there already were 482 comments for \"Scooby Doo\" and that the vote average is a pitiful 4.7 from 23916 different \"Dooers\". It's \"loved it\" filter kicks in at 4.7 also, so if you voted at least a 5, your BS can go on that rave record for the big screen version of so many now adults' fave cartoon from the olden days of animation (pre \"The Simpsons\"). And there are over 50 perfect 10 reviews for this live action craziness.\n\nI adore Isla Fisher and Matthew Lillard as actors and Linda Cardellini is a goddess to me. Let's keep my thoughts about certain other people in this film under wraps for the time being. Lillard as \"Shaggy\" and Linda as \"Velma\" are as good as it gets for human incarnations of drawings. Their comic gifts are the saving grace of this far from perfect film.\n\nCheck out Linda's wonderful deleted scene where she belts out \"You're Too Good To Be True\". Is there another actress this versatile out there now? She's the modern update of the classic movie queen who could sing, dance and act.\n\nThe whole point of \"Scooby Doo\" is silly fun at nobody's expense, except for that little bastard Scrappy! Whoever came up with a fricking nephew for Scoob must have been freebasing too many \"snacks\" back in the 70s!\n\nThis film is suitable for little ones and any drug references should be dealt with by their parent(s), who probably had a bit of \"Mary Jane\" back in their teens. This movie isn't the downfall of civilization, it's a cartoon in human form."

I feel it was done very well - casting was good (Fred's hair wasn't blonde enough but no big deal). I loved the references to all of the \"bad guys\" I grew up watching over and over again. But the most important thing to me was that my children loved it too. My children own the first season of the original Scooby Doo and they loved recognizing the cartoon villains in this movie. My children are also fans of \"What's New Scooby Doo\" as am I. My point is that the changes made here and there for the film are not deal breakers. We're still huge Scooby fans. The story line of Scooby Doo 2 was much better than the first. We found it very entertaining and look forward to adding it to our DVD collection."

It was great also to know that after all the rumors - Scott Innes did the voice of Scooby-Doo (He has done most of the recent cartoon-movies and episodes) The best part of the movie is went they switch bodies for a few minutes (I'm not telling you how, or what happens but it's absolutely hilarious!) 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been of fan of Scooby ever since I first saw an episode. And when this movie came out, I just had to see it. I love Scooby and I have probably seen just about every episode that there is. The beginning of the film starts off corny and you actually wonder if the writers had forgotten that they were writing an adaption of a cartoon rather than just writing another cartoon movie like the earlier SCOOBY-DOO ON ZOMBIE ISLAND. But after the first five minutes, things start going. The cast is perfect. No one else could portray the Scooby gang better. The cast includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardinelli, Rowan Atkinson and Scott Innes as the voice of Scooby-Doo. This is by far, the best comedy that I have seen this year. If you are a fan of Scooby, then you cannot afford to miss out on this one. My only complaint is that the monsters looked a little phony. But they were probably done that way as to not frighten the younger members of the audience. WARNING: there will be much stupid children laughter at scenes that are not funny!!! But, there is some adult humor thrown in every now and then. This is one damn funny movie.\n\nAnd to the reviewer that said she hated the movie so badly that she walked out and that the only reason she went was to see the new Harry Potter trailer, I give you credit for admitting how stupid you are for liking Harry Potter. Those of us who loved this movie (there are hundreds) are really intimidated, especially since Harry Potter will crash and burn at the box-office. SCOOBY-DOO: 5/5."

I think the fact that this film stars Sarah Michelle-Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr., largely considered key players among today's acting ITkids (teen ones at that), a lot of people might be expecting this to be a more mature outing for Scooby Doo and co. Not so!\n\nThe sets and characters are all larger-than-life and colorful, the story is simple, as is the humor.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is far from a masterpiece, but those of you wanting a nostalgic trip back to a misspent youth of countless hours watching these silly shows on television (the FIRST time!), this is a lot of fun. The kids will enjoy it, I'm sure. But this movie was written to have the silliness to appeal to the kids, but have the jokes written for the adults. This is truly worth watching. My advice is to watch this when kids will be less likely to attend. An audience filled with anklebiters will deter from your enjoyment of this wonderful film. But enough of that.\n\nSo why do I rate this silly film so high? Perhaps it's because it was indeed a nostalgic trip to yesteryear. And it was, in a way. It also joked at the hidden undertones of the series: Fred's homosexuality, Shaggy's drug habit (I mean, he thinks he can talk to a dog,), Velma's lesbianism (though this isn't touched as much as Fred), Daphne and her damsel in distress bit, Daphne being used as Fred's cover-up, and the most evil character of the show is dealt with appropriately.\n\nI read other reviews on here prior to watching the film, and was expecting to be disappointed. But as you have already guessed, I was not. Anyone who expects to take Scooby Doo seriously needs help. It's a comedy-mystery CARTOON, guys. It's camp, which is why it is so fun. And as you have read already, I'm sure, there is a burping/farting bit between Scooby and Shaggy. It goes on a bit long, and I could have lived without it, but the producers had to appeal to today's audience.\n\nShaggy's character is done PERFECTLY. They couldn't have chosen a better actor. Almost all the cast was perfect. Freddie Prinze, Jr. seems a little awkward as Fred, especially with that really bad blonde hair. It looks very unnatural, but perhaps I am myself taking Scooby Doo too seriously here. Daphne's character change is an amusing look at the change of feminism through the ages. But anyway, this is a fun, camp film, recreating Scooby Doo, having fun with it, and laughing at its plot holes at the same time. So stop reading this and go see it already!\n\n8/10"

I mean a haunted fun-house/island is pretty typical, there is only so much you can do with that. The special effects were great, and I really didn't think that I was going to like the digital Scooby, but I quickly warmed up to him, especially in some of the touching scenes between him and Shaggy. I do think that Daphne and Fred were mis-cast. I would have preferred to have seen Jennifer Aniston as Daphne, (she's got the Daphne voice too) and I have no idea who would be Fred, but anyone would have done better than Freddie Prinze Jr. The inside stoner jokes were funny too, as Shaggy's love interest was named Mary Jane and they played Pass the Dutchie when Shaggy and Scooby were cooking in the van (you could see smoke come out of the top)."

The Scrappy Doo appearance was genius. Kids may enjoy this movie as they would the cartoon, and not realize that it is a spoof of the cartoon, while still staying mostly true to it. It does to Scooby what the Brady Bunch movies did to that show. If you like watching the cartoon for fun, even though the stories are horrible at times, and just enjoy the absurdity of it all, this movie grasps that and makes fun of it at the same time. Your average movie goer might not get the jokes though, it requires a good bit of scooby knowledge to understand, but I'm glad they did it for the fans and not to please the masses. The only thing missing was a scene where shaggy and scooby fool the monsters by pretending to be waiters or barbers or something. They did that a lot in the cartoon but not in the movie. The whole scrappy thing makes up for it though. As I said, kids will enjoy it just as they do the cartoon, but I think it was made especially for older people that are big fans of scooby and love it for how absurd it is, and how fun it is when you realize it makes no sense at times."

Before I'd seen the film I was quite skeptical of Scooby being a CG character. But as I watched the film I realized that I think that was the better way to go. First off, the character is being based on a cartoon, so what's the big deal if he still looks a little cartoony. Secondly, HE'S A TALKING DOG!!! So, anyway, I made my peace with the CG Scooby and accepted him.\n\nThe movie's plot is quite thin and left me with a number of questions, but again, this is based on a cartoon so it's not a big deal if that plot is a bit questionable.\n\nThe actors did a fine job with the film. Freddy Prinze Jr. (Fred) did a fine job, as did Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne). I was really impressed with Linda Cardellini (Velma), not just as an actress, but her beauty too. I thought she was WAY more attractive than Sarah Michelle Gellar! I was also REALLY impressed with Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. He NAILED that voice perfectly! ...And I have to mention Isla Fisher (Mary Jane), what a beautiful woman, and a good actress too...I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for her future work! The rest of the cast was good as well.\n\nThere were a few pleasant surprises in the film, so I won't spoil the surprises for you, you'll just have to go see the film. I really hope you like the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris"

And I was very pleased with what resulted! \"Scooby-Doo\" has a lot of laughs, and more than a little self-parody. In fact, you will enjoy this movie that much more when you recognize the spoofy elements. Like Daphne finally getting fed up with her whole \"damsel in distress\" routine. I was surprised that they included Scrappy-Doo in the story! And, not to give too much away, but I notice a lot of Scrappy haters around, and I think their feelings will be justified. The best performance belongs to Matthew Lillard, who nails the role of Shaggy perfectly. And Linda Cardellini is no slouch either as Velma. And so, to the meddling kids of Mystery, Inc., I say, \"Meddle on, kids!\""

I'll have to agree with the rest of you that only Shaggy & Velma played their roles up to par while Daphne and Fred just didn't get it. This doesn't hurt the movie though because there's so much going on. It's very fast paced and never boring. Scooby always adds his fun when the movie slows down a bit.

The only other scene i had a problem with was the farting contest between Shaggy and Scooby. The rest of the movie was pure bliss.

        "review_detailed_main": "Scooby Doo (2002)-\n\nThe first time I watched this film was at the Odeon on a \u00a31.99 deal that included popcorn and a drink, months, if not a year after it's release. It hadn't peaked my interest, but my Mother, Nan and I were treating my Niece and Nephew and I have to say that all four generations came away happy and smiling after a good laugh. We all enjoyed it for the years after too, as my Nephew watched it repeatedly and claimed it as the best film ever. Now at 22, he still makes the same claim and can quote it word for word.\n\nWhile I agree that the film is great and has a lot going for it, I can't agree that it's the best film ever, that is clearly 'The Snowman' (1982).\n\nHowever, what is fantastic about this film is the fact that it reboots the franchise without detracting from the idea of the original cartoons and manages to still give it a freshen up for a new era. I don't think that they could have made a more fitting real life version of what was already a brilliant cartoon to be honest and the casting is superb.\n\nI do like the fact that Daphne has had some \"Buffy\" style martial arts training since we first met her and can now contribute a little bit more. It would be a shame to let 7 years of Vampire Slaying go to waste in a film full of spectres and ghosties after all.\n\nThe CGI Scooby is brilliant too and the chemistry between the dog and Shaggy is both superbly timed and hilarious. PMatthew Lillard should have won an Oscar for his performance here, but I bet he wasn't even nominated. For shame Hollywood! For shame!\n\nIt would be easier to watch this without my nephew quoting EVERY single sentence, but after all these years I know it fairly well myself too, so I don't miss out on some cracking jokes and an appropriate storyline. It's such an easy and fun film for all ages and so harmless too.\n\n880.15/1000."

I couldn't associate her with Daphne at all, and I kept having to do double takes.\n\nHaving said that, the movie is a great laugh, and I'm ashamed to have put off watching it for so long. it's an excellent up-to-date live-action version of the show. *Don't* go expecting a remastered SD cartoon episode (who would sit for 2 hours through one of those, anyway?), and you'll enjoy the mix of slapstick and adult humour.\n\nGo see it!"

You've got to remember that this is a movie aimed for children and, to an extent, teens. Now, I'm 14 and I enjoyed Scooby-Doo. I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm crazy for everything Matt Lillard because he's one of my favorite actors. Oh, and speaking of Matthew, he was dead-on as Shaggy. I can't express in words how awesome he was. The animated Scooby was impressive, and a few times, I actually started to believe that Scooby was a real dog...until I came back to reality. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but nothing to rave about. Matt stole the movie, hands down. The other performance that I liked was Linda Cardellini's Velma. She did a very good job of looking and acting like the character: the way she spoke, the way she talked, and I'm impressed with the fact that she chopped off her super-long locks to have the real helmet hair. As you can probably tell, I've been telling my friends that Matthew and Linda are the best parts of the movie.\n\n\n\nA few complaints, though. Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred? Although it wasn't a terrible casting decision, I wouldn't call it a good one either. Either he didn't do anyone research on the role as his close friend and co-star, Matt, did, or he just didn't have the knack to play the character. And can I just say that his blonde hair looked horrible. Sarah Michelle wasn't bad as Daphne and her goal to be the one who saves the day is a cute little addition. As for Shaggy's \"love interest,\" Mary Jane? I wasn't into the story. But, Matthew did a good job of making that subplot as entertaining as it could get. The actually mystery that the gang is supposed to solve made me wonder what the writers were smoking until I realized that this is Scooby-Doo and they're supposed to run into all this weird stuff. And I've got one more complaint. Two words: Scrappy Doo. That idea was just out of nowhere and pure crap.\n\nAnyway, call me crazy, but I would pay to see the movie a second time, but only to see Matthew and Linda's performances again. And, again, call me crazy, I will be buying the movie when it comes out on DVD. I'd give the movie 7.5/10 stars. If you're deciding whether to watch it, I would recommend it."

I mean all but Matthew Lillard who was as close to Shaggy as can even be possible. Scooby Doo at first seemed to be fake (how can they match up to OUR Scooby?!?!?) but within minutes he was just as real as the people playing their parts. The hardest shoes to fill were those belonging to Velma...the animated version tried a little too hard to make her NOT Daphne... and Linda Cardellini made her someone you could see as a person and not just a walking computer with glasses. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. made Fred and Daphne belong to them. I can say that I can't picture anyone else playing their parts. Without giving away a part of the movie, there is a part in the movie that shows that they know each other very well in real life. I guess I should take the end of this message to say that our boys just loved the movie to death and can't wait for Santa to bring them the DVD for Christmas.

The movie overall is entertaining and is much better than I figured it would be. But let's be honest, even though Scooby-Doo is amazing popular it's always been a guilty pleasure for many people. So keeping the movie with a tongue-in-check feeling made it work well. I thought the special effects were well done. Matthew Lillard was perfect casting as Shaggy. He was born to play the part. Linda Cordellini was also great as Velma. Growing up almost every girl I knew worshiped Velma because she was one of the only girls on TV(live action or cartoon)- who looked like a real female. She stays very faithful to the character which I'm grateful. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Geller I don't know about. I felt the could have been more faithful to the characters. Freddie Prinze LOOKS like Fred, but anyway. Overall a cute movie. Almost all the kids at the screening left the theater saying nothing but wonderful things about the movie. Which since the movie aimed at kids means more about it reaching it's target audience than movie critics feeling's on it.\n\nFun, fun movie for kids and cartoon nuts who are kids at heart.\n\nP.S.

I loved this movie as a kid and was honestly afraid that revisiting it might ruin those memories. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. While it doesn't have the same magic it held when I was younger, it remains a fun, nostalgic, and effective experience.\n\nThe humor is undoubtedly one of its strongest points. There's a bit of everything: simple, childish jokes about flatulence, sarcasm, clever references, and even some visual humor. It's the kind of comedy that appeals to both kids and adults alike.\n\nThe cast-Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini-is simply brilliant. Their chemistry feels genuine, and each actor delivers a caricatured yet lovable version of the iconic characters. It's as if they were born to play these roles. I loved them all, but I couldn't help but think, every time I saw Matthew Lillard, \"How is this guy the villain from Scream?\"\n\nThe story is simple and predictable, but it works. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that the movie was a bit too short. An extra 10 or 15 minutes to deepen the mystery or explore the character interactions more would have been welcome. On that note, I couldn't help but think about the Rated R version of the film with adult humor, which has become something of a cinematic urban legend. I'd love to see that version someday if those lost copies are ever found.\n\nIf there's one thing that truly hasn't aged well, it's the visual effects. The CGI is awful, and the creatures look far too artificial, which diminishes the impact of the more ambitious scenes. The third act also feels rushed, leaving the climax less satisfying than it could have been.\n\nScooby-Doo is far from a masterpiece and won't resonate with newer generations the way it did with mine. But rewatching it felt like reclaiming a piece of my childhood, with that spark in my eyes that only movies can bring. And that's where the true magic lies-not in the pretentious glitter of golden statuettes, nor in the aggregated scores calculated by critics pretending to be intellectuals on Rotten Tomatoes. It's in the way a movie can make us laugh, dream, and remember who we once were. In that regard, Scooby-Doo is still a classic."

I know things changed up a bit, but I think they could have made a different story line than they did with this one. I felt that Matthew Lillard and Scooby were the best in this movie as they played their character to almost the exact. Although the farting was just for more entertainment which did get me going. Velma's character in here was played okay, I don't recall her being the emotional one but it was okay... Daphne and Fred were not what I expected, I think they could have made their character better, but they were not too bad... I found myself more attached to the younger versions of Scooby Doo the mystery begins and the curse of the lake monster, I think the gang in there were much more entertaining. I can tell they all were having fun with what they were doing too... I think overall I am glad they did start the Scooby doo series non cartoon so I do overall appreciate that which is why I didn't give it too low of a rating because it still was a fun movie."

The amount of times I watched it as a child is quite shocking.\n\nEvery time I've gone back to rewatch it (including quite recently), it unsurprisingly still holds up. Sure, the CGI isn't the best, and I'd actually really like an anniversary re-release with updated CGI and the inclusion of some of the deleted scenes (some of them really add to the story and its a surprise that they were actually deleted), once you look past that, there's barely anything wrong with this film.\n\nThe whole film stinks of early 2000s but I personally think that adds to the charm of it. The casting is perfect and no live action film will ever compare when it comes to casting. The fact that Matthew Lillard has remained in the role of Shaggy for all these years just goes to prove the perfect casting.\n\nIt was enjoyable as a child and it's still enjoyable now, so overall, whilst it may not be a 10/10 film in the eyes of critics, I consider it to be a fantastic film that achieves everything it set out to do and is well worth the watch."

And Scooby Doo is a classic funny cartoon from the 90's.\n\nFreddie Prinze Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini , Matthew Lillard are great actors. I think if they ever make a Scooby Doo 3 they should be included. Freddie Prinze Jr as Fred makes a great Fred, although he was too dramatic. rating on Freddie as Fred is 8. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne acted great, except she pretty much acted the same as Buffy. rating on Sarah as Daphne is 9.5 Linda Cardellini as Velma acted great!rating on Linda as Velma is 10 Matthew Lillard as Shaggy acted well, but I am sure the director could of found somebody much better.rating on Matthew as Shaggy is 7.5 The movies Scooby Doo 1 and 2 were awesome. But Scooby Doo the movie didn't relate to the cartoon series but it was better than the second one. I rate it a 10. Scooby Doo 2 pretty much was like the series and I liked it.But I think the perfect title should be Scooby Doo 2: Monsters United. I rate it a 9.5. All of the Scooby Doo Movies were cool and I especially think THERE SHOULD BE A SCOOBY-DOO 3 !!!"

All of the actors played their roles to the fullest, making this good. While watching it, I had many laughs. Many people don't want to admit that they didn't laugh, but I bet they did. Scooby was realistic, even though at times he seemed faked, but people did a good job creating him. All characters had great chemistry with Scooby, it actually looked like they were handling a real dog. This is a good movie that everybody can enjoy, it has a unique plot, good casting, many laughs, and excellent effects.

I was a little annoyed that Freddy and Daphne weren't really much like their cartoon alter egos but at least it didn't get in the way. Matthew Lillard was SPOT ON as Shaggy...and what a cool surprise to find Rowan Atkinson in here too! And the cool thing is...the movie was frequently really creepy. All the imagery and monsters and spooks were totally in line with the series and were legitimately \"spooky\". Even the plot wasn't boring. It kept moving at a really fast pace so you didn't have time to get bored which is important. Overall a great comedy for an old scooby-snacker like myself! ROOBY ROOBY ROOOOOOO!"

The rest of the cast does a great job too, and the villain behind the plot was a great choice! The only departure I saw from the cartoon plots were that the monsters in this one were real! I went with my 6 year old niece, and she was scared a few times, but not too bad.

When I first heard that they were making a live action Scooby Doo, the first thing I though was, oh no, they're going to ruin it. Then I heard that Freddie Prinze and Sarah Michelle Gellar were cast... and I knew it was over. But wait... I knew I had to at least give this movie a chance. So I went opening day. There were about 10 other people my age in attendence and scores upon scores of little kids. I can tell you, the kids were definately entertained. Other than the laughter (which there were lots), they were quiet and seemed very enthused. As for me, I laughed my butt off through most of the movie. The movie had a very cartoony feel, which really made it all work. From Scooby, who after a few minutes I fully accepted as Scooby, to the clothing, sound effects and such, it was a live action cartoon. As for the acting. Matthew Lillard was Shaggy Incarnate, it was almost scary how much like Shaggy he was. Linda Cardellini was also very good as Velma, and by the end of the movie, she was perfect. Even Freddie and Sarah pulled off their roles adequately, but were definately overshadowed by Lillard and Cardellini. There were a lot of homage to the original cartoon, from plot devices to catch phrases. In closing, this is one of the best cartoon to live action adaptations I've seen. They managed to make a movie that kids seem to enjoy and one that I could go to and enjoy myself. Oh, I also enjoyed it when I saw it again the next day."

Mathew Lillard was superb, nothing else can be said, Sarah Michelle Gellar was good - but i don't think it was a case of her lack of acting abilities, but more the lack of character material she could work with - Daphne was the babe of the show, not the brawn, not the brains, but the sex-on-legs type damsel in destress character - and her turn to super vixen was not very welcome... it was too...buffy. Linda Cardelinie was champion as were the compurot creators of scooby (scrappy was annoying) well thats it - think people ar eonly attacking it coz of its premise, nothing more"
