        "review_detailed_main": "When there's Kajol and Shah Rukh in a movie together, naturally the expectations are monumental! Everyone expects something epic, a romance of a lifetime. But alas, the movie was cheesy, predictable and filled with the typical Hindi movie punch lines and boring slapstick comedy.\n\nThe story and concept of the movie is nice, but the execution and dialogues are no different from the ones we have heard many times before. Frankly, I am a little disappointed in Shah Rukh for not choosing to produce and act in a movie of a more superior kind, considering he has enthralled audiences for 20+ years now, he should deliver performances worthy of a veteran!\n\nVarun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon are cute in the movie with their adorable teenage style romance, but I would say that kajol is the scene stealer here. She looks breathtakingly gorgeous and her eyes convey her emotions. She is a fabulous and seasoned artist!\n\nThe songs are mediocre, Gerua is the only track that leaves a lasting impression. The stunts and car sequences are interesting and of international standard, it keeps the audiences hooked!\n\nOverall, the movie was breezy and nice, but also not upto my expectations personally, because at this stage in Shah Rukh's career he should be making meaningful movies rather than the same old masala genre. Watch it if you like typical massy masala films like his previous 2 outings, chennai express and happy new year. If you are looking for something classy or different, Dilwale is not the film for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the Bollywood potboilers are meant to entertain with mindless screenplay and no-sense comedy. Rohit Shetty has mastered the art of this kind of cinema. Only this time , he goes one step ahead and gives you a senseless caper.\n\nDilwale tells the story of two families meet again again after 15 years when their dark past comes in front of them\n\nFrom the masala entertainments like Golmaal , Singham series, Bol Bachan and Chennai express, Rohit Shetty gives yet another spineless film which is full on masala entertainment but easily forgettable once you are out of theater. The only silver lining is the superb acting by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. The movie begins with forced comic scenes and unnecessary situations especially from Varun Dhawan and Johnny Lever which you are sure going to hate. It is only when Kajol enters the scene, you will heave a sigh of relief. The sparkling chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol saves the day and you wish the second half might be interesting as their jodi.\n\nUnfortunately, the second half drags and the climax becomes typical bollywood melodrama with hero delivering high-content dialogues and blowing few punches. Editing could have been better and songs becomes hindrance to the pace. Art direction and cinematography is outstanding. Shah Rukh Khan is the scene stealer despite so many shortcomings in the movie. The actor is brilliant but is saddened by weak screenplay. Kajol lends a good support and looks gorgeous. Varun Dhawan antics will remind you Salman Khan. Probably he should define his unique style. Kirti Sanon is strictly okay. Johnny Lever irritates. Sanjay Mishra disappoints. Mukesh Rishi is good. Boman Irani is brilliant.\n\nOverall , Dilwale is predictable and boring with nothing new to offer."

But this is such a sad strategy as we can not be fooled for long.\n\nI wanted to check the reviews first before watching the movie but thankfully the real reviews from real people have told me exactly what i needed to know!"

A romantic song with a dance across the beautiful landscapes around the world does not make for a beautiful movie.\n\nDon't even get me started on the overacting. I expected at least some decent acting from the two experienced actors in this movie about whom the fans were going crazy for the past few weeks. But no. Acting? What is that? Let's just dance around the world and add some stunts and we'll earn 100+ crores.\n\nI'm eagerly waiting for the day when SRK will go back to making movies like Swades and Chak De India."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though I was not expecting too much from this Rohit Shetty directorial as I'm aware of Rohit's taste , but I ended up in a situation and mood like \u2013 \"Expect the Unexpected\". Take it in a positive whim . So let's see how Dilwale actually is !\n\nAfter their last outing in Chennai Express, I kind of had an inkling of what Rohit Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan were going to offer in Dilwale. Just another typical run-of-the mill entertainer. While Chennai Express didn't leave me disappointed, it didn't leave me in awe either. But Dilwale still does manage to look a lot more appealing from the promos, songs and the trailer. And two and a half hours later, I came out completely satisfied. Each Penny was well spent!\n\nPerformances make the film imminently watchable. SRK, as Raj, does what he does best --- romances his leading lady with ease, beats the hell out of his rivals while playing the ideal brother to Varun. Of course, how can there be another Dilwale sans the leading lady of the original? Kajol, as effortlessly spontaneous as ever, has a relatively shorter role than what you would have expected. Varun Dhawan's comic timing will make you sit back and take note. Kriti Sanon does a reasonably good job of her role. The other members of the cast are all armed with funny scenes and dialogues. One of the best things about the film is that all the other characters are fleshed out to keep the comic element up. It may sound a little audacious but Rohit Shetty's favourite Sanjay Mishra, who plays a buyer of stolen goods, is even funnier than the amazing Johnny Lever. The comedy element in the film is its strength. With top notch performances from the likes of Varun Sharma, Boman Irani, Sanjay Mishra and Johnny Lever, you will definitely laugh out loud every time they are on screen. A special applause has to be reserved for them, as they lift up he film, the moment you feel it might lag.\n\nThe direction by Shetty is awesome, to put it simply. His vision and the scale of the film is insurmountable by any other entertainer in this genre. There are no compromises on budgets and it reflects on the film.\n\nThe music does justice to the ethos of the film. The songs are well- paced, except for Daayre, and contribute to strengthening the romantic quotient of the film. The background music is haunting and somehow reminded me of the Om Shanti Om theme. The soulful music is complemented by the breathtaking locales. The film is (obviously) set in Goa, Rohit Shetty's favourite destination, and Bulgaria. The latter, alongwith Iceland where the song Gerua is shot, gives you some awe-inspiring visuals on the big screen.\n\nMoments make for great memories in a Rohit Shetty film, and so some scenes deserve a special mention. The five-minute speed dating between Shah Rukh and Kajol is interesting, while the one where Mukesh Rishi and Pankaj Tripathy narrate the Shah Rukh-Kajol back story is deeply engaging.\n\nAll in all, Dilwale was a great joyride with plenty to watch out for. Superb music. Stunning action. Unbelievable landscapes. Energetic youth in the form of Varun-Kriti. And of course, the enigmatic SRK-Kajol! Each of these elements can make you want to watch the film by themselves. And when put together, Dilwale is the great entertaining result! The film ends on a high note with Tukur Tukur, a song that you will keep singing to yourself long after the film is done. Watch it, as by Rohit Shetty's standards, it's his most complete and the most entertaining light comedy romantic movie.A Must Watch"

Dilwale has a story, has SRK-Kajol evergreen romance but Rohit Shetty is not Yash Chopra,Adi Chopra or Karan Johar. so if you are expecting a DDLJ type romance, you will be disappointed. 1st half was good. sometimes a bit slow which is not expected from a Rohit Shetty movie.. SRK-Kajol romantic scenes were too good smile emoticon there is twists in 1st half & 2nd half but both were predictable. Action sequences are just awesome, Mindblowing... comedy scenes were good but sometimes a bit silly Songs as you know are already Chartbuster... SRK as always the GOD. he was just superb in action scenes as well as in romantic scenes. Kajol is good as always. Varun Dhawan acted good as the younger brother of SRK.. Kriti Sanon had a little role,she was so so. as a whole Dilwale is a feel good movie. you won't be disappointed after watching this movie."

If you think Happy New year was a bad movie from this director? You're in for a treat, and it's not a treat you'd like. Moreover the script was probably given to some high school kid for his homework assignment. The color grading of the movie looks like an Overblown Android screen, watch Gerua for instance. I think I lost a bit of IQ today after watching this piece of crap."

I personally love them even though some of the scenes during the singing and fighting may be a little exaggerated but most of the scenes really touching and beautiful to watch.\n\nFor SRK-Kajol's fans, this film is a must watch. You can see how good is their chemistry in acting, that's why they are who they are now.\n\nOverall, I'm giving the vote based on my personal experience. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Bollywood film but this one really got my attention."

The plot was goofy, dialogues were goofy and on top of it all there was SRK, whose performance is getting worse with every passing second. The movie had nothing engaging. I've never left a movie halfway, so I decided to go through three hours of hell because I didn't want to ruin my record. Believe me that was a very brave thing to do. However unsurprisingly there were many SRK-fans who did enjoy the movie. So to put it in a nutshell, if you are an SRK fan then you are stupid enough to love this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Diwale is very much a tale of two wildly different films which have been edited together into one, with the hope that no-one notices. Half of the film is a good gangster love story sets across eras, the other half is an atrocious comedy caper.\n\nThe Quality Part: The West-Side Story-esque plot between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's characters is actually very good, and there are solid flashback scenes which are convincing in terms of looks and subtle differences in characterisation. The modern day scenes with these (more jaded) characters also works well, even if it is all resolved a little too easily at the end. Goa looks gorgeous, and the stylised nature of the way the movie is shot actually sets off the movie well (Although some sound-effects during the fighting scenes are distracting). It's a unapologetic brash modern car-chase shooting-fighting movie and if the film had simply been this story line, it would have been great.\n\nSide note: It has to be said, Shah Rukh Khan is so ridiculously on a different level to all the other actors in the film, it was like watching Robert De Niro circa Raging Bull era being forced to act in an Adam Sandler movie. He, and to some extent Kajol, who is less consistent, deserve much much better than this. They are the only people in the cast who appeared to turn up, work hard and actually act, so kudos to them.\n\nThe Terrible Part: But what brings the whole film down is the supporting cast and side-plots which have little purpose other than demonstrating terrible 'comedy' and limited performance skills, sometimes so bad it actually ruins the film. The younger love story is boring and superficial, but only raises a little when it intertwines with the love story of their older siblings. The other characters linked to the sub-plot (plot may be too strong a word) of the drug cartel/black marketeers are terrible, and serve little purpose at all. You could have easily deleted an hour off this movie by editing out these characters, and it would have been much better.\n\nBest scene: Towards the start of the film in the hospital, Shah Rukh Khan's change from one 'aspect' of his character to another without moving a muscle, his transformation as seen only in his eyes is brilliant.\n\nWorst Scene(s): A toss-up between the Ramlal/Pogo stupidity, or any scene with the car-part black marketeers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here's the thing with Rohit Shetty movies: we know it's going to be the leave-your-brain-behind type. We know it's not going to make any sense. We know the internet trolls and the twitterati are going to bite into the movie even before it releases.\n\nAnd yet we watch it. For the simple reason that he makes us laugh.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of Chennai Express, the jokes had dried up, the quips and the crisp dialogue had thinned, and the monotony was there to be seen. Singham Returns exposed that even further.\n\nBut this one takes the cake.\n\nDilwale is Rohit Shetty's worst movie. It's painfully fake and hopelessly contrived; an assembly-line piece of garbage that mistakes the audience for a fool.\n\nSo we have Shah Rukh Khan playing Kaali (go figure!), a retired son of a mafia boss, who lives with his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan) in Goa, the setting of many of Shetty's films. Veer's love interest is Ishita (a lovely Kriti Sanon). And Kaali has a brief, turbulent love-hate past with Meera (Kajol) in Bulgaria, which catches up with him later in his life.\n\nIn the midst of all this there are mafia bosses, a local Goan don for the villain, a sidekick (Varun Sharma, aces it) and the usual Rohit Shetty comedians thrown in for good measure.\n\nThis is a movie laced with stereotypes. Be it the step brothers with one of them being an orphan, or the painfully obvious plot twists, ones which can be seen from a mile away.\n\nIn terms of performances, there's not much to do for Kriti Sanon except for looking really pretty. Varun Dhawan has done this kind of goofy man-child role in Main Tera Hero before; he's pretty much the same here.\n\nKajol looks simply stunning, she's aged beautifully. Her acting credentials were never in doubt, but she's saddled with such a hopeless role and cringeworthy dialogue.\n\nShah Rukh sleepwalks through this role, just like he's done in Happy New Year and Chennai Express. He's an absolute bore; his eyes grim and his face stoic.\n\nWhat is most disappointing is that the hullabaloo surrounding this movie was about the coup that Shetty managed to pull off with SRK and Kajol, unquestionably Bollywood's most chemically potent pair, and yet their chemistry is almost non-existent in Dilwale. Not being able to capitalize on SRK-Kajol's pair just goes to show what a shoddy mess the movie is. Yes, there are the occasional sparks, like the silent nod to the 'palat' scene from DDLJ, but those are few and far between.\n\nAlmost all the lines fall flat, which is disappointing, especially coming from dialogue writers like Sajid-Farhad. The scenes look farcical, the acting extremely fake, and the jokes forced. Barely a couple of laughs are generated, mainly due to the ever-reliable Johnny Lever and another Priyadarshanesque montage leading to a hilariously confusing story.\n\nShetty has always been 'inspired' by various films, as evidenced by the Golmaal series, Bol Bachchan and even Singham. With Dilwale, not only has he taken bits and pieces from trashy potboilers of the 80s, but this time he's gone further and taken a page out of a TV show.\n\nIn the middle of the once-amazing CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, protagonist Ted Mosby meets a woman called Stella, and due to shortage of time, he takes her on a two-minute date, an extremely endearing montage, and one of the highlights of the show. Our man Shetty blatantly copies the concept, and it's neither impressive nor heartwarming.\n\nIt's a shame to see Rohit Shetty start taking the audience for granted to such an extent. It's even more shameful that Shah Rukh Khan agreed to not only act in this mess, but also produce it. Dilwale is a mistake that will be difficult to erase.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the movie, Varun Dhawan is proposing to Kriti Sanon. And in a bid to go all out, he plans to do the one thing that simply can't fail in Bollywood - SRK's arms-raised pose.\n\nHe prays, 'Bhaiya, sambhaal lena'. Sure, he gets the girl. But not even his bhaiya can save this atrocity of a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I used to really like Shah Rukh Khan's movies, he used to make good enjoyable movies. Nowadays I feel he is contributing to the regression of Bollywood cinema with movies like Dilwale, Chennai Express and Happy New Year. He was once the king of Bollywood but now it seems his contemporaries have now whizzed past him and doing more meaningful fare, like Akshay Kumar with Baby and Airlift or Salman Khan with Bharangi Bhaijaan. Anyways back to Dilwale, it is basically a rehash of much better movies, like of instance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in the case the siblings of Shah Rukh and Kajol reuniting them with typical Rohit Shetty action thrown in for good measure, the result being an uneasy mix of romance and action. The movie is littered with many unnecessary scenes and plot lines which serve no purpose other than to fill the time. Onto the performances Shah Rukh and Kajol were good but it was Varun Dhawan who impressed in this movie. I did see him in Student of the year but for some reason he didn't impress me that much. He has a promising career ahead of him in Bollywood. His co star Kirti Sanon is as wooden as they get. Bollywood veterans Kabir Bedi and Vinod Khanna are decent enough in small roles whilst comedy king Johnny Lever is tolerable and Boman Irani hams it up in a villainous role. To make matters worse the ending I thought was a bit of an anticlimax.\n\nAll in all disappointing fare given the talents involved. I suppose the only good thing to come out of this is that I was planning to see this movie on the big screen but was putt off after the reviews started coming in."

        "review_detailed_main": "Though I was not expecting too much from this Rohit Shetty directorial as I'm aware of Rohit's taste , but I ended up in a situation and mood like \u2013 \"Expect the Unexpected\". Take it in a positive whim . So let's see how Dilwale actually is !\n\nAfter their last outing in Chennai Express, I kind of had an inkling of what Rohit Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan were going to offer in Dilwale. Just another typical run-of-the mill entertainer. While Chennai Express didn't leave me disappointed, it didn't leave me in awe either. But Dilwale still does manage to look a lot more appealing from the promos, songs and the trailer. And two and a half hours later, I came out completely satisfied. Each Penny was well spent!\n\nPerformances make the film imminently watchable. SRK, as Raj, does what he does best --- romances his leading lady with ease, beats the hell out of his rivals while playing the ideal brother to Varun. Of course, how can there be another Dilwale sans the leading lady of the original? Kajol, as effortlessly spontaneous as ever, has a relatively shorter role than what you would have expected. Varun Dhawan's comic timing will make you sit back and take note. Kriti Sanon does a reasonably good job of her role. The other members of the cast are all armed with funny scenes and dialogues. One of the best things about the film is that all the other characters are fleshed out to keep the comic element up. It may sound a little audacious but Rohit Shetty's favourite Sanjay Mishra, who plays a buyer of stolen goods, is even funnier than the amazing Johnny Lever. The comedy element in the film is its strength. With top notch performances from the likes of Varun Sharma, Boman Irani, Sanjay Mishra and Johnny Lever, you will definitely laugh out loud every time they are on screen. A special applause has to be reserved for them, as they lift up he film, the moment you feel it might lag.\n\nThe direction by Shetty is awesome, to put it simply. His vision and the scale of the film is insurmountable by any other entertainer in this genre. There are no compromises on budgets and it reflects on the film.\n\nThe music does justice to the ethos of the film. The songs are well-paced, except for Daayre, and contribute to strengthening the romantic quotient of the film. The background music is haunting and somehow reminded me of the Om Shanti Om theme. The soulful music is complemented by the breathtaking locales. The film is (obviously) set in Goa, Rohit Shetty's favourite destination, and Bulgaria. The latter, alongwith Iceland where the song Gerua is shot, gives you some awe-inspiring visuals on the big screen.\n\nMoments make for great memories in a Rohit Shetty film, and so some scenes deserve a special mention. The five-minute speed dating between Shah Rukh and Kajol is interesting, while the one where Mukesh Rishi and Pankaj Tripathy narrate the Shah Rukh-Kajol back story is deeply engaging.\n\nAll in all, Dilwale was a great joyride with plenty to watch out for. Superb music. Stunning action. Unbelievable landscapes. Energetic youth in the form of Varun-Kriti. And of course, the enigmatic SRK-Kajol! Each of these elements can make you want to watch the film by themselves. And when put together, Dilwale is the great entertaining result! The film ends on a high note with Tukur Tukur, a song that you will keep singing to yourself long after the film is done. Watch it, as by Rohit Shetty's standards, it's his most complete and entertaining film!"

It's not your fault if you hate it because you spent your money to watch some serious comeback which made sense, well Diwale doesn't. It just pleases your heart. The romance and comedy lightens your heart and hardcore critics would probably laugh at the attempt but I watched it the way I watched Fast7. It has a lot in common with Fast and Furious series. Now I can't tell you how to watch your movies but I will tell you what to expect if you are willing to pay for this one. Honestly, I was glad I watched it in the theatre because it would lose its charm on TV. Kajol looks smashing and I guess I spent most of my time in anticipation of more Kajol screen time. Varun Dhawan is an idiot in the movie so don't look for any substance there. He is the comic relief who might get on your nerves if you let him, so don't. Shahrukh did what he does best and people were none wiser for not expecting much. But Kajol, she was the start for me, along with Johnny Lever. The movies thrives on the elements of nostalgia and its perfect idyllic representation of relationships with all its complications. It's a ridiculous movie with great characters, cut them some slack and you will love it. If you are deep into realism, skip this one. But if you like looking past what's on screen and love watching your childhood stars on screen, don't miss this one. I would probably watch it again, only to watch Srk and Kajol romancing with all the intensity. That is one thing I didn't find ridiculous. It felt very real.\n\nHope this helped."

Let's just dance around the world and add some stunts and we'll earn 100+ crores.\n\nI'm eagerly waiting for the day when SRK will go back to making movies like Swades and Chak De India."

Over the years, SRK has been relegated slowly, transmogrified into a director's actor, a puppet like creature that earned the big bucks not because of his own abilities, but because of the money lavished on the film, the scale and special effects of the film, the fabulous song and dance numbers. It didn't matter how bad the film was.For SRK, this may be an acknowledgment also of his growing limitations as an actor, even though he seems to defy age with his growing abs and packs.But SRK has not done any meaningful roles like Chak De! India, Swades, Hey Ram or My Name is Khan for a long time."

Frankly speaking the film is nowhere up to the standard set by Ruhit Shetty and SRK.I did not like it.I wish that other people are tolerant enough to tolerate the uninspiring story and lack of all the magic and melodrama till now being associated with SRK's films. Film is really awful to watch. My sympathies with Rohit Shetty who was searching for a big hit."

Kajol was terrific on her comeback so as Shahrukh with his scintillating looks. The dialogues were not much effective but the songs in the movie stole my heart. There were few action scenes which was not expected in Rohit's movie however the plot was predictable though good enough. Varun and Kriti had small roles but played there part as well. This was out of genre for Rohit Shetty from action comedy to Romantic action movie however it worked as well. For SRK-Kajol lovers, this is a must watch entertainer.I liked this movie and go with 3.5/5 for this movie. Don't listen to critics and have a watch for this."

This movie has a non-existential plot, stuff keeps happening due to no reason at all, and it just looks like everyone came to the set looking happy, just to bide the hours, and collect their paychecks. SRK may be a big star, and he is capable of good acting, but that has to wait for another day. This is utter rubbish. Looks like Rohit Shetty doesn't have any funny bones left in him anymore. He should either try and reinvent himself, or look for other career opportunities. You should not watch this, IMHO."

This movie is best watched alongside family and worth watching. Casting was great, Shah and Kajol are professionals and Varun and Kriti stole the show. Comedy casting was same as All The Best and as funny as it was. Final statement to be given after watching this film is that it is 100 percent entertainment purpose only."

And to live up to his reputation, Rohit Shetty ensures that Dilwale also boasts of well-choreographed, sleek n stylish, adrenaline pumped car chase sequences. One aspect that stood out in Dilwale for me was the ties of a family that was shown so beautifully. The strong and unshakable love between brothers, sisters and the familial bond that is unwavering in its support and unconditional love.\n\nFinally what can I saw about Shah Rukh and Kajol that has not been already said. They will always be two of Hindi cinema's brightest talents and when they act together it is nothing short of magic. Seeing them on screen floods me with emotion. All in all, Dilwale was one fantastic, entertaining, clean movie that can be enjoyed with the whole family!!!"

And the movie contains too many songs which helped only to increase it's run- time, nothing more. The movie comes nowhere near DDLJ I don't know why these people promoted it so.

The unnecessary car flying & bursting scenes were quite irritating to me. The storyline was absurd & kinda stupid. Parts of movie make me feel as if I was there was Golmaal 4.\n\nNothing worth mentioning happens in the first hour of the movie.A lot of grown men share hugs and talk about how they love each other, all moist- eyed and overwhelmed, but this is too generic to care about and, disturbingly, too straight-faced to laugh at.\n\nThe movie overall is quite dull & dud."

But soon after, the narrative falls apart completely . Apart from that the only thing which keeps you engaged is Sanjay Mishra's kookiness.\n\nWhats bad: THE SCRIPT. The film is neither funny nor entertaining.The deliberate attempt to repackage and sell the Kajol- SRK romance backfires. Even actors like Boman Irani and Johnny Lever have been completely wasted. Varun overdoes it, Kajol tries too much and SRK...(no comments).\n\nVerdict: Just one question to Rohit and Shah rukh.... WHY??\n\nWatch or not: Avoid"

        "review_detailed_main": "There's nothing new in 'Dilwale', which steals moments not just from Rohit Shetty's 'Golmaal' films, but also from Hollywood Rom com 'Love Actually'. Rohit Shetty is back in his favorite Goa, choosing to use sets which look like sets, done up in blindingly bright colors ( it's almost as if the scenarist is scared to miss out a single hue in the palette). The film also takes a detour to Bulgaria (Why Bulgaria? Who cares?) for a most improbable back-story, involving the main lead pair, gangs, and guns and bullets, but gets back to its tiresome old haunts and habits soon enough. This time around Shah Rukh shares space with Varun Dhawan who, in turn has a romantic track with Kriti Sanon, and a bumbling best friend track with Varun Sharma: SRK's track with old flame Kajol, which is meant to be the film's mainstay, keeps coming and going. And the other bit parts come and go, too, pretty much on a whim. It's almost as if someone says, now let's bung in a comic track, and out tumble Johnny Lever as a car thief, and Sanjay Misra as a pony- tailed receiver of stolen cars, and Boman Irani as a pink-jacketed mobster with a love of vintage cars. Yes, cars do play a big part here, as they do in most Shetty films. And yes, a couple blow up most satisfactorily. But 'Dilwale', on the whole, is a plot less drag : the slaphappy antics you see on screen are a random jumble of light, camera, action, done in the broadest sense. In this rigmarole, SRK is the only thing worth watching when he switches on the wattage ( Kajol can shine, too, when she chooses to), but his twin parts\u2014a 'car modifier' named Raj, and a gangster called Kali (yes, that's right), are both familiar and bland. When old hands SRK and Kajol look into each other's eyes, they can still make you feel it, except it doesn't happen enough. Not by a long shot."

My wife got bored of PRDP and HNY but not with this one folks"

It's just plain stupid. Everything in this movie was just utter bullshit. There was not even one good thing to say about this movie. That's how bad it was. Guess Rohit Shetty and SRK believes that people would watch anything they throw at them. Such confidence.\n\nEven writing a review on it is a waste of time. All I want to say is, SKIP THIS USELESS MOVIE."

Not that one has ever expected anything more than a masala entertainer from him but Dilwale has neither masala nor entertainment. It is just an unappetizing khichdi (hodge-podge) of action, emotion, romance and comedy.\n\nBottomline: Did Rohit Shetty make this film in his sleep? Seems so..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Folks, please read completely as it may save you a lot of Money!! OK!let me gather my senses now! Phew!! Yes!! I had stopped watching star-casted Bollywood movies for more than a year now, but because of the all the huge hype towards the end of the year and with the re-incarnation of an old hit Bollywood pair, I gathered all my courage to make one last attempt before the end of the year to watch at least one Bollywood movie with a star-casted pair, and alas I guess in doing that I just made the biggest mistake of my life and consider myself a grave sinner in the eyes of the God!!\n\nYes, you guessed it right by now!!, I am taking about the movie Dilwale that released today. I guess this movie was just utterly over-rated by the SRK fans for no reason. Hey SRK fans, one romantic song with a cozy dance on beautiful landscapes around the world does not make-up for a good movie, instead you should go watch a movie like 'ugly' that exposes the darkness lingering in our society, and to the director Rohit Shetty?, boss, please stop making such dumb movies, I've heard you are better than this, so prove it!! to SRK?, I think you are better off these days to just show up at the stadiums with your family, and cheer for your cricket team!! and please don't waste your's and people's time as your performances are getting worse with every movie!!\n\nTo sum it up, it was Rohit Shetty's sh*tty direction again. The whole plot was goofy, dialogs were 3rd class, jokes were bitter, action was indigestible, acting was unbearable and romance was artificial. If you ask me this movie would have been good as an advertisement for a fairness cream, where a dusky looking Kajol (what I know of her from the movie Baazigar) has now transformed into a Caucasian white actress who can speak good Hindi and is capable of dancing around the trees and lakes with an Indian actor, and SRK? hey dude, my hatred for you is just increasing day by day, do I need to remind you that you are a father of 3 kids now? yes I am including Abram in that pack as well, and you now should start taking roles more suited for your age, Oh BTW, did you watch the movie Udaan? Well, you could have been a father of those 2 boys there? May be it would have been a better experience for you, but, 'NO' you didn't, and rather you just like taking up these sh*tty roles. I think your main problem is that you are no more an actor, you are more like a director's puppet now who just performs as directed with no skill of your own, and then let the marketing and promotion team do the rest by advertising through fancy songs and dance numbers to rob the innocent public of billions of rupees, and then declaring the movie a'HIT', and who knows the audience has been well paid-off in advance or were even offered free tickets? and the same money is just being collected later, could very well be True?!? for I would be scared to spend my hard-earned money on a crap like this!! And, Varun Dhawan? Oh boy, you seriously need some acting classes now, and you seem to be just wasting your precious time at GYM!!, dude? can't you just speak 'humanly' and not drag the dialogs like a robot? also you look like you are always on a high and drag the dialogs unnecessarily? oh, now I know why you were running after the drugs in the whole movie!? May be you were on a high and needed to take more drugs!! LOL and Kriti Sanon? the less we see of you is better, glad you had a very short role, and very well justified for your incompetent acting skills, and for the rest of the cast? I don't have much to say except that, hope you were all paid well enough to perform such a crude act on screen!! good job!! you did your best in showcasing your cheap acting skills!!\n\nFrom all this, one thing is very much clear that this movie was made in a haste just to meet the year end release date or to just compete with another movie releasing on the same day!!\n\nMy final verdict, watching this movie, in one word, is \"suicide\", so just listen to me and please save your hard earned money for something special, may be even donate the price of the ticket to a needy person on the street when you step out to watch this sh*t, may be you will get blessed and God may help you in changing your decision to do something better. I assure you this movie is even sh*ttier than Chennai Express and Happy New Year!! So it's the sh*ttiest ever!!\n\nThat's it for tonight folks, I need to gather myself now and seek forgiveness from Lord for I committed the biggest sin of my life!!\n\nPS: Even after my horrible review, if you still dare go and watch this movie, I promise your IQ levels will do down drastically and you may need to visit a Psychiatrist later!! So please book your appointments now as there might be a queue there in sometime!!"

I was very disappointed with nearly all the movies of bollywood in year 2015 except Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Prem ratan dhan payo has also very disappointed me and I was not expecting much from dilwale too. But this movie has done it. You can see how much effort is done in making this movie. Great choice of places. Very clean and refreshing. Songs are too good and their video has made them perfect. A must watch movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot has been said about the movie Dilwale which released this weekend.The critics in India have been unbelievably negative towards the film so much that I was feeling very happy and satisfied that I watched the movie before all this negativity fell into my ears. Over the ears I have noticed that SRK produces polarising emotions.He has a tremendous amount of haters who just speak crap about almost everything related to him be it his movies,his statements or even his personal life.Some people even say he is arrogant!!! which makes me laugh out loud.These people never explain their reasons for thinking that because i guess they don't have any.These are mostly those ignorant fools who don't even know the whole thing or what someone has to say.They hardly have any sense of humour. Coming back to Dilwale,it is the best Rohit Shetty directorial yet.He has never made a more complete film.Yes there are the fun high octane elements for which he is known for but the important and amazing thing is that he has tried to do something new to extend his horizons which I loved.He has added a whole new dimension to his filmmaking. The film is beautifully shot with great songs,special mention to Gerua and Janam Janam.The actions scenes which are considered to be Rohit's forte have been a real surprise.The film has some really great action sequences and car chases which can give most Hollywood films a run for their money. The film rides on the performances of its lead pair.SRK-Kajol have done what they do best,set the screen on fire with their sparkling and amazing performances.Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon play their parts well.Kajol and Kriti Sanon look breathtakingly beautiful in the movie.The story is intense and passionate and about love and forgiveness.Its a well made family entertainer which can be watched with your friends,family or like me ALONE.!! One final word about all those so called THINKING people saying crap without even watching and throwing words like brainless film around..i think they are the ones who are brainless as I am sure they have watched many films which can be called brainless.Dilwale is far from brainless. So go and have fun.Tukur Tukur dekh taka tak!!!"

Dialogues are very simple (not even a single dialogue touch my heart). Poor direction with Varun dhawan. Seriously this was not the Varun we saw in Badalapur and Abcd2. The music contributed 50% of the movie specially Arijit Singh songs. The music and the location are the saving grace of this movie. Johny lever is wasted. Sanjay Mishra And Boman Irani tries so hard to make the film not boring. they did pretty good job though. Overall Good movie but with these starcast, storyline and the budget, Diwale should have gone to another level.\ufeff Its an Average film. You can go with your family and watch it but dnt expect too much with SRK - Kajol Chemistry."

        "review_title": "An Objective Review from A Passionate Movie Watcher",
        "review_detailed_main": "Don't get me wrong; I'm a die hard SRK fan. But when I do reviews, I always want to do them very objectively. I think it is highly disgraceful that some people have been giving this movie 1/10. If Dilwale was a 1/10, then PRDP (probably the worst movie of the year) must have been very far in the negative numbers. Even they know that almost no movies deserve that low. They like to exaggerate everything and have no integrity, so please do not consider those reviews in your decision to watch the film. I have put together an objective review of the film, not giving any points for the fact that I'm an SRK fan, and not deducting large amounts of points after being disappointed.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Dilwale is entertaining for sure. It keeps viewers engaged and gives them a fun time, but when you walk away from the film, you do not feel as if you have watched something great. The movie is an enjoyable 1 time watch for families, and I recommend that you go see it...but don't expect this movie to be of the caliber that SRK movies usually are.\n\nThe Good: Dilwale has wonderful acting by its cast. Khan, Kajol, and Dhawan perform admirably in their roles, and Kriti Sanon doesn't disappoint either. The movie is very visually stunning, and just as all SRK movies, you can see that no expense was spared in making it. The movie is comedic throughout, and some of the jokes make you laugh. The ones that don't still leave you with a smile. The action looks great, and the SRK- Kajol chemistry, though nowhere as good as it has been in the past, is definitely worth watching. Varun Dhawan, as usual, keeps you laughing, and pulls off his role very well.\n\nThe Bad: In 5 words: Rohit Shetty and the script. Rohit Shetty is by far one of the most tasteless directors. His style of directing works by attracting viewers from some lower income parts of India, but if learned to actually direct a film, his films may be entertaining to other groups of viewers as well. The movie's direction almost makes you a little nauseous. Parts of the movie are thrown together as if the director believes that movie making is filming a bunch of scenes separately and putting them in a boiling pot and expecting a great product out of it. The script of the movie is not great either. The ideas involved in the script had potential for one of the best movies of the decade, but the script completely detracted from that potential. Some dialogues were good, but many were not. I guess Rohit Shetty likes choosing these poorly made scripts though, judging from his track record.\n\nConcluding Remarks: This movie would have been nothing without the cast. The script was not worthy of any of the actors, but their charming performances made the movie enjoyable and definitely watchable. When you go into this movie, you know that it has Shah Rukh Khan, possibly the greatest actor to have ever lived. You know it has Varun Dhawan, unarguably the best new bollywood actor. And you know it has Kajol, also one of the best female actors in the industry. You expect so much from the film, and the film falls very short, with 1 man to blame: Rohit Shetty. That being said, if you go in with the expectations that this movie is not a Shahrukh Khan movie, then you will enjoy it. When we think of Shahrukh Khan, we think of masterpieces like Swades, ChakDe, Veer Zaara, or Jab Tak Hai Jaan. This movie is nowhere close to the standard of his movies, but it is still fun to watch. Go give it a try and have some fun."

If it was not for this the movie would have been 1/10\n\nI would recommend if you are a big SRK fan then go watch this movie at the cinema otherwise if your bored and having nothing better to do buy a DVD and watch it at home. Personally i would chose this movie over bajirao mastani. Finally JAnam JAnam i believe is one of the best songs of 2015 by far. HATs off"

I entered the cinema with not so many expectations but it made me jaw-dropped how the film turned out in front of my eyes.\n\nThe first fifteen minutes were tedious and weren't able to get my attention whatsoever but then the movie takes pace and suddenly I even couldn't divert my attention at my will (I was busy eating and savoring my burger which I then forgot that I had to finish it too).\n\nThe direction and cinematography is exceptional especially in Bulgaria and the song of course \"GERUA\" which we all know was shot in Iceland. The think tank and Rohit Shetty did a great job in presenting those picturesque-colorful sets. Varun's role suited his style of acting and not to forget mentioning Kriti was decent too along with the sparkling performances of Sanjay Mishra, Johnny Lever and the chubby guy with Varun.\n\nThe comedy is there to be gagged about and the action is sub-par as per the Bollywood standards as we know how Bollywood action is so it was clich\u00e9 and nothing to critique about. SRK and Kajol were great too and lived up to their stakes. The music was impeccable kudos to PRITAM for giving out yet another great album.\n\nPeople who are thinking to watch the film should definitely go for it, don't bother about the critics. I am not a big fan of Bollywood too but this made me to post this message.\n\nOverall DILWALE is 9/10. :)"

All you get are a lot of action shots, explosions and over the top, comical violence.\n\nKajol's acting was good, SRK was OK. Cant really blame them since they don't have much to work with here.\n\nThis is more a Festive season money grab, than an honest attempt at making a good movie. Throw in a couple of Big stars supported by a cast of young actors and comedians,some funny dialogues and make a lot of money.Whether the movie has a plot or not doesn't seem to matter anymore.\n\nAfter the RA-ONE fiasco, i honestly thought that SRK had made a genuine mistake and that he wouldn't do films like that again. But after this one, I don't intend to go for his movies anymore. I will download them, thank you.\n\nI think that more than my monetary loss, i am just angry that they let such great talents like King Khan and Kajol go to waste."

Varun was driving a car and meet the other girl ( don't know her name sorry ) so much comedy but its a same old comedy that we have experience in the past nothing you will remember once you walk out of the theater. according to me peoples should stop watching and supporting this kind of cinema. Shah Ruk was exactly like his past movies he never live up to his stardom for past 5 years calls him self king khan but i think hes is finished and he should retire from acting instead of making films like Chennai express, happy new year, Dil Wale, jab Tak Hai Jaan, and Ra One etc. Kajol what can i say about her. shes been retire for a while now and the brought her back to rob Desi's because of the major success Jodi in the past DDLJ. and shes was average because of the bad story line. Varun's over acted a little bit. Boman Irani had a very small role and he was annoying the whole time. last but least very bad direction by Rohit Shetty. he blow up to many cars i cant call this a action movie or a comedy nor a romantic movie its a mixture of everything one of the scene was copied from tom cruise's movie mission impossible. last words its a yet again big disappointment from Shah Ruk"

        "review_detailed_main": "Amidst the hell like confusing dilemma over two choices \"Dilwale\" and \"Bajirao Mastani \" , I opted out for Dilwale expecting a rom-com- action thriller.\n\nThough , story barely has anything new in it , some action sequences are surely new and fresh for eyes. The twists and turns ,The comic punches (Thanks to Sajid-Farhad) , The star cast (First time Shahrukh , Varun and Kriti coming together ) , and of course the Locations - everything is out of the world. The story though not kind of new but it is highly engaging & it is the main key of DILWALE.\n\nThe action sequences , The Cinematography , The Performances , The Music , The magic of adorable pair SRK \u2013 KAJOL , The Dialogues , The Comedy , and The fascinating locations - ALL ARE TERRIFIC !\n\nDilwale is full on family entertainer . It is not merely a good film but it also has tremendous repeat value. Especially SRK fans will visit the theaters at least 3 times . Dilwale has all the ingredients that one masala film should have . It would not be an overstatement to say that \u2013 Had the clash been avoided , Dilwale would have broken and surpassed even P.K's record within 10 days . In movies like Dilwale you don't need to apply logic but watch it with your heart only.\n\nOn the whole , Dilwale is a sure shot Winner and a Block Buster . It will set many records. Now take your family and rush to meet these Dilwale. You will not at all feel disappointed but will be happy that you have utilized money in a great film.\n\nCompared to Dilwale, BAJIRAO MASTANI is a crap! I got bored while watching it. If I have 2 free tickets of any movie, I will watch Dilwale twice but not Bajirao Mastani.\n\nHighly recommended !"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched Dilwale for Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. And they remain the only reason that make the film (re)watchable.\n\nWhen comparing with the film's overall impression, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol shine in the movie. They both look great (particularly Kajol) and play convincingly romance and comedy in their part of the story. Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon, as their siblings and the younger generation couple, are not bad but in comparison to older stars their characters are faint.\n\nThe story, simple and ridiculous, is not that bad as it sounds. Separated lovers, who met in Bulgaria 15 years earlier, meet again in Goa, where their siblings get to know each other, not aware of their families' past. This story, with addition of mafia plots, has its moments, e.g. A five-minutes date, Meera's confessions, Pogo and Ramlal story, some dialogues of Raj and Veer or the line \"15 saal, 4 maheene, 10 din\" perfect for my Hindi elementary course.\n\nI may live with clich\u00e9s or the adopted convention for action scenes and fights, it is tolerable. Cinematography with bright colours is pleasant. But as a comedy the film fails too often. In Dilwale too often I see a joke but I don't laugh. Who is to blame, I don't know. Director, editor, screenwriter, actors, culture/language differences? Varun Sharma's and Sanjay Mishra's scenes just don't work for me. Even Johnny Lever was not his usual. I appreciate, however, Boman Irani as King. Finally, the most irritating in the film were slow-motion scenes with tingling background score that created overdramatic atmosphere.\n\nI also have mixed feelings about the music and songs. The returning dominating music theme got on my nerves. Some songs are good. I like \"Daayre\" and \"Gerua\". \"Janam janam\" is good as a song but its picturisation does not appeal to me as a part of the film story. \"Gerua\" is really a nice music clip as a part of the film and on its own, but a bit kitschy.\n\nGenerally Dilwale is a disappointing average film and a missed opportunity for a really entertaining comedy with romance and action. Watch it though if you like Kajol's and SRK's on-screen reunions. Their charm still works. References to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge are therefore easily digestible."

Second, when Kajol confess for her love cam way too soon.\n\nIn terms of production value, the film has some great locations, sets and definitely some stunning color designs and palettes'\n\nCinematography was very well done, Directing was 50-50 wasn't that great but ACTING was horrible! And that where the directing comes in, Rohit should know by now that not all the plots should have cars. Rohm has made some bad choices in terms of directing. There was this very intense emotional scene towards the end of the third act, the was it was directed, I ended up laughing my ass off, not me but the entire theater laughed at that scene.\n\nBollywood, please stop hiring those writers who do not know anything about the plots!"

This movie wasn't tragic, too romantically intense or ridiculous; it was simply a \"sit back and relax\" kind of movie.\n\nThe only thing in the movie that annoyed me was the 5 minute date. That was a bit corny, but not intolerable.\n\nI found this movie to be very entertaining! It had a good story, it was fun (Johnny Lever always makes me laugh), and of course, SRK and Kajol were best matched as a couple for this movie.\n\nSo, I would have to give this movie a definite thumbs up!"

It's Sanjay Mishra who emerges out as the only actor who delivers yet another stunning comic performance as a guy having penchant for rhyming his sentences with brand names. Second it's Kajol performance, though far away from Mishra's performance, that brings out intensity on the screen. Very poor script, even worse screenplay, uneven editing and pathetic performances by rest of the cast. Comparing it with legendary DDLJ would be an insult to the latter. Going to watch it can kill your belief in Bollywood itself. Its horrible. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED. But if you still believe paid reviews, go and take the risk!

Even the songs of this film are uninspiring(most overrated songs). Arijit Singh's style of singing every song in same pattern made soundtrack worse.He already ruined Emran Hashmi and this time he did the same thing with SRK. Its my sincere request to everyone that don't waste your time and money on this crap.If you will encourage movies like this,than you are not going to get something good from Bollywood in future. 0.05 / 10"

You start wondering if there was even any descent plot in the first place when they started auditioning for this.\n\nBesides, there are no good story tellers left in Bollywood and the director proves the point amply.

But, as an admirer of your acting,I want you to see you in some sensible films rather than these useless movies.Last Classic from you was in 2010 as My Name Is Khan.Though,Don 2 can be considered marginally.Hopefully, the upcoming FAN & Raees will satisfy me ! ... Coming to the film, Unexpectedly,Rohit Shetty changed his directorial pattern & tried to pour some story & logic in his recently released directorial venture which has been expectedly concluded with the term of \"One time watch\". The two gigantic monuments in the history of Indian film industry & their renowned heart-warming chemistry went waste due to lack of proper execution & typical monotonous story-line of Revenge,Betrayal & Love. I think, Indian cine-goers have been moved way forward now-a-days to see those romantic couple dance in colourful dresses among yellow tulip flowers or some hill areas with the backdrop of beautiful sunset or to tolerate boring family drama. 1st half was decent but second half was thoroughly disappointing & charmless. After the 1st twist, the whole scenario of the film was crystal clear. Action scenes were superb, I have to admit. Comedy scenes seemed raffle & worthless. Even That USP of a Rohit Shetty film i.e. 'Entertainment' was very much missing in that film. Nevertheless, its a collaboration of \"King of Entertainment\" & \"King of Bollywood\" along with the presence of historical 'SRK- Kajol' pair. & it has been entitled with the name Dilwale. So, I should use Heart more rather than to use my Brain. Hahahah!!!\n\nP.S.: Thanks torrent for saving my money."

I mean, the story (if they have one) is so ridiculous and predictable from the very beginning itself. I still don't find a reason why they can't invest a little more time and effort on the story if they can spend millions on silly car crashes and stunts. Afterall, story is more important, right?I don't think that even SRK fans would find this movie enjoyable. This clich\u00e9d piece of art has ruined my Christmas.\n\nHowever there are some Pros(-for the sake of saying-) * Good visual effects, especially the Gerua song. * Bollywood's prettiest couple comes once again. * Varun Dhavan and Kriti Sanon makes a cute jodi. * Boman Irani's character (though out of place, he has given some laughter) * Songs are superb. * Some wonderfully modified cars can be seen."

Bollywood should soon go back to old era where movies were made out of good scripts and brilliant acting.I could not stand even SRK's acting in this film even though I am a great fan of him. SRK, please stay away from directors like Rohit for not being part of shitty movies like this. Talking about the positive side, Songs are sounding nice which people can watch via you-tube and Arijit melody number is superb. This is shaming the Kajol-SRK pair which was cherished by the movie goers for a long time. The guy who worked behind dialogues does not fit to his job. Comedy is brought down to a level where nobody gets a good laugh. In a nutshell, the movie don't even deserve a single star. I gave it for arijit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rohit Shetty and team are back again with Shah Rukh Khan. This time, the star casts are bigger including Kajol, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Boman Irani, Johny Lever, Varun Sharma and Sanjay Mishra. Concept is not new. But the presentation is. Comedy part of the film is very high along with high doze of action scenes. We can see emotional scenes for the first time in Rohit's movie. Locations are fabulous. Though Gerua song doesn't look like real, but, it is. All the action sequences were shoot with the help of stuntmen, and believe me, it's a hard job as I'd seen the making. Srk looks stunning. His charming gestures has aw-struck feelings for the ladies. As I have heard many times in the hall. Whistles have been played when Srk develop the angry expression for the first time. That scene was paisa-wasul. Varun Dhawan is the second lead in male. He is good, and his tunning with Srk is superb. Their emotional scene is one of the plus points. Kajol looks beautiful. Her pair with Srk is the best. I love her in all her films, so this time too she rolled it. Her character has many shades, and she portrays every shade superbly. Kriti looks gorgeous. She suits with the film and Varun, too. Varun Sharma is a good comedian. His solo speech is awesome. Johny Lever is as usual. Boman Irani is nice. The man, Sanjay Mishra is too good. Kabir Bedi and Vinod Khanna have cameo roles, and they are perfect. Dialogues have been penned by Farhad-Sajid. Humor is more compare to Chennai Express. But, it is less compare to Golmaal series. Music by Pritam is good. Gerua is a hit. Janam Janam is as well. Emotion song is cool. Tukur Tukur is suitable in the end titles. I don't get the reason why they put that slow song in the last 20 minutes. I mean it's unnecessary. Lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya is enjoyable. On the whole, SRK-Kajol lovers have to watch them on the silver screen. I'm sure I don't want to say to Srk's fans to watch this, because they will for sure. Others may find it slow and boring. But, definitely a one time watch in the theater."

The script is okay, and I would give it a 3.0/10.0 Kajol acting was remarkable and was the only exception to what could be a disaster movie. Kajol memorable on screen skills should be the highlight of the movie. 8.0/10.0 SRK : 5.0/10.0 Other cast : 3.0/10.0 Duration of the movie was like Koyla, never ending boredom. My recommendations would be go for other flicks if you have an option and is a little choosy when it comes down to monthly movie pick. Previous Rohit shetty movies were outstanding, and seems Rohit has not hit the nerve of the audiences this time. My best wishes to Rohit for this one."

Their is no vulgarity after a long i have seen a movie like this. Don't miss this movie. People were laughing loudly and crying in many scenes.

And the movie contains too many songs which helped only to increase it's run- time, nothing more. The movie comes nowhere near DDLJ I don't know why these people promoted it so. It's high time for SRK to start giving importance to the stories instead of his friendships."

        "review_detailed_main": "After Bajrangi Bhaijaan if there was one movie I went to watch with high hopes it was Dilwale. The Salman Khan-starrer proved to be good much beyond my expectations. It was time for Shah Rukh Khan to show his magic. So how did I find the film. Here's my take on it:\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\na) Few of the tracks in the movie esp. Janam Janam is fantastic b) Varun Dhawan puts in a very good performance c) The performance of the Support cast esp. Johnny Lever & Sanjai Mishra is beyond words. They are simply amazing and gives you a lot to laugh about. Varun Sharma & Mukesh Tiwari are good as well\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\na) Horrible storyline!!! One little twist that is there in the movie, comes in the first 45 mins. Everything else in the film is predictable, boring and will not keep you engaged. It is time Rohit Shetty realizes that cars flying do not make good movies. b) Shah Rukh Khans performance is ordinary. As much as you think he would create magic on the screen, he doesn't. He is playing the role of a ex-don in the movie but I don't think he's able to pull that off either. c) As for Kajol, She couldn't have chosen a worse comeback film. Her performance too is nothing you would remember. She also looks fat and is at times an eye soar. d) Kirti Sanon's performance is bland as well. She did a far better job in Heropanti. e) Dialogues in the movie are below par. One line \"Hum Shareef Kya Hue, Poori Duniya Hi Badmash Ban Gayi\" doesn't make up for the rest.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nDon't spend your hard earned money on this one. Absolutely not worth it."

I was actually celebrating the release of a Rohit Shetty film, a film that had SRK, Kajol, Johnny Lever, Boman Irani.\n\nMy expectations were so brutally crushed after watching Dilwale that I believe that Shah Rukh Khan's heyday is now over. With films like Happy New Year and Dilwale he has stopped influencing me with his innate charisma.\n\nThe story line is exceedingly predictable. Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon's love story is like a sleep-inducing narrative. SRK and Kajol's love story was so overdone that you feel like leaving the theater during the interval. I will be reasonably disappointed if this banal film earns considerable profits.\n\nThe only positive aspect of the film was the 5-minutes comedy sequence involving Johnny Lever. But by the time you reach to this funny scene, you feel exhausted.\n\nWith boring films like Tamasha and Dilwale, Bollywood needs to seriously reconsider the type of entertainment it wants to deliver."

There is nothing new in name of story. Step brother, rival kids love angle then Ghar Jamai issue that's all in the name of freshness and emotions. Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is OK for comedy scenes but again very stale in love scenes like formula to bring the parted love birds together, giving lift to needy girl, then problem in scooty and lots of such type of stale scenes. Even film starts with a very cheesy scene of a person covering up a person, who has been caught stealing goods for sake of his brother. Dialogues by Sajid-Farhad are good but it fail when comes to justify love scenes. So many scenes are exaggerated, so though it was interesting but ends as being irritating due to length. Like, Varun Dhawan and Varun Sharma confront scene, Pankaj Tripathi and Mukesh Rishi telling past to Varun Dhavan. A hard core international don's son name is Kali!!! What for it? Terror or comedy? Another character, King is there, he reveals chilling fact that he had killed his father and then next moments starts competing with comedian? Two international dons fires on each other even being aware that both will get killed not by impulse but after thinking for sometime!? Were they stupid? Characters are badly conceived. Performance wise Jony Lever is just outstanding. He evokes laughter even in old and stale scenes. All credit goes to his expression and timing. Shahrukh Khan is good. Kajol is fine. Varun Dhavan is justified. Varun Sharma is OK. Mukesh Rishi and Pankaj Tripathi support very well. Kirti Sanon is average. Music wise Geruaa is melodious and its visuals are just breath taking."

Well, despite such big names associated to this biggie, The Writing & The Execution plays a spoilsport. The wholesome entertainment value, is missing here!\n\n'Dilwale' Synopsis: Two former lovers (SRK & Kajol) with a volatile past, reunite years later, due to their siblings (Varun Dhawan & Kirti Sanon), who fall for each other.\n\n'Dilwale' has a mostly weak first-hour, where the humour & the characters, both, don't engage you. The only element in this hour that works to an extend, is the flashback. The portions in the flashback fair better, than what is served in present. The twist at the interval point is predictable & the second-hour also scores low on energy. Also, among the two love-stories, the one with the legendary on-screen pair, is comparatively better, as the other love-story in line, offers nothing.\n\nRohit Shetty knows how to entertain audiences, but sadly, 'Dilwale' is his weakest effort to date. The Entertainment Factor is missing here. All you take home is a few moments & some comical punches. Yunus Sajawal's Screenplay needed a bigger heart. There are too many loopholes in the narrative, although a few sequences are decently done. But, A stronger Screenplay was the need here! Cinematography, Editing & The Action-sequences are strictly okay. Pritam's Score is good.\n\nPerformance-Wise: The legendary pairing of SRK & Kajol is the reason why 'Dilwale' has gotten so much attention. But its Kajol who delivers a credible performance, adding some weight to her weakly written character. SRK isn't in form this time, he looks jaded here. Varun Dhawan hams. Its surprisingly to see the otherwise talented actor summit to such buffoonery. Kirti Sanon looks pretty, but gets nothing to do. Of the supporting cast, Johnny Lever, Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari & Pankaj Tripathi lend great comedic energy & deliver some of the most rubbish lines, with ease. Boman Irani, Vinod Khanna & Kabir Bedi are wasted.\n\nOn the whole, 'Dilwale' doesn't work, despite a few merits."

I dunno how SRK is watching his own movies may be his days are counting now as an actor.\n\nOverall i only see the stand point was effort of Varun Dhawan in entire movie i felt he tried to make presence in the movie felt but i would recommend SRK not to destroy this young lads career thank you !!"

The movie is excellent.. the best movie of this year. Team Rohit Shetty has done an excellent work again. You will not detached from the movie for a second once the movie begins. The story has heart stopping climax.. and that makes the movie awesome... Legendary pair of Srk-Kajol the king and the queen of Bollywood and the heartthrob Varun & Kriti were spectacular. The fight scenes have its own uniqueness and Rohit Shetty's teams work is now like Hollywood movies.. the drifting of cars the gun fights the car chase and the death defining stunts were awesome. The movie has complete entertainment. The songs has awesome timing with the story.. Arjit n Pritam has done a great work. Gerua and Janam Janam are the best songs along with Manma Emotion Jage.. Kajol was looking stunning.. and Kriti was so so cute.. A complete entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dilwale is another movie directed by Rohit Shetty and stars Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Varun Dhawan. and Kriti Sanon. The story is of 2 families with a bad history who learn to fall in love again. So far it sounds pretty good. And the performances were all good. I only have one problem with the acting: Kajol had to act as somewhat of a gangster for half the movie and that just didn't really work for me. Also the songs were very well done. I guess you can say the action was serviceable for this movie's plot. (Classic Rohit Shetty car chases in which there's a bunch of cars toppling over in slow motion, and the hand-to-hand combat scenes and shootouts were OK.)\n\nSo where does this movie go wrong? It is because of all the subplots. This movie is labeled as a comedy and I don't really get why. This movie does not need to be a comedy but a drama. It gets dramatic but the comedic scenes kind of take the real drama away from the real plot. And the comedy wasn't even that funny. I didn't really laugh at all except for a few instances. The character of King (Boman Irani): why is he in this movie??? I have no idea why. He literally does nothing and his character had no place in this plot. I won't spoil the ending but it was so dumb because (you guessed it) King was involved in the dumbest way possible. The movie would have been a lot better without him.\n\nOverall, I expected a lot more from Dilwale. I really enjoyed Shetty's other films like Chennai Express but I'm not really sure what happened here. By far the best aspect of Dilwale was the interaction between Kajol and Shahrukh Khan, which was a delight to see them both on screen together again. Dilwale could have been something special if it was executed properly, but it unfortunately wasn't. But the awkward comedy and dumb subplots kind of ruined the movie. This might actually be Rohit Shetty's worst film to date. With the competition between Bajirao Mastani and Dilwale, Dilwale is a huge disappointment; Bajirao is clearly the better film.\n\nFrom A+ to F, Dilwale gets a D+."

But it's a movie to be preserved in collections once the DVD is out and To go and watch again and again in cinema halls its celebration redefined. The second lead pair Varun Dhavan and Kriti Sanon uses the opportunity to the maximum and this will be a landmark film in their careers. After all when the king is on your side you cannot go wrong."

In between you might loose the grip of the movie, but the songs and romance keeps you attached with the movie.\n\nShetty (director) has got the best bollywood pair back on screen and has done a great job.

I was so happy that it showed up in Netflix and didn't waste any time to waiting to watch it. But, after finishing this 2 hr and 33 min movie, I don't think it was all that. I didn't care for the songs and the movie felt like it was on a cheap budget because of all the green screens they used. I will always love Kajol and SRK, but I felt their characters weren't that good. Their whole story was the clich\u00e9 \"old time love at first sight\" situation that gets screwed up because of a misunderstanding. The few action scenes were a little cool but the action part is just last because the the \"whole love story mess\" and \"family first\" theme comes first. Also, those new actors, I found their characters to be pretty stupid (probably cause they were supposed to be the comedy part of the movie). Anyway, I rated the movie a four because there are some good parts but overall, the movie's just a cheesy romance."

The other actors are efficient. Negatives of course are that it could have been more on the drama/romantic side to cater to SRK-Kajol fans and less of the Rohit Shetty style. Too much of silly comedy drags proceedings in second half. But overall, its an entertaining watch, especially if you are an SRK-Kajol fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is once again nothing more than 'a mixed chaat' offered by the team taking references from here and there and presenting the same old things in a new smartly packaged product entirely relying on the two big names of SRK and KAJOL.\n\nOpening in a typical filmy style riding high on the brotherly emotion, the big brother influence of HUM is clearly there but with a highly artificial or less impactful execution ruining a potential plot. As a result you never feel anything emotional happening on the screen at all amongst the routine cars explosions, gun-fires, gang- wars and all forced comic sequences in the initial hour. In fact the flashback giving you the glimpses of the magical pairing of SRK- KAJOL comes as the only relief element in the first half along with the fresh looks of Varun Dhawan and Kriti in particular. But at the same time it's pretty strange to see the overplayed song GERUA inserted at such a bad moment when you are just about to walk out expecting an interval. Besides here we also have another inspired sequence of '5 minute date' lifted from one of the episodes of a famous western TV Series HOW I MET YOU MOTHER.\n\nPost intermission, the film continues with the same old routine storyline of gang rivalry, misconceptions leading to separation and then silly schemes being planned to unite the big couple again. But the most painful time watching DILWALE comes in its final hour when you repeatedly wish the film to finish off in the very next scene but the director refuses to do so and keeps on throwing vague (comic) sequences one after another adding to the unbearable length of more than 150 minutes. And wait, here too after almost 130-135 minutes you again have a song 'Daayre' that forces you to see your watch or mobile phone in quick intervals.\n\nRegarding the music, many might have liked the song \"Gerua\" but it was actually the 'Late Gulshan Kumar strategy' working here for the makers wherein he believed a song could be made famous by playing it on every possible format in a repeated mode by paying more. So honestly 'Gerua' and all other songs of the film were just average numbers for me (expect the enjoyable 'Tukur Tukur'), maybe because I am still unable to tolerate any kind of loud SCREAMING in love songs composed without any heart touching melody. Plus the so lame story- telling by Rohit didn't really allow me to feel impressed by either the cinematography, background score or dialogues, that once again give you a strong feeling of 'heard before' (read TANU WEDS MANU RETURNS).\n\nIn all, DILWALE was a big disappointment for me and the only performance I loved watching in it was of Sanjay Mishra, saying his witty one liners in an entertaining style. However if you still wish to know what's in store here in comparison to the director's last SRK film, then DILWALE is not even close to Rohit's CHENNAI EXPRESS that at least had Deepika Padukone as its biggest savior."

Varun Dhavan (SRK's brother) and Kriti (Kajol' s sister) fall in love only to find out that their siblings had a connection in the past.\n\nThe screenplay is filled with utter mediocrity, jokes from Shetty's Whats App never work, situations are forced to bring a comic relief every now and then but it doesn't make any sense.\n\nVarun Dhawan hams and his screen presence is highly irritating. Vinod Khanna, Kabir Bedi and Sanjay Mishra have been completely wasted though Sanjay Mishra brings a smile with his peculiar dialogue delivery and uttering several brand names. Johnny Lever does his usual stuff, the slapstick comedy is forced. Kriti Sanon is just an eye candy and occasionally comes on the screen.\n\nThe SRK-Kajol factor works slightly but it never rekindles the romance we have already seen. We see many signature notions of their previous movies to validate that we are watching SRK and Kajol.\n\nThen we see typical scenes of flying cars defying every rule of gravity, some timidly choreographed action scenes and a song shot in the Iceland.\n\nI think it is high time and people should not appreciate such kind of cinema.\n\nDilwale is a sheer wastage of time and money."

We can't think of a greater compliment to pay him than to say with full confidence that no man could play Raj role better than Shah Rukh KhanThe movie script is totally unique. In every single action there is a constant motion, and all cuts are perfect and the camera stays on the actor's faces more close-up than usual. I don't want to tell the story which is the main hero of the film u will be amazed .comedy is very catch and sound . music gives the feel like u inaction mode..so i will highly recommend this movie .go and watch with your family .you will be highly amazed...."

        "review_detailed_main": "What we can say about this anticipated movie? Not to set it on high hopes is a good thing to do. One credit given for each SRK and Kajol, they were amazing in half way, but their chemistry isn't spark as before, but it is still nice to see them again. (It's a treat for the fans though)\n\nVarun Dhawan along with Johnny Lever and Varun Sharma is a best choice to live it up, and so duo Boman Irani and Sanjay Mishra for another side of comedy is should be credited to 2 points. Not so good story yet still make viewers laugh so hardly in theaters, so Rohit Shetty is not fail to make this one. Do not over thinking about others' speculation about this is a bad movie, should be skipped or what. I admitted that the story is so easy to be cracked, and the way they solve the problem is not that unique, since its for family movie, it is just legit.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the direction, but I think the story itself should be rearrange in a good method of a gangster and the afterlife of a gangster. I think the production team is a bit confuse to choose whether to make a solid romance or action. It is no YRF or Karan Johar's legacy of work, so it is fair to put romance in that way.\n\nAgain, this Dilwale is for Dilwale type. Whose have big heart for their idols and craving for them to romance one more. What happen in Bulgaria deserve one sole point of rating, so I gave 5 of 10.\n\nIt might be a bad movie for some people, but it always left smile to use whenever we finished it."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are a true fan of a particular actor/person, never let go of their side even if others or social media say so. Example: The movie, Dilwale. What I read from reviews and memes including the spoof video, I was not planning to see the movie but I thought whenever I wanted to feel good about Indian movies, SRK is always there in my top list. So I decided to watch and these are my opinions about the film: Rohit shetty, u did much better direction than Chennai Express and Golmaal series. In fact, watching this movie, I have faith in your concept just like that of Farhan Akthar and Rajkumar Hirani . SRK ,thank you so much for looking good, great stunts, apt expressions and acting is so good, for teaming up with Kajol(yes, she can be a great villain-Gupt and be an amazing heroine- Kkhh and,go back and forth the personalities in one movie) and under Rohit Shetty and Gauri Khan's production, she doesn't have to be vulgar, can still drive sports cars and can fight fiercely. I knew Srk won't let his fans down and he never has done worst to anyone in his family, personal or in his professional life. And he continues to give more than what he can. David Dhawan, you acted clean with looks,comedy and worth being SRK's bro. Kriti, even though Kajol pushed you back in many scenes, thank you for being you and acting normal. Johnny lever as Manibhai, Kabir Bedi as Kajol's dad/don malik ,Boman Irani as king and Vinod Khanna as SRK's dad/randhir (yes, the casting crew did add some 80-90's glamour )acted so decently that I actually watched the film till the ending credits read Rohit Shetty and team. Thank you so much, Red Chillies, for bringing to us, a great entertainer. I'm sure many would hate this film just because they can't digest the efforts but the real moviegoers can't deny the fact how much effort is put into this movie and what a great watchable+feel good+ money minting movie is this! So thankful for this great experience!"

We are all excited about the release of Dilwale. I am like THERE on the 18th. I was writing a preview before the film's release. It would be wonderful if you could share some insights or hand me some clues about what is in store for us. I am sure it would be better than Singham 2 which was a complete mass entertainer with power-packed drama, hi-intensity dialogue and towering performances as its aces (from my review).\n\nWith love,\n\nTaran.\n\nShetty's reply:\n\nDear Taran,\n\nHave you read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World? Essentially, we are in the technological age which is characterized by a lack of interest in intellectual pursuits. A succession of thrills is what is required. According to Alain De Botton - the constant challenge of modern relationships is how to prove more interesting than the other's smart-phone. Same is the case with cinema.\n\nI am the foot soldier for the post-modern culture that will take India over in the next 20 years.\n\nWith love,\n\nRohit\n\nPs: Kajol will be seen in a completely new avatar. Nobody will ever call her a dusky beauty after Dilwale.\n\nTaran Adarsh's reply:\n\nI cant wait. It sounds so slick and absorbing.\n\nWith love,\n\nTaran."

Varun Dhawan does some decent role but sometime he overacts so much. Kajol looks good with her acting. Kriti sanon has nothing much to do. Borman iranis king role was irritating\n\nThere is no story in the movie. There are some really funny moments in the movie which will make u laugh out of it and there are some scenes which are so boring and dull. The action Sequences are good but they seemed like too much forced in the movie.Music and background music is beautiful.\n\nOverall Average Family Entertainer. Masala fan u will love it. Fan of movie with a story skip it.\n\nSRK Seriously needs to skip Farah khan and Rohit Shetty and work in films like Chak De India , My name is khan.\n\nHoping for the best with Raees And Fan Review 2.5/5"

I liked Chennai Express was a decent movie at least. When Kajol said in an interview that she will get a taught role what can prove that she can do more i believed her, but after i saw this movie i think she just said for nothing. I love her and Srk but, there is nothing new in this movie. She done same role over and over again. Even fans of SRK-Kajol couple got sick of same thing over and over. Really people try to do something new. This things do not work anymore. I hope Bajirao Mastani is better than this, in fact i believe that Bajirao Mastani it will be 10 times better that this stupid movie. Sorry fans of SRK-KAJOL but this movie do not deserve even 1 star. If i could gave -11 i would definitely give it."

OK maybe storyline could have been better but it was worth just watching Srk and Kajol together. They still created the magic and the bond the 2 brothers share bring a warmth to the heart. People are always criticizing Srk films. Why ??? Yet they give some much importance to Salman's films!!! Kick and Bhajrangi Bhaijan were boring and annoying. Kick had no storyline at all yet people think Salman is great. I don't understand that. Dilwale is 10x better than these films.

These new actors are really really great... but sharukh kind of ppl just don't let them perform more in their movie... Just allowing them in his movie to put some glamor as he is already old and can not create any glamor. BTW he was never a glamor except couple of movie. Kajol is now really really old. Wrinkle are clearly visible. Story sucks.. as somebody said.. Kajor unethically remembers his old love all time but never remembers his dead husband. what kind of story is this ? totally makes no sense. Don't watch , don't waste."

        "review_detailed_main": "To start of, let's separate the contents into 6 parts. Story, Rohit Shetty, Varun and Kriti, Miscellaneous, Kajol and Shahrukh Khan.\n\nStory - Have you watched Tamasha? There's a beautiful sequence where the storyteller says that all the stories are the same. Boy meets girl, fall in love and history repeats itself again n again. Now, how you treat that same old story is what matters. This one, predictable yet so spicy and indulging throughout. Rohit shetty surely knows how to spice it up.\n\nComing to Rohit himself, the hit man surely knows how to churn out hits after hits on a constant basis. His armory of slapstick punches and gravity defying stunts seem to be unending. Now comes the glitch. His approach towards a love sequence or so to a say his depiction of a love story seems a bit premature. When you have king and queen working under your direction you must add up some more sizzling sequences between them.\n\nVarun and Kriti - The worst part of any movie is when the actors don't how they have to enact and what their role is in the larger picture. This is exactly what these 2 dint do. They knew very well that this is a SRK-Kajol Movie and supported them throughout and beautifully. Even their own spaces were equally important for the growth of the movie. Varun acted really well specially in all the comic scenes. Kriti did unexpectedly well.\n\nMiscellaneous - All the other actors have done justice to their roles. Action and comedy sequences were equally pulled of with grace and grandeur. Some of the comedy sequences are definitely world class (critics also say so :P).\n\nKajol - Forget that you know kajol. Just assume that you are watching a Bollywood movie for the first time. The idea you will get from her role and appearance is she is the leading actress in the industry who has been ruling for last 6-8 years. Yes, she is that much confident, convincing, subtle and strong in the flick. Well, do I need to specify her chemistry with her opposite number? I guess you'll find that in every review wink emoticon. Would just want to say that they just dint seem to be out of touch .. not even for a day. God, how does Gauri tolerate all these??\n\nShah Rukh Khan - Is there any word that hasn't been used to describe his screen presence and undeniable awe? He loves, He cries, He fights and finally stretches his arms and reminds everyone that you can try your bloody best but when the king reigns you must bow down. His recent movies may have not been critically acclaimed but one can't deny that in each trial the man is maturing leaps and bounds. The ease with which he portrays a lover, a brother and a dark character is something one should look up to. One stand out point which may sound a bit freakish is that from a personal point of view SRK has executed the action sequences better than the romantic sequences. When I say this please also note that I also believe that his romantic sequences are the best. Just one sequence of that ruthless aggression added up with the dark bearded look is something you get your moneys worth for & finally he ends it up with an amazing superman punch at which even Roman Reigns would have been extremely proud of!!"

After watching this movie, I should change my review of Chennai Express as decent (3 starts out of 10). This movie fails at so many levels that I sincerely think SRK has done a rewind on his acting and is failing in front of a new comer like Jr. Dhawan. A complete waste of time and if you really want to waste your time, go watch the older versions of SRK movies."

Oh well, its made by Rohit Shetty, could not have expected anything better. The direction is horrible, more of a Tamil/Tollywood movie than a Bollywood movie. Cars flying, hero beating the crap out of 5-10 guys at once, I guess that turns on the audience.\n\nShah rukh khan avoid Farah Khan n Rohit Shetty.... these two are the biggest upset of your career in last few years"

You can watch Dilwale with your family, friends, bf or gf. Dilwale is for everyone. The chemistry of SRK & KAJOL!!!! OMFG I cant believe SRK & KAJOL are married to different people :( Anyway, Watch DILWALE, ITS AN AMAZING MOVIEEEEE ;) SRK & KAJOL ARE THE BEST ON SCREEN JODI IN BOLLYWOOD. No one can be as good as them in chemistry wise. Dilwale deserves 10000000000000000000/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dilwale 8/10\n\nIt sucks when you have to wait for more than a year to watch SRK on the big screen. Dilwale was worth the wait considering his last outing HNY wasn't that great. Dilwale is all about entertainment, right from gang rivalries to high speed car chase sequences to some mind blowing fight sequences to comedy. But in the heart of it is romance and that to of the most loved on screen couple, SRK- KAJOL. This movie has all the typical Rohit Shetty ingredients. Fancy cars, blowing up fancy cars, amazing comedy and some more fancy cars :D The film has a more than decent plot line and is simple. A scarred past of gang rivalries and cut to present on how it affects the protagonists life. Add to that the traditional old school 'look me in the eyes' romance of srk & kajol and the more hip hop and present kind of romance between varun & kriti \ud83d\udc9c Btw all the four actors look amazing throughout the movie. Srk with his suave moustache, Varun with his cute boy looks, Kriti does what she does best that is being the prettiest girl on this planet. But the surprise was Kajol, i cannot even begin to say how beautiful she looks throughout the whole movie. Coming towards the movie, Rohit has a decent twist up his sleeves and he puts it to the right use in the story to give the movie a proper direction. Shooting locales are exotic, songs are amazing and are already chart busters. Cinematography is top notch, songs are beautifully shot. Comedy has always been one of the strongest attributes of a Rohit Shetty film and he doesn't disappoint. Johnny Lever as money bhai, Sanjay Mishra as Oscar, Varun Sharma as Sidhu and pankaj Tiwari as Anwar bhai tickle your funny bones and make you laugh like crazy. Boman Irani was wasted as king and he could have been put to a much better use. The 4 main characters do a fantastic job in their respective domains and charm the audience. SRK's fight scenes will leave you in awe and the audience couldn't help but hoot and shout and clap in unison. The climax is all happy ending types but it could have been much better according to me. It left me wanting for something more out of the movie. At a 155 minutes, this movie never really feels that long and time passes with ease. I would have loved to see SRK & Kajol doing an out and out romantic movie because this movie does not do much justice to their jodi as this movie has a lot of other stuff to deal with. All in all this movie is a treat to watch and it will be a fantastic watch with your friends & families and loved ones."

Story falls flat: comedy is 3.5/10 at its best. SRK and Kajol's romance makes no sense (very surface level 'love' for a move called Dilwale). Varun and Kriti had no chemistry whatsoever.\n\nAction is also horrible: weird cuts, randomly sped up and slowed down, weird sounds for punches and kicks. Dialogues are a joke as well.\n\nOnly positive about this movie are the songs and srkajol's chemistry within them. The chemistry was not recaptured in any scenes outside of songs, which makes sense as the story was so weak that no actors could have chemistry in this story.\n\nOverall, horrible and somehow worse than I remembered it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a garbage movie and you can either watch it to confirm how bad it is, or read my review first and then decide. The other mistake I made was not reading the IMDb reviews first. Normally I do not watch too many Hindi movies, maybe once or twice a year, and I enjoyed 'Bajrangi Bhaijan' last year. So that piqued my interest in Bollywood movies a little so I gave 'Dilwale' a try. Compared to Hollywood, Bollywood does not even live up to its name that they chose to rip off of Hollywood. Hollywood is far far ahead in quality, and with Dilwale, Indian movie making industry has hit rock bottom. I am sitting here taking out about half an hour of my day to inform you and save your precious time and money. There is no need for you to go and watch this movie to confirm how bad it really is. If you have watched Hollywood movies, you will know that they have shamelessly copied a few scenes without giving any credit to them. SRK is looking aged and bored by his acting career so maybe it is time for him to retire and make way for others. SRK might have had the charm long time ago, but that charm has gone, so have his acting skills, and a poor story with hopeless dialogue will not help him either. I had read other negative reviews about this movie, unfortunately after I watched the movie, and I can concur with their negative experiences that many have had with this movie. This is one of the great tragedies in film making, among many other SRK movies, Dilwale would be the epitome of film making gone hopelessly wrong."

You will see a different kind of SRK-Kajol relationship in this film. #Dilwale is full on entertaining with equal dosage of romance, comedy, action & drama. For sure no fans of such films will come out disappointed #Dilwale There is one TV scene in 2nd half involving Pankaj & Mukesh Tiwari that will bring the house down. Got lots a applause here If you are SRK & Kajol fan then you will just love #Dilwale and if you are not then you will become their fan! Super Duper Hit!!"

Weak story, bad script, lame jokes and awful acting from almost every cast. I was waiting till end for some twist regarding Kali and Maya's parents death but all turned a damp squib with just a misunderstanding. Only good thing of this film is action scenes which are slick and not over the top like typical shetty films but without proper emotions how will the action scenes create an impact? A film only made to cash on the craze of Srk-kajol jodi."

Mark our words, you'll be blown with the twists and turns in Dilwale. The scene before Interval is a nail biter, SRK & Kajol's sad song \u202aDaayre\u202c is a hidden gem it'll make you feel sad . Best after Gerua! Dilwale is 60% comedy 20% action 20% Drama. Comedy part is freaking good. No vulgarity! No skin show, but this is Bonanza..For Christmas, This will surely bring family audience as for as overseas concerns. Overall we have liked it. Perfect film to watch with full family.

Varun Dhawan and Kriti has looked very good together .. Songs were beautiful , visuals are great too , and Action is so far the best of Bollywood ..

Kajol looks adorable in every outfit she has wore, and acting is superb! Rest all the other actors were very good and do not let you think about the weak & clich\u00e9d story that it presents.\n\nAll-in-all, it's an entertaining movie with good action scenes of SRK, mesmerizing love scenes of SRK & Kajol, ace music & picturesque locations.\n\nI'd definitely recommend everybody to hit the theaters for enjoying this movie, despite of all the chaos and terror made around the release of the movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "The film is mediocre from the word GO. Varun Dhawan's sounds like he never grew up after the age 12 or may be was force fed with his dad's Govinda films, day and night with eye lids stapled to keep it from blinking, a la clockwork orange. He has tranformed into Govinda cube (I barely managed Govinda let alone cube). Kirti Sanon is another piece of trash, but I let her pass since she is a hottie, at least they offer something. SRK does shine in few moments with Kajol but he seems under pressure to deliver the so much talked about chemistry and hence uses all his moves whether its his curved eye brows or the arched smile. He has been glorified like a South Indian superstar with physics defying stunts wearing the look that only only impresses a straight collared rickshaw driver who would wear an aviator while driving , with Sanjay Dutt's painted posters as his mud guard graffiti. The film shifts gears from an action to romance stupidly, you don't realize when they are in love and when they want to fight. Some of SRK's emotionally romantic dialogues are so funnily delivered, you don't understand whether you're supposed to laugh or feel sorry for the situation. Kajol is slightly better compared to the rest.\n\nThe jokes are pure slapstick, Johnny Lever using the recycled formula of oscillating his eye brows up and down, Sanjay Mishra mouthing off one liners that makes you think whether it was targeted to the kindergarten audience, and Boman Irani playing the laughing stock one more time.\n\nCinematography is the usual hyper saturated bright colours with terribly LOW apertures that Rohit uses in all of his films. The production design is pathetically fake, unsurprisingly, in fact a set in a theater drama seems more deceiving than a Shetty film. He definitely needs to fire the guy he's been using for design or downsize his own brain. The films offers slightly more layers than his past films in terms of stories though, which still doesn't save the film from sliding down the manhole. The three stars is only for the slightly improved layers and SRK's final dialogue to Kajol, which will definitely bring a smile on your face."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the super success of their last collaboration Chennai Express, I had too much expectations from Rohit Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan. While Chennai Express was only about comedy, action & bit romance. Dilwale looks a lot more appealing than Chennai Exp & has much more to offer than what CE had.\n\nThe film looks interesting right from the start. 1st half starts from the flashback with typical Bollywood style, Family problems in between two lovers. SRK is charismatic as always & Kajol looks amazingly gorgeous even after so many years. Film continues with proper mixing of comedy, romance, drama & action. Film's action is quite world class, way ahead of Bollywood's level. Songs especially Gerua and Janam Janam are magnificently picturised & looks damn amazing on big screen.\n\n2nd part of the movie starts with the cool love story of Varun Dhawan and the very beautiful Kriti Sanon. Their energy level is something to look for & they don't spoil the love essence of SRK-Kajol romance created in the 1st half of the film. Film's huge budget makes it even more watchable. From lavish cars to Bulgaria locations. Everything looks so grand & eye catching.\n\nTalking about the comedy element in the film, Varun Sharma, Boman Irani, Sanjay Mishra and Johnny Lever make you laugh loud. Rohit Shetty has perfectly mixed up their comedy scenes in between to keep the movie going in an entertaining flow.\n\nOverall, Dilwale is a great joyride with plenty to watch out for everyone. Beautiful music. Amazing action. Unbelievable landscapes, Energetic Varun-Kriti. And of course, the evergreen SRK-Kajol. Each of these elements make you keep watching the film. And when put together, Dilwale is the great entertaining result. From romance to comedy to action to drama, Dilwale has got EVERYTHING. A perfect entertainer for your Christmas :)"

Story is definitely minimum 30 years old. 2. Though the story was pretty old the romance seems to have become younger. What a chemistry or whatever they say between the leads (SRK and Kajol) they were as fresh as a daisy. No wonder they are called the best on screen pair of Bollywood sorry I could say they are the best pair of all woods. 3. Kajol is not dusky anymore is that bothering me? No this 41 years old lass was in her great shapes and looked better than the 25 years old Kirti Sanon. She owes a great deal to the makeup artist, camera man or the post production team whoever is the reason for this. 4. SRK man how come he has the attraction in him still I wonder. 5. Rohit Shetty one obligation to you please reduce the over color effect on screen and depend on the natural colors. I am afraid I will have color blindness because of you. 6. Poor Varun and Kirti they were there as prey to show us that even with these younger bloods on screen still SRK and Kajol rocked. 7. Gerua is one mesmerizing song that deserve repetition in our phones Overall chop all crap scenes and watch the scenes of the romantic fantasy scenes between SRK and Kajol they still have the magic in them."

        "review_detailed_main": "SRK and Kajol are an absolute treat in this film. The mafia-level love story in the flashbacks and on present time are wonderful to watch; the two veteran actors have proved through this film that even after 20 years of being Bollywood's favorite jodi, they can still deliver. I loved watching SRK and Kajol. Their gazes are intense, their expressions genuine and their tears pull on the heartstrings. They operate and act on another whole level compared to the rest. Unfortunately, the sideline characters / actors are atrocious and bring this movie down many levels. Their comedic lines do not deliver. They overact to the point it becomes cringey, and it feels all too superficial.\n\nSRK does a particularly good job in the action scenes. Kajol's icy stare can give you chills. Rohit Shetty's car scenes and beautiful shots in Goa and the background are mesmerizing.\n\nThe particularly bad thing about this film is the lack of a concrete conflict, especially in the second half. It feels scattered and aimless when it should be building up to the main clash.\n\nThere's bad writing and dialogue on this one, which is a far shame for such a strong ensemble cast. After all, with great power comes great responsibility. Because of their super stardom (particularly SRK) and numerous awards, expectations are high and they have the skill and charisma to meet it. They are timeless. This movie is not. SRK and Kajol deserved better.\n\nLower your expectations though and you'll get such fun family entertainment for all!"

The treatment of the story is childish. Scene after scene leaves one cold. This was the first movie in ages that i felt called for a refund, and i watch pretty much any movie that plays in the local movie hall.

        "review_detailed_main": "Kajol and Sharukh together in a movie always raises expectations, because this is one pair who we know will not disappoint their audience, no matter how bad the script or film is. Well Rohit Shetty ventures to prove this very thing with DILWALE, a crappy script, a stinking screenplay , and two stars desperately trying to save the movie from falling apart, and yes he does succeed to an extent.\n\nThe movie is ridden with all the clich\u00e9s that you have been seeing right from the '70s and you lay back on the comfortable (not so comfortable now) seats and ask the one question which keeping popping in your head Why Sharukh why? Why Kajol why?\n\nGetting into the story, it is about Raj Randhir Bakshi (Sharukh Khan) who owns a garage in Goa and who dotes on his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan). Veer falls in love with Ishita (Kriti Sanon) and Raj decides to meet Ishita's elder sister to get the wedding going. Turns out the lady in question is Meera Dev Malik (Kajol) who says no to the wedding as she and Raj where lovers in the past and belonged to rival gang families and she believes that Kali (Sharukh Khan), as Raj was called then was behind her Father's (Kabir Bedi)'s death.\n\nThe young lovers now decide to get the elderly lovers together so that their marriage can go ahead without any problem. Kajol is excellent as Meera, and she excels more as the bad girl then as the love lorn spinster. She gives a wow performance in the scene where she reveals her true identity, would have been a lot more interesting if Rohit Shetty had worked on the Bad girl angle.\n\nSharukh is well Sharukh all the way, trying to raise above a mundane script, but gives his 100% to the role, the scene where he goes on the 5 minute date has flashes of the old Sharukh we knew and loved.\n\nVarun Dhawan looks as if he is trying to fit into the vacant slot left by Govinda, he is loud, and hams through the movie.\n\nKriti Sanon tries to act, and joins Rohit Shetty in a losing battle.\n\nThe other saving grace is Johnny Lever, with his weird South Indian Accent, manages to get you laughing every time he appears on the screen.\n\nVinod Khanna and Kabir Bedi are just glorified extras. By the time you realize whether Boman Irani is a comedian, or a Villain, you are on your way home\n\nCinematography by Dudley is excellent especially for the song \"Gerua\" and the Bulgaria Episode.\n\nPritam's music is OK, not a chart buster which you would expect from a Kajol-Sharukh starer.\n\nScreenplay and Direction by Rohit Shetty is nothing but like a child's scrap book where he has collected scenes from all the movies produced from the late 70's till date and glued them together.\n\nWatch it for Sharukh and Kajol-at least the pair is worth the ticket."

But I was totally shocked and surprised to see that Dilwale was a completely different movie. It's not at all a typical Rohit Shetty movie. You never want the movie to end and the length of just 2 and a half hours seemed too less. I've read some reviews here and I am really upset to see people giving bad reviews here. I believe that they are the one who haven't watched the movie yet and have just read some false stories of it somewhere. People, please do not believe on those reviews. Go for the movie.

Shah and Kajol too signed the contract without reading the script based on Rohit Shetty's name and when they found out what a swamp they've gotten themselves into they contractually couldn't get out.\n\nLooking at Aamir's movies in recent years such as PK and Dangal and Shah's Dilwale, I must say I am so disappointed in my favorite Khan.\n\nThe 3 stars are only for the song they had together which I can't even remember what it was about, but they were beautiful and the cinematography of that song was mesmerizing."

Johny lever brilliantly competes with the loudness of colors in the scenes. As if the noise wasn't enough, a newbie tries to recreate the magic of the very famous (overrated and ghisa-pita) scene from pyar Ka punchnama. Boman Irani is overpowered (finally!) by all that commotion and is forced to act within normal limits but still fails to control his facial expressions. Kriti Sanon and Sanjay Mishra are the only good things about the movie. Rohit shetty relied heavily on colors and the SRK-Kajol chemistry but both ditched him. If he didn't forget to hire a dialogue writer, the movie would've done sliiiightly better, probably.\n\nI think when Varun Dhawan compared it to inception, what he actually meant was - Dilwale is so boring that you fall asleep during the movie and start having dreams which are nightmares about this movie and to escape that you start dreaming again in your dreams and the chase continues..."

        "review_detailed_main": "This time around Shah Rukh shares space with Varun Dhawan who, in turn has a romantic track with Kriti Sanon, and a bumbling best friend track with Varun Sharma: SRK's track with old flame Kajol, which is meant to be the film's mainstay, keeps coming and going. And the other bit parts come and go, too, pretty much on a whim. It's almost as if someone says, now let's bung in a comic track, and out tumble Johnny Lever as a car thief, and Sanjay Misra as a pony- tailed receiver of stolen cars, and Boman Irani as a pink-jacketed mobster with a love of vintage cars. Yes, cars do play a big part here, as they do in most Shetty films. And yes, a couple blow up most satisfactorily. But 'Dilwale', on the whole, is a plot less drag : the slaphappy antics you see on screen are a random jumble of light, camera, action, done in the broadest sense. In this rigmarole, SRK is the only thing worth watching when he switches on the wattage ( Kajol can shine, too, when she chooses to), but his twin parts\u2014a 'car modifier' named Raj, and a gangster called Kali (yes, that's right), are both familiar and bland. When old hands SRK and Kajol look into each other's eyes, they can still make you feel it, except it doesn't happen enough. Not by a long shot."

You might wont question their chemistry no more, they always deliver their best. But Dilwale was like a huge hole that you cannot even mend it anymore. Some scenes were super cringe and looks so cheap even for bollywood level. They took some scenes overseas tho but it didnt help much. Their Gerua's clip was exceptionally breathtaking and the only thing I honestly like from the entire movie.\n\nThe movie also tried to make some montage scenes which I think it was the way to emphasize the sorrow, how they were both in pain as the result of their forbidden love but it didnt work at all. It was actually confusing.\n\nLook at the movie's premise, I might say that it's interesting enough. However they didnt produce it well enough to gain viewers sympathy. If the main casts werent SRK and Kajol, it will be just another expensive-but-ordinary bollywood movie."

Shah Rukh Khan in actions scenes really excels and he is just awesome with Kajol. Varun and Kriti is a fresh new pair. They complement each other really well. Special mention to Varun Sharma, he is really good in comedy, previously I liked him in Fukrey and here he also shines in his own way. The songs in big screen appeared as a treat to eye! The comedy, action, romance and family drama all in one place. In one sentence Dilwale is the full on entertainer in this festive season."

Our Shetty boy is equally good at drifting. Don't believe me? Watch Varun Dhawan's drift in Dilwale. But here's a friendly advice: Don't dare to catch the director's drift.\n\nOnce you're over with \"dil ka chilka\" kind of songs and \"King ka aadmi mujhe drugs bechne ko bolta hai\" sort of dialogues, you'll start wondering about the film's huge canvas and its lack of coherence. Pankaj Tripathi and Mukesh Tiwari's comic timing is a good thing about Dilwale. In fact, Tiwari and Tripathi are instrumental in making the audience sit through this 135-minute film.\n\nDilwale hugely banks upon Khan's stardom and he tries his best to reciprocate. The rest of Dilwale has a very little heart or should i say not heart at all.\n\nwell i saw so many paid pr review on this site.well i have suggestion for them that if you are paid pr at least don't give a ten star it looks so obvious that you are paid.because this movie doesn't deserve ten from any angle."

        "review_detailed_main": "When you come out watching a movie, and proceed immediately to ticket window and book your tickets for next show, DILWALE is of that kind, in league of its own.\n\nRohit Shetty's funda is simple: Entertain the spectator with larger-than-life heroism, amusing episodes, high-pitched drama, clap-trap and fiery dialogue, foot-tapping music, gravity-defying action, mass appealing humor\u0085 and of course, blow up as many cars as possible in trademark Rohit Shetty style, DILWALE has all of that and much, much more but this time he went ahead a step in entertaining us.\n\nThe best part of Dilwale is that role of every actor is very well sorted and everyone has equal importance.\n\nDilwale works, primarily thanks to the entertainment quotient and of course, the persuasive portrayals by its lead actors, especially SRK and Kajol. SRK is super-efficient and brings back the charm on screen. he has done some really cool stuff. At the same time,SRK allows VARUN to take the lead and he has does complete justice to those parts . Kriti looks gorgeous and did very well,even there 12-13 actors she made her presence felt. VARUN-KRITI look adorable together, would love to see them together in near future. unexpectedly, comic timing of Varun Sharma and Sanjay are unimpeachable.\n\nKAJOL truly stands out, with SRK she just look perfect. after so long we get to see her on screen,that was so refreshing.she has done perfect justice to it. I think no one could have pulled off MEERA as she did. BOTH SRK -KAJOL has many shades and both were just perfect.\n\nPerfect combination of drama, love & action in Dilwale style. The best Rohit Shetty movie. special mention to exotic locations and production design. content is very appealing, movie is very entertaining throughout and emotional towards ending.expect Hurricane at the BO, Sky is the limit.\n\nFINAL WORD- brilliant, total Paisa Wasool, lets fall in love again."

And they managed to do it. The film is unnecessarily long, considering the plot is simple. You would have thought they have settle it sooner. The plot is borderline 80s - 90s Hindi films clich\u00e9. I thought the genre had died already 20 years past 2000. Apparently, it's still alive.\n\nThe action is full-package unapologetically over-the-top. But considering the stupid jokes and plotline, I actually welcomed it. The only real good thing it has got it going is its well-choreographed dance numbers and songs. But having said that, most Indian films has that quality. So that's not out of the ordinary.\n\nA very bad film. If anyone even mentions this film besides Kuch Kuch Hota Hai is an insult to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. 2 out of 5."

Watch it, as by Rohit Shetty's standards, it's his most complete and entertaining film! The comedy element in the film is its strength. With top notch performances from the likes of Varun Sharma, Boman Irani, Sanjay Mishra and Johnny Lever, you will definitely laugh out loud every time they are on screen. The direction by Shetty is awesome, to put it simply. His vision and the scale of the film is insurmountable by any other entertainer in this genre.

With the return of Kajol and patch up of Rohit shetty with Shah Rukh Khan, Dilwale is the great movie to watch. Since a Rohit Shetty film, you find world most beautiful car to fly in Rohit shetty style. Dilwale is kind of movie where you can expect just entertainment without considering the logic since all movies are not meant for having a decent story. Gerua is most beautiful element of the movie. Kriti sanon and Varun dhavan have done excellent job as per the roles they played. You definitely like the movie if you are SRK fan and also if like to watch the movie for entertainment. Boman and Jhonny have given their best to entertain in periodic interval. Kriti looks beautiful as well as pretty in the movie. Varun dhavan tried to entertain but he need to work hard more have such skills of entertaining. Kajol and SRK looks old but still Duo have created the magic once again. Movie will be like by limited audience due to the fact that it is not purely full entertainment. but mixture of SRK- kajol magic, Kriti's pretty looks and action scenes of SRK Fights while flying beautiful cars in Rohit style will make you satisfied at the end."

Shah rukh khan looks as dashing as ever and also Kajol omg is so damn hot! Varun Dhawan on the other hand made a funny an enjoying character also! The action is not the realistic, obviously it wouldn't lol it's made by rohit shetty and the songs were that realistic but it was funny watch them too!

The Trailer was okay, Music was great and it has the appeal to attract youths but due to Rohit Shetty's directorial venture one could think of a Movie with Average plot. But i was shocked after watching Dilwale, the Story is good (not boring), screenplay is amazing and the actress did a fairly good job. The real surprise is the plot twist which happened in the second half of the Movie. Can't tell really because for that you must go and watch it in theaters. Talking about the Acting, SRK is the real king of bollywood and he proved this once again. He was in a Bold and Serious avatar, grumpy sometimes but we did an amazing job. His counterpart Kajol was good too if not that great, one may miss the DDLJ spark in the Movie but this happens quite a long when you return in the Bollywood after a long time. Varun Dhawan was average, he tried to be witty and comic but failed. His dance moves in the Movie isn't that great, but his bromance with SRK was good and one can feel it. Overall average by Varun. Kriti shanon was the waste. He cant act or dance. She did quite well in her last Movie Heropanti but this was her worst performance. All the other comic actors very good and some great jokes very there in the first half. Overall a very entertaining movie. Action/Car stunts are like never seen before in Bollywood,some of the scene were copied from Movies like Mission Impossible. Other than the action scenes will give you the feel of Hollywood. Overall a complete entertainment package, Varun and Kriti shanon will put you down but the plot and the beautiful direction of Rohit Shetty will bring you the smile, pain, thriller and fun. SRK was great, his best role in last 5 years.\n\nFINAL- MUST WATCH !!!"

What follows is a squeaky clean courtship comprising dinner dates with flowers, ice-creams, candlelight dinner \u0085 the works. It's undoubtedly corny, but credit is due to Khan and Kajol for injecting it with believability. Just when you think that the movie is heading south, there's an interesting twists and ends with happy ending.\n\nMovie has comic and love stories which will surely makes it a complete family drama and you can spare some time to watch it once."

Varun-kriti are cute as a couple, Varun sharma, J.lever & Sanjay Mishra are hilarious in their comedy role. Khanna & Bedi have small but very impactful roles. But the star of the film is without any doubt the evergreen couple, SRK- Kajol. After so many years it seems like nothing has changed between them. The way they look at each other make you think that they are actually real couple. (But don't go with the expectation of a new DDLJ, this is impossible) I wished there was more romance cause you just cant get enough of them. The action is not like other shetty films where people fly, its more Hollywood style.

The movie is hit because of the revival of Shahrukh and Kajol love story. Comedy is also very fantastic done by Varun Sharma and Johnny Lever. I also love this movie because of the talent of youngsters like Varun Dhawan/Sharma and Kriti Sanon. They were very outstanding. This movie contains lots of entertainment. You should watch this multi- talented movie created by ROHIT SHETTY and music is lovely. So please, please, please watch this movie.The story is also very beautiful and attractive.I am sure, you will like (Y) this movie. Just for entertainment."

But, I think, too many comedy in that movie, that's why, sometimes the best part of this movie just feel 'untouchy', doesn't seems every single Bollywood movie I've ever watched. And the plot of the songs, sometimes like cutting the original scenes, but actually, every singles songs was so great, and I like that songs. after all, this movie just so cool, enjoying the movie is one of the best part of the 'world movie' I've been doing. just for corrector, this comedy scenes so horribly for the roll of movie. I think , if Rohit Sheety didn't too many scenes comedy for that movie, that movie want to be a great movie, like 20th years old movie \"Dilwalle Dulhania Le JAyenge\""

The story line took pace just before interval with lots of twist n turns.Second half is equally good.Acting of Shahrukh, kajol, Varun & Kriti is mind blowing. Last 20 mins of the film is designed for Hard-core family audience and they are going to love it. Varun Sharma, Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari, Pankaj Tripathi and last but not least Johnny Lever did an awesome job. Overall Dilwale is thrice better than Chennai Express. Good family drama with loads of comedy action & drama. Must Watch. ATBB"

This is a genuinely good film and please don't listen to all the negativity around. Most of it is influenced by the idiotic politicians, Bajirao Mastani fans and SRK haters. The film is designed to be a mass entertainer and it succeeds in that. It's true that u can't see the film the way you see other intellectual films. It's a mass film, a light film and does not deserve the biased reviews it's getting now. The music of the film is excellent, Performance of the lead actors is great, though Sanjay Mishra and Boman Irani disappointed. Editing is crisp. Background score completely compliments the narrative. Rohit Shetty succeeds in providing what he alway does- Full on Entertainment. If you don't apply much of your brain and watch it with a light heart, you will surely laugh a lot and love this film. Go Watch it with your family and have Fun...."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know why people expected this movie to be like DDLJ or any or Srk's past works. Did you guys watch the trailer before you saw it? The trailer didn't suggest that this would be the next DDLJ or etc. No one did. So why do people assume it's going to be a very serious movie? People will bash the film because they don't do their research or they have some sort of bias against it\n\nThis is a Rohit Shetty film, I repeat a Rohit Shetty film. And he has outdone himself to actually create a story. The comedy and cars do not prevail in this movie, Stk and Kajol do. The concept behind this movie is beautiful. Srk's acting is excellent and so is Kajol's. Her character actually really fits her personality. The film has all elements (comedy, romance, etc..). Beautifully filmed. The storyline is beautiful but not developed right.\n\nI wish this film ran longer, because the scenes followed each other rapidly with no breathing time.. I wish they had really emphasized parts of the story or practically every scene. There seemed to be too much but too little time to fit it in, thus leaving you feel incomplete. Srk's acting is wonderful but an emphasized storyline would have done it justice. Seriously, the intensity of his character will blow you away. Maybe because this movie has all elements, it feels very rapid. Trying to fit too much in and leaving it feeling incomplete. You won't get a closure feeling from this because it will keep reminding you of Raj or Kaali. More songs would have been nice too!\n\nI will be honest and say that it made me really nostalgic to see Kajol and SRK again, but the chemistry was coming more from SRK this time, not Kajol. His character really makes this movie. Overall a beautiful story but not fully developed. SRK does make this movie, and this movie will leave you incomplete. You will be wanting to go watch his old movies after this one. It left me feeling very sad, his character made me very sad."

My whole family enjoyed it totally as there was something for everyone . I don't know what people were expecting out of a Rohit shetty movie so that they are left disappointed ?

Usually, comedy in films (Especially Bollywood films) is pretty terrible, however in this film I laughed a few times and found some of the characters and scenes very humorous. I feel like the reason why it got so much hate was how unique it was and 'western'. Many viewers that watched this film probably expected your usual happy and colourful Bollywood film.\n\nThis film didn't have many cons at all, apart from at some parts it was fairly easy to tell that animation was being used, however the animation was impressive.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this film with all the action, plot-twists, romance, comedy, it was all great. I definitely recommend this film and I just love how unique it is."

While some are just simply going gaga over this Shahrukh Khan starrer flick directed by Rohit Shetty, there are quite a few people who feel Dilwale is not up-to expectations. Dilwale is a light-hearted entertaining film that has action, romance and comedy! The film features Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon in lead roles while actors Boman Irani, Varun Sharma, Kabir Bedi, Vinod Khanna, Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari, Johny Lever and Murli Sharma are seen playing pivotal roles!\n\nFrom the looks of Shahrukh Khan-Kajol's sizzling chemistry from the movie, it is quite clear that Dilwale not only has the typical romance, action and comedy but it has also has an intense, eternal love story that takes place between Raj (Shahrukh Khan) and Meera (Kajol). The movie has released in foreign countries and the audiences who have viewed the film feel that Dilwale has a predictable story but Rohit manages to keep them hooked with surprising elements. As predicted, Shahrukh Khan and Kajol's intense chemistry is said to be the unique selling point of the movie! Rohits direction, Pritams music, Dudley's cinematography and death defying action stunts have all been super praised by the viewers. The comedy scenes make you laugh and the picturesque locations are a visual treat to your eyes. All in all, Dilwale has some really great aspects as expected and will give Bajirao Mastani a tough fight at the Box Office."

Magnificent landscapes, cars and places. Moments of romance and pain make hold your breath.\n\nThe libretto I also like, why? Because they are two stories that are woven into a past that wants to forget and hard returns, which only the power of love can conquer. For India, only love is the answer and this is reflected again and again at the insistence of the characters to achieve overcome the painful prejudices that separate them. With regard to the action, is sufficient to indicate that there are situations that are not expected, not seen get and of course mark the turning point ... and with respect to comedy, if someone does not like, is because it ignores that as humans we live the same situations anywhere in the world ... is funny feel human in any culture and know that other people have your same problems, concerns, peculiarities and comic moments.\n\nMusic . I can only say that I am as romantic, it was heaven. Song lyrics, locations, costumes and the performances of the actors was excellent. The music of this film is something that will not forget.\n\nLike most Indian films, culture is strongly positioned and of course is oriented to the core values that you want to emphasize: love, loyalty, trust, humility and compassion. That is precisely what we value in Indian films and that unlike the rest of the world. India shows the world including pain love and hope ... ..nos invited to feel, to believe and to dream.\n\nCome more films like Dilwale .... !!!!"

It has beautiful music, romantic love stories, nice cars and a lot of funny moments. Plus it reminds us of family values and respect to elders which never gets outdated. Overall happily spent two and and half hours for the whole family. It is worth purchasing because we definitely want to watch it again. I wish we could understand Hindi for a better viewing experience and not being glued to English subtitles. In our stressful and hectic lives it's a pleasure to relax a bit with a good movie like Dilwale. Shahrukh Khan is definitely the best actor in the world. We are new to Bollywood and SRK movies and keep enjoying them more and more."

The reviews are saying it's cliche and I admit to a certain extent yes, but the videography. music and story line makes up for it. Yes it's a cliche, kind of like a Romeo and Juliet but they end up together in the end, however I don't see this cliche being done well often, and a lot of romances are based off of the cliche as subtle as it can be it's there. So that's nothing new, honestly I loved the idea and direction the story took, the actors acted many scenes wonderfully, I admit a few scenes were wonky but it was 2015 lmao. I love this movie full heartedly, and I don't like many indian movies. Maybe it's because I watch more english movies? No I watch more shows then movies and even that isn't entirely true.. I'm a Otaku so, I watch a lot of anime or at least used to, now I read Manga, and a lot of webcomics. I watch a lot of Kdrama, maybe that's why?

Was excited as first time watching movie on big screen. And its was surreal experience for me and happy that I choose this movie for first time experience. Sharukh khan acted well in the movie but too much comedy spoiled the movie. This movie is only to watch in theatre otherwise you will get bored. All characters acted well in the movie and we all cheered and clapped for all the stars specially dhawan was fantastic and romance between kajol and Khan was also special."

        "review_detailed_main": "the movie is a typical rohit Shetty movie with loads of action and cars flying around but what's disappointing is that every time rohit tried to groove out of his comfort zone..just like trying to get on the back of SRK-KAJOL romance he fails every time miserably. the only thing that keeps everyone still at their seats is tha way SRK handles the situation, especially in the second half he took the burden of whole movie on his shoulder solely.kriti and varun were good in their respective roles although at some scene varun's acting looked awkward but still he survived. comic timings of johnny lever and sanjay Mishra is great and varun sharma also has done a fine job. all and all one must watch this movie for entertainment and fun but without keeping high hopes."

        "review_title": "Fabulous movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "Dilwale revolves around the story of Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) and Meera (Kajol), who are star-crossed lovers with a tumultuous past. The plot kicks off with Raj living under the alias Kaali, a car modifier and garage owner in Goa, with his younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan). Veer falls in love with Ishita (Kriti Sanon), unknowingly connecting the two families again. As the story unfolds, the dark past between Raj and Meera is revealed, bringing old wounds to the forefront and testing the lovers' resilience.\n\nThe narrative is a blend of romance, action, and comedy, with a non-linear storytelling technique that reveals the backstory through flashbacks. The screenplay is fast-paced, trying to balance the multiple genres it touches. However, the script's attempt to juggle too many elements sometimes leads to a lack of depth in the storyline and character development."

        "review_detailed_main": "Facts - 20 December 2020 Google \"The film went on to earn approximately $26.6 million (INR 1756.5 million) by February 2016. The film's final overseas gross was US$30.2 million (194 crore), the highest ever for a Shah Rukh Khan film, and making it the twelfth highest-grossing Indian film overseas.\"\n\nIt has probably grossed more than this since it is now 2022.\n\nI have watched Dilwale countless times. I will not repeat summary; see other reviews. I am drawn by Love: the love of family and love between Kajol/Meera and Shah Rukh/Kaali. Raj. At another point in time Shah Rukh noted he and Kajol have the best 4 eyes in the film industry. So true in Dilwale. Should you re-watch, check out the eyes. Kajol's icy performance after the crash is stellar. Have only seen her in movies with SRK, so perhaps she has played such a hardened role in other films. But in Dilwale, this role was gripping. Shah Rukh stayed clearly in love the entire movie and portrayed the love, often with no words. His facial expressions convey a story. Additionally the scene between SRK and Varun Dhawan/Veer near the end of the movie when they expressed love as siblings was magnificent. Again Shah Rukh's eyes are an open book. And at the end of the scene, his eyes tell you he is angry and something important is going to happen.\n\nI enjoyed the performances of Mukesh Tiwari and Pankaj Tripathi. Feel like their roles added pertinent information to the story.\n\nAlso liked action scenes. Thank you Rohit Shetty.\n\nI rated the film an 8. Clearly higher than many other reviewers. Would love to have rated it 10. But I felt like it dragged in spots: Boman Irani scenes were too long; same for Johnny Lever; for sure with Sanjay Mishra. Also, the script for Dhawan was hokey, at times.\n\nI bought the DVD set. This is a movie I will watch again and again.\n\nMy rating - 8."

When Veer falls in love with Ishita (Kriti Sanon), Raj's past romance with Meera (Kajol) comes to light, affecting both couples.\n\nThis is an engaging masala film, with generally well-written comedy and drama, and nicely choreographed action sequences. As always, Khan and Kajol have near perfect chemistry, and their acting is excellent. Dhawan was natural and a good comedian, but Sanon was stiff and not fully convincing at times. The songs are mostly good, with one song memorably so, and the incidental music was particularly effective. The locations were beautiful, and the movie looked superb overall. Dilwale is thoroughly enjoyable, just barely missing ten stars, and one worth rewatching.\n\n(Cast also includes Johnny Lever and Vinod Khanna.)"
