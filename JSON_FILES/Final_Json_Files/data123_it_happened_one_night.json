        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life, Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression, when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored, an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.\n\nThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated. Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal. Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity, you smile and wave at them. Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zeke's wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid. Upon seeing Peter and Ellie's car missing, they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there. They cannot afford freeloaders.\n\nIn another scene, a child's mother has passed out from hunger, because they have no money to buy food. Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds, but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to them.\n\nDespite these instances, the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world. In the throes of the stock market crash, this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy. At a time when the country needed release, they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night. Audiences were amused by scenes in the film, such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut. Or, when forced to share a room, Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellie's beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho,' which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellie's marriage. Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence, which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully, finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts. After he gives up, beaten, Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee. The first car that passes stops, as we see extreme close-ups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brake.\n\nA master in his profession, Capra left his mark on the films he directed. With an almost childlike cheerfulness, he maintains a sense of dignity and class. The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind, even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film. Capra's films are still regarded as masterpieces. It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies. It was one of many movies made during the Depression, a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history. It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time.\n\n9 out of 10 stars"

        "review_detailed_main": "Consider this, \"It Happened One Night\" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant.\n\nThe main reason \"It Happened One Night\" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: \"That French broad likes money\" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.\n\nThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.\n\nWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: \"Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever, funny and a bit risqu\u00e9 (for 1934)\" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.\n\nAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic, and on so many `must-see' lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another. It wasn't until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn't.\n\nThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator. She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation. Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits. The film quickly turns into an `on the road' flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story. Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.\n\nI'm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy. Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles. Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.\n\nWhatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner. It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.\n\n--Shelly"

        "review_detailed_main": "In his autobiography, The Name's Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.\n\nWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.\n\nCapra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it.\n\nCapra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.\n\nAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.\n\nThe rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.\n\nThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in.\n\nGable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night."

        "review_detailed_main": "IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre, it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.\n\nIt's a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father's yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film's release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene-stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it's faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it's time.\n\nIHON won 5 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation. It deserved all of them. Funnily enough, both Colbert and Gable didn\u2019t want any part in the film at first- I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it. It's been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film. A classic, a must-see, a great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, based on a short story \"Night Bus\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the 1930s, thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable (on loan from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) and Claudette Colbert (on loan from Paramount), with fine direction by Frank Capra, witty screenplay by Robert Risken, and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gable); Best Actress (Colbert); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture. This might have been an \"upset\" in 1934, considering other top-rated films and performances of the year, but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?\n\nThis now well-known plot that's been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES (1945) with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT (1956) with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen \"Ellie\" Andrews (Claudette Colbert), spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker, Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas), making arrangements on having it annulled. Following a heated argument with her father, Ellie runs from her state room, jumps overboard and swims to shore. Eluding her father's hired detectives, Ellie, acquiring new clothes, purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley. While on board, Ellen encounters Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a hot-headed reporter recently fired by his editor, Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson). With both disliking each other immensely, Warne, having discovered the \"spoiled brat's\" identity, becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back. Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp, misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car gone.\n\nA simple story playing like an overlong \"B\" movie, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated. Highlights include the \"Walls of Jericho\" where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses, particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peter's correct method of dunking a dough-nut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her own.\n\nAlthough IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish (there's no secondary female character, quite rare for its time). Due to the strength of Gable's performance, this has been hailed to be his best comedic role. Gable's character is hot-headed and forceful, living by a moral code. Although he shares a cabin with a married woman, that's all he does. He even tells Colbert's Ellie when she asks if she'll ever see him again, he replies, \"I make it a policy not to run around with married women.\" And when he's hungry, he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling. This is Gable, a role model. Director Frank Capra, whose subject matter is usually on people, captures the many extras, especially those on the bus and auto camps, to make them appear as important as leading players. Roscoe Karns is equally memorable, \"believe you me!\" as the gabby bus passenger, Oscar Shapeley from Orange, New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother (Claire McDowell); along with other passengers gathered together and singing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze,\" to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colbert's shoulder. During it's entire 106 minutes, there's seldom any underscoring. As for the costumes, with the exception of the final 15 minutes, both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their trip.\n\nWhile Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers, plus their reunion in MGM's large-scale BOOM TOWN (1940), it's amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards. There's a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette, the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry, saying that those kind of women don't exist anymore. Gable says this with frankness and sincerity. Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek, coming to realize it happened one night.\n\nIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the 1960s and 70s, but on cable TV as well, ranging from the Disney Channel (1980s), American Movie Classics (prior to 2001) to Turner Classic Movies, and availability on video cassette and finally DVD. While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance, it's still timely screen entertainment. There'll never be another film like this again. (***1/2)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated. Especially Capra's directing is disappointing, since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.\n\nIt's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's, the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time, only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clich\u00e9d and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.\n\nIt's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters, which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling, without ever really getting a big adventure.\n\nMore fireworks was to be expected, especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film, as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.\n\nAs could be expected, the acting is still great though, from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry, which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert, who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie, even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first, until hearing upon her win.\n\nYes, I know I'm making the movie sound horrible, which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies, with a much lower rating on here though.\n\nThere are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there, which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

In the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior. The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous. It is the classic portrayal of what may be called \"sexual tension.\" He takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect. There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their \"breakfast\" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find. As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny.

They put their heads together, put the egos in the back pocket, thank you, applied a little elbow grease and produced one of the most beloved romantic comedies of all time. How's that for a Hollywood happy ending?\n\nIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT made Gable a name, whose career was slow to start, and gave a very small studio an undisputed reputation as a can-do organization now open for business. HOORAY! The rest is history, of course, but not without saying what an unforgettable story this is and, perhaps, the very first road trip movie ever produced. Great trivia question.\n\nIt's also a very simple story; \"young man meets young woman\" and the adventures they share together, going at it as best as they can, and let's not forget during the height of the Great Depression. Truly, audiences at the time needed a good laugh and this gem was their answer, which it remains to this day.\n\nAlso a tip of the hat to a marvelous supporting cast, foremost Walter Connolly as Colbert's frustrated father, whose bark is worse than his bite. Director Frank Capra outdid himself in this one, FIVE Oscars, a first in 1934. Not to be forgotten.\n\nCapra's previous hit was LADY FOR A DAY, and a dynamic double feature with this and pizza.\n\nForever on dvd, remastered blu ray and whatever comes next."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Frank Capra films. Meet John Doe, It's a Wonderful life, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town are four of the greatest films ever made. Capra was not without his misses and downright lemons though. Arsenic and Old Lace and the abysmal Here Comes the Groom fall into these categories. It Happened one Night falls somewhere in between. Not an all out screwball comedy and not alot of social commentary, it is nevertheless a good light road picture, one of the first, and shouldn't fail to entertain. Innovative in it's way it was the forerunner to many more comedies in the later 30's which have become standards in the genre of Screwball. Capra here was still honing his technique for better films to come and it shows. At times the timing is off and the writing could use snappier one liners which hit the mark. Gable's funnier moments seem to be accidental or improvised -- and Colbert, though capable, just is no Carole Lombard or Rosalind Russell in her delivery. The thigh scene where she hails the passing car has been improved upon in several later comedies and even cartoons. Even though I like this picture, I feel it is another film which has received a higher rating over the years than it is due. Maybe it's just my love of more complex and polished comedic situations and dialogue in films like Bringing up Baby and His Girl Friday etc which I'm missing here. Cary Grant was, afterall, the definitive leading man in this type of picture. It Happened one Night is a good, not great evening at the movies. If you want to see Clark Gable really turning on the comedy charm check out Teacher's Pet with Doris Day which was made late in his career. I've yet to see a better Gable comedy than that. And if you're looking for another sweet road picture from yesteryear I recommend A Lady Takes a Chance with Jean Arthur and John Wayne, a light screwball comedy dappled with excellent performances. It's a shame it is long forgotten and hard to obtain on video."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Romance triumphant?\" Well, it gets a decent ride in this amiable, low- octane comedy, which wiser people than I regard as a classic.\n\nWealthy heiress Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is tired of her gilded cage. After literally jumping ship from her controlling tycoon father (Walter Connelly), she winds up in the lap of recently-fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who decides to aid her escape in hopes of reviving his career. Trekking across country without a dime, they find their unlikely union triggering feelings neither is prepared to handle.\n\nI've read that \"It Happened One Night\" is the mother of screwball comedies, which is absolutely the wrong way to approach this film. Sure, there's banter, and a \"dizzy\" lady at the center, but what you don't get here is the spinning-plate subplots or the zany secondary characters of true screwball. This is a two-handed rom-com that plays its story straight down the middle.\n\nIf you love Colbert and Gable, you may well enjoy this film more than I did. Despite the clever set-up, I found the story and the main characters hard to take after the first 20 minutes.\n\nDirector Frank Capra gets more out of ambiance here, and some fantastic visual language, like the way the rain falls outside the windows of a cabin where Ellie and Peter are holed up. There are some delightful moments, such as when the pair hoodwink a couple of nosy detectives, or sing along with a bus full of passengers to \"The Man In The Flying Trapeze.\"\n\nWarne's main comic trait is his cantankerousness. \"Listen, partner, you may not like my nose, but I do,\" Peter tells an ornery bus driver (Ward Bond). \"I always wear it out in the open where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it.\" It sets Peter up well, anyway.\n\nYet the overall experience of their company never feels natural. Peter lectures Ellie about everything from hitchhiking to dunking donuts, and emerges a bit of a bore. Ellie's more interesting, but that's more because of Colbert's beauty than anything her character says. Having him tell her off (\"Ever hear of the word 'humility'\") suggests more of the director's take on class differences than anything disagreeable in her behavior, which is surprisingly docile in the main.\n\nNeither lead makes you think anything other than Depression dollars is driving their union. They may play well off each other, but only for laughs. When things get \"mushy\" (something Ellie likes and Peter doesn't), the story falters. The worst part comes near the end, when he abruptly leaves her alone for a night and gets mad when she reacts naturally enough by returning to Pa.\n\nThere are iconic moments in the film, like when she shows him up as the better hitchhiker, and when she is clearly affected by the sight of Peter without a shirt on, but what \"It Happened\" lacks are the smaller moments that pull you in without feeling manipulated. I counted one, when a close-up of Ellie in the darkness shows only the tiniest pinpricks of light of her eyes as she takes in her situation with Peter. Otherwise, Capra is too obviously pushing me how to feel.\n\nI didn't feel much of anything when I was done watching this, just a mixture of appreciation for the cleverness of the story and relief it was over. However well it did at the Oscars in 1935, \"It Happened\" lacks the timelessness of Golden Age Hollywood. Yes, it plays with the conventions, and delivers some laughs, but left me cold all the same."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Miami, the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is trapped in the yacht of her controller father, the Wall Street banker Andrews (Walter Connolly), who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side- by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra. The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated, with witty dialogs, and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous. The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple. Last time I saw this classic was on 29 January 2003 and this is the third time that I watch this film, now on DVD from Columbia Distributor, and I highly recommend it as one of the best romantic comedies ever. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Aconteceu Naquela Noite\" (\"It Happened that Night\")"

Ellie runs away from her father sets off across country to get to her husband in New York. On the bus she meets a recently-fired reporter, Peter Warne. The two don't get along but, figuring out who she is, and knowing that her father will have every route into New York covered with private detectives, he offers to help her get to a husband. In exchange he wants an exclusive on her story. The two tag along together, getting through some interesting adventures. Over time they even get to like each other...\n\nA gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm, and hilariously funny at times, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward, keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.\n\nThe great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles. The chemistry between them is great and their delivery is spot-on.\n\nBoth Gable and Colbert received Oscars for their performances, as did Capra for Best Director. The movie was the well-deserved 1935 Best Picture Oscar winner."

        "review_detailed_main": "Background to that '30s era: this 1934 film is often called the first (of the many following) in the 'screwball comedy' genre; it came out in the worst of the Great Depression (US unemployment in 1928 was 2.9%, by 1933 it hit 25%; millions were hungry and desperate, leading to some antagonisms between economic classes). This was also a time when women's roles were changing in the US: the 'women's suffrage' movement gained women the right to vote in 1920 (19th Amendment), more equality in decision-making, more freedom in dress, gender & sexual roles (e.g., '20s 'Flappers'). \"Screwball comedies\" capitalized and fed on those changes: they typically \"feature farcical situations, a combination of slap-stick with fast-paced repartee and show struggles between\" (central characters of different) \"economic classes. They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship and marriage or remarriage\" (\"quotes\" from Wikipedia).\n\nA young 30's Gable plays \"Peter,\" a drinking, hard boiled newspaper reporter just fired from his job when he accidentally meets the young 20's \"Ellie\" (a young 30's Colbert) who's increasingly rebelled against the escalating but failing attempts of her upper class, super-rich father to control her. He tries to keep her on his Florida yacht while arranging to annul Ellie's impulsive marriage to a man (whom her father recognizes but Ellie doesn't as mainly interested in her wealth). But Ellie escapes her father's captivity and sets off to NYC to be reunited with her new spouse. On her way, she meets Gable who's initially interested in helping her because it'll lead to his scoop of a newspaper story (and reinstatement of his job). But then--romance eventually, gradually, starts to happen between you know who.\n\nMy rating: 6 of 10 I found this interesting as a time-traveling experience--early '30s bus rides, clothes, roles, attitudes, etc.-- but all the people seemed to me to be too much caricatures and not enough real characters. (However, many people on IMDb's \"Discussion Board\" say the more often they've seen this film, the more highly they value it--many saying it's among their most favorite films of all--so maybe familiarity breeds appreciation?) FWIW: Neither Gable nor Colbert wanted to be in this film; MGM \"loaned\" them to Columbia Pictures, then a 2nd rate movie company, for this movie as punishment for each being too \"uppity\" and/or violating MGM policies. But, after this film gained such outstanding success (lifting Columbia's rank to among the majors) and substantially helped both Gable's & Colbert's careers, they came to appreciate it."

She was always perplexed how this little, low budget film, ( shot in just 4 weeks), beat out those big production numbers she did with Cecil B. DeMille. It was the first of the screwball comedies and was the foundation of the modern rom-com. Would anybody remember either of these leads - or at least remember them quite so well - if not for this film? It's ironic that Clark Gable's signature roles in this movie and as Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind are what get him remembered. He gave good performances in his matinee idol roles over at MGM, but most of the material itself has not aged that well.\n\nElie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is being held on her father's yacht because she wants to be with her husband the rogue King Wesley, with whom she eloped. Elie escapes the yacht and plans to take a bus to New York to reunite with King. Recently fired newspaper reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) recognizes her and agrees to get her to her husband if she lets him have an exclusive on the story so that he can get his old job back. Otherwise he says he'll spill the beans to Elie's dad on her whereabouts. What ensues is a delightful road trip filled with humor, adventure, and the gradual blossoming of an unexpected romance against the backdrop of the Great Depression.\n\nBeyond the central romance, \"It Happened One Night\" also provides a humorous and satirical commentary on societal norms and class distinctions of the time. The film cleverly uses the road trip narrative to explore themes of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of happiness, making it more than just a romantic comedy.\n\nFrank Capra's direction is skillful, and the screenplay, written by Robert Riskin, is sharp and engaging. The film's success is also attributed to its innovative use of location shooting, capturing the essence of the open road and adding authenticity to the narrative."

Wafer-thin material stretched to the breaking point, with a rollicking first-half (in buses and roadside motels) let down by less-funny second and third acts more concerned with a quasi-introspective study of character. Robert Riskin won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar; Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert also won for their performances. Indeed, their rapport is easy and free of gimmicks, though some of the sniping grates. Frank Capra won two Academy Awards, one for his direction and the other for producing this Best Picture winner. Its American minutiae was fresh and novel at the time--and some of it still holds up today--but when the wisecracks turn somber, and Riskin's script loops around to bide time, the film seems less a feel-good trifle than an over-praised, desperate movie-star \"product\".

After enduring to the bitter end, the most flattering thing I can say is that the camera appeared to be in focus for the full duration of the film.\n\nI'm willing to make concessions given the cultural differences of the time periods, but I can't imagine that peoples innate senses of humor and romance have changed THAT much. I mean really, did folks back in the day think dissertations on dunking donuts and piggy-back rides were funny? I realize the players in older films can be exaggerated and caricatures, but the obnoxious male bus passenger was just too much. It was one of many cringe-worthy scenes that left me wondering if the art of writing screen plays was in it's infancy. Incidentally, who didn't think Peter's terrorist threats against the bus guy's family were a howler! I'm still laughing at that one?!?!\n\nAs for chemistry between the two stars, distilled water appears more reactive. Peter was a self-righteous grouch who wanted some dream \"dame\" who likes to frolic on the beach and look at the stars. Who wouldn't want a guy like that? She..., come to think of it, I don't remember anything about her desires or ambitions. Her facial expressions and lack of anything resembling passion were confusing. There was nothing to like on either side. He wasn't an appealing character and she was boring.\n\nI will say the movie was funny as an audience participation event. When Peter ran and caught a car to retrieve his belongings from a film-flam man, I couldn't help busting a gut. Either the cars were very slow in those days, or the cigarettes they were smoking really did make them more fit. Either way, there were several \"incredible\" circumstances in the movie that had me chuckling.\n\nI suppose the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but I'm still wondering what happened and on which night?"

Also: `The Shop Around the Corner' (around the corner from WHERE?), `The Empire Strikes Back' (it doesn't), `The Living Daylights', `True Lies', `Batman Forever', `Species', `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' ... if anyone has any more suggestions, please send them to me.\n\nIn this case, it happens over several nights, and I'm not sure which particular night is being referred to. Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying. But actually, Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air. Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end - in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake. But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all. I, for one, was convinced that right up until the final moment, it could have gone either way. How did Capra manage this? Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated? I don't suppose it matters: it's results that count.\n\nI'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all. The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society, it's almost worth creating a sexist society (and then dismantling it), in order to get the art. In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists, who, by and large, aren't so easily fooled. Claudette Colbert isn't feisty. When she DOES assert her independence, she means it.\n\n(And, of course, when Clark Gable asserts his dominance, HE means it. You don't get sincerity like this these days.)\n\nAnyway, the ideology of a film, if there is one, is always beside the point, except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film. Two real individuals, a real story, some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding, constant wit - and, as I expressed amazement at earlier, constant suspense. And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it, note that it was released in 1934. The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935. Not a moment too late."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It Happened One Night\" happens to be my personal most favorite film ever. It was an adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin), from the short story \"Night Bus\" and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story, plot, modest budget and a very short four week production schedule, this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success. The hopes were low for this film, even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles. Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in Hollywood.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\", 1934, had a relatively small budget for it's time: $325,000, of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $50,000 for her role. A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the 1930's. Released during America's Great Economic Depression, the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit. All the right elements came together. It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations. A film where luck and chemistry came together, producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved, including its' director Frank Capra.\n\nThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing. For it's time, this style of film was new. It would be one of the first of a new genre: screwball romantic comedy. Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role, was a first in Hollywood history. Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards: \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\", 1975 and \"The Silence of the Lambs\", 1991.\n\nClaudette Colbert was quoted as saying: \"I just finished the worst film ever\" on \"It Happened One Night\". She had no idea how well the film would be edited. The film editing here is subtle and sublime. Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film. Colbert's demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks, because of her vacation schedule, actually created the lively pace of the film, working in it's favor. \"It Happened One Night\" is a fine example of a quality screenplay, some good luck and a lot of chemistry, all coming together, producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classic.\n\nClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining. The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gable's performance. Unfortunately, he would not be cast in a comedic role again, even after the big success of this film. The studio system of the time demanded stars remain type-casted. For Gable, that meant macho romantic leading action man.\n\nTo me, \"It Happened One Night\" is the best ever romantic comedy film, a gold standard for it's genre. It's lost none of it's charm and naturalness since it's release in 1934. The look of the film dates it, but it still delivers it's original naturalness, charm, wittiness, timing, pacing and entertainment value. Just about a perfectly made film."

This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover, accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey. And in the journey they fall for each other. The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne (Gables) arrogant personality gives it a nice stir. The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh. The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this it's the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Movie, Best Director and Best Screenplay)."

And that is not because it is a love story, Some like it hot proved that such movies can be extraordinary.\n\nSo whom do I recommend this movie? If you like to see all the classics, this is a must watch because it won the big five oscars, which is very rare considering it happened only three times in about a 100 years. If you just want to see a great love story it can also be your movie. Otherwise stay away from it."

        "review_title": "Introspections on It Happened One Night",
        "review_detailed_main": "I recently read a statement that cited something like the test of a good mind is the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. Upon analysis, one can apply this notion to practically anything related to human experience; from concepts as far-ranging as politics and religion to those as close to us as human relationships. Since I had recently seen Capra's marvelous It Happened one Night I was reminded of the moment towards the end of the picture in which Claudette Colbert declares her love for Clark Gable.\n\nI was trying to understand the thought processes of Gable as he lies quietly, but obviously engrossed in his own mental meanderings. Here is the crux of a situation that has been preparing itself, falling towards a desired end since the inception of Gable's desire for Colbert, and yet, he questions the entire situation. As one with emotional cold feet: not wanting to remove his shoes in case the wet sand gives him a cold.\n\nThe strength of his character shows us his childishness; whereas heretofore it was a staple element of Colbert's personality, now it is he who doubts the validity of the next move. And the move must come, as in all denouements where there is a clear sentimental frisson.\n\nBut what if his thoughts per se? Is he thinking as groom, a father figure, a reporter, or just simply a man? Should the self-imposed 'Walls of Jericho' that have hitherto stood firm fall? Should they collapse in a rapture of passion? To be honest, I do not really believe that the 'act' is as important as the preamble. For me, the whole of It Happened One Night is like a road-hogging foreplay in which desire builds into love but out of a deeper understanding between teacher and student figures. One could argue over the continuity in the nature of Gable?s character toward Colbert; the fact that their relationship shows clear evolution has more than amply been recorded elsewhere; but my question now returns to the original premise about 'the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously?'.\n\nGable understands what he is getting himself into. He also understands what he has had to, and will have to go through to both let go of his previous existence as a sassy and streetwise newshound, and to accept a future with this girl who represents so much that he has up to this point detested in his life. Just as Capra had to deal with extremes of class, so too does Gable now find himself having to come to terms with himself in relation to his own class-consciousness.\n\nThe morality lies in the basic 'goodness' of mankind; not the submission to the premise that all 'upper-class?' people are the same or have the same moral standards; no. Worse: that he may have been wrong all along, that he may actually be able to do something about it, and worse yet: the dawning on him as he lays on his bed behind the 'wall?' that he has already succeeded.\n\nWhereas the analysis of film usually extends to its length in feet; the analysis of the human experience can usually humble the mise-en-sc\u00e9ne, especially when the characters are shown to be detailed, complex and deep. Although by today's standards some may analyze Gable and Colbert as being somewhat simplistic, one cannot (and should not) hold current moral values in a social framework up to the lights of 1934's scrutiny, the two as a pair are as rich and meaningful today as they were all those years ago. Furthermore, the processes that burrow through Gable?s mind at hearing simply 'I love you?' when they come not melodramatically, but as the most important words he has wanted to hear.\n\nIronically, the words interrupt his reverie and he clams up almost childishly, hoping but not wanting to hope that he will hear those words. His retorts, sending her back to her bed, reminding her that she is married, his dream-like vociferation of the perfect girl who seems so near and so far are leading him closer to the identification of self. That he might actually be ready to go further with her. That the consummation, not through wordplay but through physical action, is about to happen, lead him, as previously stated, into two minds which by extension, to his two worlds; as reporter and as future husband. All of these dualities (a cold feet of the mind) lead him to the eventual awareness that he is, in fact, juggling with opposing concepts, feelings, worlds, options and although they at first seem contradictory, are nonetheless worthy of him as a person. He is the richer for it, despite what it can cause him in the future.\n\nThe concept is timeless, the inner-conflict likewise. And this is but one small reason why It Happened one night must rate as one of the greatest films ever made."

The story is yet another variation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew', with spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert, on the lam from her overprotective tycoon father, learning about love and humility from brash, mercenary journalist Clark Gable, who insists on calling her (it later becomes a term of endearment) a \"brat\". Too often the screenplay resembles the daydreams of a down-and-out author; how else to explain the fabulously wealthy Colbert suddenly throwing herself at a man later revealed to be \"the best writer in the business\"? But elsewhere Capra's simple, crowd-pleasing sentiments carry the film, allowing the director to jettison credibility without it seeming like too hard a sacrifice."

I have to agree with Claudette Colbert, who couldn't understand why it was and remained so popular. I found it quite overrated and can't hold a candle to many other comedies to come out of the 30's.

The limb is mightier than the hand when it comes to the task of hitching a ride. Problem is in 1934 it was easier to trust strange drivers.\n\n5. Very easy to steal cars by knocking people out and tying them to trees. I'm just never going to try it.\n\n6. Never leave your bus ticket on the seat.\n\n7. You CAN and WILL get to New York on an amount of $4 if you don't buy chocolate, sleep in hay stacks overnight, eat carrots and persuade motel owners you are staying for a week. Of course, it always helps to travel with an unemployed newspaper reporter who has the upper hand threat of black mail.\n\n8. Never be afraid to call home in case of emergency, even if there's not a fortune and fiancee waiting.\n\n9. Blankets are sufficient walls of Jericho to keep the big bad wolf out.\n\n10. Ignore all of the above. No one is crazy enough to play cat and mouse if wads of cash are waiting.\n\nWithout a doubt, this still rates as Capra's best award winning success, by being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Oscars, including the coveted Best Picture of 1934. Capra-esque trademarks and some of the most famous scenes are a part of this classic comedy which made screwballs popular. And the screenplay is full of absolutely delicious moments!\n\nGable and Colbert are at their comic best, it would have been nice if they teamed together again. They both deserved their Oscars. Capra's direction was excellent, but he just got even better, picking up another two best director oscars in four years, this success marking his first.\n\nAlthough my favourite movie of 1934 is still \"The Thin Man\", \"It Happened One Night\" is one of the best movies ever made from the 1930s.\n\nRating: 9/10"

It ought to be as bad as the worst movies Frank Capra ever made, but somehow Capra overcomes everything, even himself, to craft a gem. It's completely absurd, of course, in the way a Dickens novel is absurd, but it works because we wish it could work in reality. And it works because Clark Gable was a mediocre leading man in drama but a fine comedian; because it has the peculiar 1930's way of making men and women oddly both different and equal; because nobody took the whole thing seriously, but just played it out. An absolute don't miss, especially if you're thinking of getting married."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still, it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch. While being the influence of countless films since, It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast, director, and script.\n\nAt the start of the film, we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert) in Florida aboard her wealthy father's luxury boat. Ellen is planning to marry King Westley, but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking. This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return. She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne (Clark Gable). He's a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble. Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is, he proposes a plan to her. He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story, which has become a national headline. While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close.\n\nThe plot flies at a free-flowing pace that allows for wickedly good one-liners. The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama. There is a bit of suspense as the will-they won't-they couple explore their feelings for each other. While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together, but it's never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt. We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes, such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke. They are great in the small amount of time they get and don't distract from the main narrative. One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing. The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are. This makes it hard to track the importance of each setting.\n\nThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy. Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads (often an unmarried man and woman) that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles. If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona, you should thank this film for popularizing the genre.\n\nFrank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it. He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame. He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work.\n\nThe acting is the definite draw and best part of the film. Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances. Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever. He's handsome, quick on his feet, and witty. He also delivers the perfect one-liners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him.\n\nColbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later. She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world. She bounces off Gable's laid back working man character with ease and her one-liners are just as good or even better than his.\n\nWalter Connolly also does a good job as Ellie's wealthy father, Alexander Andrews. He plays the overprotective but also understanding father. At first, he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status, but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways. He's one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be.\n\nIt Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre. Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert, and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema. Even in 2017 the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy."

I liken It Happened One Night to Marty, another cute comedy that swept up nearly all the awards at the Oscars. They're both cute movies, but neither is exceptional of the genre, and neither deserved to sweep awards that belong to the best pictures of the year. Both are large reasons why the Members of the Board at Hot Toasty Rag decided to create their own awards.\n\nAs a mere cute romantic comedy, this isn't bad. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are opposites attracting: she's a runaway spoiled heiress and he's a no-nonsense reporter without a dime to his name. They get left behind by the bus and end up walking and hitchhiking to their destination. Along the way, they bicker incessantly and meet a host of colorful characters. \"Young people in love are never hungry!\" Alan Hale sings as he gives them a brief lift. Claudette gets spanked, criticized, humiliated, and frightened as Clark gives one of the most famous stripteases of all time - and influences every man in American to ditch their undershirts until 1951 when Marlon Brando brought the fashion back. But Clark gets his hat handed to him as he boasts being an expert on everything, and Claudette catches a passing car by lifting her skirt.\n\nOne of the other famous scenes that's frequently spoofed is the accounting scene. Walter Connolly, an accomplished actor who's best known as his role in this movie as Claudette's wealthy father, is paying Clark for his expenses he incurred while taking care of his daughter. He offers a large sum, but Clark refuses and only wants gas and food money. With a smirk and a knowing, fatherly look, he tricks Clark into admitting he's in love.\n\nIf it weren't for the tremendous hype and accolades, it would be a fun movie to watch every once in a while. But there are so many other romantic comedies that are just as good (and some better) that didn't get any attention, so it's a little frustrating. And, since there are any number of actors and actresses who could have played Ellie and Peter, it doesn't seem fair that Claudette and Clark won Oscars for their parts. Constance Bennett, Myrna Loy, Margaret Sullavan, Miriam Hopkins, Carole Lombard, Fredric March, and Robert Montgomery all turned the script down with their various insults - but they all would have been fine. Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, Paul Muni, Robert Young, and James Cagney also would have been fine. If you like this type of movie, you can rent the extremely similar There Goes the Bride or Red Salute. But don't rent the musical remake; it's just awful."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was truly revolutionary when it hit the silver screen! \"It Happened One Night\" swept all four major academy awards back in 1934!! Best Actress (Claudette Colbert) Best Actor (Clark Gable) Best Director (Frank Capra) and, of course, BEST PICTURE!! Why was this movie considered so promiscuous and avant garde? Basically because of all the covert innuendos, and the lewd insinuations which gave every indication that, even back then, sex was not just for pro-creation purposes!! When dealing with the demons inside of your typical red blooded American male..What exactly was it that they had to do to assuage their consciences anyway? Now presides the proverbial instance of a \"gentleman\" having his cake and eating it too. This is not really possible!! Not for a \"gentleman\" anyway! The classic scene in this movie was predicated on Claudette Cobert's actions being of her own volition.. The necessary bed sheet in the most classic scene in \"It Happened One Night\" was construed as a case whereby Clark Gable knew the repercussions of such an ensuing fate without the presence of this symbolic divisiveness!! This film definitely delves into the euphemisms which imply that something had to be done to quell such a precariously enticing and comfortably volatile situation!! Without overt barricades, it would be something other than spiritual growth that Clark Gable would have to worry about!! This film broke ground on the wilder side of male's hormonal nature!! The reciprocating movie audience had a thorough comprehension of what the potential chicanery was which loomed on the horizon! Clark Gable's wiles were emerging and ready to surface!! AFI has listed this as one of the top 100 films ever made in the history of the American cinema. This does not surprise me, the issue of carnal desires always evoked a sordid curiosity with the average movie viewer!! The innocence of maverick movie making entertained the movie audience with this film's innocuous approach!! Being candid about the whole situation, it stands to reason that chivalry has to contend with the formidable foes that are related to the innate and lecherous desires of lonely men!! Frank Capra directs this film, and it goes without saying that Capra is a remarkable director... His list of outstanding movies is endless! \"It's A Wonderful Life\" gets the star lighted accolade of being his stellar mantel piece trophy!! The acting in the film \"It Happened One Night\" was fantastic, and the entertaining double entendre to everything made this film very enjoyable!! By today's standards, of course, this film would not be considered sexually suggestive in any substantial manner whatsoever. However, given the fact that this film was made in 1934, \"It Happened One Night\" became the harbinger of things to come with the advent of depicting how sexual indiscretion can proliferate once Pandora's's box is opened!! Wonderful movie!! The talent in this film is utterly astounding!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Peter, a washed up journalist, accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews, a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away, on a bus while taking a trip to New York. He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him. But on their way to New York they fall in love...\n\nThere are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a \"Yeah, great...but I expected something else\" feeling. But \"It happened one night\" is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations. I was neither a Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie, which won 5 Oscars, but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of, but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time it's actually very clever, carefully written and touching.\n\n-------------\n\nTake this scene for instance. Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back. She doesn't notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar. Ellen, still not turning around, is wondering where he is running of to. After a while Peter, all tired, returns and says: \"He got away...!\" And Ellen not knowing what's going on replies: \"I don't know what you are talking about!\" That's a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool. But this is actually a film more touching than funny. After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter. She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesn't love her. So incredibly magical and yet so simple. It's incredibly high grade of 9/10 on the site rotten-tomatoes.com is justified. Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence, drugs and alcohol. They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw, honest and touching beauty like \"It happened one night\" which exceeds the human mind.\n\nGrade: 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards, this film is still popular today. That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes, the two stars go their separate ways (until the very end) and the story gets very stupid.\n\nThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning (for good intentions) but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood, in films of the 1930s and 1940s, loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here, along with yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference?\n\nHuh?\n\nIf the scriptwriters here would have just kept the \"road\" part of this film going longer - with Gable and Colbert trading barbs - it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixie-ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars.\n\nOne of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch-hiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert, on her first try, gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.\n\nOverall, this is still one of the best comedies of \"The Golden Age,\" even with its faults."

        "review_detailed_main": "As good as Gable and Colbert were together in this good romantic-comedy, they weren't enough, in my opinion, to keep the story from being a little uninteresting. It might just be the fact that I'm not that crazy about romantic-comedies, but I seem to have stopped enjoying the idea of the story after a while. However, I really did enjoy some of the scenes in this classic. For example, the scene where Colbert manages to get a ride with Gable by lifting up her skirt to hitchhike. I also thought that the scenes where Gable undresses and tells Colbert that there aren't two men in the world who do it the same way and the scene where Gable explains to Colbert that dipping your doughnut is an art were brilliant.\n\nOverall, I think it might simply have been the idea of a reporter falling in love with a rich woman whose father does not appreciate her fianc\u00e9 that kind of made this movie, to my eyes, not quite as good as I expected. However, I must give credit to Gable and Colbert for their two very good and very strong performances as well as for Frank Capra's expert directing. I do believe that he is one of those directors who can make those incredibly charming movies better than any other director. I do recommend it for movie-buffs and for fans of Gable, Colbert, and Capra. After all, it was the first movie to win best picture, best actor, best actress, and best director."

        "review_title": "Capra, Claudette, and Clark - and an auto-gyro landing on the lawn",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first film to sweep the main categories of the Oscars (of that time - 1934) was IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. In it Clark Gable plays Peter Warne, a newspaperman who is having problems with his boss Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson), when he latches onto one of the big scoops of his time. Willful Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews (Walter Conolly), has fled her powerful father's yacht, in order to reach the man she claims she loves, an aviator named King Wesley (Jameson Thomas). Ellie is very strong minded and snobbish. She has common sense, but her will sometimes overcomes it. Peter hooks up with her on a bus that is going from Florida to New York. He soon lets her know that he knows her identity, but he will assist her if she will allow him to write of the bus trip for the newspaper.\n\nCapra movies are fun because he did not hesitate to throw in pieces of Americana into them. Here it was bus travel. The interstate highway system that we know of today really dates back to the 1950s (possibly it was the most useful internal achievement of Eisenhower's Presidency), but more and more roads between states were being built in the 1920s and 1930s due to the growth of the use of automobiles. However, Mr. Andrews (well played by Conolly as a stern but loving father - and a good judge of character: he doesn't think highly of Wesley), concentrates his agents at railroad and seaport (and even airport) depots and stations. He doesn't think Ellie will travel in such a plebeian manner as a bus. The bus is driven by Ward Bond, who has a nice, simple comic scene with Gable where all Bond repeats like a dummy is \"YEAH?\", to which an increasingly confused and befuddled Gable is forced \"YEAH!!\". The passengers are a mixed bag, and include Roscoe Karns as a heel and opportunist, and several others who entertain themselves singing \"The Man On the Flying Trapeze\". Ellie finally shows her humanity giving away most of her money to aid a boy and his mother who are so broke the mother fainted from hunger.\n\nEarly trailer parks are shown in the film, as well as the rest stops of the 1930s (note a brief moment when a man in great distress makes a very quiet request for information to a waiter - he is told the comfort station is in the back). It's interesting to see a film like this to catch the changing scene in America in the 1930s or any period, and the things that we now take for granted.\n\nMy one partial criticism of the film as it is it that Wesley is never really built up as a villain - although he is obviously a fortune hunter. He has some celebrity as an aviator (this was the age when men and women of real stature became public figures for aviation achievements: Lindbergh, Earhard, Post, Gatty, Hughes, Amy Johnson, Doolittle, Turner). But even Gable (admittedly jealous after he falls for Ellie) calls him \"the pill of the century\". As a stunt at the wedding ceremony, Wesley lands an auto-gyro on the lawn. Mr. Andrews feels it's silly. But for real villainy in the story, we are left with the treacherous Alan Hale (in one sequence) and Karns as a lecherous and greedy pest.\n\nThat true love finally wins is to be expected. But the journey of Ellie Andrews and Peter Warne is a colorful one that takes us back to a moment when auto travel on the east coast was still quite a little adventure.\n\nThe film won best picture, Capra best director, Gable best actor, and Colbert best actress. Ironically Colbert, a fine actress, never won another Oscar, and Gable (whose signature role was Rhett Butler, not Peter Warne) lost that Oscar of 1939 to Robert Donat (and lost the 1935 Oscar for Fletcher Christian to Victor MagLaglen). However, Peter Warne added more than an Oscar to Gable's legend. His scene where he undressed in a roadside motel room in front of Colbert revealed he did not wear an undershirt. Sales in men's undershirts declined precipitously for a number of years as a result."

        "review_detailed_main": "One day director Frank Capra read a short story in a magazine. It was called \"Night Bus\", and he realized that the material would make a great film. After paying the author $5,000 for the rights, Capra spoke with his boss at Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately, the man in charge didn't think moviegoers were interested in a film about buses, so Capra changed the title. With that, \"It Happened One Night\" was born.\n\nIn the movie, a wealthy businessman locks up his spoiled daughter to prevent an inappropriate marriage. However, she (Claudette Colbert) manages to escape, and tries to get from Florida to New York City by bus. On the trip, she meets a roguish reporter (Clark Gable) to whom she takes an instant dislike. Until romance starts to flower...\n\nIn the '30s, Columbia was one of the smaller studios in Hollywood. They couldn't afford to keep their own roster of contract players, but instead borrowed stars from their bigger \"sisters\". MGM, in turn, used the loan-out system to Columbia as a way to punish their disobedient talents. That's how a tiny \"poverty-row\" studio could suddenly have the illustrious Clark Gable at their disposal.\n\nFrank Capra wanted Claudette Colbert in the female lead, but the actress declined because she'd already booked a skiing vacation. Only when Capra guaranteed that the shoot would be completed in time before her departure did she agree to the film. Colbert later wrote a letter to her agent describing \"It Happened One Night\" as one of the worst movies she'd ever appeared in.\n\nFortunately, that was a judgment not shared by the Academy of Moving Pictures. When the Oscars were awarded that year, \"It Happened One Night\" became the first film to win in all five major categories. Best movie, best director, best actor, best actress and best writing. It would take over 40 years before that happened again."

I think overall to me the movie failed to capture any relationship or chemistry between these characters. The bus scenes that are early in the move were good but it wen downhill after that in my opinion."

Not exactly on a big profound dramatic level like a lot of other films of the 30s- including Capra's It's a Wonderful Life- but it's got such an air of confidence to its light-hearted comedy, and the winning combo of Gable and Colbert. The story is pretty simple, which is good so as to allow for this odd couple to bond and grow in behavioral terms; Colbert is spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews and she's just tied the knot, and Gable plays reporter Peter Warne. She jumps ship and Peter follows. It becomes a road movie soon after that (including the famous \"leg\" bit that's been a staple of male fantasy even up to today to a certain degree), and Capra gets his fun in showing these two characters as being so right for each other for all the wrong reasons. In that sense it's the prototypical romantic comedy, one that we've seen perhaps far too much today and parrotted without a lick of the whimsy Capra gives it. But it's also a big credit to the stars that they keep this tale uplifting (it was the depression after all), and they're simply magnetic personalities to fill up such identifiable personas. It's terrific."

        "review_title": "Here are my notes from when I last introduced it on the big screen...1/2",
        "review_detailed_main": "The idea for tonight's film started in a barber shop while Frank Capra was waiting for a haircut he read an old magazine article in Cosmopolitan called \"Night Bus\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. It was a cute idea so Capra asked Columbia studios to buy the rights to it and then he forgot about it. Frank's previous feature was LADY FOR A DAY which got great reviews and was Columbia studio's first film ever Oscar nominated and Capra's. Irving Thalberg wanted Capra to make his next film at MGM in exchange for $50k and the loan of a star. But at the last minute Louis B. Mayer canceled the film but honored the deal. Back at Columbia Capra wanted to make Night Bus, but studio tyrant Harry Cohn and all his advisers fought against it. They said things like, \"It's nothing; froth, trivia, just another bus picture, no suspense, no heart, no oomph, winter's coming and it's all exteriors.\" All they could get Capra to do was change the title to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT which they said was too long to fit on a marquee! Capra tried casting Myrna Loy \u2013 she turned it down; then Margaret Sullavan \u2013 said 'no thank you'; Miriam Hopkins was insulted and said, 'Not if I never play another part'; Constance Bennett told him to go fly a kite and then offered to buy the script and have it rewritten for her! Capra had co-written the script with his favorite writer Robert Riskin but they brought in Myles Connolly who added more sympathetic and interesting characters so people could identify with them. The pretty girl, a spoiled brat, was rich yes but bored with being an heiress now wanting something real. The man was made a guy we all know and like; a tough crusading reporter on the outs with his pigheaded editor. It's The Taming Of The Shrew, but the shrew must be worth taming and the guy must be one of us. Back to casting, this time they went after Robert Montgomery a great light comedian at MGM. Mayer called Cohn and said, \"Montgomery says there are too many bus pictures and (don't take this in the wrong way) but going from MGM to lowly Columbia was an insult. But you've caught me in a good mood. I got an actor here who's been a bad boy. Wants more money. And I'd like to spank him. You can have Clark Gable.\" Surprisingly the next knock on Capra's shabby office door came from a very drunk and cursing Gable, reporting to Siberia as he called it. Gable's objections almost made Capra throw in the towel but then Harry Cohn suggested getting Claudette Colbert for the girl in the story. (He had heard she liked money.) So Capra and Riskin made an appointment that very night to see her at her home. When they arrived Colbert regretted agreeing to the meeting as she was packing to leave on a month long skiing vacation. Capra saw this attractive, wealthy and spoiled woman and knew she was perfect for the part. So Capra, after being bit in the butt by her dog, asked what it would take to get her in the picture. (Capra had directed her first picture, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE a silent made in 1927 and a flop) To throw him off she said she normally made $25k a picture (a price Columbia had never paid to an actor before), he would have to double it AND she was only available from her studio Paramount during her Christmas vacation. They would have to shoot all her scenes and retakes in less than 4 weeks -- half the time they had budgeted! So Capra called Cohn to ask would he pay her the $50k, Cohn said \"I can pay it if you can shoot it in 4 weeks.\" Capra said, he didn't know, but he'd try. So they told her, \"Deal, Claudette! $50k for 4 weeks! Okay?\" To which she replied, \"Oh for God's sake!\" She was trapped. That next day she had to report for her costume fittings and the day after that they begin filming\u0085 in a hurry. While they shot film all day Capra edited and rewrote the story to tighten it up at night. To make the film and story move quicker he asked the actors to talk faster, his amazing cinematographer Joseph Walker to shoot faster. They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the \"walls of Jericho.\" Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night, the film which won pretty much every Oscar worth winning, still holds up remarkably well for a film produced over 75 years ago. It's a film with a very simple story but that story is engaging, charming and often quite humorous. The fact that so much of the humor survives intact all these years later is perhaps most impressive. Obviously sensibilities were quite different in 1934 than they are in 2010. But most everything still works. And it's not just a good film, it's also a time capsule of sorts, a look at an entirely different world. Obviously many modern films have been produced set in the same time period as this film's story. But those new films look back at the past through different eyes, presenting modern perceptions of what life was like back then. This movie is the real deal, a slice of 1930s American life, the way it really was. To the modern eye some of the things we see in this film seem almost unbelievable. This is how people really lived? But it was only 75 years ago, an eye's blink of history really. And that is part of what makes this film so fascinating.\n\nOf course the one thing above all else that this film has going for it is that it has Hollywood royalty in the two lead roles. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are just as terrific as you would expect them to be and both duly picked up Academy Awards. Of course pretty much everyone involved with the film except the caterer picked up an Academy Award but I digress. Gable and Colbert certainly earned their golden statues. Gable plays Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled runaway heiress. Running away from what? Well she recently got married and her father most certainly did not approve. So before the marriage could be consummated Daddy dearest essentially took his daughter hostage on his yacht down in Florida, far away from the new husband in New York. What's a girl to do? Well, jump off the yacht of course. From there it's going to be a long, strange trip to New York. Ellie gets on a bus, meets Peter and now the film really gets going.\n\nOnce our story has been set up there's really not much left in the way of plot. It's a simple story about the obstacles Ellie will face on her long journey. There sure are plenty of obstacles though. And this woman, used to all of life's luxuries, really has very little idea how to interact among the common folk. She needs someone to look after her and Peter falls into this role. It's a fun trip, with many memorable moments along the way. One scene in particular stands out with Peter and Ellie having to pose as a quarreling married couple. They could have stopped the film and handed Gable and Colbert their Oscars right there. There's also the famous hitchhiking scene, there's the Walls of Jericho, there's even a possible inspiration for Bugs Bunny. Now for all the moments which do work there are admittedly a few which don't. Some things are a little hokey but not absolutely everything is going to translate over 75 years. And while it's an engaging story it's not an altogether dramatic one as there's a sense of inevitability hanging over the whole thing. But the movie has to be deemed a success. It's witty, charming, amusing and ultimately quite memorable. Director Frank Capra, helped in no small part by the performances of his two great stars, produced a film which not only was a classic in its time but which still stands up today all these decades later."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's 1934 film \"It Happened One Night\" paved the way for many copycats; even the soap opera \"General Hospital\" had a story arc that involved a runaway - bridegroom this time - and those famous Walls of Jericho. Not only that, but it changed the undershirt industry and inspired a famous bunny pose.\n\nThe story takes place during the Depression, when hitchhiking was common. It concerns an heiress, Ellie (Claudette Colbert) who runs away from her father to join her sort-of husband in New York. On the bus, she meets a reporter named Peter (Clark Gable) who is down on his luck. The strike a bargain: Peter can have an exclusive on Ellie's story if he'll help her get to New York.\n\nThough many actors turned down the lead roles, the combination of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is perfect. Gable is appropriately a gruff know-it-all with oodles of sex appeal; Colbert is beautiful, spoiled and uppity. My favorite moment is when she coolly informs the bus driver that she's leaving so hold the bus for her.\n\nAny even peripheral fan of the film has heard that when Gable undressed and was wearing no undershirt, sales of undershirts plummeted. Perhaps a little less well known is that Gable's standing by a fence talking with a carrot in his mouth is allegedly the inspiration for Bugs Bunny. The most famous scene, of course, is Gable demonstrating how to hitch a ride and failing and Colbert lifting her skirt to get one immediately.\n\nFrank Capra is known for his feel good, idealistic films, but there was much more to this director than that, as \"It Happened One Night\" demonstrates. He gives the film a wonderful pace and gets marvelous performers out of his cast, which includes Walter Connolly as Ellie's father, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale and Ward Bond. It's a comedy, but Capra shades it with earmarks of the Depression. A slice of life in the 1930s, a wonderful comedy - well, in the end, it's a feel good film after all."

Although it was the first movie to sweep the Academy awards, taking home Actor, Actress, Director and Picture, when seen today, it's almost nothing more then a light 30's comedy surely to be put on the lower tier of Academy Award best picture winners. Oh sure, the Gable and Colbert team are great, chemistry going right and left, and maybe they earned their Oscars. But best picture? To be honest with you, the only reason it became so massively popular, is because this was what the USA needed during the years of the Great Depression, a riotous comedy that people could escape to forget their troubles. Much like the ridiculous 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', this was the right picture at the right time, (and uh, the right influential director) to take home the big prize. Did I like it? Sure, but this is a movie that's far too praised for what it's worth."

Also, arguably the beginnings of the screwball comedies, the film is a joy from start to finish, plus with Blu-ray you get to enjoy all those cars and buses and hot dog stands. Whilst the film plays with the idea of coyness, it is more or less pre-code and gets away with many a wisecrack that would have been cut the following year. Good script, lines beautifully delivered and the speed and screen wipes ensure (until the rather unnecessary hold up towards the end with all the wedding build up) that this moves like a bullet and facilitating multiple viewings.

This is a good example of the 'odd couple' comedy. It's a treat to see the debonair Gable handle some of his zingers from the script, and his double-act with Colbert really clicks into gear by the time the two opposites are forced to share a hotel room. Factory owners everywhere were cursing the demise of the undershirt, though!\n\nYou're in capable hands if you like a romantic comedy with nimble players. As is too often the case with me, though, I got so wrapped up in the central relationship that I became mildly irritated at the frequent cutaways to the subplot where the father tries to get his absconding daughter back... That, then, is why I don't rate it as highly as some - but oh well, I've still got the lively banter to enjoy... !"

(And, boy, did she ever have it coming to her!)\n\nI can't begin to tell you how much I wished that this royal, high'n'mighty bitch had gotten her over-lacquered face slapped a few more times, but, of course, it never happened.\n\nOver the years I have heard (time & again) people literally falling all over themselves, raving away to me about \"It Happened One Night\" (IHON) being the ultimate \"be-all-and-end-all\" of Hollywood, screwball comedies.\n\nWell, I must say, that after giving IHON a fair enough view, I couldn't believe how petty, small and downright trivial its sappy story was.\n\nNot only was there absolutely no on-screen chemistry, whatsoever, taking place between IHON's 2 co-stars (Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert), but, I thought that Colbert's character (Ellie Andrews) was positively despicable and I couldn't have given a wet fart about her \"poor-little-rich-girl\" problems.\n\nAnd, not only that, but, Colbert (who was 31 at the time) was clearly way too old to be playing this part which would have been more suited for a younger woman of about 20.\n\nI am absolutely shocked out of my socks that this trite, little, nothing-of-a-movie actually swept the 1935 Oscar presentations by scoring for itself 5 of its prized awards in all of the top categories of \"Picture\", \"Actor\", \"Actress\", \"Director\" & \"Screenplay\".\n\nBack in \"Depression Era\" America IHON might have thrilled and delighted its audiences to literal pieces, but, today, 80 years later, its apparent charm & appeal (which doesn't hold up very well) got completely lost on this here viewer.\n\nAll that IHON came across as being was just a completely contrived, clich\u00e9d and predictable story whose attempt at cuteness and coyness left me utterly unmoved.\n\nFrom my point of view, this rather flat and tired \"Boy-Meets-Girl\" Comedy/Romance was, at best, only mediocre entertainment."

From the moment Gable appears on film, (calling his boss from a pay phone while he's drunk), every scene from then on is a classic to this viewer. Not a single missed step does Capra take. Claudette's confrontation with Oscar Shapely from Orange, NJ is classic as is Gable's confrontation with him later. The scene where everyone on the bus sings 'The Man on The Flying Trapeze' is a gem. The scene where Gable & Colbert are forced to get a room for the night and Clark introduces the 'Walls of Jerico' as well as the donut dunking lesson the next morning and the plumber's daughter, and on and on.\n\nGable & Colbert are magnificent together. Capra, Gable and Colbert deserve every single award they received for this movie. It's an absolute masterpiece."

        "review_title": "The Birth of Romantic Comedy ...",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"It Happened One Night\" opens with two people profoundly disliking each other, a tough, blue-collar, down-to-earth journalist and a rich, spoiled and bratty heiress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, who both won Oscars for their respective roles, couldn't have played characters that were more opposite in their backgrounds and manners. Yet at the end, following one of the most creative and wink-inducing metaphors in cinema's history, they 'break the Jericho walls' together. Yes, this is an obligatory code of the romantic-comedy genre, but it's precisely because the film is the one that established these very codes.\n\nYet, regardless of its influence on other movies or the predictable ending, there's one thing that makes the film stand on its own as a wonderful classic: it's a director's film and not anyone because his name is Frank Capra. \"It Happened One Night\" marks the spectacular entrance of the most significant director of Hollywood's Golden Age: a Sicilian emigrant who embraced the American dream with such intensity that it would show in each of his films, comedies or dramas. Through \"It Happened One Night\", Capra built his reputation of a talented director whose films would forever display a vision of America never deprived of a humanistic touch.\n\nI must say though that I was surprised to read some harsh Internet a user complaining about the way Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) was treated by Peter Warne (Clark Gable). Indeed, all through the picture, she got yelled at, threatened and the icing of the cake: she got spanked. It's very eloquent about today's narrow-mindedness and the way every single thing is automatically associated to a conflict between men and women. It's not surprising because it's the very plot element that would drive most of the romantic comedies today. It did well for \"When Harry Met Sally\u0085\" but it also reduced the genre to bourgeois-like comedy of manners with no other purpose than underlining a sort of eternal opposition between male and women. As for the class struggle, it's now translated to modern fairy-tale format with mixed results, sometimes good (\"Coming to America\") sometimes, not so good (\"Maid in Manhattan\") but always superficial in the end.\n\nThe class struggle is naturally more significant in 1934 in the context of the Great Depression Indeed, Frank Capra, cleverly uses the comedic story to subtly write a social commentary about the America of the 30's, it's not as militant as his later works but it does provide a slice of life of America's people in a few scenes. Some of them reach very dramatic points, like when Peter gives all the money left to a kid whose mother fainted from hunger in the bus. The film provides remarkable examples of the solidarity that prevailed during those difficult times and that were totally ignored by the rich people who lived in a world where everything, everyone could be bought. Gable strikes the viewer by delivering a very punchy speech against Colbert, and we could read between the lines of his rant, what would constitute the essential of Capra's themes and messages in his next films. This intelligent and thought- provokingly humanistic side is the little flavor that remains after the laughs, but there are still laughs. A few romantic comedies try to mix the humor with social commentaries, and the miracle of \"It Happened One Night\" is that it never contradicts the overall mood of the film, which is very warm and delightful.\n\nTo a certain extent, the film is Capraesque on the surface but in its core, it's a hilarious and entertaining screwball comedy. The film was one of Columbia's picture major hits and that definitely launched Capra's career: had it failed, maybe we wouldn't have known Mr. Smith or George Bailey, but again, thankfully, nothing ever comes to alter the overall quality. It's funny, romantic and witty. Of course, it's also known for having been the first film to win the 5 major Awards in history, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (coincidentally, all these films won 5 Awards) Well, on that level, what happened that Oscar's night was totally deserved.\n\nCapra's directing is very powerful in the way it creates a parallel between the road trip across America and the romance between Peter and Ellie, it's Ellie's immersion into the lives of little people who sing and dance in the bus, who share food, money and laughs, and the realization that she can find happiness in this world. Through Ellie, it's also Capra's way to make us feel for this world and wish people could stand together as they did these days and he makes it through a perfect dosage of wit, of slapstick gags and verbal exchanges, the five minutes of the film about the hitch-hiking are as comedic as comedy can get, with the perfect balance between sophistication and a naughtiness, which is perfect for the romance.\n\nGable is masculine with a very sensitive way about him and Colbert is very strong-willed yet sentimentally vulnerable. There's something extremely childish and endearing in these two characters that seem like constantly playing games, hiding their true feelings, acting tough, as if it was the only possible facade. Like when Gable pretends to be a gangster and then accidentally spits on his sleeve or a more dramatic part where he rejects Colbert's declaration and she bursts into silent tears on her bed. Both Peter and Ellie are like trapped in their own carapace and incapable of making the first step, to our own frustration. But that's the way Capra handles its characters, it's only at the end that everything gets well.\n\nSee, there are two ways, the easy way, the hard way, and the Capraesque way. It's like the hard way, but wittier."

On her way she meets a struggling reporter, who decides to stick with her with a story in mind. Together they experience the joys of life. If this sounds vaguely familiar, it might be because you've seen the 1953 classic, Roman Holiday, the plot of which fits the exact same description. This came first, however.\n\nThe are also differences. Whereas Roman Holiday is a pretty clear romantic city comedy, this movie can best be described as a road trip movie. It's also a bit more dramatic, or at least not as clearly a comedy. Overall I find Roman Holiday to be the superior film, but that's mainly due to the strength of its main leads. It Happened One Night certainly has star power going for it, with Clark Gable proving himself Gregory Peck's equal in all ways that matter. But if you were to tell me Claudette Colbert was just as good in this as Audrey Hepburn was in Roman Holiday, I'd punch you. Not that Colbert is bad, mind you, but her character is written pretty passive. I blame mostly the era, but the problem still exists.\n\nNevertheless, I do like this film. Frank Capra's light, idealistic world view is evident throughout and it's just such a joy to experience. In his world people still believe is basic goodness and there are no true villains. Or if there are, there are also plenty of people to laugh at them or to thwart their evil schemes.\n\nWhat can I say, they don't make movies like these anymore. An attempt to make a movie such as this nowadays just wouldn't fly. It would be seen as too naive. Its dialogue as too corny, its characters as lacking humane flaws. But in denying ourselves films such as these, we're losing something. Whether its simple honesty or something else. But we're losing it.\n\nAnd that's a shame."

        "review_detailed_main": "Robert Riskin's screenplay is filled with plentiful wit and repartee. The dynamics between the chief characters are ripe for comedy, and the situational humor in the picture is fantastic. Clark Gable and especially Claudette Colbert give wonderfully spirited performances that are a real pleasure to watch, not least as they have outstanding on-screen chemistry; I could easily stand to watch ten more films starring these two. The scene writing and narrative at large sharp and smart, a true delight, and who but Frank Capra could be relied upon to make a movie with so much lighthearted warmth? Some moments that would come off as ham-handed in another title are executed with a joyous earnestness that's welcome and refreshing; in contrast, some scenes and dialogue are so silly that the term \"screwball comedy\" feels insufficient, elevating mundanity to an art form of ridiculousness. All this would be more than enough in and of itself, but the production design and art direction are rich and inviting, and the costume design and hair and makeup no less so. Joseph Walker's cinematography, meanwhile, is at once both soft and vivid, allowing 'It happened one night' to literally be easy on the eyes. It's no wonder why this is held in such high regard, for even ninety years on, it's superbly entertaining!\n\nThis isn't to say that it hasn't aged at all in that same time. While unlikely pair Peter and Ellen do come around, with more depth to both becoming evident, it's worth noting that to some extent the film falls into the same trap as a great many of its contemporaries. The man is always right, dontcha know, and good and clever and wise, particularly compared to a woman is always a spoiled brat, dontcha know, and he must look out for her and teach her the error of her ways and all that's wrong about her. As fun and cheeky as the picture is, I'd be lying if I said it didn't take a while at first for me to warm up to it, for earlier scenes reek of sexist condescension that's altogether tiresome. This is almost rather flummoxing, considering the fabulous intelligence, ingenuity, and heart that characterizes the movie at large. Some specific scenes are so terrific that I want to say they're among the best (if not simply the superlative) in the entirety of Capra's oeuvre, and surely very high on the list in cinema overall. The tale truly didn't need to be so heavy-handed in its exposition to provide the necessary contrast to propel the eventual shift, and to set up the inevitable conclusion.\n\nThe good news is that much more than not the feature is so strong and vibrant that its value far outweighs the early weakness. It's not forgotten, or forgiven, but it pales in comparison. Why, even as 'It happened one night' seems to run a bit long in the tooth, the last twenty minutes or so are also executed so finely that every last vestige of consternation is all but wiped from the slate. There is, in my mind, an asterisk appended to this movie, but it's small and slight next to the tremendous worth the title otherwise represents. I expected a good time before I sat to watch, yet when all is said and done this is far better and more essential a view than I could have anticipated. Gable and Colbert are marvelous, with supporting cast members like Walter Connolly having their own moments in the sun; the cast turned in sublime contributions; the writing and direction are almost as good as any could possibly get. Ultimately this is just a classic, period, and one that just about everyone needs to see at least once. There's a reason Capra has the reputation that he does, and 'It happened one night' is proof positive. However you need to go about watching it, this is well worth your time!"

Unlike Gone with the Wind's Scarlett O'Hara, his companion in this film is a ditz who never rises from her cluelessness and dependence. This interaction is what makes the film unique but also a bit strange, as the supposed charm of Peter Warnes comes across as exploitative and domineering and it is hard to sympathise with him or the happy ending. The film is full of lifelike acting, zany and memorable moments, and an overall classic plot, but is let down by questionable characterisation."

First he tries to get a good story out of that, then he inevitably falls in love.\n\nShe's reluctant and the ending is supposed to be a surprise. It isn't but for sure it's the precursor of countless similar scenes of runaway brides.\n\nInteresting for its historical value and also for the short scenes with the Shapeley character that allegedly inspired the creation of Bugs Bunny."

        "review_title": "Frank Capra - The ultimate story-teller",
        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra is widely regarded as a revolutionary director and this movie constitutes substantially to this tag. 'It happened one Night' was the first movie of it's kind way back in the 30's where romantic comedies were yet to be born. This is considered as the first major romantic comedy in Hollywood history. Add to it, it was the first ever 'Screwball comedy' movie. Yup, this was actually a new genre invented by Capra. After reading some trivia about the movie, I came to know that the leads Gable and Colbert hated the script so much that they wanted to get over with the movie as soon as possible. Actually, the story of this movie is so simple that it can be explained in a paragraph. But the story-teller that Capra is, this simple story is converted into a very lovable and feel good rom-com which never ceases to amaze you. The movie is full of clich\u00e9s such as a rich spoilt girl falling in love with a not so wealthy guy and the girl running away from her marriage once she realizes her true love etc etc. But one must also consider the time when this movie was made. Perhaps, this was the first bride runway from marriage scene of cinema history. This movie also influenced a lot of other artists and filmmakers. The cartoon Bugs Bunny is influenced by one of the characters from this movie. Bollywood influence being 'Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahi'.\n\nThis was the first movie to win an Oscar Grandslam, i.e all the top 5 major Oscars - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay - A Feat achieved 40 years later by 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Clark Gable rules the screen with his comic timing and exceptional screen presence. Claudette Colbert will make you fall in love with her, a very natural performance considering the era in which the movie was made.\n\nOverall, Be a part of history and watch this movie keeping your critics hat aside.\n\nRating : 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "While this is definitely not my type of movie I had a great time watching Frank Capra's 1934 \"It Happened One Night.\" The pace and timing throughout this movie is impeccable and I really enjoyed Claudette Colbert's role as the wealthy heiress trying to escape her father's wrath and find true love. The movie is a lot racier and more risque than many movies of the '40s and '50s. There also seemed to be a lot more location shooting than you find in most movies of this era.\n\nThis movie works a lot better than the more modern sappy romances for me, like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\" Wile all of these stories are simple and contrived in such a way to ensure everything works out \"for the best\" in the end, it somehow seems a lot more believable with Gable and Colbert at the helm."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not one for comedies, but this was a good one.\n\nThe first film to win the 5 major Oscars, 'Happened' stars the legendary Clark Gable as he accompanies a spoiled girl from Miami to New York, played by Claudette Colbert. Along the way she learns a thing or two about the rest of the people in America. (This is a film in the Depression.)\n\n'Happened' has a very \"love to hate you\" vibe about it between the two leads, whose blossoming relationship is the star of the film. Beginning with a bus ride, the duo ride, walk, hitchhike and sleep in various locations, jabbing at each other for most of it. The do seem an odd couple at first, but you grow to love them, as they do each other. It's cool, because you could argue the \"tipping point\", where each realizes their feelings for each other, is one of many scenes.\n\nWhile on the topic of scenes, there are some great ones. The bus, the songs, the \"gangster\", the hitchhiking, and my favourite, the angry couple (\"QUIT BAWLING!\") keep the film fresh and funny, until the last act where the 'rom' in this rom-com takes over. That is until the very end, where a great running joke gets the last laugh.\n\nCapra's direction is great: the characters constantly develop, the journey moves, and the film feels just right.\n\nA great early romantic comedy heavy on laughs and love. Fans of classics will love this. 8.4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "There have been written so many things about \"It Happened One Night\" that it's probably not really necessary to add anything else; the plot is known, its huge success (including the Oscar Award for Best Picture of 1934) is known - there only remains one question for me: is it really THAT different from all the other screwball comedies of the time, and THAT much better? We've seen \"Ball of Fire\", we've seen \"Bringing Up Baby\", we've seen \"Bluebeard's Eigth Wife\" and many others of the kind; and they were all about equally funny and equally well made and acted - in fact, some of them are even more entertaining, because with a running time of 105 minutes, \"It Happened One Night\" is a bit overlong and DOES have its lengthy periods. And there also are MANY other comedies from the same time, which are MUCH less known, and yet almost more unusual and inventive - like \"Three Cornered Moon\", made just a year earlier and also starring Claudette Colbert.\n\nNow was it the studio's PR machinery (and it was VITAL for Columbia to land a success that year, because otherwise they would have gone bankrupt), was it the impact of Clark Gable, who was rising like a shooting star at the time, were it the last glimpses of pre-Code frivolity (like when Claudette Colbert teaches Gable about hitch-hiking, and lifts her skirt instead of her thumb; or the constant talk about the 'Walls of Jericho', the blanket that separated their beds...) - it's all OK with me, of course, it may not be the VERY best of the classic screwball comedies IMHO, but it's surely good, clean fun to watch even today!"

        "review_detailed_main": "My quest to watch more classic movies(going rather slowly,BTW)pointed me toward this film,a historically relevant as well as critically well-received film. While I probably watched it wrong(I saw in in parts,due to my sometimes business,laziness or easily-distractedness),what I saw was still a marvel of earlier,\"Golden Age\" film-making,rife with fast-talking,quick-acting,chain-smoking men and women who couldn't bear to be out in public wearing anything but suits,slacks,ties,dresses,hats and shiny shoes! Particular in this pastiche were the matin\u00e9e stars,Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert,the very examples of bygone film style. This movie,a relatively early offering from legendary filmmaker Frank Capra,was able to use their style,savvy and moxie to full comic effect.\n\nSpoiled and sheltered heiress Ellie Andrews(Colbert,with a face that didn't NEED the soft-cell photography.Not that it hurt)wants to reunite with her playboy,estranged husband(Jameson Thomas),so she bolts from her father's yacht and decides to go it alone. She'll need help,as it turns out,and help comes in the way of opportunistic reporter Peter Warne(Gable,in a performance that's cobbled maybe a 1,000 impressions!),smelling an exclusive story. He's set on believing she's a stupid,spoiled heiress,and while she does little to change that impression,he somehow falls in love with her. But with the newspapers abuzz with the story of a runaway heiress and her wealthy daddy(Walter Connolly,underrated)offering a good-sized reward for her return,WArne has to decide the age old question: the girl or the money? Oh,yes,and the story.\n\nHistorically relevant for being the first of three(to date)sweeps of the Academy Awards(Best Pic,Actor,Actress and Director),this movie may've dudded with less kinetic actors,but the principals deliver here. While I cannot call this a favorite of mine,it's still a must-see for people who want to grasp some of Hollywood's old glory,an old-fashioned love story/madcap comedy or just a cheap,quality rent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it's evident why the many attempts to re-capture the spirit of this film have failed. The story really isn't all that good. What works is watching how Clark Gable (as Peter Warne) and Claudette Colbert (as Ellie Andrews) make the most of the script, with help from director Frank Capra. They play the reluctant lovers quite magically - coming across like a couple of performers having fun with the project. Possibly, the sparring of their characters parallels the two stars discovering their professional \"chemistry\". There is a sense of fun (the script calls it \"screwy\") about the film, thanks to Mr. Capra and his famous stars.\n\nMost memorable are the leading couple's \"risqu\u00e9\" scenes - Mr. Gable baring his chest when explaining how men undress, and Ms. Colbert lifting her skirt to hitch a ride - they are sexy and tasteful. And, Roscoe Karns' \"Oscar\" is worthy. The ability to create \"fun\" from \"dumb\" was improved on, in better films - but re-making this rather dated and unappealing story would obviously be futile. You can't re-make Capra, Gable, and Colbert - and that's what happened one night.\n\n******* It Happened One Night (2/22/34) Frank Capra ~ Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Roscoe Karns, Walter Connolly"

While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said \"now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver\" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie in my Film & The Humanities at my college. And I found it dull and a dread to watch. It's a competently made film with good production design and solid actors working on it. But the rotten core of this film is with its two main characters and how they unnecessarily complicate the story. The movie has actually had a pretty good setup as a woman, Ellen played by Claudette Colbert, betrothed to a king runs from her father to be with her fianc\u00e9. Upon going bus to bus to get there, she meets Clark Gable's character named Peter who's an egotistical, newspaper man. At first their chemistry is fun. But where this movie really started rubbing me the wrong way is how controlling Peter is towards Claudette. I get it, it's old-fashioned but with the demeanor Gable gives the character, it feels unhealthy. She doesn't seem to enjoy it either, nor does she hint or explicitly say so. For a character that made an active decision in escaping from her father, she doesn't play an active role through nearly the rest of the movie. Like I said, Peter takes her and pretty much dictates all her actions their on till a certain point til' the end. Their chemistry mainly involves them being snappy with each other. I felt no amount of dialogue or character actions made me learn anything new or significant about these characters. Therefore, I struggled to make a connection with them. Plus, there are many problems in the story that felt very contrived and forced (especially towards the end). So many of these problems feel like they can be solved with simple character dialogue.\n\nAnd I understand many of these tropes are very garnered to old styles of film. But considering the vast amounts of movies that do a far better job capturing romance, this movie only shows how much we've gotten better at it. If you can deal with these tropes, all power to you. I just could not stand it and it really was killing my patience.\n\nOverall, this movie has a great actors, good production design, but it severely lacks in the character/character department and it severely suffers from that. Especially with these obnoxious tropes instilled into it.\n\nI'm giving this one a 3 out of 10..."

Frank Capra talked about how he felt the original cut had too much humor that it overshadowed more of the Drama that he was trying to convey with the film with the mix of comedy. There are some innuendos the almost kiss and The Wall of Jericho it there while not as in your face It does get a fair number of laughs if you can appreciate the style of humor for its time. The Cast itself Clark Gable and Claudette Cobert add a fair deal of chemistry and dynamic between the two with them. The Bickering and the Collaboration between what would because trope and established elements. The Two of them are complete opposites in almost every way. A down on his lucky working-class man and A Spoiled Heiress. She's to marry this sort of a pushover in a way guy, but then you have Gable who's more a man who's not a pushover who gives orders and talks back to his Boss.

I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, \"it was a different time!\" but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.\n\nDespite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, \"she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret\" but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word \"demented\" popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.\n\nThe characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks. I hope no bizarre situation occurs in which I am ever forced to watch this again.\n\n4/10\n\nBye love you"

However, unlike some other formulaic cash grabs you might see today, nothing about the misunderstanding felt forced or overly coincidental. The acting was great, and Clark Gabels performance was charming, smooth, and reluctant, akin to Bogart in Casablanca."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night is one of the only three movies since the commencement of the Academy Awards to have been able to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay), a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and of cause latter on in 1991, Anthony Hopkins The Silence of the Lambs followed suit.\n\nHere is a romantic comedy as raw as they come giving you a thrill as you watch two people miss matched from the start found a way to fall in love and tour America on their way to New York. The funny thing about the movie is the name which says, \"It happened one night\" when actually in the movie's story it actually went on for more than a night.\n\nThe movie plot is about Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) who has been whisked away by her father in his yacht to keep her away from her new husband King Westley. Ellie then jumps ship, swim to shore and heads off to New York to meet with King Westley. On her way she meets a reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and both started as an unsuitable pair that grew to be lovers.\n\nBoth Colbert and Gable felt the movie was not going to be good enough and gave Capra a lot of bull. Even the movie's iconic scene where Colbert lifted up her skirt to stop a car during the hitchhiking scene, was not so easy to film for Capra as Colbert refused to do the scene claiming it was not lady like, but upon seeing a body double do it, she later changed her mind and did it herself.\n\nAlthough picking up slow, the movie later became one the biggest hits for the studio and the thing is that at the end the movie cleared the Academy Awards and both Gable and Colbert were better off. Colbert is known to have told a friend, \"I just finished the worst picture in the world.\" She boycotted the Academy Awards when she got a nomination believing she will not win, but she was called back to come pick up her award.\n\nHere is a movie that actually makes you smile all the way through, although like the actors themselves upon initial siting of the film you can be turned off thinking this is heading nowhere, but be patient the movie has all the familiar scenes that we see in the movies today (all taken from this old classic). This old classic is tagged the 46th greatest film in the last 100 years in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).\n\nIt Happened One Night is a nice DVD for one to place on the shelf.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

It happened one night did incredibly well at The Oscars, scooping five huge awards, deservedly so.\n\nThe time flew by, it's genuine a film you can get lost in.\n\n8/10."

No one liked the project. Clark Gable was banished to the film as a punishment, and I'm quite sure that in 1934 Frank Capra was not looked upon with the high regard his films enjoy today.\n\nYet everything came together in this \"bus movie\", as it was derisively called pre-production, and a charming, funny, and moving story unfolded.\n\nOnly a few years into \"talkies\", the film set the tone and stage for the antithetical courtship that would become virtually ubiquitous for romantic comedies. Don't believe me? How do you decide who is going to get together at the end of a romantic comedy? Its the two people that early on hate each others' guts, right? Right. Every one of those movies is in some way derivative of \"It Happened One Night\".\n\nUnless you just hate \"old movies\", watch and enjoy. Or if you've already seen it, renew your relationship with the film. It is absolutely worth it."

Only three films have managed to win the so-called Big Five - including 'Best Picture', 'Best Director', 'Best Actor', 'Best Actress', and 'Best Original Screenplay'. Nearly ninety years after its release, Capra's work still retains a certain charm and a few relatively amusing dialogues, although it also contains some rather sluggish passages.\n\nA film worth seeing - a classic Hollywood entertainment of its time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The ONLY good thing about this movie is Clark Gable whose shirtless scenes actually led to a decrease in undershirt sales in the United States upon this movies release (that's true, and the funniest thing about this movie). Now I'm not someone who is opposed to old movies or even old comedies (though I think that pretty much all of them are products of their times, as are movies today). But I don't find this movie funny at all. It doesn't have witty lines and verbal humor nor does it have much slapstick or goofy stuff. It doesn't really have any funny material, unless you find some annoying sailors on a bus singing the \"daring young man on the trapeze\" to be hilarious. BTW the one sailors solo and dance proves that gays have been in the military for at least 70 years. Even the Romantic portion of this movie is weak, mainly considering that Claudette's character is very unappealing. She is really winey and not funny at all. If you are looking for a classic comedy check out The Marx Brothers, The Thin Man series (which I think are still hilarious today, Asta alone is better then this entire movie), W.C. Fields, or even Buster Keaton (if you want to go that far back...he is better then Chaplin). I guess I'd recommend this movie to Gable fans or people who want to see what won best picture in 1934 (im sure there was something better). This is just one of those movies that has since attained untouchable classic status and is on the critics funniest movie lists. It isn't funny and as much as I hate to admit it, I laughed more watching Happpy Gilmore (I don't like Sandler) then I did at this movie.\n\nZoopansick"

        "review_detailed_main": "During production, hardly anyone, except director Frank Capra, believed that this film was worth doing. Clark Gable had been loaned from MGM to Columbia to be the male lead. 30ish Claudette Colbert was to play the ing\u00e9nue. Both were very reluctant to be a part of this film. It was given little promotional attention upon release. Yet, somehow, audiences loved it, as they generally still do. It's certainly one of my favorite romantic comedies, having seen it a number of times over the years. Claudette was so cute and Gable so handsome. They both had great screen comedic talent, and great screen chemistry.\n\nClaudette and Gable would reunite 6 years later in \"Boom Town\". However, this was not a romantic comedy, and was not as well received.\n\nAnother film from the '30s that somewhat resembles this film is \"Desire\". If you enjoyed the present film, you will likely also enjoy that film. It stars Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich. Like the present film, it's largely a 'road' romantic comedy, with them being mostly antagonistic until they settle down and get to know each other better. However, Marlene wasn't as cute as Claudette, nor as good a comedian. Nonetheless, if you find Marlene fascinating, it's worth seeing.\n\nSee both these films at YouTube."

Almost 100% indoor sets & poor picture quality somehow discouraged me to be perfectly honest, however lame that sounds. \"It Happened One Night\" was encouraging thanks to Frank Capra & Clark Gable. I haven't seen too many of Gable's movies except Gone with the Wind. However, I did not know what to expect from him in such a jolly, maverick role. He was absolutely brilliant. His deliveries were so sharp, his sense of humour was so good, I had no doubt since then why he was such a popular man among the ladies. His intro scene is absolutely hilarious and reveals much of what to expect from him. You couldn't blame Claudette Colbert for falling in love with him; even for 30s, he wasn't a boring \"gentleman\", but a cool guy. He had his own reasons, sense of morality and more importantly, real and like much of America then, poor. Its absolutely enjoyable ride, no matter which type of movies you enjoy. I'd give it an 8+ happily!"

The sense of character dynamics and development is what really carries the story here. Colbert and Gable's relation is exciting, and I really enjoyed the film's atmosphere, rather than the plot itself, although excellent on its own.\n\nThe charm and snappy wit of Clark Gable is unmistakable, and to me reminiscent of \"Gone with the Wind\".

This doesn't go unnoticed by the shrewd \"Warne\", who soon reckons her story is worth a load of cash to his editor. What neither reckon on though, is that their initial hostility/indifference to each other gradually morphs into something - well, yes, you can guess that bit. Indeed, the story itself has a degree of predictability to it - but that doesn't matter here. This is a quickly paced, well written comedy drama that utilises the intimacy of the bus (or the motels) to provide an excellent vehicle for two actors who just exude a joyous chemistry - never a romantic, or sentimental one - as they try to stay one step ahead of the blokes sent by her father to return her to safety and to her affianced \"King Wesley\" (Jameson Thomas) who is the latest cause of the familial discord (her father loathes this opportunist fellow). Tables are turned and turned again as each try to outmanoeuvre the other - with Walter Connolly turning in quite an engaging performance as the dad who also knows there is more than one way to skin a cat. This might be my favourite Gable outing - he had a lovely smile and glint in his eye for comedy parts when he was enjoying himself and Colbert is also at the top of her game for a thoroughly enjoyable and spirited look at human nature and bloody-mindedness."

I had intended to watch only the first few minutes before flipping channels, but was swept into the farcical situation and ended up going to my New Years party somewhat later than intended. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable were inimitably charming and delightful... their clothed banter had more scorching sexual innuendo than most of today's stars can muster. I'm no prude, some of my favorite flicks my grandparents would probably have a heart attack if they were alive to view, but it was curiously refreshing to enjoy a \"wholesome\" sexual comedy. Capra's film is truly a movie for the ages."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night is a film from 1934 directed by Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Arsenic and Old Lace) and written by Robert Riskin (Mr. Deeds, You Can't Take it With You, Meet John Doe) who adapted it from Samuel Hopkin Adam's (The Harvey Girls, The Gorgeous Hussy, Week Ends Only) short story. It stars Clark Gable (Gone With the Wind, The Misfits, Mutiny on the Bounty) and Claudette Colbert (Since You Went Away, The Palm Beach Story, Drums Along the Mohawk).\n\nIt Happened One Night is about a rich spoiled girl who runs away from all of the wealth and meets an out of work newspaper writer and they hitchhike to New York City together and on the way there, they just might find love.\n\nThis film was one of the pioneers of the screwball comedy genre. So when the Robert Riskin was writing this script, I'm sure he had no idea of the impact this would have on the world. Ever since this film, the formula has been copied over and over again. Even now, this has the classic rom-com formula.\n\nThe acting in this movie is great. The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is impeccable. Sure Gable's character Peter might be a little of his time (with all the talk of beating Colbert's character Ellie). They still work very well together. Colbert also gives a good performance as the rich girl who just wants to get away from it all. They both won Oscars for their performances.\n\nWhile a good movie, we have all seen this before: two people with conflicting personalities don't like each other in the start, but of course fall in love in the end. But then I remind myself that this is the first movie to do that. In conclusion this is a very funny movie that has a lot of heart."

Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of a rich Wal-Street man who secretly got married to King Wesltey (Jameson Thomas), but her father won't even hear about it. Sick of being told what she has to do, she escapes from her father and tries to get from Miami to NY to see her beau. On the road, she finds a wise-crack reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who agrees to help her, but in return he wants her story, exclusive.\n\nThat's the main plot, and it happens lots and lots of things that happen while the story develops. Let's just say that this movie set the fashion for men to not wear undershirt t-shirts, it taught people how to dunk a donut and how to hitchhike.\n\nClark Gable did a wonderful job, who would have thought that \"The King\" who is known for playing roles of ladies men and serious roles, now plays a comic role. He did wonderfully, he surely deserved the Oscar and you can tell that he had a great time doing this movie. Claudette Colbert was excellent too, great performance as the spoiled girl who always gets her way.\n\nAlso the movie is great b/c even though it had a limited budget and only 4 weeks to be done, this movie wasn't entirely filmed in a studio, you get to see nice landscapes and great photography, and i love the dialogue between the characters, lots of memorable quotes on this movie that people still use nowadays.\n\nThis is probably the best comedy of the 30's, and the pioneer in the so called comedy genre \"screwball\". I give it a 10/10, and to encourage people to watch it, let's just say that Friz Freleng created the famous Bugs Bunny after watching this movie. When you watch it, you'll know why."

There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their \"breakfast\" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find. As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence, his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny. This is a must-see for every one who loves old movies, and entertaining for all."

She meets up with Gable's character, Peter Warren, on a bus set to go to New York City. That's where the fun begins! The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is there.

Especially I liked very much the interpretation of Clark Gable who played as Peter Warne and I believe that he was simply outstanding in his role. I also liked the interpretation of the beautiful Claudette Colbert who played as Ellie Andrews. One more interpretation that it had to be mentioned is Walter Connolly's who played as the father of Ellie Andrews, Mr. Andrews. I also want to mention that this movie is a really enjoyable movie because it has a good plot which is combined very well with the interpretations of the cast and of course the direction which is made by Frank Capra.\n\nFinally I believe that \"It Happened One Night\" is a very good movie to watch and I strongly recommend it. This movie wants to show us how things change in life when some events happen and we have to be prepared for everything from the worst to the best."

Silent films were dead, 'talkies' were here to stay -- it allowed us the chance to laugh and sing along with the actors in the film. What could have been better in such dismal times?\n\nLooking at it that way, one can see why \"It Happened...\" was showered with adoration. But it just doesn't resonate today...there have been additional phase changes in the interim.\n\nIn terms of content, this is watchable only for Gable's performance, who towers over everyone else here. Simultaneously, he smirks for the audience in recognition of his own power. The plot pinballs off of the newspaper headlines, which keeps the mood light.\n\nHowever, in form, this offers nothing as a *cinematic* experience. There's no change of perspective from our day to day world...it could all be played out on a stage. Heck, you could turn your back to the viewing screen and follow what's going on from the audio content -- like a period radio show.\n\nIt's for this astounding lack of cinematic qualities that I must rank it so low. If you want a far superior and more effective example of visual storytelling, go with Hitchcock's \"The 39 Steps\"."

It didn't disappoint. It was like an archaeological look back in time to the original \"ROM-COM\" master movie, and it still holds up after all these years. Think about it...it was made over 3/4 of a century ago. To put it in another perspective, if you went back an additional 76 years from when this was made, it would be Pre-Civil War! It's important to remember that this was made in the height of the Great Depression, and note the strict moral code of the time, fully incorporated into the movie. However the total sexual tension was fully exploited in the movie, and still applies today. I also appreciated the technique in the final scene, of letting the audience imagine what's happening, when the \"walls of Jerico\" finally go tumbling down!\n\nCapra's directing and choice of shots and perspectives was amazing too! It really set the standard for all these genre of movies that have since followed. Very watchable, Very entertaining.\n\nOne final thought....as I watched Gable in this movie, his facial expressions and mannerisms totally made me think of Johnny Depp, who I now realize is the modern day Gable!\n\nWatch this movie and don't think too much...just let yourself be entertained."

Those actions would not work in film today, as we all know, certainly not in a comedy genre. However, it explains why Colbert's character, not a ditsy dope, would choose to run away from her privileged existence and face certain retribution -- financial and emotional -- making her all the more sympathetic as she gamely takes on Clark Gable in a battle of wits and manners. Likewise Gable, in the opening scenes, suffers in somewhat tragic circumstances, and his character struggles to hide his dejection and sense of failure under a dapper appearance and good grooming. Without this foundation, the situation is silly and contrived, because these two attractive, intelligent, witty persons would have no reason to react as they do, suffering rebukes and slights from one another, mostly \"deserved\", or at least rationally handed out, according to their limited knowledge of each other. A variation on the theme of 'Pride & Prejudice'!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen a few Frank Capra movies in my day, and I must say that this is my favorite of his films. Every modern romantic comedy, from \"The Graduate\" to \"When Harry Met Sally\" to \"Sleepless in Seattle\", owes a serious debt to the film that all but spawned the genre, \"It Happened One Night\".\n\nIt can be argued that film was lucky to even get off the ground. This film was produced at several different locations on a shoestring budget (with Claudette Colbert receiving a large chunk of that budget as pay), yet the chemistry between Colbert and Clark Gable was among the best ever caught on film. Also, Capra's efficient directing style, which became a necessity for this project, paid off in spades.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" caused a sensation from the word \"go\". T-shirt sales dropped because Clark Gable didn't wear one in the film. The phrase \"Walls of Jericho\" became a part of the American lexicon. It showed that women could indeed get just about anything they wanted, just by showing a little leg. And it has been acknowledged in several circles that \"It Happened One Night\" was the inspiration behind the creation of one of most-loved cartoon characters ever, Bugs Bunny.\n\nIt would be hard to pick just one reason to watch this film, but if I had to choose, it would be the scene in which Peter (Gable) and Ellie (Colbert) pretend to be a married blue-collar couple when private detectives hired by Ellie's father encounter them at a motor lodge. This scene alone demonstrates Gable's and Colbert's chemistry with each other (I know I've mentioned it before. Trust me -- It's that good!).\n\nThe first film to win Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay, \"It Happened One Night\" is a heartwarming, charming, hilarious movie that I would recommend for any couple (young or old) to see. This is the first truly great romantic comedy, which still holds up pretty well (Okay, so taking the bus isn't very romantic anymore).\n\nBy the way, I showed selected scenes of this film to my son when he was 16, and he liked what he saw. If that isn't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is!"

        "review_title": "Utterly charming and immensely influential !!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The genre of 'Romantic comedy' is generally scoffed at and looked down upon by critics and many viewers nowadays. This is mainly because of the mechanical way in which a huge number of them have been produced over the years and unfortunately, there is a distinct lack of creativity and artistic input apparent in most of them. Although the prejudice that some people have against the films categorised in this genre is justified due to recent releases, but one has to acknowledge the fact that a number of great and incredibly influential films also are romantic comedies. The film that is widely regarded as the one that pretty much single-handedly started it all, is Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night'. It was the first Screwball Comedy and it is very easy to see the way it influenced subsequent films.\n\n'It Happened One Night' is a film set in the Depression Era. It hints at the struggles that ordinary American people faced at the time. However, the film never really tackles it head on and in a way must have offered the viewers of the time a nice escape from reality and an escape from the horrors of their financial problems. The film explores the class distinctions of society. We get to see two individuals belonging to different classes and financial backgrounds get together and go on a journey. We see the character of Peter showcase his disdain and prejudice against the haves of the society. We also see how Ellie being a rich sheltered socialite finds it difficult to completely fit in with Peter and his ways initially. The gender politics in the film is an interesting element. On one hand, there certainly are aspects of it like Ellie needing Peter's help for everything, or some of Peter's aggressive remarks towards Ellie that can make the film look a bit dated, but from another angle it is a bit progressive too. We see at the beginning that Ellie is being almost suffocated and imprisoned by her father. Capra gives us a good understanding of how oppressed she clearly feels and the whole affair with King Westley is nothing but an attempt to break away from the shackles.\n\nThe film is very charming and funny. Clarke Gable puts on an utterly charismatic performance. He exudes charm and charisma and Claudette Colbert holds her own brilliantly. The chemistry and the wit involved in the scenes between them to a great extent makes the film. Robert Riskin's script is rich with witty, snappy and sharp dialogue. There are singular examples of brilliant scenes that stick out over the others which are extremely funny even today like the piggyback scene, the hitchhiking scene, etc. to name a few. The film pretty much set the template for the trope of the two leads hating each other at the beginning and then slowly developing feelings for each other. We see this transition take place slowly and gradually. There are three major scenes involving just the two of them having a conversation before going off to sleep which can be used to notice the changes and developments that take place in the way they perceive each other over the course of their journey.\n\nThis was made when the silent films were starting to go out of fashion, and one can see how much the camera work is reminiscent of the silent films of the era. The camera is not very mobile and the movement of the camera is kept to a minimum. However there is one specific moment of bravura camera movement in the scene where the camera tracks sideways from left to right to follow Ellie as she heads to the cottage shower while being noticed by the working class people in the locality. Another very important aspect of Capra's direction is his lack of the use of music. Films of the later 30s and early 40s were famous for being a bit drowned in music. But Capra uses the music in a very discreet way. Some of the most important scenes in terms of character development is accompanied by nothing but the sound of crickets chirping in the background.\n\nBut I couldn't say the film blew me away and I'm sure that's because of the fact that I was already expecting a lot of the twists and story elements that were going to transpire as they have been repeated to death over the years in other films. The last 20 minutes of the film I felt were a bit flat. Another example of a film which left me a bit underwhelmed because of the tropes being used and reused in later films was 'Double Indemnity'. I know maybe this criticism is a bit unfair, but I generally tend to judge a film solely based on whether it worked for me or not irrespective of when it was released and I'm afraid 'It Happened One Night' doesn't completely hold up.\n\nHaving said that it is still a charming, funny film with charismatic performances. There are a number of scenes of genuine comedy littered throughout the film. But the last 20 minutes left me a bit underwhelmed."

If you want to chill and enjoy an inspiring story, this is the right movie for you!

Very interesting interactions between the 2 main characters. For me it's a 10 for all it entails."

        "review_detailed_main": "I enjoy romance movies where two people initially have no interest in one another, but then grow fonder of each other through their adventures together - until they realize life simply won't be the same without the other. I find it more realistic.\n\nEllie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of wealthy businessman Alexander Andrews, and is married to King Westley (Jameson Thomas). When Alexander suggests her marriage to be annulled - because he believes Westley to be only after her money - Ellie runs away from her father to reunite with Westley in New York.\n\nOn the bus, she meets reporter Peter Warne. As they get acquainted - but by no means fond of each other! - Peter agrees to help her on the condition she gives him an exclusive story. Reluctant at first, she agrees, and this is the start of their adventure together! Her bag with all her money was stolen at the start of her journey, and to help her (and protect her for his own personal gain), Peter poses as her husband.\n\nClark Gable is just fabulous as Peter, and there are many hilarious moments as they have to overcome the many obstacles to get to New York! 'It happened one night' is wonderfully entertaining!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen the movie many times. I was puzzled that sometimes I liked it a lot, and other times I wondered what the fuss was about. I finally figured it out: the movie is a sweet, delightful, amusing romance and should be appreciated for that. It is not really a raucous comedy. I just saw it again tonight. I noticed that there was not a good laugh, hardly a chuckle, for the first hour! (Though the \"Yeah? Oh, Yeah!\" scene was nice, as was his comments about writing books on undressing, dunking, etc.) In fact the only good laughs in the movie are on four occasions, all near the end: **** minor spoilers**** (1) when they pretend to be bickering marrieds to throw off the detectives, at the motel; (2) the great hitchhiking scene (Gable has most of the lines, but Colbert's few reactions and smiles help the scene enormously); (3) when he is driving back to the motel with the money, and her entourage races past him coming from the opposite direction; and (4) when he meets/gets paid by her father.\n\nThe movie gets better and better as a wry, tender, erotic, romantic drama once we get past the first hour.\n\nTwo small points of logic that break the spell some: (1) nice scene, but it was silly to give the boy practically all their money (a $10 bill, quite a large amount in 1934) because they wouldn't take the trouble to get change for the bill; and (2) it was reckless/stupid of Gable to leave her despondent, asleep and unaware of his plans as he leaves for an extended period to raise some cash and then return. ****end of minor spoilers****\n\nAnother small point: I wouldn't call it a screwball comedy. For practically the whole movie Gable was direct and honest with her (and she with him) as to their trip together.\n\n9 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love director Frank Capra's work, but hadn't seen this until now. I'm glad I did.\n\nHere's my breakdown:\n\nSTORY: In retrospect, this story isn't all that unusual, but there's enough good story to give it a nice balance: > Conflicting personalities > Suspense and levity > Romance built on fidelity > A predictable end*\n\n*My only complaint with the story\n\nACTING: Normally, I'm not a fan of stars because most become obese with pride and self-obsession. Gable was (is) an example of that, but his ability to be so natural on screen is compelling. I would compare him and Cary Grant, but Grant not only had a single gear, he was so arrogant and demeaning. Yes, Gable doesn't treat women much better, but his natural style is far more genuine than Grant's pretense.\n\nColbert did a great job, and showed why women normally out-perform men in acting. The flexibility and range are much wider, and Colbert exercises these traits well here. Comparing her to Jean Arthur in another Capra film \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), Arthur has a much softer and wider range.\n\nBut both deliver perfectly on their respective roles.\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Moderate to high value (for those who love classics)\n\nTEMPO: Good pace\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: For the era, I was impressed (even with the sets)\n\nMUSIC / SOUND: Limited, which was just about right\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: Director: There's a hand full of brilliant directors: Capra, Hitchcock, Wyler, Wilder ... and a few contemporary ones. But Capra will always be among the \"giants\" of film directing.\n\nWriters: Riskin has written some good story, e.g. \"Lady for a Day \" (1933) and this. No doubt there are others, but I thought \"Lost Horizon\" (1937) was awful. Frankly, I dislike Gary Cooper's \"acting,\" so I've not see some of Riskin's other work for that reason.\n\nIs it a good film? Yes\n\nShould you watch this once? Yes\n\nRating: 7.5."

As they travel together, they fall in love.\n\nThe movie has a beautiful plot but is lost in poorly constructed dialogues and in the continuity of the scenes.

Tales of street life disappeared, movies dropped the sly lines of innuendo, and even the monster movies weren't so monstery anymore. It was a great time for romantic comedies where everything worked out in the end. While most of them were forgettable, \"It Happened One Night\" is memorable for many reasons.\n\nAs much as being a story about a man and woman falling in love despite themselves and despite the efforts of family and business to intervene on both sides, the movie is a record of the time - a time of traveling by bus through the night, a time of hitchhiking with pleasure and with confidence, and a time when newspaper deadlines still mattered, at least to the newspapers.\n\nHundreds of reviews mention that this movie swept the top five Oscar categories, but that's never the most reliable gauge of a movie's worth. Only seeing it can really show you what's to like about a movie - the characters, the performances, the lasting mood of its moments of fun and moments of melancholy.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" doesn't waste space. Each scene contributes something to the film's character. The irreverent sarcasm between the leads constantly builds the tongue in cheek tone. The moderately-paced plot keeps interest without skipping too fast across the light parts of the story. The unlikable nature of the leads dissolves as we see enough their characters to appreciate the hidden chemistry between them."

It Happened One Night (1934) won the glut of Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress. At the time of Barry Norman's 100 Best Films of the Century being published, only one other title, The Silence of the Lambs, had hit those five markers. Has another film since then?\n\nFive Oscars. Very good show indeed. If you watch this road movie about an odd couple running away from discovery, I expect, what will strike you is how indebted so, so many other movies are to this Capra film. Hollywood really does endlessly recycle the best ideas, but sadly these days the copying and pasting is just a little too obvious and cynical, right? Thank goodness the latest talk is of superhero fatigue.\n\nClaudette Colbert is the runaway rich miss being frantically sought by her worried father. Clark Gable is the hard-up journalist who spots an opportunity to make a story, and keeps her company when they meet on a bus. US public transport being what it is, it isn't long before they're forced to hitch their way. One hitch leads to another.\n\nNot only is the film a pre-echo of so many other movies - the one that sprung to mind most immediately for me was Roman Holiday, and Overboard for that matter - but one can't help thinking of other, better films by the personnel. Cable in Gone With The Wind. Colbert in Since You Went Away, and Capra's Christmas favourite, It's A Wonderful Life. And I must part company with Barry Norman on one point, there is nothing especially sexy about the bit-of-leg scene. The movie belongs to the era of the Hays Code (1934-1968) and its coy censoriousness. Just take a look what was going on in 1933, my dears.\n\nMassivelu influential comedy about a man and a woman bumping along together as best they can, but I'd say it has been well and truly superseded."

Detracting from my hatred a bit, however, is some very nice cinematography as well as some interesting and neat ways of incorporating the Great Depression setting without detracting from the main story. Some of the jokes landed quite nicely although most of them were either too dated or portrayed with too much hammy acting to get a laugh or even a chuckle. I'd give it a 4.5/10 as well as a sticker of essential American Cinema since I now know the origin of about a dozen running gags in current film and television."

Claudette Colbert, who is really beautiful, plays a controlled rich man's daughter who, after a bitter dispute, dives (very smooth and skillfully) off their rich yatcht, hops on a bus, and goes from Miami to New York to be with her fianc\u00e9 that her super controlling dad is trying to stop her from marrying. Claudette is a grown woman, her fianc\u00e9 is not a criminal or anything, he's just someone her dad just personally dislikes. So I am on Claudette's side and I feel that her dad was controlling to an unecceptable level, he was sending out detectives after her, that's just not OK considering the circumstances. Getting away from her dad's home was not illegal since she was a grown woman.\n\nClaudette meets Clark on the bus through interesting and humorous circumstances. I loved all the wit and repitour between the two. Clark's hilarious responses to the uptight bus driver saying \"oh yeah?\". Clark finding out the truth about Claudette and him blackmailing her to both help get her to her fianc\u00e9 and to get his newspaper editor job back, cause he'll have a good story on her, and many other great and funny situations and dialogue between the two of them. The moment in the cabin when Claudette's dad's detectives were looking for her, and she and Clark put on a last minute act to fool them,them yelling at each other and then Clark telling the detectives \"too bad you're not looking for a plumber's daughter!\"(Claudette earlier said \" I'd trade places with a plumber's daughter any day\"). The character of Shipley, I completely understood Claudette's reaction, Shipley was annoying. And then Clark lying to Shiply about being a gangster to scare him away, since he threatened to butt in front of Clark to grab half the $10,000 reward of returning her to her dad. The way Shiply ran off was the first funny thing he did. Then Clark and Claudette ditch the bus while saying \"when Shiply stops running, he will start thinking\". I liked the night time scene next where they set up camp outside, and Claudette lying back in the hay with the moonlight shining on her face, a nice old fashioned feel it gave. I also enjoyed the hitch hiking talk between them. Clark showing her all the different thumb signals, then him not being able to get any stoppers. Then Claudette pulling her dress to her knee and the first car seeing her stops. Claudette then tells Clark \"goes to show, the leg's mightier than the thumb. Clark: \" why didn't you take off all your clothes? We coulda stopped 40 cars\". Claudette: \"I'll remember that the next time we need 40 cars\". Hilarious. I'm not sure if this film was pre or post code but there were a couple sort of pre code references. Clark, while pretending to sleep, laying his hand facing up on the seat next to him when he sees Claudette coming back to sit there, Clark demonstrating to Claudette in what order he undresses as he's doing so in front of her, and his talk about \"the walls of Jerihco\". None of those things were anything as risky as what you have today, but there are a lot of pre code films that were considered risky by 1930s standards and not so risky today. Anyway, except for Claudette's dad's actions being too far, this film was great. And I loved the bus scene where everybody is singing to \" Man on flying trapeze\", that scene really reminded me of this film being an older, more simple time."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is unfortunate that I had to this hilarious comedy first, because all the movies after it pale in comparison. This movie confirmed my love for spunky Clark Gable and introduced me to the lovely, elegant and talented Claudette Colbert. It Happened One Night is a very simple story and that's what I loved about it. Colbert plays a rich, snooty heiress that runs away from her Father after he disagreed with her new marriage to a playboy. Although she is just doing it to spite him, she is determined to go to New York and marry him. He sends out private investigators all around the country in hopes in finding her. Since she is rich, she uses unlikely transport: a night bus! And there she finds Clark Gable. Hilarity and romance ensues.\n\nThere are many memorable scenes in this and every time I watch it, it still cracks me up. There is nothing better than to watch Gable teach Colbert how to hitch-hike - boy does she show him! Great performances, great direction - just runs smoothly so you can enjoy this fantastic movie.\n\nIt Happened One Night will make your needs melt for Clark Gable, make you laugh out loud and make you realize how much this sort of comedy is lacking in today's cinema."

The first film to win all four major Oscars (Best Picture; Actor; Actress; Director) when the Oscars still counted for something, IHON is the touching, funny story of a rich girl Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) who meets reporter Peter Warne (a delightfully charming Clark Gable) on her wayward way to New York. Along the way, the mismatched couple pretend to be married, wade through streams and sleep in haystacks, hitch-hike and, of course, fall in love.\n\nThe script is delightful, the direction marvellous, the acting superb. Clark Gable is on top form here, and I dare any female viewer to watch this movie and not be completely charmed by him. ;) He's debonair while being a bit gruff around the edges, tough but sweet, kickass but caring. Anyone doubting Clark Gable's legendary charm and appeal (I did, before I saw this) should only have to watch this movie to discover it for themselves.\n\nMy favourite bit would have to be, of course, the running theme of the Walls of Jericho. Watch to find out for yourself... certainly the best extended metaphor I've ever seen in a movie! 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "As part of my acquaintance with the Academy Award winners, I managed to watch an interesting, but rather predictable film \"It Happened one Night\" in 1934. The film collected five awards at once, including the Best film and the Best male and female roles. An illustrative aspect, however, after watching it, I was not delighted either with the performance of the main actors or with the picture itself. I wouldn't call the movie bad, but I didn't really like it.\n\nThe picture will demonstrate a fairly formulaic plot for our time, where a rich girl runs away from piled-up problems and gets acquainted with a little lucky journalist who is in search of really worthwhile material, which will certainly help to improve the position of a man. The main characters are played by Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. Both are good in their roles, convincing, but it still seems to me that the couple got their Oscars only because there were no alternatives. I would not call their game outstanding.\n\nHistory is another matter. Even if it sometimes looks ridiculous and even affected, it cannot be taken away from the fact that it was this picture that gave rise to a whole direction of films, which is now commonly called roadmuvi. \"It happened one night\" in a peculiar way plays out various interesting moments that happen to the characters during their journey. The audience will then be able to see the same elements in many similar paintings, and an attentive moviegoer will surely understand that they were inspired by this Oscar-winning picture.\n\nDespite my reserved attitude to this work, I in no way detract from its merits to world cinema, on the contrary, I see in the film a lot of things that changed the aesthetics of cinema and inspired new paintings by other authors who successfully borrowed the concept of this film or its elements. The film came out average, not claiming to be a masterpiece, but it should not be forgotten that I, as a viewer of the 21st century, had already seen a lot of paintings before I got to this work. And that's why the film seemed like a kind of gray horse, a picture that you would hardly want to review again.\n\n5 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It Happened One Night\" may be a movie for its times, but its humor, its tenderness, its \"love for the little guy\" and its interesting detail of what life on the road was like in the 1930's, makes this movie so watchable 71 years later. Not too many flicks can withstand the test of time, but I suppose the \"battle of the sexes\" genre that permeates \"It Happened One Night\" and the honest dialog that fills the script can still resonate with us (it does me)so many years later. It was made before Hollywood explored the dark side of life and so \"It Happened One Night\" does not tell you much about the grimmer aspects of the 1930's. It only briefly alludes to the joblessness and hunger that many people experienced (a woman faints on the bus, and there's a train full of hobos), and does not touch race relations during those years whatsoever. Instead, in no maudlin way, it seems to try to show that there is decency in everyone, from a hustling reporter looking for a scoop, to a rich heiress trying to find happiness in her own right. That they should find love in each other, despite their differences, is what makes the movie so hopeful. If that's too naive for some to stomach, the sophisticated humor in such scenes as the Walls Of Jericho and the donut dunking lesson, help ground the movie in some reality.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" got the Oscar for Best Picture in 1934, and as far as I'm concerned, would deserve it again today. It is delightful."

Walter Connolly again plays a blustering part as Colbert's father.\n\n'It Happened One Night' gained Oscars and was a big money-maker for Columbia, and well-deserved."

Colbert is delightfully coquettish as the naive Ellie. The story is filled with humor, well done sentiment, quotable dialog and it moves along at a brisk pace. Capra's direction is understated and polished. It all adds up to a classic romantic comedy.\n\nHowever, the film has a very dated and irksome view of gender politics. I lost count the number of times Peter threatens to hit Ellie (i.e. domestic violence) and he does spank her without her consent. It is part and parcel of the screwball comedy that a romantic relationship is a coded fight for dominance. So while say the hitchhiking scene is funny there's a nasty undertone of gendered struggle. This aspect renders the film dated in the worst way. I cringed a lot more this time I watched it.\n\nThis is a good product of the 1930's. It has all the strengths of Capra. But also the time period's and Capra's weaknesses."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of Capra's earliest and it's amusing too. Capra, from an immigrant Sicilian family, shows his concern for class differences and promotes a benificent view of the poor. There's nothing explosively funny about the script, no memorable tag lines, but rather comic or ironic situations follow quickly upon the heels of one another. There are some laughable exchanges though, as the one between Ward Bond as a bus driver and drunken passenger Clark Gable. Bond: \"Say, I ought to sock you in the nose.\"\n\nGable: \"I always keep my nose out there where people can take a sock at it.\"\n\nBond: \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\nGable: \"That's an intelligent reply. Why didn't I think of it?\"\n\nBond: \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\nGable: \"If you keep that up we're never going to get anywhere.\"\n\nBond: \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\nGable {exhausted}: \"Ya GOT me -- YEAH!\"\n\nColbert is a spoiled brat, as we are told several times, although Capra never deprives her of our sympathy. (She's not spoiled, she argues, because spoiled people are used to getting their own way and she's been told what to do all her life.) Gable is a blustering newspaperman who begins their relationship with the intention of exploiting her but falls for her instead. (Cf., \"Roman Holiday\".)\n\nHe teaches her things. (1) How to dunk a donut. (2) How to hitch hike. (3) How a man undresses.\n\nThese lessons must have been amusing to an audience in 1935, many of whom might have been happy to have a donut to dunk. The undressing scene -- incomplete before Colbert retreats behind \"the walls of Jericho\" -- started a fad involving the non-wearing of undershirts by men.\n\nIt's still kind of interesting, partly because we rather like the performers, but it's badly dated. Nobody dunks donuts anymore. Nobody hitch hikes either. Why not? Because instead of driving Model A Fords at 30 miles an hour down country roads everyone now speeds along in Ford Mustangs on Interstate Highways at 80. And hitching is now largely illegal.\n\nBesides, all hitch hikers are serial murderers now. (Except north of the border, where hitchers flourish along the TransCanada Highway. Canada has no serial murders, only postmen and moose hunters.)\n\nBut this is a movie with some of Capra's populism on display. I direct your attention to the scene aboard the second bus. The scene is crowded with ordinary humanity of diverse but modest backgrounds. (Rich people in this movie fly.) An improvised band is playing in the back of the bus and a passenger requests, \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze.\" The tiny band goes through the first verse, including the bridge. A sailor pipes up and says, \"I know the second one, let me handle it.\" And the third verse is sung by a short dark guy up front. Then everyone piles into the bus's central walkway and dances around -- sailors, fat guys with bushy beards, little scholarly looking people, all smiling and singing. It's a startlingly unexpected delight, a spontaneous community engaged in a rite of intensification, the equal of any of John Ford's dances. Even the bus driver, behind his curtain, is drawn into the song. And the moments when the sailor if fluttering his hands and swings clumsily from an overhead bar are unforgettable. A thoroughly happy scene, a capricious but Capraesque caprice.\n\nGable is almost always likable and unpretentious. Colbert can be irritating but she's okay here. You won't laugh during this film but you'll probably smile a lot. Well worth going with."

Claudette Colbert has often stated that it is the worst movie that is recorded.\n\nFrom so much dissatisfaction and anxiety gave birth to one of the best comedies of all time. At least I think so.\n\nIn addition to the set design, sound and atmosphere, which are excellent by the way, Capra is managed with two different human character and an average storyline to create a masterpiece. Modern story about falling in love with a slight but pronounced sexual segment, socio-economic differences and excellent verbal duels was hit. ting is a segment that is the film gave the necessary strength.\n\nThe story is a human and humorous and not even a single moment is not superficial. Disgruntled actors have made one of the best chemistry in the history of cinema. The motif of the opposition, and sending each other two different, intelligent, good-looking men used a million times, but the best effect is achieved in this film. Colbert creates vibrant Ellie, naive, inspiring and inspired by the desire for the ultimate freedom, while Gable is brilliant in the role of journalists, symbols of freedom in American pop culture treasure ridden most acceptable of marriage - alcohol.\n\nThis movie is still overwhelmed by its freshness and grandeur, and each modern replica acts pale and superficial. \"IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT\" is a true classic in the true sense of the word and the jewel of the genre, which day by day slowly disappearing."

The simple plot of a spoiled runaway girl who befriends and eventually falls for a smart mouth reporter while ironically riding on a bus trip to meet the man whom she thinks she loves is pure genius. The old clich\u00e9 is very apt over here and it can truly be said that they don't make em like they used to.

The two don't get along but, figuring out who she is, and knowing that her father will have every route into New York covered with private detectives, he offers to help her get to a husband. In exchange he wants an exclusive on her story. The two tag along together, getting through some interesting adventures. Over time they even get to like each other...\n\nA gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm, and hilariously funny at times, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward, keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.\n\nThe great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles. The chemistry between them is great and their delivery is spot-on.\n\nBoth Gable and Colbert received Oscars for their performances, as did Capra for Best Director. The movie was the well-deserved 1935 Best Picture Oscar winner.\n\nThough not Frank Capra's first movie, not by any means, this was the movie that put him on the map and kick-started a run of creativity that would see him make such classics as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, You Can't Take It With You, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Arsenic and Old Lace and, of course, It's a Wonderful Life."

        "review_detailed_main": "and that night was 8th January 1976, which was the first time I saw this All Time Great. Although I've seen it well over 10 times since it never fails to charm, captivate, amuse, entertain and defragment me, they being the opposite effects most modern movies have on me. Frank Capra made some great films, but imho he didn't better this simple little screwball comedy with its Love (Ultimately) Triumphant message.\n\nGrouchy newspaper man Gable bumps into coquettish runaway heiress Colbert on a bus trying to get to New York to marry an ugly gold digger to spite her father. To get the story he helps her but they gradually fall in love of course - this is the logical how and why of it, with the central witty and natural performances from Gable and Colbert as sparkling as the lustrous photography. As a by-product True Love between the classes was also shown to be possible, although of course in this case neither class had Breeding. There are some delightful characters to savour along the way \u0096 the tongue-tied Ward Bond, the garrulous Roscoe Karns, the operatic Alan Hale, and the blustery Walter Connelly. Favourite bits: dunking doughnuts; piggybacking; hitch-hiking; the Walls of Jericho making it alright; frightening Shapely; the repartee on the bus(es); the clinch by the haystacks in the gleaming arc-moonlight \u0096 and so much more!\n\nTo me it's ascended into timelessness \u0096 it seems less dated than most films made from the '50's to the '80's - the only films that will temporarily look less dated than this are perhaps those made in any current last couple of years. And no matter how corny I always relate better to real people than to Imperial Stormtroopers or cgi cartoons. Thoroughly recommended - this is a brilliant beautiful film, absolutely inconsequential and one of my top 10 favourites."

Gable is perfectly charming as a fast-talking playboy and he and Colbert display terrific chemistry. They are helped by a fine supporting cast, particularly Connolly as Colbert's banker father. Among the highlights are Gable showing his mastery in the arts of dunking a donut, undressing for bed, and, most memorably, hitchhiking. Working with a witty script, Capra keeps things moving at a breezy pace, never slowing down to wallow in sentimentality or deliver a heavy-handed message, as in some of his later films. One of five best films of the 1930's."

        "review_detailed_main": "It isn't any wonder why \"It Happened One Night\" struck such a chord with movie-goers in the depression-hit USA of the 1930's. Frank Capra's sparkling romantic comedy is just about as uplifting as any movie can possibly be. Whatever it is that makes a star a star, Clark Gable had it in spades more than any other leading man before or since, & how could Claudette Colbert, (or any other woman?), not fall in love with him. Against her father's (Walter Connolly) wishes Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has married newspaper magnate King Westley (Jameson Thomas) & after an argument she jumps her rich fathers yacht into the sea & swims to shore. She is wearing a long white silk gown & not carrying a handbag. Next we see her at Miami bus station purchasing a ticket to New York to be with her husband, complete with a new outfit & handbag! Even allowing for a few plot absurdities this is a movie with a big heart & is very entertaining. On board the bus she meets Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who is a newspaper reporter. When the bus makes a meal stop at Jacksonville Ellie has her handbag stolen leaving her with just 4 dollars. Peter now gets wind of who she is, the runaway daughter heiress of a millionaire father & he senses a good story. After they get back on board the bus Ellie sits next to a rather comical man named Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), who is an incessant chatterbox who has a habit of saying \"believe you me\". After getting tired of him she tells him, \"Believe you me, you bore me to distraction\". On this night there is a heavy rainstorm outside & the bus is forced to make an overnight stop. Peter hires out a chalet at a campsite & he tells the owner that he & Ellie are a married couple. When she protests he points out to Ellie that after the theft of most of her money they cannot afford \"separate establishments\". He attaches a length of rope across the centre of their chalet & drapes a blanket over it as a room divider which he calls \"the walls of Jericho\". \"That I suppose makes everything quite alright\" she tells him. Peter Warne now admits to her that he is a reporter & has latched on to Ellie Andrews because he senses a good story. He knows her real husband King Westley very well & tells her, \"That guy is a phoney. If I were you I would take the next bus back to Miami\". What follows is a movie that is chock full of memorably entertaining scenes & I guarantee that if anyone is feeling a bit low this film will improve their mood. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "In movie-making, the best things happen through collaboration. It Happened One Night, easily the finest Best Picture Academy Award winner up until that point is what it is thanks to a perfect teaming of talents in its writer, actors and director. This exceptional group created a picture that is the essence of 1930s Hollywood \u2013 one of the most neglected and misunderstood periods in cinema history \u2013 and yet is universal enough in its appeal to be widely enjoyed today.\n\nLet's begin with the writer, one of the unsung geniuses of 1930s cinema, Robert Riskin. While everyone knows about the directors who couldn't handle sound or the silent stars who found themselves out of work, it's rarely remembered that screenwriters had a hard time adapting too. No-one seemed to know how to balance dialogue and action, and one of the weakest elements of many early talkies is the screenplay. It Happened One Night is one of the first really beautifully constructed screenplays of the era. Riskin's pacing of the budding romance is spot on, ensuring there is never a dull moment by smoothly easing us from romantic intimacy to comic absurdity. One of the most effective juxtapositions is when the coach passengers all join together to sing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" just before the coach crashes. The song draws into the warm feeling of community spirit, making the crash more of a jolt. Riskin's dialogue is abstract in that it is witty and almost poetic at times, but every sentiment is believable, and makes the characters larger than life.\n\nThe early 1930s had also seen a scramble to define a great screen performance. The Academy Award-winners for acting thus far had been a very mixed bag, with a tendency towards rewarding the most grandiose theatrical performances. While the previous year's Best Actor \u2013 Charles Laughton as Henry VIII \u2013 is admittedly the most watchable and absorbing slice of hamming I have ever seen, and totally deserving of the prize, it was not of a style that could become the norm if the talkies were to progress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were not spectacularly good actors, and there are many better performers who were never even Oscar nominated. But they deserved the awards here because It Happened One Night captures the fullness of their admittedly limited ranges \u2013 form Gable, suaveness and street-smartness, from Colbert haughtiness and sophistication, and from both a flair for comedy and down-to-earth realism. Most importantly they make their characters likable, something that the deepest or most versatile players still sometimes fail to achieve.\n\nAnd now we come to producer-director Frank Capra. Capra had a massive ego when it came to marketing his own brand, but on the screen he took a decidedly relaxed approach, using long takes and few camera movements. One of the best things a director can do to aid the actors is simply give them space to act in, not cluttering up the scene with a lot of bizarre angles or tracking shots. Capra often does something known as \"cutting down the line\", which means during a scene he switches to a closer or more distant shot without changing the angle. This technique is sometimes frowned upon, but it is effective because it steps up the intensity of a moment without changing the positioning of the performers in relation to the camera. Capra keeps his attention-grabbing whip-pans and close-ups to a functional minimum, using the former to draw us into a scene (like those horizontal wipes), and playing the latter like a trump card at moments of emotional intensity.\n\nWriter, cast and director \u2013 each was ideally suited to the material. This was the only way in which a picture this special and this enduring can have been made. The auteur theorists may not be able to accept this, but the Academy did. It Happened One Night landed the Oscar \"grand slam\" of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Credit where it's due."

Frank Capra undid that theory-and this surprise hit shows why. Despite 1934 norms (no profanity, nudity or bed-hopping--can you imagine?--and Colbert's makeup never fades even after sleeping all night in a haystack) the story is simple but entertaining: spoiled heiress rebels against strict father by running off to marry playboy (who looks older than her father, but that's neither here nor there) and in the process, falls in with cocky young newsman who protects her.\n\nNot many would have pictured Gable and Colbert as a team, but they're surprisingly good together despite the movie being shot, on a shoestring, in a few weeks.\n\nIt's one of Old Hollywood's best. See it if you haven't yet."

        "review_detailed_main": "Romantic comedy is one of the most fun of all movie genres; a great one is mixed with a nice balance of romance and humor that is very enjoyable for the actors and the audience. Today, these \"rom-coms\" are much more cynical and bitter; almost to a point of not being funny or romantic at all. They also so rigidly follow a formula that it becomes incredibly difficult to find any part of the story that is surprising, refreshing or even remotely entertaining.\n\nHere is a film that very well may be the first example of what is considered a romantic comedy. Often called the first screwball comedy, this is anything but for there are very few fast-talking dialog scenes and the on-screen couple don't get into too crazy of situations. Directed with down-to-earth sincerity by that great American director, Frank Capra, the story of a spoiled young woman taken from her high society settings and stuck with a wise-cracking, handsome man who takes her under his wing and sets her straight is as old as the hills. And yet, it works here effortlessly due mostly to the wonderful and realistic chemistry between the two lead actors.\n\nClark Gable and Claudette Colbert, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time, reportedly both disliked the script and only did it for money and steady work. Neither would have thought that an Oscar for each and huge acclaim was waiting for them on the other side. Each actor's personality complemented the other perfectly; Gable's smart-ass remarks and smug grins against Colbert's soft, delicate yet independent facial expressions. Another element here handled much better than today is the parental issue. For most parents in these movies, they are either blithering idiots with no mind for parenting or bull-whipping tyrants with no evident love for their children's welfare. Here, the father is a little hard but is certainly filled with love and only wants what is best for his daughter.\n\nStill, perhaps this film will live one forever because of the incredibly smart and funny script. Based on a short story, screenwriter Robert Riskin fleshed out the characters and threw in some really great one-liners revealing not only the conflict between the main characters, but also the features and mannerisms that would put them in future situations. Nearly every scene is wonderful to watch unfold. The great timing between Gable and Colbert adds to the snappy dialog and makes the watching all the more enjoyable.\n\nIt is amazing what has happened to practically every part of the great medium that is film a mere 80 years later. What was once great comedy and great romance together in the same story today turns into wild and illicit sex or stupid, dumbed down physical comedy and cheap laughs. Sometimes they have both; but here it comes down to well-written and acted characters along with two very likable actors letting their personas shine and the story do the talking. It really is true when they say they just don't make them like they used to."

The film starts off a bit slowly but keeps moving and picks up steam as it goes. Some have complained about sexism in the film and I suppose that is for the viewer to decide about. Is it sexism,all the trouble her dad and his men go through to locate the wayward daughter and keep her safe ? I saw it as a decent man helping out a decent, impulsive woman that was in a jam. He was trading her a safe-passage to her husband,for the rights to publish the story of the adventure. They both needed something from each other and tried to work it out in a respectful manner.

This movie probably had low aspirations when it was first released in 1934, but everything clicked so well that it's now considered to be the supreme example of screwball comedy, one of the best movies of the 30s, and one of the best movies of all time.\n\nClark Gable and the adorable Claudette Colbert could not have more chemistry together. Their sassy back and forth is a joy to watch. And though this movie came out in the first year of the enforced Production Code, their relationship is refreshingly sexy. Dig Clark Gable in his undershirt (gasp!). And check out Claudette Colbert's shapely gams when she uses them to hitch a ride in one of the movie's classic scenes.\n\nThough the film is light and frothy, the spectre of the Depression isn't totally absent. For example, in one brief scene, Gable pauses at a railroad crossing to watch a freight train go past, loaded with hobos presumably off to find work somewhere, anywhere they can. One wonders if this was even staged or if Capra happened to catch an authentic moment from a dark time in America's history.\n\nThe screwball comedy is not a genre that's managed to survive throughout the years, so all the more reason to enjoy this funny, breezy, sophisticated piece of cinema magic.\n\nGrade: A+"

        "review_detailed_main": "Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are the stars of Frank Capra's legendary romantic comedy, 'It Happened One Night'. Decades later, the film still feels fresh, has lost none of its charm and is a pleasure to watch.\n\nAfter the opening credits (accompanied by some appealing theme music), we are introduced to Claudette Colbert's character of Ellie Andrews. She has locked herself in her room on a boat which belongs to her over-bearing father. He is threatening to annul her very recent marriage to 'King' Westley because he disapproves of him. After an argument develops, she jumps ship and swims for the shore, with the intent of going straight to New York to meet up with her new husband. While taking a bus trip to reach her destination, she encounters Peter Warne (played by Clark Gable), a newspaper reporter who eventually recognises her after seeing a front page story of her as a runaway. After he threatens to turn her in unless she stays with him in order to give him headline news, she reluctantly makes the cross country trip with him. Things don't always go to plan, which allow some humorous scenes, and there is an attraction that develops between the two. The question then, is who will she end up with by the time the film ends?\n\nThis is a film which deserves its status. Not only is it a wonderful, feel-good movie, it is great in all aspects of cinema, and has hardly dated a bit. The films energy and performances from all the cast keep the film from feeling stale, even after more than 70 years. The script is cleverly written with some truly laugh-out-loud moments. What makes this film even more remarkable, is the fact that few people involved in it, with the exception of Frank Capra, had much faith in it. Even the stars of the film, particularly Claudette Colbert, were unenthusiastic to say the least. Thankfully though, the film turned out incredibly well.\n\n'It Happened One Night' also has a place in cinematic history for being the first film to win all 5 Oscars in the main categories, an achievement that was not equalled until 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest'. Some viewers today remark at how unlikely it would be for a romantic comedy these days to receive such an honour. That being said, it's not a film that is going to be forgotten any time soon, and it certainly should be seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a nice movie, no doubt. But you would be disappointed if you were to be an Indian viewer who had first seen its Indian remake Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahin (1991), which is a sensational mix of the up-and-down romantic drama, hilarious comedy, great acting (Aamir Khan - who outperforms Clarke Gable by a distance, and Anupam Kher), and a score that would have done Giorgio Moroder proud.\n\nUnfortunately, the remake can never make it to this list because it is not in English - it is in Hindi, India's native language. Still, one must ask if Italian/Spanish titles could be included in the list, then the list should truly be free of language restrictions.\n\nActually, as an afterthought, I should add that at least half of Slumdog Millionnaire is actually in Hindi. So maybe the real problem with the list, just like with the Oscars, might be that it expects somebody from the Western world to direct & produce the movie. Whether or not you disagree, I strongly recommend you watch Pushpak (another Indian movie, and importantly NO language problems with this one). This is in not a imdb-250 movie. After you have watched it, you would likely just ask whether imdb-100 or something even shorter."

Is very important to point out that the movie, because of its honesty, brings upon a few harsh sexist ideas as any romance from the 30's would. I think we as an audience should pay close attention to that as it reflects our modern culture even to these days therefore not to view it with contemporary disregard. The movie is exceptionally funny, emotional engaging and holds it until the very end the most thrilling convention a love story has: will they manage to be together?"

And believe me, this 1934 Oscar winner movie is the best of all these three movies.

        "review_detailed_main": "107: It Happened One Night (1934) - released 2/22/1934, viewed 8/2/08.\n\nAlcatraz becomes a prison. The first Flash Gordon comic strip is published. BIRTHS: Hank Aaron.\n\nKEVIN: What can be said about this seminal rom-com classic that hasn't already been said? This is one of only a couple of 1934 releases that we've seen previously. When we first rented it, we watched it twice before sending it back, which was extremely rare at the time. Even then, I wasn't exactly sure why it merited a second viewing. One of the many things I like about this movie is how it's one of those classic films that was never designed to be a classic. There was nothing particularly out of the ordinary about its production, and yet the planets aligned just right so that the end result swept the major awards at the Oscars for the first time ever. Even when you watch the movie, you're not likely to find anything unusual or innovative about the story and the characters, except that they are all top-notch. Both Gable and Colbert take their potentially bland roles and breathe beautiful life into them. Gable's struggling journalist Peter is kind of a jerk on paper, and not just because he's exploiting Ellie for a story. He seems to want to bring Ellie down a notch and give her a humbling lesson about common folk that she'll never forget. He insults Ellie and her upbringing in nearly every scene. He tells Ellie's father (played by the excellent Walter Connolly) that what Ellie needs is \"a guy that'd take a sock at her once a day, whether it's coming to her or not.\" But Gable's likability and charisma make Peter's undeniable love for Ellie (in the context of all that outward disgust) feel honest and not a contradiction. How is that even possible? Peter creates something of a monster in Ellie, who exceeds his bitter expectations when she metamorphoses from a spoiled, shut-in heiress to a spunky and resourceful heroine (re: the limb is mightier than the thumb). Colbert hits just the right note to make Ellie likable and even at times relatable, yet never losing the sense that this is an upper-crust kind of girl. Then there's the chemistry, which crackles every moment they share the screen. These two probably bad-mouth each other more than they are ostensibly nice to one another, but the script drops in all those subtle hints that these two are really growing attached throughout their journey. The episodic storyline is perfectly paced. I don't think there is one scene that runs too long or too short in the entire film, and every character and subplot is paid off by the end. Frank Capra made a lot of perfect movies, and this one was the first of those.\n\nDOUG: 1934 begins with Frank Capra becoming an A-list director while giving birth to the screwball comedy with It Happened One Night. Not bad, Frank. What's with that title, though? It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm not going to bother summarizing the plot, so I'll just get straight to the review: When I first watched it some years ago, I thought Peter was a little too mean. I don't think that anymore (any girl with $2 her pocket who indulges in bus vendor snacks is in need of an escort), though he probably couldn't get away with some of the things he says or does today. The hitchhiking scene is my favorite, and not for the reason you think; It's Claudette Colbert's shining moment. After taking so much abuse from Peter, she finally gets to upstage him and make him look stupid. I can't believe this hasn't been remade a hundred times over. There's The Sure Thing, which follows the model, of course, but I'm surprised we haven't seen Hollywood do a literal remake, especially in this age of celebutante heiresses splashed all over the media. (Not that I'd want them to, mind you. It's just\u0085odd.) Although it became a huge hit and a motion picture classic, it's easy to see that IHON was designed as a small film.\n\nLast film viewed: One Hour With You (1932). Last film chronologically: Design for Living (1933). Next film: Tarzan and His Mate (1934)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is the little engine that could. It was a smallish romantic comedy produced on a modest budget from a minor studio. It would be a film, despite starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, that would vanish as time progressed, right? Guess again! The movie happened to be the table-setter for a new kind of film, and it is a movie that resonates well with people, even to today's modern audience. Personally, I found much to enjoy. Despite my misgivings on the screwball genre, Capra gets it right. The situations are zany, fast, and witty. The performances are excellent, and Capra is on the top of his game following his usually formula in the world of comedy.\n\nThe making of the film could have been its own film. This picture was produced by Columbia, which was seen as a minor picture at the time. Frank Capra lacked two major stars to appear. He previously worked with Claudette Colbert, but their experience together was negative, and she vowed never to work with him again. I guess a salary that is doubled would change minds. Because of how the studio system worked in the 1930's, actors were \"owned\" by individual studios. In Clark Gable's case, he worked for MGM. Rumor has it that he was punished by the studio and allowed Columbia to borrow him. Gable was apprehensive about the project and even showed up on the first day of set very drunk.\n\nThe opening sequence sets the picture off with a bang. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is a wealthy socialite who secretly married this aviator, Wesley. Her father, believing what is best for her, annulled her marriage. In anger, she jumps off the boat and goes ashore. Her father, Alexander (Walter Connolly) sends a private detective agency to find her. Ellie manages to stay one step ahead when she purchases a bus ticket. She sits next to a cynical journalist, Peter Warne (Gable). Warne manages to annoy her and ends up blackmailing her in order to force her to travel with him. Despite her original feelings, they begin to fall in love. But Ellie has reason to believe that Peter may be more into her father's $10,000 reward than her?\n\nIt is well-known what an accidental pairing the teaming of Colbert and Gable was...but it worked in such a grand fashion. They both were fantastic as a whole and individually. Being such great actors, should we truly be surprised? The most famous scene in the movie is where Colbert shows off her leg to attract drivers. She was very hesitant at first, but she decided to do it anyway after she learned what Capra was going to do for Plan B. Gable really owned the role as the cynical reporter and he really elevated everything to another level in the film's end. Just watch and you shall see.\n\nIt Happened One Night is the first picture to win the grand slam at the Academy Awards. It took home Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress. Colbert actually thought she wasn't going to win, so she did not attend the ceremony. The studio's head, Harry Cohn had to send someone to \"drag her off the train\" for her vacation. The film revolutionized the screwball genre, and it is the best film from the genre in my own humble opinion. Capra allowed his film to succeed on a quick, zany screenplay and wonderful, breezy performances. People back in the day were enamored with Gable's shirtless figure. Soon after the film was released, the Hays Code would come in effect which would not allow this. Anyhow, a funny, enjoyable picture with Frank Capra at the top of his game.\n\nMy Grade: A-"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Frank Capra's \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress in 1993, and for that it was preserved in the National Film Registry. It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable.\n\nPeter Warren appears and quickly distinguishes himself from the other male characters in that he is not only intelligent, but he's a man of honor and dignity. Not only that, he's street smart and humble compared to Ellie's would be husband. Consider the well-played foil of how Peter is on a simple bus, in sharp contrast to the groom who arrives at his wedding in a plane of all things. It is on the bus where the majority of the character interaction takes place. The two seemingly opposite personalities are brought together by fate, another one of the trademarks of screwball comedy that became a principle of romantic comedy as a whole. Throughout the film, one hears dialogue in rather a series of quips almost, the comedic insults and quirks of the characters. You see this with many of them, but it is strongest with the two star crossed lovers.\n\nThat is one of the beauties of screwball comedy. This \"sex comedy without sex\" achieves its sexual tension without being lewd at all. Despite the lack of today's raunchy style, the dialogue is so rich, and the actors so talented with lines, you can feel the attraction building. Before it even reaches the d\u00e9nouement, you can hardly notice how much closer the characters have become due to its sublime subtlety. Romantically speaking, the hay scene is the high note, as we finally see the boiling romance between the characters that they previously denied or really had no intention of. But also, and perhaps for memorabilia and sentimental laughs really, would be the hitch-hiking scene. It's not just incredibly hilarious, but Ellie finally proves her worth to Peter who previously had cared for her almost as if she were a helpless damsel. It's brilliant characterization at work. The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character. In many shots of Ellie's father (Walter Colbert), we see the fine wine and other assorted alcohols. In sharp contrast, the first time we see Peter he's drinking out of a bottle in a telephone booth. The remarkable beauty of the film's artistic mise-en-scene though comes out in its night scenes, especially in the rain. The camera and lighting really illuminates the characters in those scenes. It makes them stand out amongst the others as if they weren't even there. As time goes on, night after night, the two literally and emotionally draw closer to one another.\n\n\" It Happened One Night\" is a masterpiece on many aspects. It is a classic that represents the birth of a genre and a picture of human emotion. Alas all that, it is a frozen moment in history, giving illusion to a time that has been forgotten by some. Taking all that into account, along with the majestic authenticity of the glorious black-and-white days, it truly stands the test of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"It Happened One Night\" is a classic love story yet its best feature is that it surprises you: it's not chock-full of clich\u00e9s (though not devoid of them either) and it has an enduring sense of humor that all generations can appreciate.\n\nThe film stars two classic screen actors in Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert playing Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews, one a recently fired journalist and the other a runaway heiress who meet on a bus to New York. For Peter, this scoop could save his career and for Ellie, well, she needs all the help she can get to make it to New York alive. The two develop an unlikely relationship exchanging humorous jabs as they bus, hitchhike and hijack their way and of course while neither will be the first to admit it, there's no hiding their feelings for each other from the audience.\n\nClassic films tend to rely on the prowess of their marquee actors and Gable and Colbert are terrific together. Both are humorous and play a wide range of emotions. Gable is one of those stars that has that intangible \"it\" factor that just makes him seem so incredibly important in every scene. There is a strong tension between them the entire film that is funny at times and romantically intriguing at others.\n\nThe writing, however, is what makes this a standout classic. The way Peter wiggles his and Ellie's way out of tight situation, namely those that would result in Ellie being found out, is genius. Robert Riskin does some of the best witty dialog and scenes. The best parts of the film are when Peter and Ellie are alone, either in their motel room or out in the forest. The tension between them is highest and it makes the dialog that much better. This is a film that you remember the scenes. Like a play they all carry their own weight and interest. What happens next is not as important as what is happening.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" only suffers from a clich\u00e9 ending. The humor shifts from wit to just laughing at the film in general because you know the inevitable will happen and anything that tries to stand in the way at that point is just --pointless. Anyone who loves classic situational and near-farcical comedy will love \"It Happened One Night\" and with good reason. It's enjoyable for all generations but it's very true to the era, definitely an escapist Depression-era film because it concerns itself with the wealthy and pokes fun at them. There's even a song, though it's incorporated in a more drama-focused way, no theatricality.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

It's easily one of the best movies that had been made.\n\nI have firstly watched it without any references just seeing it in IMDb top 250 and that Frank Capra has directed. I completed watching it once, twice and now thrice. It's a simple ride that will be at times too fast as the bus moving in the film and at times lousy as they eat their breakfast. It's not hurried and it's neither slow. This has the perfect pace and Frank Capra, the genius who has given wonderful gems knows how to keep the audience glued.\n\nThe time it was made that is 1934 could have been so exciting to have seen this and I discovered this movie only last year that is 2010 and yet I was very excited all through for the first time and even now. There are moments that have stood the test of time and this I believe will be appreciated simply for it's authenticity for a real life portrayal by characters.\n\nNow coming the movie, it's a tale of a runaway girl who wants to meet the one she loves and along this journey meets a man she falls for. The depiction of such simplicity is strengthened with such conversations that are straight into heart as we can relate to all of those. Like the conversation where our hero helps the heroine save from the detectives while she combs her hair, ah so apt it was. Refulgent this movie shall be for all the romantic comedies.\n\nI hugely thank frank Capra for presenting such a delightful film right in 1934.\n\nIt's 5/5 for the earliest romantic comedy that I am aware of and the one of the best I have seen thus far."

All of the worthy things happen to us unintentionally one way or the other and who knows maybe the person sitting on a bus next to you is destined for a longer ride.\n\n\"It happened one night\" is Frank Capra's Oscar-winning Best Picture of 1934 and it stars rough, tough but handsome enough Clark Gable and charming Claudette Colbert. The movie tells a story of a spoiled little girl of a rich father whose only purpose in life is to contradict him because he doesn't allow her to do what she wants, and she wants stupid things. But even stupid things can become the smartest decision you have ever made. She runs away from home to be with her \"safe\" person of interest and meets this fellow who is a complete opposite - he's rude and impolite, he speaks his mind about everything, he can't stand her kind of people but (and here's a mysterious part) he loves her anyway.\n\nNo matter how different or how incompatible two people can seem it is their feelings that have the real value. If they are able to co-exist and not kill each other, they care for each other and do not want to be anywhere else than right beside one another - that's it. It happened. And usually it happens so fast you wouldn't even notice it until you're full speed ahead in it.\n\nClark gives one of the best performances in his career whereas Claudette is absolutely gorgeous in her role; you just cannot take your eyes off of their pair. Frank has done an incredible job and starting with \"It happened one night\" his career took off like a rocket for the stardom where it stayed for a long time and for ever in my heart."

While it may not be the earliest \"romantic comedy,\" the movie did establish several industry \"firsts\": first to win the \"top 5\" Academy Awards including Best Picture (which has only happened two more times since then, in 1975 for \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and 1991 for \"The Silence of the Lambs\"); first to win the Oscar for Best Picture & also to be named best by the National Board of Review. And all this by a movie that neither of its leads wanted to be in, were the director's first (or even his third) choice, nor thought after completing it was any good or would be successful. But Gable and Colbert were dead wrong, and Capra was right. I am not a huge fan of all Frank Capra's films, some of which strike me as corny and too emotionally manipulative. But he sure nailed this one! I'd give it a 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night (1934), was a film of firsts. It is an example of early romantic comedy in film. It was the type of rom-com, that influenced many films that came after it. It took that genre and galvanized it, so it would become a staple genre for the next century. Also, this film capitalizes on a few other sub-genres. This film is an off-shoot of the sub-genre known as the \"buddy\" film, only in this case it is between a man and a woman, from two completely different backgrounds, coming together to help each other. They also capitalize on the classic sub-genre known as the \"chase\" film, where our two characters take us on a journey across the country, as they flee from the other characters, to reach their final goals.\n\nThe plot of the film revolves around a rich socialite, the daughter of rich businessman named Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), Ellen, who rebels against her father and marries a spoiled-rich, fortune-hunter, named King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Ellen (Claudette Colbert), escapes from her father's home and ends up in Jacksonville, where she meets a man, an unemployed reporter, named Peter Warne (Clark Gable). He tells her that he will help her get to New York City to be with Westley, in order to grab a scoop of a story. If she doesn't cooperate he'll turn her over to her father. So, off on their adventure to New York City, they go.\n\nThis film came out at a very interesting time in Hollywood's history. It was a post-depression era film, part of the early-talkie era and a pre-code Hollywood film (although the censorship-code started to take hold by 1935, so this is at the tail-end of that moment in film history). The use of sound in film was becoming more streamlined and much more crisper. This one uses all the techniques and talents that made early sound film so groundbreaking.\n\nThis film completes its greatness by winning the Best Picture Award at the Oscars in 1934. This film won all of the big five awards that year. It has those classic moments that made this film wonderful to watch. From the hitchhiking lesson, to the \"Flying Trapeze\", sung on the bus, to sleeping in a hay field and dividing the room up with a rope and a blanket. It has the right amount of comedy, drama, mood, sexual tension, sights, songs and sounds, that make it a near-perfect film.\n\nClark Gable and Claudette Colbert earned their Oscar wins, by convincingly giving us performances that still hold up today. His portrayal is right on the numbers. He doesn't come off as an over-emphasized 1930s clich\u00e9. His character does work throughout the ages. He's nice, but tough. He's sly, but also ignorant. He can be slick, but also look like a clown. His resourcefulness is lost on her though, because she is so prone to being waited on by others, that she doesn't see the extraordinary lengths he goes through to please her.\n\nI also want to emphasize the conditions these actors had to work under when they made these films so long ago. Today actors have huge campers they can wait in until filming starts. They have more protections for their safety today. They have a team of people around them catering to their every need. Technologies, communication and transportation is much more accessible today. When you watch these older films, visualize yourself and your friends today going out for a film shoot, in the rain, mud, cold, with limited resources and a couple of vehicles, that barely go over 35 miles an hour. That is what it was like, filming these huge Hollywood productions, back in its early days. It's these great moments, involving the whole process of the thing, that makes a film like this even greater.\n\n8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

        "review_detailed_main": "This old black and white Frank Capra classic must surely have set the standard for the romantic comedy, perhaps even been the first of this genre. It stars Claudette Colbert and my favourite actor from that era, the handsome Clark Gable, who fall in love in the midst of an entertaining set of screwball adventures, all the while exchanging assorted witty banter.\n\nThe story revolves around a spoiled heiress, Ellie Andrews, who marries a fortune hunter named King Westley against the wishes of her father, who has the marriage annulled before it can be consummated. Ellie runs off and boards a bus where she meets reporter Peter Warne, who recognizes her. He gives her a choice, either give him an exclusive story and he will reunite her with King or he will reveal her whereabouts to her father and collect the reward. Ellie agrees to give the story and various adventures ensue, during the course of which the pair develop a mutual attraction.\n\nThis movie has two main claims to fame, other than its incredible male star! The first is the hitchhiking scene in which Peter tries unsuccessfully to thumb a ride, turned down by car after car. Then Ellie lifts her skirt to reveal a shapely leg and...you guessed it, the next driver slams on his brakes!\n\nThe other is the famous Walls of Jericho scene, which is my lingering memory of this tale. Peter and Ellie are obliged to share a motel room for the night, surely quite risqu\u00e9 for that era! However, in order to maintain the proper decorum for an unmarried couple, a blanket is hung up sort of clothesline style to separate the two sleepers. Oh, the Good Old Days when couples weren't having sex within the first fifteen minutes of the movie! Now I won't give any spoilers, but will those walls of Jericho ever come tumbling down?"

The film pursues a rich lady as she goes through rustic America, experiencing American destitution and American magnificence in equivalent measure.

        "review_detailed_main": "The first of three films that Frank Capra directed that won him the Best Director Oscar (Mr. Deeds Went to Town lost Best Picture to The Great Ziegfield in 1936), It Happened One Night is credited as at least one of the first, if not the first, screwball comedies. A genre born of the Hays Code Office's requirements around the portrayal of sex in movies, it partially substituted violence for sex in watching the interplay of man and woman develop over ninety minutes or so. This is a much milder version of what came to dominate the comedy scene for another decade compared to something like Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby, and it never loses its Capra touch of gentle humanism. That Capraesque approach to humanity is one of the keys to this film lasting as long as it has.\n\nEllie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of a rich magnate, Alexander (Walter Connolly), who was caught at the marriage license window as she tried to marry the gold-digging playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) by Alexander's agents who stole her away from New York to Miami where he's keeping her on his yacht until he can talk some sense into her. In a fit of anger, she jumps ship and manages to get to shore where she evades her father's men and gets onto a bus alongside Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a New York newspaperman who gets unceremoniously fired by his editor, Joe (Charles C. Wilson), over the phone. Not know who Ellie is, Peter, thinking she's pretty, pays her some attention, chasing after the guy who steals her bag and leaving her with four dollars to get her to New York.\n\nThe joys of the film are all about the interplay between Ellie and Peter, anchored by the winning performances of both Colbert and Gable. However, my only real problem with the film comes with its comedy. There's an early scene where Ellie and Peter share a two-bedroom cabin, separated by the \"Walls of Jericho\", a string with a quilt hanging over it, and the interplay between the two is so slowly cut. If Columbia operated at all like how Irving Thalberg ran MGM at the time, then Capra and Harry Cohn screened the film for audiences as they fine-tuned it, and the pauses in the dialogue feel like room for laughter from the audience. There's a funny line, then the film goes quiet for 3 seconds or so before picking up the conversation. This works well if the audience is actively busting a gut every few seconds, but while I was happily bemused by the snappy dialogue between the two, the scene surprisingly dragged a fair amount. The comedy is nice, but the presentation of it was designed for it to be hilarious.\n\nEllie and Peter steadily grow their relationship as they become reliant on each other. Ellie is out of money, and Peter has the story of the year tracking the movements of this rich heiress that her father is desperately looking for with agents up and down the eastern coast of America. It's also a sort of marriage that develops, especially in the film's later sections where Peter becomes increasingly tied to the idea of providing for her himself, getting mad at her when she talks about convincing their ride to give them a meal (he'd picked up some carrots from a farm, anyway). There's also the moment where Peter fails to get a ride while hitchhiking by using his system with the thumb while Ellie gets a ride with the first car by just showing her leg. He's mad at her because she did it instead of him, but he also couches it in terms of her getting naked for other men. He feels possessive of her like a husband does a wife, and all of this is done rather subtly, letting it develop over the course of the film without anyone ever talking about it directly.\n\nThe emotional weight of the film is just that: the subtle development of a husband/wife relationship between the two characters as they grow to rely on each other for several different reasons. They have obstacles to overcome (the most amusing being the overbearing fellow passenger on the bus, Mr. Shapeley played by Roscoe Karns who picks up on Ellie's real identity that Peter has to scare off), and getting over those obstacles is what draws them closer. There's a bit of screwball type violence, mostly Peter smacking Ellie on the butt as he's carrying her across a river because she doesn't know what a piggyback ride is, but most of the film really relies on character first and foremost.\n\nOf course, the film ends with what has become something of a clich\u00e9 with a misunderstanding bred of an innocent disappearance, convincing both that the emotions they both felt were born of lies, creating the final obstacle that they need to overcome (the resolution is something that Mel Brooks aped decades late in Spaceballs), and because the characters are so clearly created, their relationship so clearly drawn, and their emotions so clearly felt, that resolution, while built on some contrivance, ends up ringing just the right way.\n\nThere's so much to enjoy in It Happened One Night, especially as it moves into its second half. There is such a warmth of humanity on display, especially in scenes like the whole population of the bus singing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\", that it's hard not to get caught up in it. Warm, amusing (though not hilarious), and touching with an ending to make the heart glow, Frank Capra's first major film is Classic Hollywood distilled."

She meets smart-mouthed reporter Peter Warne (Gable) en route and the antics continue as they mutually reply on each other to get to New York despite their differences.\n\nAfter Ellie Andrews escapes the clutches of her father (Connolly) and tries to make her own way to New York, we get to enjoy seeing her experience such foreign concepts as budgeting, being alone with a man and sleeping rough...mostly done with her upper-class charm, bar the odd tantrum.\n\nRogue reporter Peter Warne, not wanting to miss a chance to get his job back, blackmails her into letting him tag along. Their relationship develops and varies between friends and enemies as they remain stuck with each other. Peter fails to hitch a ride with his thumb so Ellie hilariously hitches one using her leg, a scene mimicked in the Laurel and Hardy classic Way Out West when Stan does the same thing.\n\nIt was a non-stop film and plenty of fun to watch, though the acting was over the top in places among some of the supporting cast. The atmosphere on the bus was well done with a very entertaining rendition of The Man on the Flying Trapeze.\n\nSaid to have inspired several Looney Tunes characters, the film thrives on the combination of the naivety of Ellie and the life experience of the more happy-go-lucky Warne as an unlikely love triangle begins to form and plenty of hilarity ensues. It is a little predictable like many rom-coms, though perhaps in the day they kept the audience guessing! This was the first film to receive the Oscar\u00ae \"Grand Slam\": Best Picture\u00ae, Best Director\u00ae, Best Actress\u00ae and Best Actor\u00ae. A nice bit of irony for Oscar\u00ae-winner Claudette who stated \"I have just finished making the worst picture I've ever made\"."

Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert have great on-screen chemistry and do a fine job of making their characters and their relationship believable and engaging.\n\nGable and Colbert are helped by the film's screenplay. The story is simple but it provides a great opportunity for these characters to be fleshed out and their relationship to be explored. The film established several tropes common in romcoms today but the characters and dialogue are well written enough to prevent the film from feeling clich\u00e9d or dated. It did take me a little while to get into the rhythm of the film and feel invested but by the end I was rooting and cheering for the lead duo.\n\nThe film is also well shot. This shot - http://pre-code.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/ItHappenedOneNight2.png - from the beginning of the film took me by surprise. It was a pleasant surprise. It feels rather modern for a film from the '30s. Most shots from the 30's tend to be wide shots that capture a good chunk of a scene. This applies to 'It Happened One Night' as well and it is not a complaint. They give scenes or conversations a kind of flow that makes it seem more natural. It is a nice change of pace from what we're used to today.\n\nOverall, this is a pleasant and engaging film with two well-developed characters played by two well cast and charismatic actors. I wasn't amazed but I would happily revisit it in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "In \"It happened one night\" the daughter of a millionaire (Ellie played by Claudette Colbert) wants to escape from the oppressive etiquette of her class. On the road she meets a journalist (Peter played by Clark Gable) who smells a story.\n\nThis plot is very similar with the one of \"Roman holiday\" (1953, William Wyler), except that in \"Roman holiday\" the female lead character is not the daughter of a millionaire but a princess.\n\nIn my opinion \"It happened one night\" is the better movie, and this is not due to the male leading actors (Clark Gable versus Gregory Peck) but more to the female lead actresses (Claudette Colbert versus Aufrey Hepburn). Claudette Colbert play is more spoiled in the first half of the movie and more spicy in het second half. It is ironic that the actress who makes the difference between the two movies is the one that is almost forgotten today.\n\nBecause her father is looking for her Ellie travels by long distance bus in the first half of the movie. This is also the way she meets Peter. The long distance bus turns out to be a real culture shock for the daughter of a millonaire. In a memorable scene she orders the bus driver to wait for her during a stop, and is really surprised when she finds out that the driver hasn't obeyed her order. Accustomed to cars with a private driver she was not prepared to adapt herself to the time schedule of someone else.\n\nWhen the chance of discovery in a long distance bus becomes too big Ellie and Peter change to hitchhiking in the second part of the movie. This change in means of transport more or less coincides with the character development of Ellie from spoiled to spicy. This is illustrated in another memorable scene. Peter is boasting that he is a very experienced hitchhiker, but all the cars are passing him by. After a while Ellie shows him how to stop a car using her female charms."

It's a cute little love story with good acting, but it is hardly worthy of a best picture win. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "To modern sensibilities, \"It Happened One Night\" is a tame clich\u00e9 of a love story. Although tabbed as a classic \"screwball comedy,\" in fact it lacks the essentials of that genre. It is neither as funny nor as romantic as the best of the screwball comedies. The end is visible from the beginning, and the road from start to finish doesn't travel a route that is particularly entertaining. Nonetheless, this is a landmark film of the 1930's and it deploys three of the great talents of that era: Frank Capra as director and Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert as the two hostile personalities who eventually fall in love. I never thought much of Gable when I was young but my mother often said he was the handsomest man alive. Colbert also pales alongside contemporary sexpots yet she was considered one of the most beautiful of the stars (back in the days when Stars were Stars). And Capra was considered a master movie-maker in his day. Although tame by contemporary standards, \"It Happened One Night\" is worth viewing as a milestone of an earlier era. Bearing in mind the limited technical resources available at the time and the no-sex code imposed by the Hays Office, I think it's worth 8 out of 10."

His facial expressions alone are priceless. Gable and Claudette Colbert make a splendid pair as it's a playful battle of wit throughout the film.\n\nFilled with memorable one-liners and humorous situations, this movie is a must see! Look out for the \"oh yeah\" driver, \"believe you me\" Shapeley, Peter's demonstration of undressing, and the hitchhiking lesson - hilarious!"

The story tells of rich heiress, Ellen Andrews (Colbert), running away from her father to reunite with King Westley (Jameson Thomas), who had eloped with her. On the way to New York, she runs into snappy reporter, Peter Warne (Gable), who had recently lost his job. After recognizing her, he agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Hilarity soon ensues as the two undergoes a series of (mis)adventures on the way to New York.\n\nA pioneering masterpiece and all-time classic. This movie still holds up greatly and is still a fun one to watch every now and then, even after many-many years and many-many rom-coms and road movies later. If many scenes and scenarios seem familiar, it's because this movie is seen as the pioneer and blueprint to many concepts, tropes, and scenes often found in rom-coms or road movies of the romantic persuasion. Putting aside the blueprint aspect, there is still a lot to be discovered with this movie. The chemistry between the two leads is absolutely brilliant. The story itself is tight and very entertaining featuring lots of great scenes as the duo make their way to New York featuring many misadventures and hilarious occurrences, all the while we see them get closer and closer to each other with every passing mile, also present is fast-paced, clever dialogue (mostly courtesy of Mr. Gable). There is also no shortage of great supporting characters, from fellow bus passengers to motel owners bring their own charm to the movie. Not to mention an abundance of classic scenes. All of this is then wrapped up in a quite satisfying end that'll leave viewers smiling after tagging along in this adventure. All in all, this classic movie is an absolute must watch, even if you're not a fan of romantic comedies or road movies."

It Happened One Night became the first of these iconic movies as it swept the Academy Awards of 1935.\n\nClark Gable and Claudette Colbert as Peter Warne and Ellen Andrews take us on a breathtaking journey across the United States with so many cheeky escapades and good-natured wisecracks that the 2 hour runtime simply flies by. Screwball comedy is the name of the game, personified by the lively, charming Peter with a few punchlines from his flirtatious partner in crime as they outrun (or rather outsmart) a nationwide manhunt. Romance, lurking subtly in the background for most of the movie, takes centre-stage as the story draws to its delightful conclusion.\n\nThe acting awards were well deserved, with both leads bringing their characters to life with refreshing authenticity and although the prim dialogue seems a little off to the modern viewer, it lends a true old-timer feel to the story. The plot is pretty straightforward, which is appropriate for a comedy and the cinematography offers everything you could expect from a movie produced almost 90 years ago.\n\nRumoured to be the inspiration behind the now legendary Bugs Bunny, IHON is the adored great grandpa of rom-coms, the sublime origin of most cliches we see in the genre today."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night is a great Classical film about society and the American Dream. While being a classical film, reusing old plot points and themes, it had a sense of realism as well, whether that be because of the realistic characters created, or the touchier subject matter. It differs greatly from the first film we watched Modern Times in it's message and it's approach.\n\nThe message of this film seems to be \"If you put your head down and work hard, then you can get through anything.\" This message is very optimistic, and almost the opposite of Modern Times which was very pessimistic. This film is also a perfect example of Cinema offering an escape, it's not as subtle as Modern Times, but is still hidden under a comedy, so in essence people could see the film, and enjoy it without knowing the message. The message is very optimistic, through the message and characters it offered audiences a chance to hope when times were very tough.\n\nI would go so far as to say the whole film was an allegory for society and the American Dream, saying \"yes times are tough, but it will get better.\" The characters are relatable because they were imperfect, they weren't stereotypes, and they resembled the masses, which made the allegory all the more powerful. Audiences could see themselves in characters that would persevere and eventually succeed, further reinforcing that the film offered hope to the masses. Whether or not Capra knew we were closer to the end than the beginning than the end of the great depression is irrelevant, because films like this helped America get out of the great depression and redefined the American Dream. The impact arguably was this film, and others like it helped people be more comfortable being themselves as they were finally being represented in media, they weren't being told to be a stereotype anymore. The impact was both good and bad, as people began to be more comfortable being themselves, society became more open, and less judgemental, but things like divorce rates, and single parent families also rose. Whether or not the impact of this film is good or bad is totally subjective, but I would lean towards positive, because optimism is usually a good thing to give people. Looking at the advanced camera-work, lighting, the countless films it's inspired, along with the timelessness of the message, It Happened One Night may be the most influential films of all time. I know it sounds bold, but when one considers that it was a film unafraid to tell the masses \"be who you want to be,\" that's a message that people still haven't fully accepted today. It also helped redefine, and reinstate hope in the American dream, while offering audiences an escape. It's a very well-rounded film, and it is still present in society today."

        "review_detailed_main": "You would think that after over a century of having the Motion Picture around as a Business as well as an \"Art\", that we'd have some formula or two that could be applied and, Wah-La! Success, we have an Oscar winner. We do have formilae, but they're all too evident. The success of a picture is often just good old fashioned, \"Pot Luck!\" As in so many other cases, Director Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934) started life as a short story in the hallowed pages of The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nIt was Samuel Hopkins Adams' story titled \"Night Bus\", and it was adapted to the screen no less than four times. In addition to this 1st time with IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, there was Columbia's 1956 remake, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT, with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon; as well as both Fillipino and Turkish productions. Like so many other Capra films, Robert Riskin was responsible for the screenplay.\n\nSimply stated, the plot goes something like the following. A cocky and rebellious newspaper man, Clark Gable, decides to tell off boss, and go freelance, all on his own. He does so with a bottle and a telephone. Meanwhile, spoiled daughter (Claudette Colbert) of ultra rich(though sympathetic)father(Walter Connolly)decides to run off from her scheduled marriage, leading father and his army of Private Detectives on a merry cross country chase, from Florida to NYC via a Greyhound-type Bus.\n\nEx-reporter and rich Heiress cross paths, and the fun all begins. Was it going to be business for Peter Warne(Gable) as a \"scoop\", that would allow him to name his ticket anywhere in newspaper business? Or was this to become a case of personal involvement for the two? A see-saw, back and forth series of events then transpires and we have one of the best pictures ever. And to think, it was all do to other studios lending a couple of their Stars to lowly Columbia.\n\nMGM lent Gable to Harry Cohn's \"Poverty Row\" Columbia Studio as a punishment for misbehavior in public. Paramount likewise lent out their lovely,sexy and sophisticated Leading Lady, Miss Claudette Colbert, reportedly against her will. The two reportedly did not hit it off so well, but their professionalism prevailed.\n\nWe must mention again a great assembly of supporting players that gave such life and seeming spontaneity to the story. We had Alan Hale, Ward Bond,Jameson Thomas, Arthur Hoyt,Blanche Frederci,Charles C. Wilson, Irving Bacon and even Bess Flowers. Special mention has to go to Roscoe Carnes whose possibly career's best role/performance did so much to add sparkle to all of his his scenes. He also provided a comic relief as fast talking, lecherous Traveling Salesman, Oscar Shapley.(\"Shapley's the name and that's how I like 'em!\") In spite of all these problems and a short shooting schedule, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT swept the Oscars with Best Picture, Best Actress(Miss Colbert), Best Actor(Gable), Best Screenplay(Riskin), Best Director(Mr. Capra).\n\nIt was interesting to observe our \"young 'uns\" and getting their reactions to a film that is now over 70 years old. Well, it appears that the age has little, if anything to do with their enjoyment and appreciation. As our 30 year old Michelle Ryan, now of Arlington, Virginia, stated, \"There is a big difference between 'movies' and a 'Film'.\" And IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT should be on everyone's list of \"Top Films\"!"

The romance and the will-they-won't-they aspect is also done better than most of those that followed in their footsteps.

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. This film, more than any other film of the time before, made comedy classy and personable. It has genuine heart, skillful gags that have no need for pies or extravagant slapstick, and intelligently written characters who are along for a ride, literally and figuratively. It is one of my favorite comedies and my goal for this post is to renew interest in my readers who have already seen it and ignite a curiosity in those who haven't experienced the joy of viewing it for the first time.\n\nFor those unfortunate ones who haven't yet seen Frank Capra's master work, or simply those who have forgotten its plot, here are the basics. 'Ellie' Andrews, the irresistible Claudette Colbert, is a young socialite from Miami who is bored with her smothering father. She impulsively marries a fortune hunting heel of a man which infuriates her father. She rebelliously runs away and determines to meet her husband in New York, traveling by Greyhound bus. On board, she makes the acquaintance of recently laid-off reporter Peter Warne, the ever charming Clark Gable, who within hours deduces her identity and makes her an offer. She'll allow him exclusive story rights to cover her journey to reunite with her love and he won't tell her daddy where she is. The rest of the movie is a wagon-load of shenanigans that the two of them get into on the bus, off the bus, on the road, in the wilderness, and in the process of multiple overnight rooms. This movie was the boasted favorite of Friz Freleng, one of the pioneers of the Looney Tunes and you can see why. The gags and dialogue are snappy and always effective, all the actors are in rare form, and the story moves at a brisk, yet leisurely pace to compliment the sometimes leisurely, sometimes chaotic journey these two share. Why don't I own this one yet?! Time and generational gaps have unfortunately given It Happened One Night the label of an \"old movie\", something an unfortunate number of youth today will go out of their way to avoid, which saddens me. I am as much a proponent of classic film as Scorsese or Roger Ebert, and that does not make me old. That makes me educated in a certain regard to history. It Happened One Night was the first of only three films thus-far in American film history to win the Big Five Oscars: Best Picture, Screenplay, Director, Actor, and Actress. This movie is a time capsule of how it was in the Depression on the road. I would rather watch this movie than another time capsule of the Depression-era, John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, since this movie is nothing but lighthearted fun from start to finish. Grapes of Wrath is so heavy-handed and sappy, that it tends to make Paul Haggis' Crash look subtle and that movie could hardly have been less subtle.\n\nThis film is a bundle of joy wrapped in caustic lunacy with love from one of America's prime comedic directors, Frank Capra, whom most would remember as the maker of 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the public domain classic It's a Wonderful Life. If you're interested in seeing more from super-zany Capra rather than soapbox, melodramatic Capra, look for 1938 Best Picture Winner You Can't Take it with You. This movie is begging to be watched, so do It Happened One Night a favor, and give it a look. I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed.\n\nFinal Rating: 5/5 Practically Perfect in Every Way"

        "review_title": "A Journey of Laughs and Love: 'It Happened One Night' Redefines the Road Film Genre",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the pantheon of classic American cinema, Frank Capra's \"It Happened One Night\" stands as a seminal work that not only defined the screwball comedy genre but also set a high watermark for road movies. With its release in 1934, this film embarked on a journey that would lead it to become the first to win all five major Academy Awards, a testament to its enduring legacy and craftsmanship.\n\nThe narrative is a masterclass in character development and pacing. Claudette Colbert's portrayal of the fiercely independent yet vulnerable heiress Ellie Andrews is a nuanced performance that resonates with empowerment and charm. Opposite her, Clark Gable's turn as the roguish yet endearing reporter Peter Warne provides a perfect foil, and their chemistry is the engine that drives the film's narrative forward.\n\nCapra's direction is deft, balancing the comedic elements with moments of genuine emotion, creating a tapestry of scenes that are as hilarious as they are heartfelt. The infamous \"Walls of Jericho\" scene is a brilliant piece of innuendo-laden dialogue that showcases the film's clever writing and the actors' impeccable timing.\n\nThe cinematography captures the sprawling American landscape with an eye for detail, making the journey itself a character in the story. The film's road trip is not just a physical journey but a metaphorical one as well, charting the emotional growth of its protagonists as they navigate the unpredictable path of love and life.\n\nFrom a critical standpoint, \"It Happened One Night\" is a film that transcends its era. It eschews the melodrama of its contemporaries for a more grounded and realistic portrayal of romance and adventure. Its influence is palpable, inspiring countless films and filmmakers who seek to capture the magic that Capra and his team so effortlessly displayed.\n\nIn conclusion, \"It Happened One Night\" is a near-perfect film that deserves its place on any list of canonical American road movies. Its blend of humor, heart, and humanity is a timeless reminder of the power of cinema to transport us, to make us laugh, and, most importantly, to make us feel. It is a film that, much like the journey it portrays, is unforgettable once experienced."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is part two of my two part introduction: ... Another unexpected accident came years later when legendary Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery told the story of how he came up with the idea for Bugs Bunny by watching Clark Gable eat carrots in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! A sound man on the film later told Capra the story of how he over-heard Colbert complaining to Gable about making the film (she thought it her worst) and Gable defended Capra saying he Gable was having a blast and that Capra was on to something. Well they finished the film on time and it opened at Radio City Music Hall where it only played for one week. The reviews were good but mixed and the box office not as strong as Capra's previous movie LADY FOR A DAY. Then \u2013 it happened. Happened all over the country \u2013 not in one night, but within a month. People took longer to find the film, in the Midwest, in small towns, the word of mouth spread and surprise it was funnier, much funnier than usual. But, the biggest surprise of all, they could remember in detail a good deal of what went on in the film and they found everybody else did and that it was great fun talking about this and that scene. And let's go see it again and take the neighbors. The quietness burst into the proverbial prairie fire. Theaters sold out for weeks and weeks. Critics went back for a second look, a third, a fourth.Astonishingly enough, the news about It Happened One Night was not that it made Classic status but that it got made at all. Oh and buy the way it, was the first film to sweep all five of the major Academy Awards and the only one for 48 years! Colbert did not want to even attend the Oscars so she went in travelling clothes, seems she was leaving that night to go on that vacation she missed. So when her name was called she ran up grabbed the award, said thanks and dashed out the door only to STOP. Turn around. Go back up on to the stage to the microphone and added, \"I owe Frank Capra for this.\" Gable said the same. Meanwhile, my favorite director Mr. Frank R. Capra went on to have a wonderful life. I used to call him at his home on his birthday (he was in the phone book) to thank him for making this film, and then MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, LOST HORIZON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, MEET JOHN DOE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. I used to call him on my birthday too. I told him watching his films again, was my present to me. With the help of film preservation, I hope you can always enjoy his presents to all of us."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has been around since 1934 and people are still commenting on it. Above all else, I've notice a lot of women who love to comment over the most famous scene in the film in which Clark Gable takes off his shirt and exposes his bare chest. I'm surprised, after all the other good-looking heartthrobs that have come and gone since Gable, women are still admiring his muscular physique. MY favorite scene however, is when Claudette Colbert brings the cocky Gable down a peg or two and puts him in his place when she hails a cab with those nice gams of hers. He spends the rest of the trip down the highway sulking over how a woman beat him at his own game of hitchhiking. Well, it serves him right. Also, I want to punch (no, KICK) him right in the face whenever he dictates to how and what she spends her money on. The jerk obviously thought he owned her or something. I'm not a feminist or anything, I'm just old-fashioned to a certain extent and think that a guy should be a gentleman to a lady and not boss her around. If a man bossed a woman around these days he would have gotten his teeth knocked in, or worse. Anyway, this was a great movie with a lot of comedy, a few bittersweet tears and an all-around good time for movie buffs."

        "review_title": "Charming, witty, and joyful.. First romantic comedy",
        "review_detailed_main": "Another one of director Frank Capra's classics. This one stars the great Clark Gable opposite Claudette Colbert. Although neither of them might be considered superstars, this film was revolutionary as one of the earliest romantic comedies, setting the formula for all future romantic comedies in Hollywood, Bollywood, and beyond. Despite being filmed 90 years ago, \"It Happened...\" absolutely stands the test of time. Gable plays a renegade journalist, Peter, and Colbert plays Ellie, a runaway heiress to a wealthy father. Against her father's wishes, she runs away to elope with some pilot she thought she loved. Peter and Ellie meet as strangers on a bus to New York. Ellie's father sends detectives on her trail and a $10,000 reward ($233,000 today) for anyone with information about her. Issues along the way, such as a flooded bridge and the bus breaking down, cause them to share a hotel room and hitchhike. Both despised each other for different reasons - he saw her as a cowering, spoiled brat, and she saw him as an obnoxious, egoistic jerk. They soon realize in their conversations they have shared dreams of life. Through the journey, they mature by being around one another and fall in love. The chemistry is apparent between the two leads. Charming, charming, charming through and through.\n\nThe technicals are on point. Acting, directing, cinematography, editing, pacing, and timing on witty quips are sensational. At the 7th Oscar in 1935, \"It Happened...\" became the first of only three films in history to do a clean sweep - winning every major category. Best picture, best actor, best actress, best director, and best screenplay. No film replicated that until 1976 with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and 1992 with \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" Gable gave away the Oscar he won for this film (the only one he ever won) to a kid he met. The kid returned the Oscar years later after Gable died young in 1960 (another actor to die in his prime).\n\nSome other tidbits. During the 1930s and 40s, actors were known for doing multiple films in a single year. Studios had high demands, and the pay was much lower. For instance, Gable did 40 films across the 1930s, and Colbert did 36. That's about 4 movies per year (some years, 5-6 films in a single year). No other actor does that today. Studios also employed actors with exclusive rights - MGM employed Gable. For his scandalous affair with another MGM actress, Gable was loaned to Columbia Studio to do this film as punishment. The legendary Bugs Bunny was inspired by Gable in this film. One comedic scene has Gable removing his shirt. Undershirts dropped in popularity among men when they saw Gable didn't wear one.\n\nWould I recommend this? I believe this is a must-watch movie before you die. I rarely watch romantic comedies, but I pleasantly enjoyed it. It's hard to not like. Like most old movies, the ending felt a bit rushed. Overall, the film is everlasting and a joy to watch.\n\n8.5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a lot of good, and a few great things to say about this classic.\n\n1). I actually laughed out loud a couple times. I grinned a bunch of times.\n\n2). The development of their love is more linear than in any other film I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure that was intended. Regardless, it was perfectly executed in every respect; the writing, acting and direction.\n\n3). I'm not a big Gable fan typically, although I've always believed him to be an excellent actor. He's just young enough here to have a bit of boyish charm barely show thru the rugged exterior of his flawed, yet principled character. He really does a great job, no doubt, particularly when he's trying to hide the fact that he's been hurt.\n\n4). Claudette is gorgeous, vivacious, funny, and lovable. Her performance in this movie (one she was very reluctant to accept initially); ended up earning her the best actress Oscar, and deservingly so.\n\n5). It's a road trip movie. And those always keep the audience's attention better than anything else offered. I don't care if it's Sleazy Rider, Thelma and Louise, or Dumb & Dumber; road trip movies are more fun, that's a fact.\n\nSome other highlights include the controlling father, who changes his tune upon his daughter's eventual return. Unlike the love mentioned in item 2, above; his change wasn't linear. He became quite engaging upon seeing the change in his daughter, recognizing clearly she had fallen for someone other than her obnoxious fianc\u00e9. Also, reading between the lines, analyzing his lovelorn daughter toward the end, he took an immediate liking to (whomever the hell it was), she fell in love with.\n\nThere are a few clever subtleties like that in this movie.\n\nAdd in Alan Hale Sr., in a quasi-cameo role, driving his two hitchhikers nuts with his obnoxious singing.\n\nFinally, the ONLY reason this movie does not get a 10, is the ending. Not that it wasn't a happy one, but the writers (I'm guessing their responsible), not only needlessly gypped the audience out of the final scene where they get back together, BUT MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY as well. Heck, they actually failed to put in the climax of the movie. What the hell were they thinking? No faces, no dialogue, just an explicit (and goofy) suggestion that all was OK.\n\nI cannot elaborate on what could've (should've) been done here without making it a spoiler, but the possibilities were endless.\n\nYes, I highly recommend. Furthermore, this movie is purchase worthy for your collection.\n\nThx\n\nBob R."

        "review_detailed_main": "Love, an obnoxiously overwhelming emotion that can often dictate our actions towards one another. Initially one may dislike the other due to unprecedented circumstances. Difference in class, wealth, personality or all of the above. However, expend enough time with that particular individual in a closed environment, and naturally those extinguished feelings may burn bright once more. For overindulged heiress Ellen Andrews, whom originally eloped with a fortune hunter only to realise he solely desires her wealth, cooperating and cohabiting with the middle class seemed like an otherworldly adventure. Haphazardly fleeing her father, whom desires her marriage annulled, she encounters a newspaper reporter. Their initial disdain for one another soon transforms into an illuminating love, which sees them travel cross-country to initiate a wedding that neither of them crave.\n\nCapra's award-winning pre-Code romantic comedy is the grandfather of all modern romcoms. Simple as that. Every clich\u00e9d trope and narrative beat stemmed from this joyous road trip feature, in which continues to rampantly inspire today. From the inevitable romance between the opposing central characters to the situational comedy meticulously embedded throughout. It's a romance not regarded highly for its basic plot, but for its sublime compositional components. Riskin's screenplay is absurdly witty, nestled with sharp quips for both characters that would ensue joyous hilarity and gleaming smiles. A notable example is the hitchhiking dispute. Peter would egotistically demonstrate his ornate abilities to hitch a ride with a passing vehicle, utilising three distinct techniques with his thumb. Asserting his masculinity and all. Ultimately, he fails. Ellen then stands up to plate and secures a ride by flaunting her leg. Whilst this action may not have aged well in terms of portraying the female counterpart by seemingly objectifying her (a product of its time, no doubt), it seamlessly combines the visual cues of Gable and Colbert's wonderful performances with the rigidity of Riskin's script.\n\nThe feature entirely depends on their chemistry, including the way they naturally bounce off each other and the emotional connection attracting them. Fortunately, it's categorically splendid to observe. Gable's roguish qualities automatically promoted Peter to acquire a convincingly charming personality. His initial blackmailing ultimatum, subconsciously viewing him as an antagonist, soon dissipates into contagious likeability. The pencil moustache too was a win! Colbert had the most ground to break with her character Ellen. Developing a sheltered heiress whom had limited knowledge of the real world into a relatable individual. Excellent performance, with enough subtleties to substantiate an emotional fragility to her character. Capra's straightforward direction, alongside Havlick's succinct editing, manages to present a convincing love story through situational and literary comedy. Hugely sophisticated for its time.\n\nHaving said that, there is a precise moment within the road trip when Ellen switches into doe-eyed love mode. With just the click of a finger, her character changes from this semi-independent strong-willed persona to this emotionally malleable loved up weakling. Yes, its purpose is to accentuate her overwhelming love for Peter through an arduous one-sided confession, adjacent to the symbolising \"walls of Jericho\" that corroborate their privacy, yet it also diminishes her characterised qualities. The 'Romeo and Juliet' narrative strand unfortunately occurs all too abruptly, consequently altering the third act's momentum.\n\nDespite these reservations, It Happened One Night is a product of its time that still holds up extremely vibrantly today. A romantic comedy that relishes in the classic romanticism of pre-Code Hollywood, which clearly has inspired every subsequent romcom since. It's the patriarch of the sub-genre, bolstered by sterling chemistry between the two leads. \"The walls of Jericho are toppling!\", and to that I say \"Let 'em topple\"."

The movie has snappy dialog, a fast-paced story, excellent development of the principal characters, and a good upbeat ending. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable give outstanding performances which reveal their skills as comic actors. The hitchhiking scene cannot fail to provoke laughter. The movie presents a story format that sets the standard for a genre of road movies. The movie also highlights the emergence of an America dominated by the automobile and tied together by roads and highways. Figuring in the story are gas station attendants, motel owners, bus drivers and bus stations, all part of the newly emerging automobile age. A movie of this kind could not have set in a pre-auto culture. This accounts for the movie's contemporary feel. Clark Gable so dominates this movie that it is virtually impossible to imagine anyone else playing Peter Warne. Yet, what makes the movie succeed is its straightforward storytelling about people who want to be break free from the social conventions that are denying them happiness. This is a wonderful and beautiful movie."

No, \"It Happened One Night\" is an unabashed romantic comedy and one of the best (if not the very best) of all time.\n\nThe story concerns a spoiled heiress (Claudette Colbert), on the run from her controlling father, who meets up with an unemployed newspaper reporter (Clark Gable) on a night bus to New York. They decide to work together to their mutual advantage but what starts out as a business arrangement gradually develops into something more.\n\nThe film's embarrassment of riches begins with its stars. Not only do they deliver excellent performances individually but together they have wonderful chemistry. Gable's performance is probably the best of the two but both were deserving Oscar winners. Besides these two, the cast is uniformly solid, including supporting standouts Walter Connolly & Roscoe Karns.\n\nThe film is distinguished as the first to win all five major Academy Awards. Besides the aforementioned Oscars for Best Actor & Best Actress, the film also took home Oscars for its adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin) and direction (by Frank Capra) along with the prestigious Best Picture Oscar. Only three films have ever captured all five awards. Pretty elite company, to be sure, but well warranted given the quality of each contribution.\n\nIn the end, \"It Happened One Night\" is a film that's practically without fault. Despite being over 75 years old it's still as vibrant as the day it was released. Without a doubt, it's a must-see for any self-respecting film fan."

I love seeing what that generation behaved like.

Undercover as a \"commoner\" she comes across the cad Peter Warne (Clarke Gable). He is a rebel newspaper writer who's, somewhat, lost his writing skills. Their chance meeting leads to Peter wanting the scoop on her motives for running away. They bicker incessantly but we all see they are falling in love.\n\nYes, this is template of both a road movie AND a screwball comedy. The lines often come fast and furious so you have to catch them.\n\nModern audiences beware, there are, what some may consider, misogynistic undertones. HOWEVER, Ellie tends to dish out more than she gets.\n\nThis film is a classic for a reason. As a reminder, this flick was a few years after the Great Depression. Yet, some things still remain true. Love, community, learning empathy. All great messages without being hammered over the head with the messages.\n\nThis is one of the moments in cinema that make you proud to make films."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's rare the Academy Awards hands out the 'Big Five' Oscars to one motion picture: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. In fact, only two other films hold that honor after February 1934's \"It Happened One Night\" achieved the seemingly impossible. Strangely, the Columbia Pictures' movie was initially a production no one wanted to be involved. Several top-flight stars rejected having anything to do with the production after reading the script, including Miriam Hopkins, Myrna Loy, Margaret Sullavan, Frederic March and Robert Montgomery, who later called it the worst screenplay he had ever read. Columbia boss Harry Cohn recommended actress Claudette Colbert to director Frank Capra to play the role of 'Ellie' Andres, who escapes from her wealthy father by diving off his Florida yacht to return to New York to re-unite with her recently married husband. Her father loathes the man and demands the marriage be annulled. Colbert had bad memories dealing with Capra in the first movie she ever appeared in, 1927's silent 'For the Love of Mike,\" and vowed never to work for him again. To discourage the hiring, she demanded double her salary of $50,000. Surprisingly, Columbia met her request.\n\nCapra, after hearing so many actors reject the screenplay, asked his writer friend Myles Connolly what he thought of the script. His advice: make Ellie more sympathetic. Screenwriter Robert Riskin reworked the script based on Samuel Hopkins Adams' 1933 short story 'Night Bus' to do just that. Still, the rewrite didn't improve Colbert's disposition on the set. She bickered with Capra throughout the four weeks of filming. She told her friends \"I just finished the worst picture in the world.\"\n\nClark Gable was equally unenthusiastic about the project. MGM loaned out the actor since his next studio film wasn't ready for some weeks, and his $2,000 a-week salary would be paid by Columbia. His first words to Capra on the initial day of shooting was \"Let's get this over with.\"\n\nOnce \"It Happened One Night\" was released to major city theaters, critics were lukewarm towards the film. The New Yorker review scathingly wrote \"pretty much nonsense and quite dreary.\" The initial short run at the large city movie houses was drawing only a mediocre audience. The film then played at smaller venues and towns. Suddenly, through word of mouth, lines formed out the door anxious to see Gable, as Peter Warne, a jaded know-it-all newspaper reporter just fired from his job who meets up with Ellie on the bus journeying north from Florida. The movie struck a special cord to rural Americans who were experiencing a lack of jobs, food, and shelter during the Depression. Roger Ebert noted in his review of \"It Happened One Night, \"The communal singing of \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" interrupts the action and morphs into a wonderfully democratic vision of the night bus as a society in eternal transit.\"\n\nThat bus ride scene was particularly instructive in how Capra, through his years of living in poverty, instinctively reframed it in the middle of filming. The director at first hired a small band to play \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" to a bus full of lower class travelers, including the two leads. Amazingly, all the extras knew the entire words to the song and sang it on the set. \"Another idea.\" recalls Capra. \"Why not let the whole bus join in? And that's what finally evolved.\" He praised small Columbia for allowing such independence that larger studios would have a committee of executives deciding on the director's preference.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" is filled with such classic scenes. When a bridge washed out the road during a rainstorm delaying the bus, Ellie and Peter are forced to share a motel room. The script called for Gable to strip down to his undies, describing each phase of his undressing. Gable's slick-tongue narrative got hung up when he had to remove his undershirt. Capra decided to bag the T-shirt. Gable's dialogue flowed smoothly after that. The sequence was so popular the males in the audience stopped buying undershirts, causing a massive drop in T-shirt sales.\n\nAnother scene is the famous hitch-hiking sequence where the two are forced to stake a ride. After Peter is unsuccessful using his thumb, Ellie tries the approach by raising her skirt and showing some leg. A body double was used for the close-up. Colbert was appalled. \"That's not my leg!\" she exclaimed, and insisted her leg be used instead.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" is credited as cinema's first screwball comedy. Even though loose versions of the farcical genre had been around since Shakespeare, including 'As You Like It,' the format didn't really pick up steam until Columbia's film. Movie critic Andrew Sarris defined screwballs as \"sex comedy without the sex.\" The commonality all the screwball comedies have is the quick-paced dialogue, with romantic relationships set in hilarious situations, and containing occasional class distinctions of the middle-class seen as 'heroes' while the upper-class members looking like saps.\n\nEven though \"It Happened One Night\" cleaned up at the box office in the secondary market, Colbert agreed with the sophisticated critics who gave a thumbs down to the movie. She was so sure she had no chance of winning the Academy Awards Best Actress, Colbert, despite her nomination, was seen boarding a train from Los Angeles to vacation in Phoenix during the evening of the ceremony. An Academy representative rushed to the station to inform her she had just won. Colbert went back to the Biltmore Hotel's gathering to accept the award. Film footage showing the evening's winners captures Colbert attired in traveling clothes.\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" was the first to capture the 'Big Five\" awards. The other two were 1975's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and 1991's \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" Members of the American Film Institute rank the Capra film the 35th Best American Movie, the 8th Funniest, the 38th Most Passionate, the third Best Romantic Comedy, and nominated Ellie's quote, \"Well, I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb\" as the one of the Best Quotes in Film. The motion picture is also included in the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die' reference book."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night is the first required film that I'll be watching this fall for my college film class, and it's the first of three in the Romantic Comedy unit. The other two are When Harry Met Sally...(1989) and Monsoon Wedding (2001). After finishing this one, it's easy to see why this was first on the list.\n\nIt Happened One Night tells the story of Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of wealthy Wall Street man Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who is marrying aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas) out of rebellion, and can no longer bear for her life to be planned out for her and constantly be told what to do. So she literally jumps ship from her father's boat in Miami and heads for New York in pursuit of Her soon-to-be husband Westley. On the bus there she gets stuck next to wisecracking New York newspaper man Peter Warne (Clarke Gable). Meanwhile Mr. Andrews is using everything at his disposal to find his daughter, including but not limited to a reward in the newspapers offering $10,000 to anyone with information on her whereabouts. Once Peter sees Ellie's wit and finds out who she is, he sees a great opportunity for himself. He offers to help the charming yet na\u00efve Ellie get to New York without getting stopped in exchange for exclusive rights for her story. The film then takes us on the journey of them discovering that they love each other, despite the slightly testy nature of their initial relationship.\n\nWith a powerhouse director like Frank Capra, it's no wonder why this film turned out as well as it did. In fact, it is the first film to ever win the \"big 5\" at the Academy Awards, which consists of the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Actor, and Best Actress awards. The only other films to accomplish this feat were One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).\n\nThis film, as far as I know, established the blueprint for the modern Romantic Comedy, which it also deserves tremendous credit for. As for my personal opinion, I think this very enjoyable watch that maintained my attention throughout most of the runtime, and while it isn't perfect, or even my favorite film from the 30's, it's still an undeniable old Hollywood classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a romantic comedy set in 1933 between Miami and New York. It follows the escapades of Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled, protected 25-ish daughter of wealthy New York industrialist Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly). She elopes with an older gold-digging aviator, King Westley (Jameson Thomas), to escape her father's clutches. Alexander is determined to get the marriage annulled and whisks Ellen away on a boat in South Florida. Ellen flees from the ship and is determined to get to Westley in New York, and catches a bus in Miami. Her disappearance becomes a major news story in the nation's papers.\n\nOn the bus, she meets Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a jaded, hard-drinking newspaper journalist who has just been fired from his job at a major New York newspaper. Peter offers to help Ellen return to Westley if he can have exclusive rights to her story.\n\nThe film follows their journey by bus, hitchhiking, and Model-T Ford from Miami to New York. We meet people like Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), who discovers Ellen's identity on the bus, and Danker (Alan Hale), the man who gives them a ride. The winding and unwinding of Peter's and Ellen's relationship provides much humor, and we learn new meanings for the \"walls of Jericho.\"\n\n\"It Happened One Night\" reflects 1930s perspectives on male-female relationships and includes some themes from \"Taming of the Shrew,\" but Ellen does show an independent streak. Gable and Colbert have remarkable chemistry in their roles, and Walter Connolly as Ellen's father and Charles C. Wilson as Peter's on-again, off-again editor boss provide good support. The humor is over the top enough to be great fun."

A sense of adventure, and discovery, wit, and romance... that always brings me back.\n\nNow it's plain to see, Cary Grant and Claudet Colbert are wonderful together.\n\nI am reminded of growing up with my sister, and feeling seperated from family and society, like the two actors in this film, on a sort of journey thru blindness, to find your way home again."

The movie goers of the time enjoyed it so they went back to see it again bringing family and friends cause they knew they had seen something truly awesome. Come Oscar time it took the five biggies, Best Picture, Leading actor and actress, writer and director. A feat not repeated again until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Yes! But don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy myself!\"\n\nThis is a soothing film to start your morning.\n\n'It Happened One Night' is, on paper, pure establishment: a Frank Capra-directed Hollywood hit (albeit a slow-building one) that famously won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay, then becoming the template for hundreds of romantic comedies that followed. It's apropos then that its title suggests a flicker of chance, an unperceivable dash of magic. Indeed, even now, 'It Happened One Night' carries the unmistakable tenor of a breakout hit, fueled by confidently zippy repartee and manic comic invention that almost none of the innumerable pretenders to the throne of romantic comedy can match.\n\nClark Gable and Claudette Colbert star as a rakish newspaper reporter and a pampered and recently married heiress who fall for each other on a cross-country trip despite their clashing temperaments. The pair are as mismatched as can be: she's trying to get out from under her overbearing father's thumb (who's trying to annul her marriage) and runs away, and he selfishly smells the scoop of the century when he realizes who she is. No prizes for guessing whether they go from mutual irritation to attraction over the course of the trip, as what ensues are almost corrosive verbal fireworks between the two. He thinks she's a spoiled brat, and she believes he's a gruff, self-serving jackass. While they're both on the mark, this witty, hilarious picture, written by Capra-regular Robert Riskin, makes the most of this unlikely pair with its jagged and droll battle-of-the-sexes humor and unsentimental approach to romance.\n\nYes, it's a narrative that's been recycled countless times since, sometimes merely by using the genre conventions it helped to establish, like any movie where a pair of attracted non-lovers are forced to share a sleeping space. That's what Gable and Colbert do in the walls of Jericho scene, remembered for both its Biblical innuendo and its less allusive shot of a bare-chested Gable. There's also the much-spoofed scene where Colbert's Ellie schools Gable's Peter in hitchhiking technique, also predicated on a type of nudity that no longer qualifies as such. It's remarkable, then, that the '34 telling of this now-familiar story still feels fresh: always funny, still romantic, and quite beautiful to look at beyond even its two photogenic stars, matching the film's weaponized patter. There's a lot of deep and understated affection in the comedy, but the way the picture uses diverting sharp barbs to mask those sentiments is incredibly sophisticated for its time. Then again, maybe this film just indicates that I was born four decades too late.\n\nMuch of the film's progeny strive for that innate likability while missing one virtue of its not-quite-screwball pacing: simplicity. 'It Happened One Night' lets Peter and Ellie spend a lot of time together, focusing on their competing desires rather than the zany logistics of their travel arrangement. Their most famous scenes involve just the two of them, and many of the other sorta-important characters are either comic bit players or mostly offscreen. In the end, their romance, even with all of its twists turned into genre hallmarks, feels as quick and graceful as a magic trick, just as any classic romance should."

I wouldn't have minded if it went on for longer, tho it isn't too big of an issue and I'll let it slide.\n\nThese people feel real, and it's all thanks to Capra's direction, Rob Riskin's wonderful script and our two leads.\n\nIt amazes me how good their on-screen chemistry is when this was merely their first picture together. It felt like they really fell for each other. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if they did.\n\nIt's the definition of a \"feel-good movie\" , one that has become sorely missed and sadly extinct from this trend of nihilistic ironic comedies such as Deadpool or Rick and Morty that have unfortunately infected our modern culture and left us with cheap laughs at the expense of our collective intelligence.\n\nThey literally don't make 'em like they used to."

I can watch it over and over, enjoying it every time. I am not the biggest Clark Gable fan, but the combination of him with Claudette Colbert in this film is fire! The two play off of each other very well.\n\nThe heiress Ellie Andrews(Claudette Colbert) has secretly married aviator King Westley to her father Alexander Andrews' (Walter Connolly) chagrin. Her father holds her hostage on his private yacht while he tries to annul her marriage, until Ellie takes an escaping dive to go on the run to her new husband played by Jameson Thomas. To avoid her father's henchmen, Ellie does the unexpected and buys a ticket on a public bus where she meets the currently unemployed reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable). Peter may be tipsy when he first encounters Ellie...but it doesn't take him long to figure out that she is a fish out of water. Bad with money and easy to take advantage of, Ellie is down to her last few cents and has had her luggage stolen when Peter finally steps in...and Ellie is not the most grateful recipient of his help...and there in lies the fun.\n\nBased on the short story by Samuel Hopkins Adams, this screen play by Robert Riskin is filled with some of the best lines and best scenes in Hollywood. It's obvious why it swept the Oscars in 1935...Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director, and Best Writing-Adaptation.\n\nNot only is this a wonderful film that every classic film fan should watch, but it is a bit of a historical time capsule for historians. The yacht, the cars, the bus, the roadside lodges...with their outdoor shared showers, the prices, the food, the cigarettes...this is a historical delight. This film comes highly recommended by me. My favorite romantic genre is the hate-to-love genre and this is that to a tee.\n\nI originally watched this film more than three decades ago, because I had purchased a classic film blank address book that contained a photo of Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable from this film. I was so enthralled by the photo (which was my favorite in the book) that I sought out the film and have been delighting in it ever since."

        "review_detailed_main": "It happened, all right - happened to me. I LOVED this film, and I thought it was wonderful! Where do I begin? Well, it's still as fresh as a daisy today. Excellent performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, and easily worthy of \"Best Actor/Actress\" awards. Ditto for the script and direction! Best Picture of 1934? I haven't seen all the nominees yet, but this one is a shoe-in, I'd say. Absolute magic from Frank Capra, and you could have fooled me that this was the same man who directed IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (which I didn't much care for).\n\nColbert plays the spoiled daughter of a stuffy socialite who decides to abandon her life of confinement. She winds up bumping into the tough Gable and from there, the sparks fly. Very humorous, and a great chemistry between the two lead performers. One of the best romantic comedies of all, and I'm prepared to call this easily one of the all-time greatest movies ever made too; it will certainly occupy a place on my own personal \"100 Greatest Films\" List (which I'm going to be working on over time).\n\nOh yeah?? YEAH!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When spoiled millionaire heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) jumps off her father's yacht, reporters are on the trail for the hottest newspaper story! She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down- on-his luck reporter Peter Warne, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and \"Westley,\" the weasel husband she married in haste who is only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the Oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! When they find themselves stranded off the road, Peter teaches \"Brat\" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking. It is a classic scene, as he fails miserably until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! \"It happened one Night\" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated so many famous scenes from \"It Happened One Night.\" With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds;\"the walls of Jericho.\" This is another classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellies' father, close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. \"It Happened One Night\" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture. It should be part of everyone's movie collection. 80 years after it's release, \"It Happened One Night\" is still fresh, funny and the ultimate screwball comedy!"

There is famous chemistry and repartee - verbal and physical - between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night, and that's the most important thing to know about the film. There is also a MacGuffin (Colbert herself), a voyage with lots of real-world complications, recurrent social commentary, excellent cinematography, playful erotic moments, and an audience that is rooting for the two protagonists from the opening credits. We are enjoying the comedy and the slapstick, but we also feel the tension of their trip and the tension between them. It's a gem."

        "review_title": "Classic Comedy About Sheltered Female and Strong Male=TNT",
        "review_detailed_main": "This script by Robert Riskin I find to be filled with excellent dialogue; This is an unpretentious but very idea-level social satire, involving the unlikely pairing of no-nonsense Clark Gable with classically-trained charismatic Claudette Colbert. The second unlikeliness about the film is the princess-like Colbert, being barred by her magnate father from consummating a secret marriage, jumping off the yacht where she is being confined and ending up being spotted by newsman Gable. He is in fact portrayed as the usual late-twenties hard-drinking no-nonsense reporter sort with three exceptions--he is adventurous, able to get along and function effectively at all levels of society even during the Depresssion, and he is working in a profession where there is no job-level between managing editor and field reporter; this all leaves him frustrated by dull or routine assignments but wanting to investigate and do something important in the world. Only the wealth of Colbert's father qualifies her as important. Once he befriends her, and agrees to get her where she wants to go, the added complication comes from their attraction for one another, a slowly growing and smoldering subtext to what they actually do. He disapproves of her; she disapproves of him. He represents, it appears to me, reality--what she has been denied every bit as much as any European princess (\"The Princess Comes Across\", \"Roman Holiday\") has been denied it; and he is a natural leader shut out from the upper levels of society and thus denied also; and he is the natural leader/mental aristocrat by ability denied her worlds of unobstructed goal-setting, doing one's one desires and not having to be disbarred from anything. As no one I know has noticed, then, this is a European story-line grafted onto a supposedly classless U.S., every bit as much so as is \"Destry Rides Again\" or \"Roman Scandals\". That I suggest is the secret to \"It Happened One Night\" and its strong story-line; it is a film about Gable's personal purpose of doing a good story for his career's sake and having it turned upside down by his falling in love with what Colbert ought-to-be, could be, and is becoming. The \"Walls of Jericho\" business involving the erecting of a curtain so Colbert will feel safe spending the night with Gable is a charming device for comedic purposes, as is Gable's removing his shirt as a symbol of reality-sexuality being offered to Colbert, the last thing she immediately wants to deal with. In another sense, the Walls are protecting him, the realist, from immediately having to deal with her higher-value-sexual meaning rather than her story-value to him as a reporter. The cleverness of the dialogue, picaresque adventures, human encounters and interactions depicted in the movie all magnify its importance again. And the fact that these are all beautifully presented by director Frank Capra and his technicians further increases their ability to affect an audience. The couple's different ways of handling people, the dunking of a donut, and the classic triumph of the bared female leg (hers) over hitchhiking expertise (his) at promoting them a ride become symbols of the natural triumphing over the artificial. over \"barriers\". And when the time comes for Ellie Andrews (Colbert) to decide whether she wants to stay married to one King Westley or divorce or marry Peter Warne (Gable), we the viewers have been well-informed as to what decision she will be making. This is a screwball-type comedy due to the unpredictable reactions of many persons to the Depression's unnatural restraints and emergencies. The basic situation--the princess-cheerleader female and the rough-hewn-commoner male has been carried out many times, but never with more success since the film's release; but this is essentially a European plot line grafted onto a U.S. stature-through-ability individualism; this is why so many attempts at this formula have failed, I suggest; because the formula was not understood, and because the united States has been increasingly unAmerican since 1902, particularly since 1937. The other interesting and important aspect I find as a writer is that Gable does not know who this waif is at the beginning; so we find that Gable's character is a commoner who deserves to be an important man, a first-rate newspaperman frustrated by his inability to chart his own course, a man who likes people who lives in a rough, noir-like environment, and a man who likes women and wants an equal but has to play mentor to a desirable woman only slowly realizing her potential. This is the \"ice-goddess\" aspect of the rich explored in \"The Phildaelphia Story\" by Philip Barry; Gable's problem is that of the great man stuck in a tsar-ridden society, familiar from \"Holiday\", \"The Big Sleep\" and \"The Fountainhead\" among others. The film I find is a delight; its dated aspects are those of its technologically backward period only. Its strengths appear to me to be derived from its honest plot and many interesting characters. Both leads are self-regulating; he lives by a moral code, and during the film she discovers the need for one. They seem to be an excellent match, when all is said and done. The evils of the Depression, which socialist Capra might have stressed even more than he does, are used very cleverly here as a background to the personal self-discovery mutual story-line. This is a well-photographed and artistic effort, I suggest, but nothing as stylish as Capra's later efforts. Cinematography by Joseph Walker, art direction by Stephen Goosson, and Robert Kalloch's costumes, with brief music only being provided all add to the realistic sense of the two character's descent from riches or daily reality and their immersion in the wider meaning of a nation in social upheaval and economic distress. In the cast the viewer should note Walter Connolly as Colbert's exasperated banker father, Roscoe Karns, Ward Bond, Alan Hale, Arthur Hoyt, Jameson Roberts, Harry Hume, Milton Kibbee and many more persons effective in brief parts. This is a well-designed movie, very deserving of its popularity."

The romantic tension between a man and a woman in its purest form. Claudette Colbert delivers such a classy performance in full command of her attraction to Gable. Her release is in her comedy and romantic teasing. I have not seen a Clark Gable movie so deliciously sparkling with his charm, smile and that famous glint in the eye of possibility. Frank Capra helped to shape the Model of the 20th century American family. But before the family, of course comes romance between a man and a woman. Capra infused his loving Italian roots, and focus on the realities family into many films in the mid 20th century. Innocence and hope are common values in his post depression era films. A must see."

I might, however, recommend Bringing Up Baby over It Happened One Night. I'm not sure, so I'll encourage anyone reading this to watch both. The screwball comedies of the 1930's all contain a nourishing endorsement of 'happily ever after,' not only as a possible destination and resting place, but as a necessary one. 'Happily Ever After' is fated in these movies, and we have the comforting pleasure of watching the two potential lovers find their way into that paradise. Romeo and Juliet with a happy ending, the crossing stars of two star-crossed lovers being untangled."

        "review_detailed_main": "Broke and desperate, Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), a young heiress trying to get back to her new husband of whom her wealthy father disproves, ends up travelling up the east coast on the cheap with Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a reporter who agrees to help her in exchange for an 'exclusive' story. As a comedy, Frank Capra's almost 90 year old light-weight romance has not aged all that well but as a pleasant snapshot of America in the '30s, it's great. Famously, the film cleaned up at the Oscars and the direction, cast, and script are all very good. Gable, one of Hollywood's iconic leading men, is willing to play the fool at times, (gnawing on carrots, ineffectually spitting, etc) something I always like in a 'star' and Colbert is great as the somewhat na\u00efve, almost waifish 'spoiled rich girl'. The plot follows the usual 'meet cute - bonding adventures - love acknowledged - final-obstacle surmounted' trajectory but is enjoyable (and likely seemed a lot more original in the early 30s than now, after decades of similar storylines). The film was made before strict enforcement of the Hays Code, so the humour is slightly sly and risqu\u00e9 (although no more than many of the subsequent 'screwball comedies', which snuck a lot past Mrs. Grundy's censorious eyes). All in all, a fun slice of Americana and Hollywood history - cute, quaint, clever, and well worth a watch at a number levels (and one reason why I don't wear an undershirt)."

The movie was meant to be a comedy and it certainly is, constant joking and almost goofy scenes made it nearly impossible not to chuckle.

So I think Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, Kate Hudson, Kate Beckinsale, Claire Danes, Cameron Diaz or Anne Hathaway should be a terrific choice. The actors that can be a good Clark Gable would be Will Ferrell, Aston Kutchner, Alex D. Linz, Chad Michael Murray, Owen Wilson, Jon Heder or Ben Stiller. Instead of showing one leg in the classic version the woman would show both her legs in the remake for a person to stop the car. This remake is going to be much different from the original version."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've lately been watching a number of films made in the early 30's and it just strikes me watching \"It Happened One Night\" how unlike all the others it was, good as they sometimes were. I know it was the first screwball comedy, something in itself, but it's Capra's moving camera, the snappy dialogue and the credible acting even in unlikely situations that make you feel less like you're watching something staged. In all those senses, it plays like the first modern movie. Crazy as they sometimes are, Gable and Colbert's characters feel like real people, talking and acting naturally as they go. It's also a film made for adults to enjoy, the for-the-times risqu\u00e9 humour concerning the erection (no pun intended) of the symbolic Walls of Jericho between the thrown together couple, Gable's undressing to his bare torso, Colbert's hitching a ride for them by provocatively hitching her skirt and the closing consummation scene where the walls come tumbling down are all knowingly and winningly rendered.\n\nGable is great in the role that elevated him to his unchallenged status as the King Of Hollywood, the personification of contemporary masculinity, handsome, confident and honourable and yet not without sensitivity or good manners. Colbert is equally good as the spoiled brat who is brought down to earth on the road with Gable. She's sexy, sassy and chic and every bit the match of Gable, a prototype for the smart-talking female characters to be played in succeeding Hollywood comedies starring the likes of Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur, Barbra Stanwyck, Carole Lombard and others. The starring couple's interaction and comic timing is perfect, a model for all those initially-warring-couple features for years to come.\n\nWith a witty script by Robert Ruskin, an able supporting cast and a succession of humorous situations, the film flows beautifully from the off, never letting up, directed energetically and at times almost instinctively by Capra in the movie that really made his name. There are no lingering close-ups, static scene-setting or slow dissolves here, it's all pace and movement as befits the plight of the runaway couple.\n\nCapra's social commentary is still evident and doesn't gloss over its Depression Era setting, manifest in the scene when Gable salutes the everyday folk riding the top of the train which crosses his path. Capra didn't really return to screwball comedy after making this, instead going on in later years to further exercise his conscience by employing Messrs Deeds, Smith and Doe, but he didn't need to, he nailed it forever with this marvellous one-off collective collaboration, almost unbelievably shot in only four weeks."

And the role of Peter Warner perfectly fits Clark Gable ! If there should be a blackhead to underline, I would say that of course the story is a little bit foreseeable, but anyway it's a case for any romantic comedy, and if you choose to watch a movie of that kind, I think you are perfectly aware of the fact that you are going to see a happy ending story, aren't you ? Personally I didn't stop laughing all time long ... Believe me, if you're a little bit depressed, that should make you feel a little bit better ! As a conclusion I would say that if you haven't seen it yet, hurry up, you won't be disappointed !"

Even though the plot itself is a product of the times, the dramatic tension and comic sensibility remains fresh today. Sure, we know from the beginning the two attractive leads will end up together( how could it be otherwise?) but unlike romantic comedies of today, the journey to that end is believable.\n\nStandouts: Oscar \"Believe you me\" Shapely; the famous hitch-hiking gag; the bit with the detectives in the cabin.\n\nI've seen this film referred to as a \"screwball comedy.\" I don't think this falls into that category. While there are some screwball moments, overall the situations, while unlikely, are, at least to a degree, possible, and the performances aren't manic. Each moment is played for reality. There are plenty of quiet moments to balance the action of the piece.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, you should."

The scene on the bus where \"the daring young man on his flying trapeze\" is sung has to be a classic. Clark and Claudette glow in this. Even though some of it is quite ahead of its time (sharing the room, the famous undershirt scene which caused undershirt sales to drop 50% in the year it was released) the suggestions of hitting her to keep her in line are appalling today. Roscoe Karns as Shapely gives a winning performance and nearly steals the movie. I give it an 8 out of 10."

Gable is a fitting opponent; although he overacts a bit now and then, he is not annoying. Walter Connolly gives a fine portrayal of Colbert's father and Alan Hale is hilarious as the singing car bandit.\n\nOn a par with classic 30's movies such as My Man Godfrey and The Thin Man, It Happened One Night is a fast-paced and amusing feel good movie that will make your day."

Needless to say, this enrages her father who angrily announces that he will have the marriage annulled. In response, Ellie jumps out of their yacht moored safely in Miami in order to reunite with King in New York. Angered by her actions and concerned for her safety, Alexander immediately sends out private detectives to find her and bring her back home. However, anticipating that he would attempt an action such as this, Ellie secretly boards a greyhound bus and successfully evades her father's blockade. Naturally, having never been on her own before, Ellie has some issues adjusting to her new situation--and this only intensifies after sitting next to a reporter by the name of \"Peter Warne\" (Clark Gable). Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is one of those classics which has withstood the test of time and is as entertaining today as it was 90 years earlier. It's definitely an enjoyable romantic comedy, and I recommend it to those who are interested."

It's one of the last films of the pre-Code era, and as such delivers witty, adult, dialog and comic situations delivered by several great stars and character actors of the era.\n\nThe story is a bit preposterous, with Claudette Colbert as the spoiled, sheltered, daughter of a protective multimillionaire and a young Clark Gable as the dashing but jaded young newspaper reporter who decides to help her escape her father's protective clutches in pursuit of a hot story. Madcap antics ensue, as they say, as the two may or may not fall in love with each other. It's all lightweight farce, but it's superbly well done, and a great piece of classic Hollywood entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "It Happened One Night set a pretty high water mark for romantic comedies back in 1934, a standard that has rarely been met, and possibly never surpassed. Any classic movie lover would be hard-pressed to deny the charm of this film. As enjoyable as any of Capra's best, I Happened One Night is one of those rare films that is a joy to watch, simply for its entertainment value. Clark Gable stars as Peter Worne, a hard-nosed reporter, who just got the pink slip from his job when he runs into Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews. Having run away from her father, Ellie is trying to get to New York to be with her husband, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Smelling a story, Worne decides it may be best for both of them to stick together for a while. What the newsman doesn't count on is that he may see more to Ellie than what he had counted on. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play off of each other wonderfully throughout the movie, displaying a the chemistry between stars that makes a movie a classic. The achievements of the Capra and company did not go unnoticed during Oscar season, either. It Happened One Night made Oscar history as being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards, a feat that would not occur again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it in 1975. Aside from winning Best Picture, the film also took in Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). It Happened One Night should not be missed!"

Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are brilliant with great chemistry and strong supporting actors. The plot was the usual love story where boy meets girl and falls in love but it was beautifully played out in this movie. Clark gave a wonderful performance as the overzealous reporter and Claudette convincingly played the spoiled rich kid with no shame whatsoever. It is indeed a must-see especially for classic movie lovers or Clark Gable fans. Take it from me, if I haven't established it already, this is a really good movie."

Setting the template for the genre for decades. Its stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert form an unlikely couple. Colbert a spoilt brat heiress about to marry someone in New York. Gable a failing newspaper reporter who needs a scoop to boost his flagging career. In an era before interstate air travel the pair travel from Miami, Florida to New York via a nightbus and several stops en route. Its interesting how simple life seemed in the depression era U.S. in this film. No freeways with thousands of cars hurtling past! Just quiet backroads with the occassional car. The film is an early road movie as well as rom com. Very little is set in one single location. Just the odd motel rooms, the nightbus and exterior shots. Gable seems to revel in his role as a bit of a scally that differs from his more stiff upper lip roles in films such as Gone With The Wind. The film was a great success winning several Academy Awards including the big 5 (Director, Actor, Actress, Best Picture and Screenplay). Few films (only three to date) have achieved such an accolade. For the first ten minutes I was like this is really dated and will be boring, however on reflection you can see its appeal. Bravo again Mr. Capra. Hindi remakes were made like Dil Hai ki Manta Nahi and Jab we met. But my favorite remains this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original rom-com that is still ruling the commercial rom-com genre with all of the tropes created in it. It's an entertaining film that still has its charm after all these years. But it has aged poorly in a lot of facets too. The regressive stereotypes are a bit much in today's age. Even if we consider the age of the film, it's just annoying and distracting all the time with its characters' outdated crappy behaviour. It's still a fun film that can be remembered for being the first in a lot of things but not one of the greatest films in a long shot. Iconic moments alone doesn't make a film great, it should stand the test of time. This film stands the test of time in certain aspects and fails in certain others. Still, the moments like the hitch-hikers leg, the bride running away etc makes it a classic worth noting."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I readily admit that Frank Capra knew what he was doing as a director, I do not rate him in the same quality band as my favorite directors William Wyler, Alfred Hitchcock, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Fritz Lang, Fred Zinnemann, or Billy Wilder. That said, I find IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT his finest hour, far better than perhaps his best known movie, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which sickened me with its 'overschmaltziness'. There is a point of contact between those two Capra-directed flicks: both turn on the financial problems of the male lead (Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, respectively). Perhaps it has to do with the poverty Capra grew up in: born in Sicily, he traveled by ship to the United States and described the trip as loads of passengers vomiting from beginning to end, and the lingering stench apparently never left his nostrils - nor did poverty in his early years in Uncle Sam.\n\nThough I consider Stewart to have put out a higher quality body of work over the course of his career, I find Gable's Peter Warne more likable than any character Stewart played for Capra.\n\nClaudette Colbert also deserves high praise. Her round face is not my ideal in terms of female beauty, but she has a lovely figure, great legs and once she smiles she is to die for and I forget any imperfections.\n\nBack to IT HAPPENED, regrettably I watched a badly cropped copy on Youtube. Probably unfairly, it causes me to dock two stars. Still, cinematography by Joseph Walker is highly skilled and the script by Robert Riskin so imaginative and ground-breaking that it has been credited with starting the 1930s spate of screwball comedies.\n\nDefinitive must see, very likely an influence on Alfred Hitchcock and his THE 39 STEPS masterpiece that would come out in the United Kingdom the following year. 8/10."
