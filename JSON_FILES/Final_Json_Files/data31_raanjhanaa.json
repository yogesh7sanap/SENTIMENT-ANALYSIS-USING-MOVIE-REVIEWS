        "review_detailed_main": "Dhanush who had earlier wooed the South Indian audience with his acting skills, chose a script tailor made for him to launch himself into Bollywood. The movie, doesn't disappoint those who enjoyed the stories where love stands above everything else in life. To top it all, when you have ARR weaving his magic with some sublime music, the beauty of Banaras just comes alive in front of your eyes. The three main characters, all have their own shades of grey and more often than not they stem from Love. Sonam for once does justice to her role, she grew into her role as the movie progressed and gave a telling performance that she could reflect back with pride. Abhay was as flawless as ever, just easing through his role with nonchalant ease. It would only be fair if i end where I started - Dhanush simply stole the show with his intense portrayal of a person driven by love, a person who does the most stupid, brave and incomprehensible of things in the name of love. My Verdict: Expect a love story with a traditional characterization supported by some brilliant music and clean performances by the lead cast - you won't be disappointed."

Dis movie belongs to him only( heard he was d youngest recipient of the national award for the best actor down south) ... Dhanush with his simplistic looks,so very expressive face n true act oozes life in his on screen character.. With his earthly charm,he truly has carved out a niche for himself.. The director has succeeded once again in portraying our U.P. in such beautiful colors,capturing the mood n by-lanes of the people of eastern U.P. with gr8 detail.. Complemented by the so very fresh n beautiful sonam who seems like is going to dethrone d ladies at the top!!! Look for the dhanush's friend,a kin in all weathers,his sis who truly adores the local lad and not to forget abhay... In all, the director has managed to bring out the potential in every actor and has given the viewer some meaningful work.. Worth mentioning are the dialogues too which will both make u both laugh and give something to think about,kudos man.... and the soulful tunes to laud the effort by d Mozart from chennai ... worth a 2nd watch, meaningful one sided love story.... Majestic.."

Now a days when people talk about first half and second half which doesn't matter according to me. Story has all the elements be it fun, romance, drama and it has a classic desi Indian touch with it because movie is based in varansi which gives it a flavor with its crispy language, people, ethnicity. Its pleasure to watch reality in the movie when all the movies releasing are masala shits.\n\n2> If music is given by A.R. Rahman there is no point talking about it. Mucic was flowing like butter.\n\n3> Performances are best like characters are meant for them. Dhanush is awesome in his performance. He is a delight to watch. The way he delivers his dialogues is super cool and his accent has a roughness and his south Indian accent doesn't interferes with his Hindi accent. Sonam looks sober and does her part with full conviction, Supporting cast especially Kundan's friend \"Murari\" is fun to watch.\n\n4> Dialogues has everything from catchphrases, roughness to desi gaaliyan of UP.\n\nOverall, it is a very good film after such a long time as we don't come across these days in bollywood :)"

Well, I was still blown over by the movie or should I say DHANUSH! Ranjhanaa is based on a topic that is so far reaching and yet is that much more realistic! Every scene is delicately handled and the emotional parts were so subtle.Everyone in the screen just melted away and got hazy when Dhanush was in it. He makes you laugh, cry, hate him, and sympathize with him at the same time. AR Rahman's music was divine and seamlessly blended with the storyline. Excellent performances by the whole cast - But Dhanush owns the movie! A definite must watch!!!"

I seriously recommend it to be watched. it has a little bit abuses which aren't suitable for a child's attention. if you are looking for a movie to watch for fun, to cry, to feel love, experience pain,i am pretty astonished about \"Dhanush\" as this was his first movie in the Bollywood and he made his mark pretty high. People it must be watched at least once, and i am very sure about going to the cinemas to see it again Enjoy, It is not something either that will get you bored during the movie. The movie has brilliant direction, acting. For me its a 11/10"

He has very easily managed to carry the entire film on his two shoulders. Not an easy task, but he has done it. Reason? His immense talent and experience. Not once did I feel bored watching him act flawlessly. Sonam Kapoor is another surprise package of this movie. She has also acted very well. If she wants to be taken seriously as an actor, she must do roles with meat like the one in this movie. Abhay Deol has a guest appearance which he has performed well as expected. I was sceptical about this movie but was I surprised! I am glad I went and watched this movie in a theatre. Money well spent I must say. I wont give away anything about the story in my review. I'll just say, please go and watch the movie in a theatre. And last but not the least, I want to say, \"Well done Dhanush, Welcome to Hindi Film Industry!\"."

Music by Sir A.R Rehman which has got the divine power in itself. Good story and Brilliant acting, Specially by this Tamil guy \"DHANUSH\" what a great actor he is I must say.. The way he has delivered every dialogues is just mind blowing. His face expressions, his body language and his emotions at some parts of the movie is so real that it makes you feel touched.\n\nI would say, if you haven't watched this movie yet then you're missing out big time. This movie is worth a watch. specially if you like Romantic or drama movies then this is the one movie for you! I would rate this movie 10/10 and I mean it.. just cause of \"DHANUSH\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Raanjhanaa, what can I say about the film!! As an avid film buff I have compel to write this bollywood movie review. It's an unique movie, so bollywood but so unique and refreshing! It is a definitive multi-layered story woven beautifully with a great but complex script.\n\nScript is complex, multi-layered but transparent to viewer. It starts from boy meets girl and narrates philosophy, dedication, progression of life with love. And how it turns to an unique love story that should not be missed.\n\nThe editing is very good at first half, but it should be more stringent in the second half. Cinematography is marvelous, Baranasi can be this beautiful? then you have to watch it.\n\nSongs and lyrics woven beautifully in the story. You can not side-line the songs and watch the movie; it is practically lyrical story. AR Rehman creates a blend of true Indian flavored music here.\n\nDialogues are also playing a crucial part in the film. From witty to clich\u00e9, from orthodox to unorthodox, it varies and triumphs.\n\nWhen you are seeing the acting of the film, Dhanush has really become Kundan. Dhanush never existed in this film, only Kundan has. That should sum up the acting depth infused in the film as Kundan. Welcome Dhanush to bollywood. Sonam is beautiful and well enacted the role. She is more compelling towards ending of the film.\n\nAnother advantage director uses in his film that is supporting actors. Special mention to Murari(Kundan's friend) and Bindiya. Both have the best one-liners of the film and their acting was just apt. Abhay Deol is also good.\n\nDirector Mr. Rai presents you a story with great attributes. Celebrate, cheers, empathizes and of course fall in love....with a bit of sacrifice.....Raanjhanaa !!!"

Having said that, this is a highly entertaining paisaa vasool venture with substance. Kudos to the writer and director who gave us the soulful Tanu weds Manu but this time he sets his mark higher.\n\nThe movie takes you on journey with Kundan who is brilliantly plated by Dhanush right from his school days in Banaras to his ultimate destiny. Its very hard not to feel for the guy and cheer him,laugh with him, feel with him and it definitely makes one nostalgic and teary eyed at the same time.\n\nThere are many amazing sequences in the film which are so realistic that you can really feel the main man crying,smiling,puking at various stages of the movie.His transformation from a school boy with a crush, through a youth with stubble and only one real goal in life, to an atonement seeking person is palpable.\n\nMind you though its made to be a love story it almost never gets into stereotypes or clich\u00e9s and keeps us on the edge of the seat with its thrilling twists throughout the course.\n\nOf course the main character is aided by a wonderful support cast from his friend Murari who gets the best one-liners, his childhood girlfriend, Abhay deol who plays his role with ease and surprisingly Sonam Kapoor who has dared to do something different & succeeded.\n\nBut the movies greatest strength is Dhanush who can make you cheer for him even when he's slashing his wrist, or riding is love into the river when he realizes she in love with somebody else.\n\nOn the flip side his role as a political leader seems over stretched after the racy 1st half and some of the actions of the lead female towards the end are not understandable.\n\nAll in all if you want to watch desi realistic love story with raw human emotions and unpolished drama here's your chance. Don't miss it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Raanjhanaa, director Anand L Rai returns to familiar territory of unrequited love which he'd explored with some success in his previous movie Tanu weds Manu. As with that movie, this movie also set in the Hindu heartland, in this case, a vivid & colorful Benares. Here too, the hero played by Dhanush falls head over heels for the lady Sonam Kapoor.\n\nDhanush plays Kundan, a Tamil Brahmin born & brought up in Benares whose ancestors had moved to be priests in a local temple. As a boy, he comes upon Zoya, the daughter of an affluent Muslim professor and it is eternal love at first sight for him. After several years of persistent pursuit, nay stalking, umpteen slaps and a slashed wrist, Zoya finally relents and reciprocates only to find the age old cliche of differing religions being raised and her parents pack her off to study at Aligarh initially & therafter, at JNU. While at JNU, she falls in love with the idealist student leader Abhay Deol. However, Kundan remains obsessed with his love for her and awaits her return and when she returns, he is devastated to know that she has not only forgotten about him, but is also in love with someone else.\n\nThe first hour of the movie sails through smoothly with many a light moment set in the earthy & colorful milieu of Benares capturing the city in all its rustic charm. However, as soon as the movie moves out of the Benares to Delhi & beyond and tries to dabble in issues such as campus politics and hot social issues in news, the narrative feels contrived & comes unstuck.\n\nDespite its several flaws, the movie remains eminently watchable for its positives. For one, Rai has made this movie with lot of heart and national award winning actor Dhanush, making his Bollywood debut, has given a sparkling performance and has carried the movie through on his slender, yet very able shoulders. Sonam Kapoor looks good and has an elegant screen presence, but still has a some way to go in terms of performance especially in the more emotional scenes. The leads are ably supported by the stellar cameos by Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub as Kundan's best friend Murari and Swara Bhaskar as Bindiya, Kundan's childhood friend who eternally pines for him. The movie benefits to a great measure from A.R. Rahman's music which blends nicely with the proceedings and some splendid cinematography which captures the city of Benares in all its colourful glory."

        "review_detailed_main": "At last done with Raanjhaana (2013)\u0085In the end it cannot be considered as typical bollywood clich\u00e9 love story. Story writer's non-communal thought has been strongly reflected in this film. In past days race, religion was noted as major facts and were responsible for creating discrimination but as day passed thinking of human about race and religion may have changed but human race is still keeping this discrimination alive by creating some boundaries of educational qualification, status and financial stability, which is too tough to break, who knows nearly impossible even with extreme love and passion.\n\nThe interesting part of this film perhaps starts from the point where \"Shiba's\" incognito boy Kundan falls in love with zoya while she was praying. Kundan's character here noticeably resembles Ranjha's character in myth. Here Kundan is the son of Hindu scholar on the other hand zoya belongs from an educated, middle-class family. But as the movie tends towards conclusion, it is not the religion that stands as obstacle rather it is the intellectual difference between them that does. But in the end they overcome those obstacles with love. So here in the end it is love that makes a triumphant journey and smiles over the cloud of dismay. First part of this movie was shot in \"Banaras\" which tints viewer with the color of \"Holy\" and love and gives viewer a flavor of teen-age immature emotion. But the story of the first part was not only limited to masochistic love. A love that bloomed in Banaras has taken political turn into Delhi which gave this movie a new dimension. In the mean time we get acquainted with rising teen-age thought and filthy power politics. Director immaculately presented some current affairs of Delhi. Here, we must give director some credit that he has depicted so many issues but the taste of this film remained unharmed. No matter how much we try to run away from politics but we have to accept this ugly truth that this very politics somehow control our lives, this very truth is finely depicted here. Another interesting part of this movie is every character here is too much stubborn. Each and every person is crazy at their point and unwilling to compromise. They are ready to leave their race, religion, city even their standards for the sake of love. In this film character of Sonam Kapoor might seem offensive for a little while but this feeling will start to diminish as the movie proceeds. In the ending part of the movie Ananda tells Kundan \"There are two types of leader\" , one that find peace by abolishing the government and another do find peace by establishing it.\" In practical life second one is very rare. But one thing has been clarified that if we need to unify all labor class people, first we need to understand their emotion rather than Marx, Angles and so on. But becoming politically influenced suddenly which occurred to Kundan in this film was not at all realistic. Dhanush played tremendously in this film, and 100% fit for this character. A tremendous bollywood debut for Dhanush , no doubt. Avay Deol though seemed little bit aged but not bad as a political leader. He has shown greater promise within a very small margin of time. Though Sonam couldn't always keep rhythm with Dhanush and delivery of her dialogue often lackluster but comparing with her other films definitely she has made progress. Bindia and Murari both characters were splendid throughout the film. Another thing is praiseworthy about this movie that it produced some brilliant dialogues which are really heart touching. Music of A.R Rahman was brilliant as usual (one wouldn't dare to judge, neither would I). Music was very relevant to the city and characters and changes according to the scenes and character. Local music of Banaras has really touched the heart. And Irshad Kamil definitely deserves some credit for his brilliant lyrics. The song \"Tum Tak\" in the starting of the movie clearly and finely depicts the character of Dhanush. Depiction of songs and cinematography was also very distinctive and praiseworthy. To love something or someone and destroyed by it completely (Fanaa) is the life's truer eminence, the movie pretty much ends with this concept .\n\nReview By Faiad Iftikhar Rafee Dhaka,Bangladeh . fb.me/iamrafee"

The story is complicated yet transparent, one that you may be inclined to feel judgemental about but one that you'll see from different perspective.\n\nAfter the flavour blend in the Kanpur for Tanu Weds Manu, Rai extends his ambitious to introduce the majestic of Varanasi city in this movie with a great blend of love story and moreover, since the film revolves around locals, it doesn't make sense to capture the visuals like some wide-eyed tourist. But the playful hues of Holi and a generally colourful palette that defines the city of temples fills the frames for most part till the story shifts to misty winters in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University campus.

        "review_title": "Perfect example of how a novel love story angle gets diluted in the overstuffed execution on screen.",
        "review_detailed_main": "After so many memorable films made in this particular genre, coming up with a new impressive angle in a love story is quite impossible as it seems in Hindi Cinema. But surprisingly RAANJHANAA makes that difficult breakthrough in its offered content and the film surely scores its main brownie points for this very reason alone, unarguably.\n\nIts basic storyline has many important twists and turns coming every half an hour which also might (partially) remind you of films such as MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION (1954), KINARA (1977) & TUM BIN (2001). The film starts impressively from the childhood and then enters the adolescence age quickly where the boy gets slapped repeatedly by the girl in a very weird manner. After a brief meeting revealing their identities, the religion factor of Hindu-Muslim comes in and then both get separated as the girl goes to another town for higher studies. Meanwhile an incident of the boy cutting his wrist is also there which the girl easily forgets as she returns back to the town after a few years. Now this whole premise of the boy's one sided love is both cute and interesting and Dhanush's innocent portrayal of his true to life character is another reason that this initial hour keeps you hooked on to the screen with all its love, drama and songs.\n\nBut actually, there are too many absurdities and unconvincing liberties in the script, which don't let you fall in love with their characters completely. To be precise, in a traditional city like Banaras, a young School Girl slapping a Romeo boy several times (right in the middle of the road), not causing any panic in the people around was quite unbelievable. Secondly as the boy and girl meet for the first time, a young girl of 9th standard (coming from a conservative Muslim family) straight away putting her hand in the boy's open shirt to find his \"Jenau\" was again highly absurd for me and strongly disgraceful too. Thirdly, it was really funny to see that the girl, returning to the town just after 3-4 years is simply not able to recognize the same boy who had slit his wrist only for her when she was in the 9th standard.\n\nThankfully, just when the boy-girl love angle starts becoming monotonous, comes Abhay Deol to save the film, but then he also falls in the same trap of absurdity in the next few scenes. Now the highly weird scenes featuring Abhay Deol includes the one wherein a sudden kiss on the cheek is given by the girl right in the middle of the campus (a girl who comes from a traditional Muslim family of Banaras). And why she kisses all of a sudden? That's because she strongly wishes to prove her point that all people are not equal on this earth and some are special. Next the girl's Muslim family members of Banaras who are very particular about the religion, make no investigation about the boy, ask nothing about his family background and have no questions to ask before announcing the marriage of their beautiful daughter to him in a hurry.\n\nHowever, this is where we have the major novel twist in the plot which also gets lost as the story moves further and the director misses to use the factor of guilt, love and emotion in it in the later part of his film. But wait the 'Memory Loss' absurdity re-surfaces once again here when Dhanush forgets to attend his own marriage after getting dressed for it in the tailor shop and so does his dear friend who was most interested in getting him married in order to get out of this silly love-mess.\n\nPost intermission, we have another shocking twist and then suddenly the love story takes a major, social political turn bringing in the 'Safdar Hashmi' element into its execution. Now we have our lead characters fighting for the common man, cleaning the roads and even contesting for the elections. In short, keeping the absurdities aside, it's the first half of the film which makes an impression but the second half pulls it down completely giving it a political angle unnecessarily. Too many unrelated subplots inserted post interval, dilute the overall impact of its fine love story and the viewer loses the interest once the film crosses its desired length.\n\nLooking from a brighter angle, cinematography plays a major role in making an impression capturing the local ambiance of the city beautifully and the dialogues make their presence felt in few enjoyable scenes. But the music (including the background score) turns out to be a quite less than expected from the maestro A. R. Rahman, except \"Aisey To Na Dekho\".\n\nPerformance wise, the film totally belongs to Dhanush, who makes a strong impact as an actor particularly in the second half. He wins over the viewer first with his innocence and later with his acting skill in the final hour of the film quite strongly. Sonam emotes well, yet I couldn't find anything new in her act honestly. Abhay Deol once again delivers what is required from him in a small special appearance. But why he accepted such kind of miniscule role remains a mystery. In reality, it's the supporting cast here which makes a more important contribution, wherein both Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub and Swara Bhaskar are truly brilliant as Dhanush's childhood friends. Plus Kumud Mishra, Vipin Sharma and Sujata Kumar simply excel in their few but important scenes in the first half.\n\nIn all, focusing only on its core issue of a one sided love, its mistakes and the guilt factor, RAANJHANAA could have reached a different level altogether in this particular genre. But in its present avatar it just remains an above average love saga with a difference. And you can watch it once just for Dhanush's sincere act to say the actual truth."

Its interesting, entertaining & heart-warming. Certainly, A Winner!\n\n'Raanjhanaa' Synopsis: A boy falls in love with a girl & follows her in every step of her life.\n\n'Raanjhanaa' begins brilliantly. The protagonist, Kundan, played delightfully well by Dhanush, is a hero to root for, because his journey is full of surprises. The first-hour is humorous & has a certain tenderness to it. The second-hour, on the other-hand, is intense & a bit depressing. Himanshu Sharma's Screenplay is Well-Written & doesn't end up being clich\u00e9d, which is its biggest asset. Though, The Writing dips considerably in its intense second-hour, it never really bores. But yes, a better second-hour would've only enhanced the film's overall impact.\n\nAnand L. Rai's Direction is skilled. The filmmaker has handled the light as the as well as the intense moments, with dexterity. Cinematography captures the rustic look well. Editing is fair. Music by A.R Rahman is super, as always.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Dhanush is delightful as Kundan. He's an unlikely hero, but his performance from start to end, makes him an endearing & memorable hero. Sonam Kapoor plays her part effectively, although her dialogue delivery seems flat at times. Abhay Deol is flattering in a cameo. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub & Swara Bhaskar are mesmeric in strong supporting roles. They contribute enormously in the goings-on.\n\nOn the whole, 'Raanjhanaa' is a pleasant surprise, that entertains efficiently. Go For It!"

During the 140 min run time, I felt at some point this connects to an extent, with the stories we heard, have seen and experienced. Especially the Banaras, Lucknow touch, it made me fell for the movie. I did remember the first of the firsts meeting during the Raanjhaana and yes music is awesome. Especially the title track and Tum tak... This was my first movie in a theater after the heartbreak (lol) but it turned out to be a memorable one."

The guy was blabbering about the unsound mind and immaturity of Dhanush in his whole review but we all loved Dhanush more than any other actor in this movie. I bet you can't expect a movie like this one in hundred more years from Bollywood..... My love for this movie can also be judged by the fact that i have written only one review so far.

And when you come out of the movie, you feel sort of a limbo. I came out thrilled.\n\nDhanush has delivered an amazing performance. Though he falls out of the line in the current generation of the \"Macho\" Bollywood Hero, he depicts a very common man, his thinking, and his decisions. Sonam looks gorgeous, and gives an laudable performance. Abhay and Mohammad are spot-on too. A.R Rehman gives an outstanding feel.\n\nAlthough there are a couple of scenes, which you don't understand why are present. But - for me- that was OK.\n\nWatch it if you were in love.

Now you've got to love that. The film does have its flaws and the director makes some factual and continuity errors in his narrative. But all of this can be forgiven when a story of this intense simplicity comes along, which splatters a smile across your face from the get go; tugs at your heart strings for a major part, and finally wrenches your heart out towards the end.\n\nIn actuality, the real contributors of \"Raanjhanaa\" are its beautiful script and Dhanush's effortlessly endearing portrayal. The National Award winning actor enacts his character as a quirky, innocent, dreamy, raw, and passionate simpleton all rolled into one in the most sublime manner. His effort certainly merits a nomination if not a win at most of the major award functions this year. This is one southern star to look forward to in Hindi cinema."

Well as a pro-movie buff I believe to think I am, I liked it, at the same time it became clear to me that this film is layered. So, it would be fun to watch it after a long pause.\n\nThat pause finally ended, tonight, and I am writing this review moments after I finished it.\n\nWell, I am quite exhausted. I don't want to consider the success of a passionate love story, or any story with passion at its heart, by the amount of joy or tears it brings to the spectator, rather I want to see what the story teller intended to say. And whether I, as an audience, am able to take it or appreciate it or not. Anand L Rai already proved his story telling weaving ability and made a sacred place for himself for his utterly unique style.\n\nSo yeah, I was not amazed that during this second viewing of mine, I was getting the things he wanted to tell. I got blown away with the presence of some moments, moments I believe he desperately wanted to tell. I shall give just one example of that. It is the last scene of the movie where from the background Kundan says his monologue, 'I could have got awake, but for whose sake?.....Who the hell gets awake. . . .the mood is just not right to wake up.....it's better to remain asleep'\n\nThis moment told me the drive the storyteller kept in him till the end of his movie making journey. It must have been an unimaginable bliss for a film maker to be able to express a thing to his audience who finally got it. Doesn't matter if in the second viewing, doesn't matter at all.\n\nI really don't know when's the next time a crazy guy like Anand L Rai would have an insane story like this to give Mr. A R Rahman, where he would compose things like. . .'don't give a stare like this, as if you've never seen me'....\n\nStill got it? It comes at the end!!"

The storyline gets diverted from a very nice build up in the first half to stale \"bhrastachar - politics\" in the second half, which was not at all required in such kind of romantic movie with communal set-up. Director wanted to give everything on one platter i.e., Khichdi, Chicken, Sambhar, Makke di roti etc etc...and that is why the film lacks in totality. AR Rahman's music, as a whole, is just OK.

Also it was a strong lesson for the people who judge people by their looks only and not by their talents. Many recent bollywood stars would would have considered them privileged if they would have been even half an actor as this young guy. The movie started with the backdrop of Benaras, a city which has its own mesmerizing charm. The simple humorous love story becomes complicated as the time progresses and you understand love and passion is not all about dancing around trees in the exotic foreign locations, it can be very very cruel, full of betrayal too. Sonam also has acted well, so are the side actors - in fact few great performances along with good storyline is the heart of the movie . A. R. Rehman's music was really good. so are few songs. This movie is an honest attempt to rediscover complicated human relationship, portrays our own Indian locations beautifully, experiments successfully with unusual casts, Go and Watch! 8/10 - VERY GOOD!"

The music and score are both highly resonating with the mood and the narration. The music is an pivotal part of the movie and it's quiet impressive.\nWhat did not work:\nscreenplay; the run time could have been cut down by cutting down some of the scenes regarding politics. The movie somehow diverts from the main agenda of the movie for a while, then quickly gets back in track. If the movie had not diverted itself, it could have been an exceptional watch. It's a concern but not a complain. Those scenes are watchable.\nFinal verdict:highly recommended"

I am surprised to figure out that the promotional efforts of this movie were really bad. Despite of this fact, it came out to be an entertaining movie and people are now talking about this movie. Dhanush has acted really well, initially I was skeptical about him but he has done really good job playing a Banarsi guy. Sonam Kapoor also justified her role in all senses.\n\nI was pretty impressed by side actors performances as well. Both Swara Bhaskar (I am a fan of hers) and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub have added to the success of the movie.\n\nIn short, it was time well spent watching it and I totally recommend this movie. Happy to see that Bollywood still comes up with different movies which have good story, acting and screenplay.. and in the end they are entertaining too."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is not often I go watching Hindi movies on the recommendation of some FB users and I did it this time. My expectations were as such low but the film brought it to abyss. While the story is hailed as a love story (poor Hindu boy - rich Muslim girl), the plot and the overall story line hardly holds. There are so many cultural inconsistencies (well! what are expecting from a Bollywood movie, but come on!).\n\nFirstly, we have this boy who has this fascination with this Muslim girl and he stalks her. Well, I don't know if the directors have heard of '1000 Indian brother' issue. You follow a girl and the girl complains and suddenly you have 1000 brothers of that girl appearing from nowhere who will beat you to... Ahh well! to a Bollywood hero nothing of such things happen, do they?\n\nSecondly, the boy stops the girl wherever he wishes and does mostly unacceptable gestures throughout. You have cases wherein a foreign couple kissing in public gets USD 500 fine and face nearly six months in jail and here you have our hero going through it all without any consequences. Rather, the girl seem to enjoy them in retrospect. Pheww!\n\nThirdly, the boy actually does some minion tasks for the rich family (to stay close to the girl). In a society where hierarchies and caste systems are so prevalent (and that too cross-religious ones), the poor boy convinces the rich girl's dad to get her to be married to the other bloke. Ohh yea! Ask any Indian if they will ever listen to someone who is so low in the hierarchy for any opinion on anything at all.\n\nFourthly, the boy due to certain interesting 'Jugaad' (settings) gets to become the head of this political party. That was like not just laughable but overall crap-de-la-crap. Anyone involved even remotely would know how does it work and what kind of financial muscle is required for operating and leading a political party (even an upcoming one) and being a contender for a seat, who are kidding here?\n\nOverall, else than some lovely music which flows through and some interesting dialogues (many not watch-able with family), it is just plain rubbish!"

Sonam Kapoor has stepped down from being a debonair to one of the aficionado in acting.She has greatly improved in acting and her acting career seems to get a lot of hope from this. Dhanush seems to have given his best and his accent never proved a barrier for him. Dhanush's friend Murari plays the role of a typical guy from UP and never fails to amaze the audience with his humor and wit even at the serious scenes.The Writer has given sufficient time for the development of each of the characters plot and the actors have executed them well with a good performance. Music By A.R Rahman never fails to soothe your ear-Overall a great entertainer with a taste of present political masala.A must watch for those to whom abuses are not the thing that worries them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like everyone else I was apprehensive about watching this one mainly for the lack of powerful star cast but after hearing many positive reviews I went to see the movie and I'm glad I did. I gave it a 10/10 because firstly it does what hardly any other bollywood film has done lately i.e. present real,flawed characters with whom you can connect and empathize. While most of the other films have heroes who can make 20 bodies fly in the air with their slightest of touches, this film has a more genuine hero. A common man who looks like sh*t and is madly in love with a girl for 10 years. The main USP of the film is its dialogues. The dialogues of Murari (dhanush's friend) will make you jump from your seat and fill the theater with whistles and claps. The first part of the movie is a warm story of persistence and love and is full of vigor and energy. Dhanush plays the role easily with charm and flair. The second part of the movie is about a man searching for redemption and may not be as funny or vigorous but is still heart warming and intense. So watch it for the excellent performances by the actors, for the best dialogues that u'll ever hear in a Hindi movie and for the refreshing and original story that is hardly portrayed by bollywood"

I never understood love stories before but after Raanjhanaa i feel like now i am ready to watch other Indian love stories. The director Anand l rai is future of Hindi romance and if he makes one more Raanjhanaa he will be face of Romance. Raanjhanaa connects with all. Kai po che has a ultimate competition with Raanjhanaa now in award season and if Raanjanaa does not win best picture award then there will be strike in India because if it was made in English then It would have won Oscar hands down. Now in last line i am giving Raanjhanaa a huge honor by declaring it one of my favorite films after Batman Trilogy 3 idiots and Swades and if a director makes a sequel of it then it would surely number two on this list and Shahrukh Khan after ruling 2 3 decades the face of Hindi and World romance beware your competition Dhanush is here"

They says 'Love is Blind'....the movie shows that love when blind has no boundaries and cannot differentiate between good and bad.\n\nThe movie starts off well, loses steam in the 2nd half but the ending is tragic but brilliant. The writing and dialogues is poetic and spices up the film.\n\nPerformances by the leads is outstanding especially Dhanush. Dhanush proves that language is not a barrier for any actor and excels in his Hindi debut. You feel his emotions . Sonam puts a good performance especially in the last 15 mins ans proves that she can act. Special mention to Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub & Swara Bhaskar who play Dhanush's childhood friends.\n\nExcept for the half hour in the 2nd half where the movie meanders, its a excellent movie and a must watch !!"

But thanks to so much drama and twists in the second half, it indeed seemed 'Unconventional' yet heart-throbbing. An intense plot supported by great acting from the cast. Dhanush, no words to praise, proves he is one for Bollywood too. No one other than Dhanush could have done the role so fittingly well. Have never seen a Sonam Kapoor movie before, but she did her role so beautifully! And Thalaivar A.R. Rahman was it his very best again with such wonderful music. Typical family audience and commercial moviegoers won't love this movie.Cheers to the director for making a neat and exceptional movie without any irrelevant masala or usual Bollywood love scenes (if you know what I mean). 10/10!!"

The dialogs have been penned down logically, they all sound convincing and thereby, end up making the scenes and the characters look impressionable. Anand L. Rai's direction is an added boon for the film, paired with the flawless storyline.

Dhanush is simply mind-blowing and might I add , he is on way to becoming one of the biggest stars in Bollywood. His has played his character with aplomb . Sonam Kapoor is in the league of her own . She has a come a long way from the days of acting in crappy movies like Players. Ditto for every star cast in the movie. Music is good, though falling short of AR RAHMAN's standard."

Kudos to the maestro for his hard work.\n\nIf some more work had been done on the second half's script or adding some element to those politics portions in the script Raanjhanaa would have been a great movie.It just makes you feel dull whereas in the first half it is so much fun.\n\nWatch it for Dhanush,A R Rahman's Music,Dialogues and lastly Banaras."

Situation makes Kundan(Dhanush,) a Crazy Lover of Zoya(Sonam) from his first sight when he was not more than 10 yr old. Love expression was Crazy Like 90s style. Where a lover-boy doesn't know why does he love someone. Heer Ranjha kind of story in Banarash Style and a man always dies Coz of stupidity of girl.and don't forget previous movies where actress names were Zoya. Dhanush was very good and I didn't noticed that He looks like Brother of Riksawala good thing there were stories in between songs A.R Rehman music. 7.5/10 stars."

Not that it is perfect, but surely a mesmerizing watch. What's good? Film sparkles in acting department and cinematography (and I don't need to write about the background score or music). Dhanush is fab as an unusual lover boy. Even Sonam Kapoor went out of her wooden frame to support the entire cast, which did a good job. A little bit of political drama could have been averted, but that is director's vision. It did not do much harm to the love story anyway but cut out on time. Watch it out for Benaras, witty dialog's, Dhanush and Rahman. Recommended for each age group. Enjoy the movie. And yes, to those, who hated it, that must be because it doesn't match your taste. Maybe you are a Sallu fan. :D"

Yesterday I watched this movie on it's TV premiere and i was spellbound, for a single second I could not find any actor Kundan (Dhanush), Zoya (Sonam, Bindiya (Swara Bhaskar) and Murari (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) they looked like typical Banarasi and they took this movie to another level. Story is always a base of any film and this film delivers, except few scenes in second half you cannot pinpoint on anything, screenplay, dialogues, acting, excellent. one-liner was highlight of this film and most of them you can find in the gallis of Banaras. If Dhanush ruled the first half as innocent lover, Sonam Kapoor was awesome in second half. overall I will count this movie as one of the finest work of Hindi Cinema. Hats off to it's Director Mr. Anand Rai, I give it 9 out of 10 for a complete film."

Raanjhana showcases how a person lives and dies each day only to make someone happy for the rest of life.\n\nRaanjhana is a journey of free-spirited Kundan who searches for love in young and vibrant Zoya from holy and religious place of Banaras to political environment of Delhi University.\n\nFrom the director of Tanu Weds Manu , Anand Rai L goes one step further in Raanjhana and gives you a sensational film. The plot is a simple love story but it is the handling of subject with aplomb and sensational performance by Dhanush which makes the film watchable. The movie begins in flashback mode narrating the story from childhood and is fun to watch. It is Dhanush who keeps you glued to the screen with comic timings. The 2nd half drags a bit when the focus shifts to Delhi but is compensated by powerful climax. Hats off to Anand R. Lai for choosing South Superstar Dhanush in a very different role. The screenplay is like roller-coaster with highs and lows . Editing could have been better. Art direction is superb. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogues are witty. Dhanush is the show stealer with splendid performance. The actor is simply mind-blowing and should walk away with lot of acclodes. Sonam Kapoor lends good support to him along with Abhay Deol. Music by A.R.Rahman gels well with the film.\n\nOverall , Raanjhana is sparkling , elegant and colorful. Watch it for Dhanush and you will understand what I am trying to say. Excellent 3.5/5"

The story is quite different from the usual bollywood love story angle and the orther aspects of the film with twists and turns made it enjoyable because it was so atypical. Sonam did a very good job especially considering her character being so emotionally deep. Sometimes she was annoying but perhaps that was the nature of her character in some ways so it wasn't a turn off. The music was fantastic as A.R.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a slow poison. It grows on you more and more with time and with every watch, as the nuances start seeping into you. Where the film succeeds most is in bringing out that throbbing, pulsating, vibrant, poignant feel of a small town India, that naivety of youth, that hotheadedness of our college days. It brings out that belief we all had in our first youth- that we can fight corruption and make the world a better place to live in. That we can win our heart's love. As we grow older, our optimism decreases and so does our faith in humanity. But that doesn't make our youthful silliness any less true. It is a tale of those days of our life when we first get to know \"ki saala dil na left mein hota hai na right mein-centre mein hota hai\"because that is where it pains. The tale unfolds a young Kundan's infatuation with Zoya. A girl from a different station in life. She is flighty and lives in the moment. She is aware of her charms and uses them throughout to get her end. What she doesn't realize is she's playing with fire when treating emotions so irresponsibly. Dhanush, as Kundan, surpasses all expectations. He plays a 16 year old as convincingly as a 25 year old. His naivety, his growing up, his pain, his passions show so clearly on his face that you remain awestruck. He is one of the strongest actors around. Sonam does a commendable performance as the flighty Zoya, but fails miserably in the second half as a politically conscious student. Murari and Bindya are gems as supporting actors. The music by ARR is haunting and you'll find yourself humming to most of them. The editing in the second half is the only downer in the movie. The cinematography will make you long for going to Benaras. It is magic.\n\nOverall, it is a tale that will bring you closer to your youthful fantasies and pain and that India which throbs and pulsates with soul."

        "review_title": "A painstaking pursuit of love",
        "review_detailed_main": "In the hinterlands of the country, Love is still unabashed, heartfelt and mostly tends to begin as one-sided. As the boy devotes himself to the girl at first sight, his life centers around the charming crush that wouldn't last much longer because either the family or politics would intervene. Yet, in the colorful and vivacious town of Benaras unfolds one such childhood crush that grows into a painstaking pursuit of love. National award winner, Dhanush, plays the innocent and impulsive Kundan while Sonam Kapoor, in one of her most impressive performances is Zoya. Director Aanand Raj ('Tanu weds Manu') infuses a small town love story with several twists and a political angle to raise the stakes of lovers and haters alike.\n\nKundan's persistent, at times wacky approach to woo Zoya leads to multiple slaps but eventually, the fondness grows while they are barely in high school. But of course, this wasn't acceptable by Zoya's parents and she is thus sent out of the city to study, leaving Kundan and his promises of timeless love. Upon her return to Benaras years later, she takes a while to recognize Kundan, who is now a handyman at her family home. Kundan's love for her is still only his to keep and not to share as Zoya found her soulmate in Akram/Jasjeet (Abhay Deol). As an idealist leader in the J.N. University, Abhay Deol's convincing portrayal is briefly interrupted by Kundan's foolhardy decision. Dejected and rejected, Kundan finds no solace for himself until he indirectly gets involved in Jasjeet's political movement which is now spearheaded by Zoya. Kundan's pure intentions, upfront attitude and outspoken confidence garner faith from his comrades but not from the one he yet loves. Through a series of twists in the story, writer Himanshu Sharma challenges Kundan's dedicated love and Raanjhanaa is a tale of its triumph.\n\nWith his pure intentions, unabashed dialogues and simpleton charm, Kundan makes us take his side in the story even though the writer and director frequently challenge his impulsive and immature decisions. The credit has to go to the National award winner Dhanush, who is a departure from the heroes of Bollywood. Yet there is some innocence and sincerity in him that is undeniable. Take his dancing as an example. No Hindi film actor would dance vigorously but that is precisely Dhanush's unique charm that works in this film. Even though his dialogues might come out unabashed, he is effective in standing his ground with his delivery. Dhanush joins the ranks of Mahadevan and Siddharth among a few others who leave a great impression for their Hindi film debut. Sonam Kapoor has a stronger character compared to her previous roles. She does well in holding her own especially in the second half. While she looks beautiful as a small town girl in the song and dance of the first half, her versatility shows in the parts when she leads a group of rebellious young thinkers. Abhay Deol has a brief yet prominent role that changes the course of the one-sided love story. At times, we wish for his commanding character to have shades of his oldest brother but that might be too much to ask for. The rest of the supporting cast is fresh and their natural acting does lend to the film's realistic feeling.\n\nA.R.Rahman's music isn't the finest he has produced. Tum tak sounds like it wasn't composed for a Hindi film while tu man shudi is an excellent merging of two very talented artists, Rahman himself and Rabbi Shergill. Raanjhanaa might remain the most memorable track through with its melody and image of Dhanush's vivacious dancing. The rest of the music is almost forgettable and adds to the film's precious length.\n\nAanand Raj enriches this simple love story using plot twists as its main attraction. While exacting fine performances from the lead actors, he creates tragedy, sorrow, anger, joy and tenderness around love to revive the genre of soulful romantic movies. Raanjhanaa tends to be more real than a fairy tale, occasionally wavering to the extremes. Watch it for its twists, for Dhanush's sincere performance, laudable dialogues and for Sonam Kapoor's impressive portrayal of Zoya, for whom Kundan became a Raanjhanaa."

Both the stories succeeds to grip you with the beauty the film has with good performances from Dhanus, Sonam Kapoor, and Abhay Deol. However, Dhanus carries the most of the footage of the film and deserves the major credit despite the rough tough look he gets in the movie.

Now I have, to pay my gratitude to this movie. I didn't even do this for Dev.D. Now you can appreciate the gravity of the situation!\n\n'Aanand Rai' has deservedly solidified his account in Bollywood with this movie. The music is awesome and 'Tum Tak' vibrates your nerve chords to the extent of making nostalgic some of you. And another mortal adds to the list of here-to-stay-newly-added fans of 'Dhanush' from North India. RESPECT for his acting skills! You can actually feel his happiness and pain and empathize with him throughout. The first love is just like that for many.\n\nThe feel of the first part of the movie is unreal and special, amplified by pure awesome cinematography. It becomes a bit convoluted in the second half, which is responsible for reducing a point out of 10/10. But it still stands highly recommended!!"

To be fairly honest, I was left stunned watching the whole movie: the perfomances, the music, the screenplay, the dialogues, the plot twists, the climax. I have watched it 10 more times since then and it never ceases to mesmerize me every single time.\n\nThis is a fast paced movie that starts as an innocent love story of a hindu boy and a muslim girl and take turns to explore different genres like a drama, polytical satire and much more. Dhanush will remain my favorite Indian actor for the rest of my life, such was his performance in this movie. Jeesan Ayyub and Swara Bhaskar deserve special mention for their powerful performances too. All the little characters of this movie played their roles to almost perfection. I can't find too many plot holes anywhere in the movie. The castings were perfect. Perhaps no one would better suit the role Abhay Deol played. Sonam did her job alright. The music touches the heart and totally amalgamates with the movie. You would never really feel like avoding any of the songs unlike many bollwood movies where the songs are there just to be there. The masterful music of this movie brings it to life and the story keeps moving forward with the songs.\n\nOn top of all the good things like the acting, screenplay, the twists/turns, the climax left me speechless (beyond imagination); such was the power of Raanjhanaa. Only a 10 star can do justice to this movie.\n\nIf you are an audience who can appreciate and understand movies that are larger than life and are yet to experience this movie, just sit tight and watch a movie that you will remember for the rest of your life."

Raanjhana showcases how a person lives and dies each day only to make someone happy for the rest of life.\n\nThe movie takes you on journey with Kundan who is brilliantly plated by Dhanush right from his school days in Banaras to his ultimate destiny. Its very hard not to feel for the guy and cheer him, laugh with him, feel with him and it definitely makes one nostalgic and teary eyed at the same time.\n\nThere are many amazing sequences in the film which are so realistic that you can really feel the main man crying, smiling ,puking at various stages of the movie. His transformation from a school boy with a crush, through a youth with stubble and only one real goal in life, to an atonement seeking person is palpable.\n\nMind you though its made to be a love story it almost never gets into stereotypes or clich\u00e9s and keeps us on the edge of the seat with its thrilling twists throughout the course.\n\nOf course the main character is aided by a wonderful support cast from his friend Murrari who gets the best one-liners, his childhood girlfriend, Abhay Deol who plays his role with ease and surprisingly Sonam Kapoor who has dared to do something different & succeeded.\n\nBut the movies greatest strength is Dhanush who can make you cheer for him even when he's slashing his wrist, or riding is love into the river when he realizes she in love with somebody else. And the places were the shoot have done in city Benaras have its own charm with the taste of mythology and the some spice of love of two different religion.\n\nOn the flip side his role as a political leader seems over stretched after the racy 1st half and some of the actions of the lead female towards the end are not understandable.\n\nAll in all if you want to watch desi realistic love story with raw human emotions and unpolished drama here's your chance. Don't miss it!\n\nThank You."

He simply stole the show with his intense portrayal of a person driven by love, a person who does the most stupid, brave and incomprehensible of things in the name of love."

I have been waiting to see raanjhnaa for a long time and it has proved that all that waiting was worth it. Raanjhnaa is quite different from usual Bollywood romantic movies. The character development is amazing and a special mention can be made in regard of Kundan(Dhanush). The movie carries its pace and attention very well in the first half. The music matches the situation exceptionally well hats off to A.R Rehman. Apart from that the dialogs are very witty. A piece of advice don't take this movie literally ;) It has a lot to offer, just be willing to gain something n u will empathize with characters."

Dhanush proves that looks doesn't matter if you really do the justice with acting. Every character have done a great job.\n\nMovie starts with light moments and move towards the complications of love. Dialogues are well written which makes you laugh time to time and having a pure touch of Banaras. What can I say about the music. Afterall it is again A.R.

That guy takes the movie on his shoulders and carries the burden effortlessly. Muraari's timed punches keep the mood light even in sad scenes. You feel bad for Bindiya throughout the movie. The best scene in the movie is when Dhanush hugs Sonam tightly and tells her that he doesn't love her because she is beautiful, even it would have been some other girl he would have loved that girl immensely and that its nothing to do with Sonam being pretty. For rest, please go and watch the movie yourself. The climax is a big time surprise."

A Hindi movie debut for south superstar Dhanush could not have been better than this. His common man look only help his character come out to be more real and likable.\n\nRehman's Music is good and goes well with the narrative, specially the title track, Tum tak, Piya.\n\nStory is fresh, not a typical bollywood love story. The regular twist and turns keep your interest in the movie intact. The dialogues are the main hero of this movie, specially the one-liners. Kudos to Himanshu for his writing and Anand L. Rai for trying to be different.The only setback is it seems to be two different movies, pre-intreval and post-interval.Not disconnected though, the pace and the environment changes drastically post interval. Which takes a while for one to fit into the mood.\n\nOverall a must watch love story."

A very good performance given by her. She also delivered fab performance.Rest supporting cast also played well enough. Dialogues are like epic. Simply unforgettable. I would give this movie 11/10 I watched a very good movie after a long time as was tired watching crap movies from our bollywood. But this movie needs standing ovation. Everything is just too perfect. I never wrote such review for any movie . But this movie is magnificent and epic movie so cant resist myself from writing for it.

Wondering if there is anymore you can add to this steaming pile of sh!t. Music is very disappointing too. The only song worth listening to was a stolen retro song... this is not how you want to project the Indian youth or how you want Indian youth to engage in politics.

He starts by following Shahrukh pattern( expressive show of emotion and following the girl )to Vinod Mehra pattern( staying near girl and helping her silently) to woo her.\n\nFirst half is fun and moves very fast. But the second half where he follows Vinod Mehra charter of romance(being with the girl, helping her silently in whatever way possible),the romance part takes back stage but still being undertone of the new situations kundan have been thrown into because of this girl. The climax is letdown as the twist and/or the shock factor they were trying to put in, hasn't come through well, as seeing the development and behavior of the characters it was evident what's going to happen.\n\nDhanush is brilliant as lover who is crazy after the girl - Sometimes getting fooled knowingly to keep his love happy like a true blue lover and sometimes resentful and hurting her.\n\nDhanush plays the role of lover with so much passion that his act is most endearing one. Sonam looked beautiful and played the role of a girl who uses her beauty to get her work done with great innocence. Mohammad Zeeshan and Swara Bhaskar are also terrific. Abhay deol was good , though there isn't much for him to do\n\nBut all these performances are enhanced by some brilliant one liners and dialogues which look convincing and are actually hilarious makes one ROFL"

        "review_detailed_main": "Raanjhanaa is anything but clich\u00e9,unique in so different ways unlike most Bolly offerings these days.First you have an unconventional hero, who can act and look the role he is playing (He actually looks like a 9th grade student at the age of 30 as he did in \"3\"). He impressed previously in 3 or Aadakulam.He might not be as good here but his effortless act is most definitely one big reason for which the film clicks.Secondly you have a role written for a Bolly mainstream female lead which has so many shades that any actress with even decent acting skills could have made a career out of it.Sonam won't,no surprises.She looks BEAUTIFUL nevertheless.I am not sure who in India could have looked so beautiful,young and yet do justice to this fantastic role-but in case choice was necessary acting should have been preferred over looks. :( .Thirdly you have two genuine actors, playing the supporting acts and giving the best performances in the film.Not Abhay Deol (though he is good in cameo),its Md.Zeeshan Ayuub and Swara Bhaskar (she was even better in Listen Amayaa & Aurangzeb) who stays with you way more than anyone else. But the biggest positive aspect that the film delivers, are its characters.Each of them are so very real,with so many shades and flaws that you can relate.The relentless hero cursing his love being rejected,the scheming heroine spitting on the hero-Raanjhaana does have a coming of age effect working for it.It has a genuine story though the screenplay, primarily in the 2nd half fails.With a very vibrant,fast and effective 1st half ,the film suddenly looses its steam in the 2nd, trying to push itself in uncomfortable zone (read politics).With more than a few far-fetched sequences,unnecessary comic reliefs & punch lines and a stiff Sonam lingering around, Raanjhanaa loses its holds,falters.Rehman too does not help with his tunes, though the background music is pretty good.But then you often move helter skelter while trying some new road,only promising to improve in the next venture.Anand Rai does exactly so and gives a far better love-story than the clich\u00e9,bore to the core YJHD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Initially I was sceptic about this movie. I assumed a different story from the trailer. A story full of romance and clich\u00e9s. A story which was bound to have a good first half and boring second half. Well, I am right about the second half. Post interval the movie slows down very much, at times drags then after few minutes beating around the bushes it concludes with a good ending.\n\nTheme: \"The pundit's son Kundan (Dhanush) has fallen for the girl at first sight. That they're both kids makes us dismiss it as a meaningless crush. But a few years later, the boy is still in love with the girl, Zoya (Sonam Kapoor). When she's in school, he follows her around holding her hand and getting slapped in the process. Finally, she relents because of his \"consistency\". The film shifts cities when Zoya gets into JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University), and through her, we are introduced to the idealistic and political culture of the place. She discovers a long-lost strength as she confronts and then falls for student leader Abhay Deol. The film takes a turn when Zoya returns to her hometown after eight long years only to find some things changed, and others surprisingly the same\"\n\nCharacter development: This movie is stands on the shoulder of two leads Sonam as Zoya and Dhanush as Kundan. But, mainly zoya's character goes through any development. Say it mentality, expectation from life, treating situations. Dhanush kind of stops growing emotionally. Most of the time he learns that things have changed in and around Zoya and impacts him momentarily but does not change him or his mentality towards Zoya. I would say Dhanush's character in this regards does not go through much changes in the movie.\n\nDirection: The movie has a very unconventional script and putting that to frame could not have been easy but Anand Rai did a marvelous job. If only he thought about anything about post interval scenes. Dhanush is used to the fullest and he proves he's here to stay. But more praise goes to Anand Rai for bringing out a convincing performance from Sonam Kapoor. This movie won't win her any award but might help her land some good roles. And if she stick around like Deepika, she might improve. Next praise of the direction is the scene construction. There are few gems in the movie. Specially mentioned would be the gas cylinder scene, scooter into Ganges and Dhanush vomiting scene. Anand Rai got an excellent script and did a marvelous job portraying it into movie.\n\nCinematography: Cinematography is apt to the situations.\n\nActing:Dhanush is superb. This is a tailor made role from him and him only. His looks and his physique complements the movie. Then add his brilliant acting talent, the way he speaks, his body language is brilliant. People talk about chemistry between lead pairs but here Kundan(Dhanush) and Murari's chemistry surpassed everything. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Murari did a solid job and at times shadowed Dhanush. Sonam here dared to do a very tough role. Her role was the most strong role in the movie and even tougher than the Priyanka's role in Barfi. Her character goes through various changes in the movie, jealousy, love, revenge, guilt, passion everything comes into her role. We are grateful that she pulled that off somehow, else it would have been a torture to tolerate her in a movie like that. Swara Bhaskar as Bindiya did a very good job. I really liked the scenes where Murari, Kundan Bindiya fight with each other. Rest of the characters are average does not require a special mention here.\n\nSongs and background score: Only one song i.e. 'Tum Tak' I found apt to the situation rest do not contribute to the movie. I would appreciate the background score here more than actual songs.\n\nEditing: Can't have mercy on the editor for the bad second half. Few unnecessary scenes could have been avoided.\n\nEntertainment value: Till first half this movie would entertain you later you might get bored but the ending is good."

It would be your one of the best romantic movie. :)"

While there are some tinges of grey shades in the characters of the protagonists, they are not fully unjustified in their actions. The movie starts as rom-com but eventually becomes quite dark towards the end.\n\nActing wise, all the casts performed their best. The male protagonist Dhanush, who is also a national award winner, did full justice to the role that was tailor made for him. His appearance, mannerism and innocence totally made me recall \"bhaiyas\" from Uttar Pradesh. He should do more of such roles although can't say for sure if he make it in bollywood because of his thick Tamil accent. This is Sonam Kapur's best performance till date, although I would've preferred Parineeti playing this role. Abhay Deol is a charmer as usual. The music is good too, especially the \"Banarasia\" song gives the feel of bhojpuri songs. Overall, I will give it 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "A blend of malevolent passion, coupled with naive desire, Raanjhanaa tells a tale of a soul desperate for approval - seldom played or mastered by south Indian stars, specifically as a breakout role in a new language. However, Dhanush intricately weaves his craft into the role, donning a new persona as the posterized \"lover-boy\" burdened by Sonam Kapoor's lack of interest. With a powerful score orchestrated by none other than the maestro himself, A. R. Rahman picks up the films notes whenever Anand L. Rai falters. Nonetheless, Rai's directorship simply embodies his talent: boundless.\n\nA brisk start with a gripping, bubbly, and at times heart-wrenching performance from its supporting cast (you didn't seriously think Abhay Deol would disappoint?), Rai uses his talented cast to deconstruct masala-esque themes and dismantle the heavily leaned-upon pillars of Bollywood's (and at time Kollywood's) rom-com tropes. Of course, he brilliantly interlinks comedic elements, and no amount of praise can hope to accommodate Dhanush's powerhouse performance.\n\nWhile the cast, the characters, and the themes hold up a lengthy 2 and a half hour runtime, one must ask themselves: \"was it justified?\" A brilliant film that I certainly would dub a masterpiece had I only watched the first 40 and last 40 minutes; it's auteur lacks one thing: conciseness. My only negative remarks would include the unfortunate feeling of a piece of gum that'd been over-chewed - it simply lost its flavour over the course of time. As many films undergo a thorough editing process, perhaps Rai could've left a couple more scenes on the cutting room floor, but luckily for the director, Rahman tugs at our heartstrings, and pulls us through these drab 20 minutes in the middle with herculean strength.\n\nOverall, Raanjhanaa is a film that I consider to be fantastic, and a definite watch for anyone."

He makes the pursuit of a lover to be loved funnier, pure and honest than anyone else ever. Sonam is charming and even with few flaws, she and Dhanush make up for a wonderful pair. Raanjhanaa is not one of the best love stories captured through celluloid, but it certainly is one of the finest performances by a lead pair in a love story. Even better than SRK and Kajol in the over hyped \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\". Yeah, I said it but that's the truth. I don't say this because I'm a south India nor I personally like Dhanush. I mean I do like him in some films but I'm not his fan boy."

Director Aanand Rai has handled this tough-bit complex-fusion script so easily that you won't find any fault and the movie is easy going. The team of Tanu Weds Manu brings this drama of Love, Politics, Jealousy, Power, Friendship etc. all in a single movie. I completely agree with the second half and the beautiful climax of this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was really impressed by the music as well as lustrous & vibrant movie posters. So my expectation from Raanjhanaa (2013) was quite high.\n\nThe first half hour was really nice, but after that the tempo began to fall; sometimes high, sometimes low. Although they tried to put several twists in the story, but none of them clicked well. The script (by Himanshu Sharma) was not well composed; seemed like \"links missing\". It was tough to find or relate what the writer wants to tell and where he wants to go, may be it was because of immature editing (by Hemal Kothari)!\n\nThis movie reminded me of Saawariya (2007)! That was one man show by Ranbir Kapoor; here's the same, one man show by Dhanush. The similarity and reminding point is Sonam Kapoor; in both, she was really very flat. This is the point where she needs to improve a lot. She looked uncomfortable in the role. She looks young and beautiful, but all she needs is to act.\n\nDhanush was flawless throughout the film. He was perfect for the character than Shaheed Kapoor. May be more Bollywood is coming for the boy. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub (as Murari) and Swara Bhaskar (as Bindiya) did splendid job with their roles.\n\nIf there was no A R Rahman involvement with this cinema, this might be a disaster! What to say, all the tracks were unique in their genres. The vocal Percussion & vocal Shehnai by Chinmayee and Aanchal Sethi for the song \"Ay Sakhi\" was remarkable. Melodic \"Tum Tak\" & crispy \"Raanjhanaa\" will provide piece in soul for a long period of time.\n\nMy actual rating is 3, but bonus 1.50 for A R Rahman & 0.50 for Dhanush making a total of 5. In a nutshell, not recommended; but can be seen at your own risk!"

First half is pretty sweet with child love and then grown up love and lot of fun moments also included. Dhanush friend did a real good job being a typical UP folk. Dhanush may not look like a typical Bolly wood hero but his acting is damn good, it never looks like that this is his first movie, he is perfect for this movie. The kind of script movie has demand is the lead actor like Dhanush. Sonam also done a good job after long while, she improved a lot from this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Dhanush's character, his portrayal & performance is one of the strong- points of Raanjhanaa. Other points are its throbbing music, supporting cast, colorful setup & fresh writing.\n\nThe first half, talking about the initial romance between two lead characters, is very powerful. It emotes total romance, humor & drama. Thirteen minutes into screenplay, the story is half-told, wonderfully. The next part shows aftermath. Abhay Deol enters and politics follows. Sentimental sequences make up almost three quarters of the second half and it actually paces the story. The climax is pure Bollywood ishtyle where the lead people react and evince the meaning of film as a whole. Wonderful!\n\nSupporting cast is extremely potent, especially Dhanush's on-screen friend & that friend's sister. Their performances are terrific. A R Rahman's songs are truly extravagant, yet I felt repetitive use of lilts could've been done without. And I really doubt if Rahman has sampled Hans Zimmer towards the end. But, it doesn't matter because the hot theme actually mesmerizes you. There are many elements to consider and that itself is enough for considering this drama.\n\nThe experience as a whole was good enough for a Bollywood movie releasing among other clich\u00e9d films, because the makers know their audience and only reveal plot points when they think the story needs it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A very strong cinema. Highly recommended! 8.3/10.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nProfanity: Strong | Sex/Nudity/Vulgarity: No | Violence/Gore: Very Strong | Smoking: No | Alcohol: Very Mild | Porn: No"

        "review_detailed_main": "Raanjhanaa. Love has the power to enlighten you so it has the power to destroy you and kill you. Raanjhanaa is a pure Indian love story of a small-town boy played by terrific Dhanush who needs to break through the class divide to gain acceptance from his childhood sweetheart played by Sonam Kapoor who is in love with big city ideal played by Abhay Deol. Abhay Deol in his cameo is lovable as always. Sonam Kapoor does better than her previous attempts in acting. But movie belongs to trio of Dhanush the actor, Anand Rai the director and A.R.Rahman the music director. Dhanush in his first Bollywood outing makes you smile, laugh, dance, cry and even puke. At the most surprising and devastating twist in the story, movie turns into one of the most poignant love story told in recent times. His performance is so full of impact because it is supported by deep thoughtful direction of Anand Rai and mesmerizing music of the great A.R.Rahman. Most of the songs play in background and make you feel the warmth and pain of being in love and irony of life for the people in love. But it is not fairy tale from start to finish, movie derails in his last half an hour by drifting from its main plot and turning into a political drama. But this can be easily forgiven as you would have given two thumbs up to this movie long before its climax. Watch it for love, watch it for Rahman, watch it for break out debut of Dhanush in Bollywood."

Because casting Dhanush or else changed the character in the story as south Indian guy. It worked great. The moment we see Dhanush start his act on the screen, it works like a charm. He made it look so joyful and lively, I started enjoying his presence. Sonam kapoor and Abhay Deol carries their characters very well which makes movie a complete entertainer. Re-recording and music of the film are good. A. R. Rahman has pretty good idea how it works for south Indian star and how it works for Bollywood. He made his presence all over the movie. Climax is well planned and my eyes were filled with tears and it touched my soul. This kind of performance is not new to Dhanush but Sonam and Abhay had different roles which they worked for first time. I loved the movie and screenplay and story are awesome."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Raanjhanaa\" is a Hindi romantic drama film directed by Anand L. Rai, released in 2013. The movie stars Dhanush, Sonam Kapoor, and Abhay Deol in lead roles, with Swara Bhaskar and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in supporting roles.\n\nSet in the city of Varanasi, \"Raanjhanaa\" tells the story of Kundan Shankar (Dhanush), a lower-middle-class Hindu boy who falls in love with Zoya Haider (Sonam Kapoor), a Muslim girl. The film explores their intense and passionate relationship, as well as the complexities of love, religion, and societal expectations.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of \"Raanjhanaa\" is the outstanding performances by the lead actors. Dhanush, a prominent Tamil actor making his Bollywood debut, delivers a remarkable performance as Kundan. He effectively portrays the innocence, vulnerability, and ardor of his character. Sonam Kapoor also shines in her role as Zoya, displaying a range of emotions and capturing the complexities of her character.\n\nThe film's music, composed by A. R. Rahman, is another highlight. The soundtrack features soulful melodies that beautifully complement the story and enhance the emotional impact of the scenes. Songs like \"Tum Tak,\" \"Raanjhanaa,\" and \"Piya Milenge\" have become popular and are still cherished by audiences.\n\nThe cinematography by Natarajan Subramaniam captures the essence of Varanasi, showcasing the vibrant colors, narrow lanes, and the city's spiritual atmosphere. The director, Anand L. Rai, does an excellent job of incorporating the city's cultural and religious elements into the narrative, creating a visually rich experience.\n\nWhile \"Raanjhanaa\" received critical acclaim for its performances and music, it did receive some criticism for its handling of the portrayal of stalking and obsession in the name of love. Some viewers felt that the film romanticized such behaviors, which can be problematic and perpetuate harmful narratives.\n\nOverall, \"Raanjhanaa\" is a visually appealing film with powerful performances and an engaging storyline. It explores the complexities of love and the clash of religious identities in a society deeply rooted in traditions. If you enjoy intense romantic dramas with strong performances and soulful music, \"Raanjhanaa\" is worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Never had a Bollywood movie enthralled and entertained me as Raanjhanaa did since Gangs of Wasseypur. It is the most heart felt mind blowing experience you will ever have! Raanjhanaa is a love story, a story the like of which you have never seen before. It is an intense, raw steaming cauldron of love brimming with unprecedented passion where love consumes all. (It is just so so difficult to put down my thoughts on this one. But damn man, I am going to give it a try.) It is not your typical warm mushy love story, the kind that are you are so used to watching. It explores love in its truest, its purest form. There are moments where the scenes are so stupid, so clich\u00e9d that it seems to be taken from a very typical Bollywood movie, that you might have just laughed at its silliness. But wait for a few moments and those scenes will grow on you. And moreover how would one expect the translation of one's passion by a generation who has fed from Bollywood movies. The difference is startling when you see Sonam Kapoor's restrained, subtle love, not because it does not carry the intensity and passion of Dhanush's, but because it is the upbringing she gets. Sonam's love for Abhay is as raw as Dhanush's for Sonam. And here where the movie shines in the exploration of love. It studies two protagonists, both of whom shimmering with love and their affection directed at different persons, but at a metaphysical level united as one in their unbridled passion. It may seem to many that there is a lot of negativity with Sonam's character, be it the way she seeks Dhanush's help or later her actions result into his miserable condition. But if one looks closely at Dhanush's character you will see how closely Dhanush at the core is the same being. Apparently, people will naturally sympathize with Kundan and not with Zoya and thereby lies a major flaw in the treatment of the story. Since the two love stories reach the same dead end and the two characters are indistinguishable in their actions and deeds, it is inappropriate for one character to be portrayed in a more positive light than the other. Dialogues are very well written, many of which are witty and funny without taking away the intensity of the moments. They seem to blend with the characters, the landscape and the story seamlessly without ever feeling like just an addition to the ongoing surroundings to add to the entertainment. Dialogues never make any moment melodramatic or too fantastical to believe, they give an earthiness, a realism to the story that plays a pivotal role in making the movie so good. Dhanush has acted brilliantly and is really a talent house to look forward to. Sonam Kapoor has also given a good performance. Abhay Deol is wasted. The supporting cast is brilliant with Murari and BIndiya. The cinematography is also up to mark capturing the aesthetic of Varanasi on the celluloid. A. R. Rahman excels with this pitch perfect music direction. Raanjhanaa is a must watch for the love story that it is, a love story of fall and redemption that is not a fairy tale that culminates in the union, but a portrayal, a canvas where different true colours of love are splashed to make something so beautiful that it will remain forever etched out in my heart for eternity. In spite of all the tragedy and heart breaks, Raanjhanaa is not a sad movie. It is a celebration of love. Maybe sometimes it is just enough to love."

Many people could relate many scenes with their own life or story. This was the best bay Dhanush could have made his debut in the Bollywood. The climax of the film was the best part of the film or me.The film had 1 or 2 flaws like the overdose of slaps by Zoya in the didn't make much sense but the content of the story was brilliant.

This is a love story throughout, but nothing terribly mushy or boring and certainly nothing typical of a Hindi romance. There is substance and a great story line here that keeps you engaged with the characters (even the side characters are hugely entertaining). There are some really funny moments and a few sad ones all combined to make a great story with no one over all mood. Dhanush plays his role very well and is destined for great things down the road. He sets a great example of putting your mind to something and tolerance towards being wronged. This is one of Sonam Kapoor's better movies and her role is excellent. The sets are real looking and it's refreshing to see no CGI, fake sets or green screened scenes. There is lots of color here and very real looking extras. The struggles between caste, religious differences and class divide are presented well with nothing glossed over. There are no super hero antics and no weird breakout dance scenes out of whack with the story. The music is excellent and goes well with each scene. An excellent movie that stands above the typical Bollywood stuff that is cranked out year after year."

In one word the whole movie is just incredible....5 star \u2b50 performance by the whole team. Accolades....."
