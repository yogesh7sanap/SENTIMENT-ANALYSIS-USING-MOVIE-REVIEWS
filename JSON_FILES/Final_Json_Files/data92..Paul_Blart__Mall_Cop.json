        "review_title": "About as good as a movie called Paul Blart: Mall Cop could be",
        "review_detailed_main": "If Paul Blart: Mall Cop had been made 20 years ago, it would have starred John Candy. That's a complement, by the way. Candy had a knack for playing bungling, yet good-hearted people who mainly wanted to please. He certainly specialized in playing people who tried too hard to be nice to cover up past pain. There's a lot of this in Kevin James' performance as the title character here. He's more than just a comic goofball. James turns him into a likable and surprisingly sympathetic hero that we find ourselves cheering for by the end.\n\nKevin James rose to fame on television starring on the sitcom, The King of Queens, and has been trying to break into movies for a while now. He's acted along side stars like Will Smith and Adam Sandler, but this is his first shot at a stand-alone starring role. Sandler is still there behind the scenes (His Happy Madison production company produced the film.), but this is James' film all the way, and he doesn't waste the opportunity. His Paul Blart is admirable in a way. He's overweight and he suffers from hypoglycemia, but he always tries to do the right thing. He's passionate about his job as a mall cop, but he'd really like to be a police officer on the street. He's taken the physical entrance exam many times, but his health problems have prevented him from finishing. He makes up for his shortcomings by being the best mall cop he can be, and by also being a good single father to his teen daughter (Raini Rodriguez), who respects him and wishes he could fall in love again. Paul has his eyes on a young woman named Amy (Jayma Mays), who also works at the mall. The first half hour or so of the film is devoted to Paul's life, and it certainly helps us get into his corner when the actual plot kicks in.\n\nIt's Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, and some high tech criminals stage a lock down and a hostage situation at the mall as they pull off their theft plan. They place motion sensors and small bombs at the entrances, so no one can get in or out. They think they've removed everyone from the building, but didn't notice Paul was in the back of the arcade playing Guitar Hero. When he emerges from the arcade, he quickly learns about the hostage situation, and discovers that both Amy and his daughter are amongst them. This kicks off the main action, where Paul must use his resources around him to out think and outrun the criminals while keeping everyone alive. I liked this aspect of the story, and how Paul Blart actually has to be clever in order to outsmart the captors. The movie is rated PG, so it's never too violent or scary for kids, which is the perfect target audience for the film. They'll like the film's gentle and goofy humor, and accompanying adults may find themselves charmed by Blart himself.\n\nI never laughed out loud while watching this movie, but I did smile a lot, and I found myself caring more about the main character than I imagined. Let me tell you, that's more than I expected walking into a movie called Paul Blart: Mall Cop. There's plenty of sweetness during the early moments, establishing Paul's shy relationship with Amy, and the caring one he shares with his daughter. When the time comes for him to be a hero, we can cheer for him, because the movie makes him into a true underdog. He's constantly battling with his own shortcomings and health issues, and it's clever the way he keeps on finding ways to keep himself going, driven by saving the ones he loves. If I'm making the movie sound too serious, it's not. There's plenty of slapstick gags, surprisingly no bodily fluid or toilet humor to be found, and some pretty good physical comedy on display. If there's any major shortcoming to be found, it's that the movie is pretty inconsequential, and will probably be forgotten by me a few months from now.\n\nStill, considering the kind of junk that usually clogs theaters in early January, Paul Blart certainly is not bad. I imagine the movie will make a good rental, since its somewhat small scale will make it perfect for watching on TV rather than the big screen. If anything, it's one step closer to making James the cross-over star he obviously wants to be. I wouldn't mind seeing the same kind of likability he gives here in a less juvenile script. He's on to something here, he's just gotta find the project where he really knocks one out of the park."

        "review_detailed_main": "Never watched King of Queens, never have been a Kevin James fan but always liked him better than his pal Ray Romano. I was coerced into seeing this Mall Cop movie. I give it a 6 out of 10. Now some may say that is a low rating, some may say better than mediocre.....for me who normally does not like this guys type of humor, this is a great rating!!! It was mildly entertaining...for me it gets the extra star to put it at 6 because it's refreshing to see some humor that's not overly sarcastic, deeply degrading to someone else (except the title character), or just downright cruel. This relied on what I call \"Bill Cosby\" sense of humor. Funny but overall clean. A bit cheesy, but I think that's what Kevin and the screenwriters were going for. Normally I don't get why people think he's funny but in this case, I did get it....and you can't help but like the guy. Without giving any detail, the bar scene for me was one of the most Laugh Out Loud moments in the movie. The way KJ zips around on the Segway is pretty hilarious although because of it's consistency throughout the movie it wears off a bit. I agree with previous reviews of how the villains kind of downgraded the movie a bit. If that was smarter, or those parts were rewritten, it could have been a lot funnier. Another surprising aspect is Kevin's agility, and athleticism. In this particular movie he is very physical (or at least stunt doubles allow him to appear that way) Overall my 6 out of 10 rating should be perceived as a great rating for this movie. I previously never liked this actor, I thought the title was dumb as dirt, and although I always keep an open mind I would be lying if I didn't say that my expectations were very, very low for this. Certainly not as bad as I thought it would be, and not as great as I thought it could have been. Kevin and cast made this a little better than average...and it changed my mind about my hesitation with this guy....I hope someone puts him in a good movie with a great script in the future (better than Chuck and Larry, Hitch). I believe it will do well on cable. One last thing that I must mention was great, at 82 mins...it was just long enough to not overdue what should be viewed as a kinda silly concept."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I saw the premise of this movie, I had a chuckle. It had the potential to be a decently funny movie, something perhaps with heart, something that delivered a good deal of laughs and you walked out feeling good. I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning movie. Its definitely not Oscar-worthy. The real disappointment lies in the lack of humor in it.\n\nPaul Blart (Kevin James) is a mall cop that seems to have no direction in his life. They go to good lengths to show how truly depressing his life is. Paul sees a woman in his mall, Amy (Jayma Mays), running a stand for hair extensions. He realizes that he needs to be with her and tries to woo her, even though he has no self-esteem. Just as the story is falling apart, the mall where they both work is robbed in a supposedly sophisticated scheme. Suddenly our slovenly friend is thrust into a role where he can try to impress the love of his life and excel at his job at the same time. Easy to guess where this story is going, no?\n\nThe acting was okay, the direction was tolerable. The problem is the script. As I said, the story itself had potential. It just felt as if the writers could decide where this was a character they loved or hated. It really could have used another re-write or two to develop the script a little more. The movie is tolerable, but realize that not only are you not seeing an Oscar-worthy movie, but you'll be a little disappointed in the laughs as well. 3/10"

It looked like it might be a total waste of time, along the lines of \"Delta Farce\" or \"Meet the Spartans\". However, after reading some of the reviews, and being a fan of \"King of Queens\", I decided to check it out and was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it. The casting was excellent, the screenplay was very good, and Kevin James fit the bill perfectly. I can't imagine anyone other than him playing the role of Paul Blart, Mall Cop.\n\nPaul Blart is an overweight, hypo-glycemic (prone to fainting spells), shopping mall security guard who lives with him Mom and teenage daughter somewhere in North Jersey. Paul aspires to be a NJ State Police officer but cannot pass the required physical, and thus is consigned to his present job at a West Orange, NJ shopping mall. While Paul is on duty, a group of armed robbers attempt to steal the credit card receipts. The remainder of the film is Paul doing battle with this group of robbers. This sounds more serious than it is. Rest assured, it's a fun comedy with many funny gags / bits.\n\nI'd recommend this movie to anyone who liked \"King of Queens\" or has an affinity for light-hearted comedies."

The hero is very likable and you always cheering him to come out on top. I wouldn't say it's a hilarious movie or keep you on the edge of your seat, it had its moments. I would consider the movie a good waste of time. It's nice to have a film out there that is light and avoid bathroom jokes and video-game type violence.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" from 2009 stars Kevin James, Jayma Mays, Shirley Knight, Bobby Cannavale, and Keir O'Donnell.\n\nPaul Blart works for mall security after not making it to the police academy. He acts as if he's guarding the White House, stopping people in motorized carts for infractions, reporting in even though his boss asks who it is, and going a little overboard in his handling of a new trainee.\n\nHe hasn't dated since his green card marriage blew up, but he sees a young woman at one of the kiosks, Amy (Jayma Mays) and falls head over heels. After he makes a complete fool of himself at a bar, she seems less friendly.\n\nWhen a gang announces the mall is closing early and starts an organized takeover and captures hostages, including Amy, Paul is fooling around with a guitar and singing in one of the stores. Therefore when the mall is locked, he's stuck in the mall. And it falls to him to do something about the robbery and the danger to the hostages.\n\nNormally the last thing I watch is films like this. These past two weeks I've seen two. It's since the election. I have needed films to numb my mind. Kevin James makes me laugh with his slapstick and cluelessness, so it was fine.\n\nIt's predictable, it's funny in spots, it seems to go on longer than necessary, but by far it is not the worst thing I've ever seen. And for a change with today's comedy, it didn't have vulgar jokes.\n\nThis last week I watched Netflix's True Memoirs of an International Assassin, also with Kevin James, to give you an idea of what all the divisiveness and hate of this election has done to me."

A film which should be quietly enjoyable and give a few laughs.\n\nWhat I watched was mind-numbing garbage. Whilst I didn't expect anything too original, I didn't think I'd get such unoriginal, factory fodder. There was nothing to be enjoyed, and almost everything was too expected. The little that was marginally original was creepy. I felt like screaming to the love interest, don't go any near that stalker as he zoomed in on CTV then offered a lift on his mop-mobile. Would anyone say yes if a creepy guy offered to put his arms around you on his Segway when you just met the guy; especially one with stalker tendencies? The scene in the bar that followed was just as painful to watch, and even more reason for the love interest to run a mile.\n\nThe writers seemed to forget that if you're going to create formula movies, with a loser you need the audience to like, that there has to be something positive and likable about the character. I can't think about anything redeeming during the first twenty minutes. The writers took too many liberties with the audience and just presumed, 'Hey, this is an actor everyone likes, we don't need to make any effort in the script to support this.' This is not Kevin James greatest moment. The box office receipts merely show how successful good advertising can be, no matter how bad the product is."

The idea itself is a very interesting one at very least, but it's the realization is where the movie fails. The story begins to borderline on being boring halfway through, and it all begins to be more than predictable. Once or twice the story takes an engaging turn, but it's really not enough. The funny parts are to be counted on the fingers of one hand, and the ending is -again- so predictable, it hurts. Which is a shame, because the acting is really good, Kevin James is truly shining through and proving that he's a really good actor; again, not nearly enough to salvage the shortcomings of the plot and the lack of jokes. Which is a shame. Movie starts really promising, but the further we go into the movie, the more painful it becomes to watch it. As if the makers gave up on it after shooting the first 30 minutes. I'm giving it 5 stars only because the first half an hour is really decent. And I gotta admire James doing all his stunts. So do yourself a favor. Don't watch the movie. Watch the trailers. That's all you need to see."

I recently re watched it to see if it stood the test of time. I Was more than surprised to see the themes relating to us now more than ever. Themes of bravery, the kindness of a good mans heart, and not succumbing to the fear within you in the face of danger. That is why this movie gets ten whole stars. Kevin James brings phenomenal acting as always to his role as the titular Paul Blart. His performance is on the same level as Emma Stone's in La La Land. Kevin James is a prime example of someone who deserves an Oscar and for this movie that particularly shows. He plays the tough and emotional role of a single father trying to provide for his elderly mother and child. He is a failure to the world and needs to bring himself up to a higher standard. Masterful writing and acting compliment this piece well.\n\nThank you Kevin James for this creation."

This film may have improved upon its shortcomings if it was humorous but it was not with only a few jokes making me raise the corner of my mouth, although the style of humour starts to make sense when you realize that the directors previous films are the such of 'Dr. Dolittle 2' and 'Daddy Day Care'.\n\nPerhaps I did not enjoy this movie because I watched it expecting more than it could offer, Perhaps it does not fit my sense of humour, or even my annoyance at the script getting through Hollywood whilst so many more well thought out scripts lay unnoticed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to a preview screening today at the Mall of America, where Kevin James was doing a signing to promote his new movie. I didn't get an autograph, but I was able to go to the preview screening of the movie, and although we got into it a couple minutes late, I was still able to see the bulk of the movie.\n\nIt definitely isn't bad, but I wouldn't put it up there as a top comedy either. It's decent at best. There are actually a few genuinely funny moments, but there aren't many. The rest of the jokes throughout the movie aren't bad in the sense that you cringe at them, but they aren't really what I'd call funny either. Really though, the movie is highly tolerable, and doesn't overstay it's welcome, ending at a good time. I didn't have to pay for it, so maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much, but as long as you aren't looking for the next great comedy, at the very least, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe main weakness of the movie is the main villains in the movie, the \"X-TREME T33M!\", turn what is a pretty good movie into a pretty mediocre movie. You just can't take them seriously, as usually bad guys in movies don't jump around as if they believe they are the evil twins of Spider- man, and to make it worse, they also equip themselves with skateboards and BMX bikes, because apparently free running around the wall wasn't XTREEEEEEEM enough for them. They really make the movie seem more like a kid's movie than it already did, which I guess it is more of a kid's movie, but still.\n\nKevin James himself isn't bad, and he has most of the best jokes of the movie come from him, but he isn't really at the top of his game either. Really no complaints; the only thing holding him back is the somewhat sloppy script. If you liked him in \"King of Queens\", you'll probably like him in this, yet he is a little underwhelming to be honest.\n\nThe plot is very simplistic, Hollywood routine stuff here, no surprises, except one last minute twist that is actually unexpected, mostly because it was so unnecessary to move the plot forward. It was just so unneeded that it really made no sense, and was almost shocking. It's like someone who says they are going to count to 100 and then they count to 105. What was the point of that? They already accomplished their goal when they got to 100. Kind of a bad analogy, but you get the idea.\n\nOverall, it's nothing to write home about, but it definitely isn't bad. If you are a huge Kevin James fan, then go ahead and see it, and if you have kids, then they will most likely like it. I was going to give it a 6/10, but seeing as how it is more of a kid's movie, I decided to give it a 7, also because it is very tolerable, and there are some actually pretty funny parts, so it is an enjoyable movie (although again, I could be a little more accepting because I got to see it for free). You might enjoy it, you might not. Really, just watch the trailer. It pretty much captures the spirit of the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was introduced to Paul Blart: Mall Cop by my older brother when he got it on DVD in 2012 or 2011 (don't remember exactly when). I'm quite amazed that this movie came out during my final year of preschool. And I'm gonna be honest, I've always enjoyed it, but it definitely doesn't hold up in places.\n\nSet in West Orange, New Jersey around the holidays of 2009, Mall Cop focuses on Paul Blart (played by Kevin James), a middle-aged single man who lives with his mother Margaret (Shirley Knight) and teenage daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez). Paul dreams of becoming a state trooper and has tried out several times, but his hypoglycemia constantly holds him back. In the meantime, he works as a security officer at the local West Orange Pavilion Mall, a job that he's held for a decade, and takes great pride in, though his colleagues and customers couldn't care less. On Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, Paul seizes the chance to shine when seven hooligans, led by Veck Simms (Kier O'Donnell), who has been posing as a security trainee, invade and shut down the mall, and take hostages inside the bank, including Maya and Amy (Jayma Mays), a weave and wig saleslady who Paul has become infatuated with recently. Determined to protect his cherished mall and save his loved ones, Paul mounts his trusty Segway and revs into action to stop Veck.\n\nThe acting in this movie, while nothing spectacular, is good enough. Kevin James brings his A game to the role of Paul. Raini Rodriguez is fine as Maya. Jayma Mays is sweet and kind as Amy. Shirley Knight is good as Margaret, even if she has only two scenes. Although, Kier O'Donnell does fall a little short as Veck. Everybody else isn't too bad.\n\nThe writing is a little more hit-or-miss. Mall Cop is definitely packed with some really exciting action, especially all the scenes of Paul taking out Veck's thugs. There's also some really great comedy in here that manages to make me laugh. Examples include Paul getting drunk at American Joe's (\"I BELIEVE IN MAGIC!!!!\" *SMASH*), and his one-liner before using a scuba tank to take out one of Veck's thugs: \"Hey, you. SCUBA-dooby-doo.\" HA! The movie is even heartwarming in places, especially the scene of Maya comforting a despondent Paul after he finds no online dating matches, and of course, the ending. But here's where the shortcomings arise. Some of the movie's comedy comes across as less funny and more cringeworthy. One key example is the scene of Paul getting in a physical tussle with an angry fat lady at Victoria's Secret. I'm not gonna lie, I hid from that when I was younger. While I've grown more tolerant of it, it's still cringeworthy, and it basically stops the whole movie dead. And the fact that it's only addressed by one passing reference just a little later in the movie just adds to how pointless it is. Another issue is how incredibly dated this movie is, because the mall is filled with stores that are no longer in business, namely KB Toys (appearing in a deleted scene, but only listed on the store lists that Veck gives his thugs in the finished film), which I loved to visit all the time as a kid before it went out of business (just around the time this movie was released), Sharper Image, where Paul grabs a camera from (which ended its retail stores before the movie was even released!), and Sears, which, as of today, only has a few stores that are still in business. It's especially harsh to see Lord & Taylor, now that thanks to COVID, that store saw its end just two years ago.\n\nMall Cop is also filmed quite nicely, but there are problems. Throughout the movie, the Massachusetts filming locations are all too detectable. As someone from Pennsylvania who's been to New Jersey millions of times over the years, I can tell that this movie wasn't filmed in New Jersey. And when calling Paul over a borrowed cellphone, his friend's daughter's ex-boyfriend Pahud (Adhir Kalyan) pulls up a cell-tracking map that shows the mall's located in Trenton, New Jersey, right near Cadwalader Park. West Orange is in northern Jersey, nowhere near the Delaware River. Added to which, the mall's inside constantly fluctuates between scenes (store front arrangements change, architecture changes, etc.). That's because the movie was filmed at two different Massachusetts malls: Burlington Mall in Burlington, and South Shore Plaza in Braintree, and I visited both these malls with my family during Spring Break back in 2018.\n\nOkay, finally, music! Composer and record producer Waddy Wachtel's score for this movie is pretty darn good, I must say, especially his exhilarating main theme, and his music for the opening credits. It also sounds energetic and suspenseful when it needs to. And the movie chooses some great songs that fit well, especially \"I Can't Hold Back\" by Survivor. But that's not all; the end credits use \"Think I'm In Love\" by Eddie Money, and it works extremely well! Also, I'm not a particularly big fan of Barry Manilow, but his song, \"Weekend in New England\", is perfectly used for the aforementioned scene of Maya comforting Paul.\n\nAll things considered, Paul Blart: Mall Cop has flaws, some minor, some severe, it's dumb at times, and it's certainly dated, but, ultimately, I love it. In my opinion, I think it's Happy Madison's best effort. If you like to see movies that are centered around mall chases, watch this movie!"

Part 1 is seeing how much of a fat loser he is with his old mom and fat daughter, trying to get the girl and what not,. Part 2 is seeing how much a fat loser he is and him fighting the bad guys. The film is peculiar because it is somewhere between being a stupid PG comedy for the kids and a very bad homage to Die Hard. The funniest lines are those that aren't intended to be humorous. Seeing the bad guys jump around the mall (and I mean literally jump) spitting out their terrible lines was the best part of the movie. Some parts of it just don't make any sense. Overall if you are going to be close minded it is a terrible film. If you have an open mind, it will still be a terrible film."

My roommate and I, who can sit thru any and all Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris movie with pleasure, feel the need to burn the Mall Cop DVD in order to cleanse ourselves of the shame inflicted by Paul Blart. I think Lucifer himself forces the likes of Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and Ted Bundy to watch this film confined in the gates of hell. If you are thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor, and punch yourself in the groin for an hour and a half instead."

He meets a wonderfully nice and pretty hair extension saleswoman, Amy (Jayma Mays), whom he instantly falls for. Things take a turn for the worse however, as a group of thieves take over the mall.

Yes, we all know it's not meant for critical acclaim but for pure comical entertainment and it delivers.

He has a daughter who's mother left him once she got citizenship. Paul has a crush on the new girl at the wig kiosk but of course he's conscience about his weight. Then one day, some organized crooks take over the mall and Blart is unaware. Once the crooks have hostages including Blart's crush and his daughter then he decides to take things into his own hands and save the mall.\n\nAt first I was terribly disappointed to see this was PG-13 because I thought it was then going to be a little contrived potty/stupid humor film for kids. Yes some stupid humor was there but in the best way. I think this would be the perfect family or date movie (as it was for me) so take a trip to comical fun."

Paul Blart may be called a parody of Die Hard or a try-hard comedy film. Again, I don't exactly know what you thought this movie was (what the Godfather?) but it meet my expectations. The comedy is a perfect balance between adults and children, so no hard times there. And everything else was just great. But overall, all in all, in conclusion; this film is an underrated comedy film that needs to be more appreciated. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. One thing: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS.

The movie solely relies on Kevin James and while that worked with the TV Show, it does not work here.

        "review_detailed_main": "Having already seen (and liked) Observe and Report, it was almost necessary to see the year's other mall cop movie to make sure my experience was well-rounded. O&R was a very dark and disturbed comedy, and while not the funniest movie of the summer was certainly very different from anything else that came out. Paul Blart is almost the same movie with the edge smoothed to a curve. There's nothing really wrong with it, but there's nothing quite right either, and while its harmless enough, I can definitely say that Paul Blart is a waste of time.\n\nKevin James is Paul Blart, a lovable schlubb of a mall cop. He has a daughter from his ex-wife, who used him for a green card and then ran off. He has a crush on the new girl as the hair extensions booth (which almost borders on stalker-ish at the start of the movie). He is constantly put down by the worst people imaginable, including a pen salesman who is unfortunately never punched in the face. He has hypoglicemia, which causes him to pass out without the proper dosage of pixie sticks. And he loves his segway. Admittedly, its a badass segway.\n\nThe character of Blart is certainly the strong point of the movie. Unlike the tendency nowadays for anti-heroes and sarcastic twits leading in comedies (think the Stifler influence), Paul Blart is wholesome, sympathetic and never unlovable. He's a big guy, but in a cuddly rather than pokeable way. James plays the character very well, and may very well have a future in films. He's put on a lot of weight, but he plays it to his advantage in the movie.\n\nHalfway through, a group of criminals invade the mall in an attempt to steal Black Friday credit card revenues. Their plan is inconcievably stupid, as is par for the course, but the fact that the criminals are made to look smart just adds insult. The movie also tends to just ignore certain pieces of information, making some of their plot ridiculously random. The criminals themselves are ridiculous. Someone thought throwing in some parkour jumping would spice up the movie, but instead is just face-in-palm bad. One in particular is a lunatic to the point of absurdity, especially for light fare as this.\n\nThe biggest sin of the movie is that its mostly laughless. There's a couple chuckles throughout, but no real laughs. When Blart must defend his mall, a laugh or two is finally emitted. Most of the good stuff is in the trailer, although Blart taking on a Predator-esquire role in a Rainforest Cafe is admittedly pretty funny.\n\nDespite trying to promote self-esteem for our heavy-set protagonist, Paul Blart relies heavily on fat-man-fall-down humour, which is a little puzzling. Regardless, the important part is the movie just isn't that funny. Its a harmless kind of funny, and is certainly not intolerable, although the editing is quite horrid. Its not the worst movie in the world to be dragged to, but I can't help feel I just wasted 90 minutes of my life."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie. I thought it was very funny and meant for all the family. I think the reason why it was given a slightly lower rating was because most people were expecting a full on spy movie or police investigation, which I am here to tell you, it's not. It kind of gets to that towards half way through the movie, but it's meant to be a comedy, so isn't necessarily going to be taken seriously.\n\nThe storyline overall was great and easy enough to follow. A man got a job as a mall cop and all the way through the movie is trying to impress a girl. I won't say any more than that as I don't want to spoil anything, as there are some plot twists.\n\nThe casting was spot on perfect. It wasn't like 'woah that acting is amazing' because it is hard to pick those people out when they don't have a scene where something has gone wrong or given a very powerful line. Nothing very special but at the same time, I doubt we could have gotten any better. There were no weak moments from any of the actors.\n\nThe comical side of things was also perfect. They didn't try to force jokes or funny scenes, you could tell it just all lead on naturally, which is a good thing. You can really tell when ideas have been forced and then it doesn't work.\n\nThe music wasn't anything you'd really pick up on but it was still there and wasn't bad but wasn't absolutely amazing either.\n\nThis movie is definitely for all ages. It is a family film as well, and fit for most people, unless they don't like a good laugh.\n\nFor some reason, the guy at the beginning who goes round with Paul Blart reminds me of Moriaty from the TV series Sherlock, no clue why but he does. (Moriaty in the TV series is absolutely brilliant, just saying)."

At least none that was direct, so its VERY kid friendly.\n\nThe story delivers, Kevin James delivers perfectly on Comedic Moments as well as Heart Warming ones.\n\nThere is product placement in this movie by Sony, although it is very low key. And to anybody in the Pennsylvania, NJ, Delaware Tri-State area you will feel right at home in this mall, as it is obviously a Simon/Kravco Property given the decor and the usual assortment of Simon Mall Staples such as Legal Seafood ( whatever their name means. Still not sure I'd eat there.)\n\nUntil this film I do not believe I've seen James in anything where I don't think its an extended episode of King of Queens. In this film he was pure Blart.\n\nVery well done. I may even go back a second time."

I am glad that I didn't pay for this piece of crap and so called \"comedy\". Just Starting from the beginning to the end, I didn't even chuckle for one time. All the jokes are clich\u00e9d, predictable and dumb - probably cater to the below the age of 12 audiences. It clearly demonstrates that Kevin James cannot carry the movie neither could all the supporting casts. I am still floored by the fact that it cashed in more than 100 million in box office (Must be no big animation released at that time so parents had no choice but were forced to take their kids to watch this awful flick since it was PG)."

My advice: If you really like Kevin James like I do, wait till this comes out on DVD, rent it, watch it and return it...on time. -You don't want to catch a late fee for something as disappointing as this.\n\nOh, and if you did see this and really liked it, I recommend 'Employee of the Month' with Dane Cook."

He has written the film along with Nick Bakay neatly {keeping entertainment & only entertainment in mind}, as an actor he's done a brilliant job. And as a producer.... he made a Blockbuster hit, thus earned money, money all the way to the bank.\n\n'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' is entertaining fare with hilarious moments attached to it. The film promises to entertain, not enlighten... and it's true to it's intension. This is no way a fantastic watch, but surely a entertaining, light-hearted & well-made film, which springs up the mood.\n\nActing-Wise: Kevin James is excellent. He plays the Mall Cop with the correct amount of confidence & style. Keir O'Donnell is good as the menace. Jayma Mays does a fine job. Others give a good account for them self's.\n\nOn the whole 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' lives up-to the mark. A joyride!"

Paul Blart is a loser who failed at becoming a policeman so has a job as a mall security worker and runs around on the mall on a segway. If him on a segway is supposed to be funny, I missed the humor there. On Black Friday, the mall is overtaken by a group of thieves who want to steal the credit card information from all the stores. The police and the SWAT team are called in so the thieves take some of the mall workers as hostages. With the help of Paul Blart the thieves are caught and the hostages are released and Paul gets the girl in the end. Kevin James tries so hard to make this poor script funny, but the movie is a bore."

James is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. The movie is rated PG, so it's never too violent for kids. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly from the moment when I saw the trailer for Paul Blart: Mall Cop, I knew I wanted to see it. It looked like a great new comedy that we needed, it's always fun to root for the underdog, right? But I did have to wait for the rental, fun economy, right? So I was able to get it today and you know what? It really wasn't what I had expected at all, even though it had some really fun moments, over all the story was way too much and tried too much to be like Die Hard. The film took a complete 180 where this sweet lovable guy turns into Travis Bickle(Taxi Driver). I don't know why they kept turning this film around, not to mention that with the exception of Kevin James, they picked the most horrible cast to carry this movie.\n\nWhen Paul Blart fails the New Jersey State Police training, he is reduced to being a \"rent a cop\" security guard at the mall. During dinner with his mom and daughter, Maya, they try to cheer him up and want him to start dating again. Blart's ex-wife had married him for the green card, had a daughter with him, and then abandoned them. While on patrol at work, Blart passes by Amy's kiosk and she gives him a smile which distracts him enough for him to run face-first into a display car. Back at base Blart has to take the new guy, Veck Sims, out on another patrol to train him. On Black Friday Amy, Stuart, and Veck are in the bank to cash their paychecks. Blart is heading there too but the owner of the arcade asks Blart to help him close the store. When a gang breaks in through the service entrance and prepares to take over the mall by force, Blart is focused on playing Rock Band. The robbers clear the mall and take hostages in the bank. When Amy tells Veck to get down, he reveals that he is the ringleader of the gang. Veck plans to use credit card codes to steal $30 million, in order to fly to Cayman Islands, and to take the hostages with them. It's now up to Paul to take the bad guys down Die Hard style and save Amy and the day.\n\nOver all, I would not say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, not by far, it does have a few good laughs here and there. It just went into different directions and most of the funny scenes were used in the trailer already, so it was something that I was expecting. Also not to mention that this movie had the most unrealistic situations, for example, Paul tries to leap from a speeding car to a speeding van, but he misses and falls down, somehow he gets back up like nothing happened and continues to run and climb fences. I know fear makes you do some crazy things, but that was just completely unbelievable as well as the \"love story\" and there was no chemistry with James and Mays. I would say if you want a couple little laughs, rent it, but otherwise, I wouldn't really say go out of your way to see it, it's not Kevin James' best work, he can do much better.\n\n3/10"

The whole theater was cracking up.\n\nIt's a typical Happy Madison film in that it shouldn't be taken too seriously. I was afraid the previews may have had all the funny parts, but I was wrong. There was definitely a lot more greater moments to be had. The film is obviously stretching reality by quite a bit in parts, but that's what comedy often times is about. I disagree with the many of the comments before me. I would recommend seeing this movie. Kevin James was great and newcomers Keir O'Donnel & Jayma Mays were impressive and adorable as well. Go see it if you get the chance!"

I just don't know of too much more that can be said after viewing either the trailer (preview) or the movie poster. Too me this is the kind of movie I might have sneaked into in my youth simply because I had watched all the other movies in the metroplex. Those were the days, when I would pay $7 and then hop from theater to theater until I had gobbled up every movie playing. Of course there was also no cable TV then either.\n\nBasically this is the story of a security guard working in a New Jersey mall. His dream has been to join the police force but his weight has always disqualified him. One day some criminals take over the mall and take hostages. Mall Cop Paul Blart is trapped inside and decides to help the police regain control and attempts to take on the gang on his own. Hilarity ensues.\n\nThis movie is the dream child of comedian Kevin James who wrote and then stars as the main character, Paul Blart the Mall Cop. The director is Steve Carr of Daddy Day Care fame. I won't lie, there are a couple of times that I may have shaken my head with some inner prepubescent laughter. Over all this is what you would expect, bad jokes about being fat from a fat guy. I have chosen to give it a few words because as of January 30 this movie has made a little over $83 world-wide. It was finally removed from 1st place on the charts by the movie Taken with Liam Neeson. I can only hope that by giving this movie some air time here it will have brought some people that will discover some good movies that I have written about. I beg you to go see them and not give your money to films such as this one. 1/10*"

A bunch of criminals running around on mountain bikes and skateboards was a bit labored. I liked the free-running, but I don't imagine that, in real life, a master criminal would've hired more than one...and that one would've been just coincidence...\n\nThis film had the perfect mix of humor, pathos and action, it just lacked that punch that a conscientious director would've given it.

That Kevin James co-wrote the script and created a well-defined character AND knew how to act physically (and take falls) is evidence that, given script and director, he is a true comedian. I'm disgusted by SNL alumni that think banging into things and shooting for an ironic persona is the stuff of comedy. Most of them are clumsy and obvious in both regards. Quick cutting masks the use of stunt doubles doing the physical gags these ersatz comedians should be able to execute. That Mr James can act physically as well as verbally, and knows how to write for his character puts him in proximity of the silent and early sound film comedians and well above most of the other comics of today. To see Kevin James to good advantage, see Paul Blart: Mall Cop. It's not great---only in comparison with other alleged comedies of today. Despite my dread of sequels, I look forward to Mall Cop II in 2015."

Accordingly, I thought that the movie would be very similar to most comedies that Kevin James has appeared in including: Hitch, I Now Prounounce You Chuck & Larry, and You Don't Mess with the Zohan. However, just to be safe I decided to wait until it was released on cable to watch it instead of paying the cash for the theater experience and I'm glad I did. Paul Blart was actually much worse than I expected based on the advertisements. The plot was pretty unbelievable and the acting wasn't that great either, not to mention that the majority of the cast consists of no names that aren't that convincing in their roles. If anybody ever criticizes one of Eddie Murphy's movies again, then they need to watch Paul Blart which was terrible. Even The Golden Child, Norbit and Meet Dave look good in comparison to Paul Blart. Finally someone produced a movie that makes Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan and Pauly Shore look talented which Paul Blart managed to accomplish with it's underdeveloped script."

He has an inner voice, he hears an altruistic echo that resonates through those hallowed halls of the mall that call him to action. Sure he doesn't appear to be a hero, someone may see him for the first time and think of him as a \"fat guy with a glorious mustache \" or a \"rent a cop with above average Segway skills\" or \"a person struggling with hypoglycemia, heartbreak, and copes with the pain by patrolling the grounds of the West Orange Pavilion Mall\". It doesn't matter to him what they think because he knows when the time comes for him to strap on his helmet, put down a quick pixie stick, repeat his core values \"detect, deter, observe, and report\". He doesn't need the world, but the world needs him. He is Paul Blart and he is our Mall Cop."

The story line is a sappy nonsense clich\u00e9 of boy meets girl and encounters an unreal challenge scenario where he proves to be a hero. Even so, I enjoyed watching it and think it is a great movie for kids. It's rare to find a well done, clean movie, that's not all computer animation.

Even a truly gifted comic actor like John Candy (when he was alive, of course) would have struggled to make this poorly written garbage work, and Kevin James is no John Candy.\n\nA charmless central performance, an incredibly unlikely romance (Blart falls for, and ultimately wins the affection of beautiful mall stall owner Amy, played by Jayma Mays), some ridiculous but not at all funny action, and lots of cringe-worthy gags all go to make Paul Blart: Mall Cop a total stinker. What I don't understand is how this film made so much money that someone has actually green-lighted a sequel. Yes folks, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is on its way"

What I think I didn't pay much attention to was the rating. A very important point of note about this movie is that it's rated PG! Now, if you love movies produced by Adam Sandler and such, you will find that this movie has funny parts. The plot, however, is overwhelmingly geared toward presenting a somewhat funny film for the entire family; as opposed to the raunchy, adult humor that Happy Madison usually presents.\n\nI just returned from a matin\u00e9e showing of this film, and if I'd paid full price for what I thought was another Happy Madison hit, I'd have been sorely disappointed. If you're looking for a movie with good, clean humor that you could take your kids to see, then you should love this movie. However, if you were hoping for a bit more...as I was...then you might want to wait until the DVD release."

It's a good kids movie, though the kid level in it could really be toned down a little bit. I'm surprised Kevin James got the role of Paul Blart. I was sure that John Goodman would have this in the bag.\n\n\"Mall Cop\" seems a lot like a 90s nostalgia movie. A movie that someone like John Candy or Chris Farley could have made back when they were still with us.\n\nThe movie revolves around the life of single dad Paul Blart (Kevin James). His dream of becoming a police officer is jeopardized by his low blood sugar. He trains to become one, but gets rejected when collapsing. He is raising his teenage daughter, living with his mother. To prove to them he is worthy of a real job, he gets the closest job he can get to a police officer, a mall cop.\n\nThere he meets Amy Anderson (Jayma Mays) who works at a kiosk called \"UnbeWEAVEable\". After numerous attempts and fails to amuse her, the mall becomes invaded by crooks who plan to rob the mall. They take Amy and store her in a place where they are keeping various other hostages. It's up to Paul Blart to take the down the criminals (in comical ways of course) and save the mall.\n\nDespite the film's overwhelming supply of fat jokes it isn't an awful movie. A harmless kids movie, just for kids. Thats what brings it down, because I don't really think adults will laugh to really at this. If they do, their sense of humor must be far stretched than mine. To conclude, it's harmless, made for kids, and ignored by adults.\n\nStarring: Kevin James, Jayma Mays, Keir O'Donnell, Peter Gerety, Bobby Cannavale, and Adam Ferrara. Directed by: Steve Carr."

This movie is family friendly with mild violence and no nudity.This movie was consistently funny .It was well written and acted by all those involved.It has some pretty good plot twists too.\n\nWhile maybe not a great movie it is heads above what passes for comedy these days.I saw this movie when it first came out and I'll rent it and watch it again.\n\nHopefully the success of this movie will open more movie doors for Kevin James,who is a great comedy talent.\n\nRock on,Dougie!"

There is at least 15 very very good jokes and scenes in this film & that is possible the most of any mall-based comedy-drama I have seen in the last decade. If there was an Oscar for \"best very good movie masterpiece of the year\", this would have won. If this movie masterpiece was a facebook post, I'd either react with a wow or a haha. The decision would be hard. I once watched the sequel with my friends and it wasn't as good. i fell asleep quickly, but woke up in time to see the scene with the swan or goose (can't remember which). Very good comedy gold and a good return to form for the series that reminded me of this very good movie masterpiece original! Could only be improved if lead role or main bad guy was played by Pierce Brosnan, or another ex-james bond actor such as \"Sean Connery\".\n\nVery good movie, very 10/10!"

I like how he moves, how he acts, how he uses his body not just for fat jokes (and there are many) but as a bombastic prop. He flies over fences, breaks through glass, and allegedly James did all his own stunts.\n\nSome jokes were good, some average, but the main issue I had was the creepy age difference between Blart and his crush. She's roughly thirty, while he is in his mid-fifties. That may work for George Clooney, but it defies believability to think a middle-aged, overweight security guard has a chance with a reasonable attractive young woman. And it is a little bit gross."

It took a while for me but after the first 20 or so minutes, I was very willing to go for the ride and just laugh my ass off at the physical comedy that James provided especially as it seemed to threaten to get serious during the hostage scenes. Some of those bar scenes were especially funny. All I'll say now is, if you just want something to make you forget your troubles for a couple of hours, Paul Blart: Mall Cop makes a swell time to relax with."

As a child I saw the same with Abbot & Costello followed by Martin & Lewis until their breakup. In recent years the heavyweight solo artist has been the since deceased Chris Farley and John Candy. The lost soul Mall Cop is played by Kevin James who at least looks more solid than the aforementioned two who imploded early in their career. This movie is a no-brainier so just sit back and laugh and enjoy just like a cheap novel you read through the middle of on an airplane flight and leave the rest on the seat for someone else.

There are scenes of hilarious, fun which include fat men running over dogs, fat men running into cars, and fat men becoming raging drunks. Then, there are scenes of intense, dark action, like elevator-fight scenes, several gun shoot-outs, and a car chase. So, the movie does have a bit of everything in it. which is a good thing, since it hasn't been shown in flicks for awhile, but, it's also a hard thing, since it isn't impossible to notice that the directors only really use a big man as they're hero for crude jokes, and a original plot, since the fight-scenes go a little out of they're reach. But, no need to harsh at all, because this is a triumph amongst corny-action films, a hilarious, funny and intense thrill-ride that will keep more then enough audiences drawn towards it.

One would think if you are going to have a comedy there would be some lines or sight gags that actually can make people laugh. Not so here. Very sad, and embarrassing to watch. James' Paul Blart reminded me of Jackie Gleason's The Poor Soul, which would have been funnier, but alas, Gleason has passed on. It is a real shame today's comedians do not go back and look at the comedic masters of the past. They could learn so much. But, alas, they think they know better. Believe me. They do not. Alas, alas and alas, I give up trying to remind them.\n\nThe story does get interesting, sort of, when Blart is alone in the Mall with the crooks who still have the hostages. Kind of like a Home Alone movie, but Mall Style. So you see where this is going. Interesting but still not funny or clever.\n\nI recommend that Kevin James either go into drama or sell cars. But, with all the car companies going kaput and laying off tons of people maybe drama would be the better choice. For some reason these so-called comedians do not have the timing for comedy, but they do have it for drama. I know this doesn't make sense but there you are. It's true. It's one of those mysteries like how were the pyramids built. Look it up. One clear cut example that comes to mind is Will Ferrell in the drama: Stranger Than Fiction. He was great in it . In comedy, no.\n\nDoes the movie save itself? I say no, but you know the outcome even without actually going to the movie. As long as millions of people pay millions of dollars to these so-called unfunny \"comedians\" nothing will change. And, that is sad.\n\nI think I will get one of those Segue machines\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.\n\nViolence: Yes Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No"

It's too depressing, especially when Blart humiliates himself at an employee get-together, and injures himself in a stupid accident while on duty. It's a conventional underdog trying to make good story, and Blart seems like a nice enough guy to root for. Kevin James is good enough in the lead (he also co-wrote), but some supporting actors are weak. The bad guys, the pen salesman, the daughter, the bully-turned cop guy, the girl-friend; all overdone at times. Some of them are annoying. The ending throws in a bunch of unnecessary twists that mean nothing.\n\nStill, this is just shooting for low-brow slapstick, and is OK on that basis. But turn off your brain before watching."

Finding a party occurring in the lobby, they decide to leave and make first contact later, but they find that the DHD is a replica and thus incapable of getting them home.

Not once did I care about anything going on on-screen, nor did I laugh once. The only thing saving this film from a pure 1 star rating is it's brilliant selection of classic rock songs that play few and far between. Even then, don't torture yourself. Just turn on the radio.\n\nYes, it's family friendly. Does that equal good family entertainment? I honestly think not. If you're looking for good family fun, rent a good classic and don't wast your time on this rushed, muddled mess of a film (it's obvious that they tried to get it in theaters for the holiday season, but failed at that as well)."

But he gets a chance to be the hero of the day when the mall falls under siege from a gang demanding a ransom, where his bumbling heroism sets out to foil the terrorists.\n\nThis probably isn't the kind of thing I'd generally give much attention to, but everyone needs to watch something a bit light every now and again and this fit the bill perfectly. As others have commented, the tubbier leading man has always been delegated to the comic buffoon role, most notably the late John Candy, whom lead star James matches quite well indeed. He gets a great deal of his laughs from how laughably over the top the script requires him to go at times and make such a prat of himself and indeed how silly the script itself is in places, in amongst a lot of the more slapstick and pratfalls kind of stuff.\n\nThis is simply gentle, light, family entertainment that you could comfortably sit around and watch as a family, which is a type of comedy that's becoming less and less nowadays and so you can appreciate that bit more. ***"

This movie may be good for under 13 watchers or for marijuana smokers... The movie is about a fat security guard who falls for some attractive woman. He has an opportunity to win her heart by outwitting terrorists who take her for a hostage at a mall. This might have been a good movie if they put some more realistic themes, not people popping up out of nowhere. The only reason why I watched this movie to an end was because I \"admired\" the stupidity of people who made this film. Don't waste your time watching this."

I fit that demographic. My young daughter and I laughed all the way through it - it was genuinely funny and I actually cared about the main character. Why some of the reviews on IMDb even get posted will never cease to amaze me - they aren't even reviews in some cases. The person who \"reviewed\" this movie by essentially blaming movies like Mall Cop to be why America has its issues is one that left me scratching my head. My advise to those that feel inclined to give ANY movie 1 star: Watch the trailer before you see a show...oh...you didn't even see it? Then don't review it! I gave it 10 stars based on the fact that it delivered what it promised."

        "review_title": "Fun for security guards and civilians alike!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Shortly into Paul Blart: Mall Cop, I was struck by a sudden realization that I wasn't sure if the movie was making fun of all security guards or just the ones that take their jobs too seriously. In pondering that question, I realized that the fun-poking that the movie does could wreak devastating havoc on the rent-a-cop industry in the United States. Can you imagine the terror if it suddenly became cool for security guards to slack off on the job? I don't even want to think about it.\n\nThe next thing I did was mourn the sad fate of the Segway, which was introduced to the public back in 2001 and was intended (and many people believed it would) to completely redefine the way we travel within cities and even design the cities themselves. It's easy to have believed that, too. Merely a year into the 21st century, the realization that flying cars remain distantly in the future (or, more likely, forever limited to fiction) paves the way for a strong belief that the futuristic vision of 21st century Americans that we have been waiting for might be something as simple as this curious little vehicle on which Americans of the future must soon be zooming around on.\n\n8 years later, however, the Segway remains wildly over-priced and conspicuously absent from the general public. At most it's a curious oddity occasionally glimpsed in public, popping up more often as a sight gag in movies like Paul Blart or Ron Howard's brilliant televisions series \"Arrested Development\" than as an everyday means of transportation.\n\nAnd it's use on-screen is doing nothing to improve it's public image! Paul Blart is a mall security guard who believes that his job is not only on par with a police officer, but even a member of the military. He zooms importantly around the mall on his Segway, calling codes and status updates into his shoulder radio even as his superiors sit in the main security office teasing him for being so serious.\n\nPaul is a lovable guy but the movie tries so hard to get us to laugh not only at his dead- serious attitude about his low-profile job but also at his weight and hypoglycemia issues that it becomes nearly impossible to accept his budding romance with a local hair-extensions salesgirl. Kevin James, of \"King of Queens\" fame, is a wonderful comedic actor who brings back fond memories of John Candy, but most of the movie hangs from him like a wet blanket.\n\nI do appreciate, however, that the movie attempts to get us to laugh without a single sex joke or body noise or any other such nonsense, and it's not overflowing with pointless profanity like so many other low-brow comedies these days.\n\nThe action and romance are both thoroughly ridiculous, as are the bad guys who take over the mall (with an intricate plot to steal, I kid you not, credit card numbers) and then race around it on skateboards and BMX bikes, , but it's important to realize that the movie is a fun romp around a barricaded mall, sort of like what you would get if you combined Dawn of the Dead, Die Hard, and Home Alone, and removed any possibilities of zombies or bloodshed. Home Alone, for example, was gorier than this movie.\n\nAnd besides, it also features the funniest Indian accent since the 1986 classic Short Circuit. Peanut Blart and jelly!"

They last maybe a week or so at the box office before going video. And I vaguely recalled the premier for this thing: it didn't look too funny then, but that was several years back. At least we gave it a shot.\n\nNow granted, I was never a King of Queens fan; never quite got its humor. But that's okay; it wasn't for every audience, and it was a TV show. However, James' comic-film performance here is weaker than yesterday's coffee. He tries way too hard: timing stunk, and his \"jokes\" got lost. And I'm not singling out James here. Most of the film's action was flat or lost all together.\n\nAnd Carr is not one of my favorite directors. I've seen the trailers and excerpts from a few of his comedy films, like DADDY DAY CARE and DR. DOOLITTLE 2. Was unimpressed. And obviously, he gave James little or no direction to work on this film.\n\nWe've all heard of Bad Casting and Bad Scripts. Well, this film was one of those.\n\nAnd agreed with a few other reviews: John Candy would have aced this role. Kevin James does not."

But nevertheless, they provided some funny moments which will definitely bring some smile.\n\nIf you a fans of Bruce Willis Die Hard - you can consider this movie as a light version of that movie, but with heavier leading role.\n\nIf you looking a funny movie - this movie is OK, but I will not recommend you to go to the Cinema. Just wait for the DVD...so the price that you pay will make your smile come more easy."

This movie is a movie in which I can have a good laugh at how cheesy, stupid, and bad this movie is.\n\nFor this review, I will be talking mainly about the acting, characters, and the comedy.\n\n1) The characters- For one, the characters aren't all that bad. The character of Paul Blart to me if a lovable, goofy, and funny character who should be a sympathetic character. HIs daughter, on the other hand, is just plain annoying in this movie. This character got on my nerves, but that's just what the actress worked with. The love interest is also kind of an airhead and the romantic subplot is think is just shoehorned in this movie.\n\n2) The Acting- The Acting was okay for the most part. The guy who plays the new guy, Vec Simms, he does well as well as the main star, Kevin James. Kevin James is a funny and goofy comedian who can make me laugh no matter what he's in.\n\n3) The comedy- To be honest, the comedy in this movie is a little bit lame, but still, it makes me laugh at loud in several places, and when it does work, it works well.\n\nAll in all, I consider this movie a guilty pleasure movie, and when I want some mindless comedy, Ill watch this."

I felt like I couldn't have said it better.\n\nThe title character is what he is,but he's also a gentle,idealistic guy who is very proud of his work,his work ethic and takes his roles as a security guard,son and father--a single dad,at that--very seriously. Paul(Kevin James,who really IS the sum total of much of what is good about this movie) cannot get most anyone at the mall,even most of the other mall workers,many of whom like him,to really respect him. He longs for companionship and love,which he seems to find in the sweet but somewhat vacant hair-piece saleslady(Jayma Mays,who has the best set of \"Carol Kane eyes\" since,well...Carol Kane!)who runs a Kiosk in the center of the large new Jersey super mall he trolls. When a group of physically skilled and mostly(stress mostly)well-trained burglars overtake the mall,take hostages and lock out much of the post-Thanksgiving \"Black Friday\" crowd,they don't count on locking in our hero. Of course,Blart's size and seeming inability to control simple conflicts(getting his butt kicked by an irate portly woman inside a Victoria's Secret a day or two before)would seem to make him hardly a match for well-armed thugs but,well...you know how this'll go.\n\nA respectable supporting cast that includes Shirley Knight(as Blart's sweet,well-meaning mom),Rani Rodriguez(as Blart's adoring daughter),Peter Gerety(Blart's boss,who utterly doesn't get him),Adam Ferrara(as the chief of police),Bobby Cannavale(as the uber-macho SWAT commander)and Keir O'Donnell(as the mastermind of the crime)are pretty much window dressing for James' movie,an obstacle course of various physical stunts and pratfalls that he executes with as much plain,honest effort as it does over accentuate his size. Another thing that the previous poster(among others)got right was the fact that James is as much picking up the mantle for the proud tradition of \"fat guy\" comic actors playing erstwhile lovable lugs/heroes such as John Candy,Chris Farley,John Belushi and Dom DeLuise. His ability to play both sympathetic yet fitfully funny big guys who are prone to disaster but also heroism is a somewhat untapped quality(outside of the occasional plucking of his non-verbal comedy on the long-running series \"The King of Queens\")that gets PLENTY of work and good use here.\n\nThis film has producer Adam Sandler ALL over it,which,while very easily identifiable(right down to Sandler longtime fave Allen Covert in a bit part),is more of a help than a hindrance to this very light,very easily digestible comedy. Not what many would call a \"high dollar\" or \"priority\" movie experience,this is a perfectly good rent or second-hand theatrical buy(i.e. \"cheap movies\")and,with your expectations kept low(perhaps VERY low),one can get the desired effect out of Paul Blart,New Jersey's best and bravest mall cop."

But his character, obviously meant to be a lovable schlub, turns out to be not lovable at all. He is a glutton, a stalker, and a ridiculous low-rent martinet. The movie offers few laughs, but does provide a bit of interest by satirizing DieHard. The supporting cast turn in journeyman performances. The movie suffers from a lack of funny."

See this movie! It's Kevin James' best film since 'Hitch'.\n\nI had really high hopes for this movie, especially after being so disappointed by 'Chuck & Larry'. But this movie's comedy does a much better job of mirroring that of 'King of Queens' only with whackier subject matter. I think I may have bit my lip when I saw the 'PG' rating, but there isn't a single kiddy or immature joke to be found. I hardly ever say this, but in the laughter department 'Mall Cop' is practically flawless.\n\nTake a chance on this movie; you won't regret it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is receiving an unexpected amount of criticism, and I'm unsure why. It contains minimal violence, even less in terms of sexual content, and the gross-out humor is far below the usual level seen in recent comedies. The antagonists navigate the mall using mountain bikes, skateboards, and impressive parkour moves. Clearly intended for a PG audience, it succeeds in that regard. It's a wholesome family comedy that everyone can enjoy. When I watched the movie, the theater was filled with families, all of whom seemed to have a great time. They laughed and giggled, and there was very little of the bored chatter often heard at kids' or family movies.\n\nAfter watching this, I couldn't help but think about the John Candy movie \"Summer Rental.\" Candy had played various roles in films prior to that, but in \"Summer Rental,\" we see the classic John Candy affable lug character that served as a template for many of his subsequent roles. His characters were typically some variation of that, and he portrayed them well, earning the adoration of many. Kevin James possesses a similar likable quality, and I hope that he carries on the easygoing legacy that John Candy left behind.\n\nTo echo Paul Blart himself, \"Don't dismiss this movie.\" As I mentioned, there were numerous scenes that had both children and adults laughing together. Isn't it worth at least the price of a matin\u00e9e ticket to share some laughter with your kids?"

When the mall gets taken over by some bad guys, Paul rises to the occasion even if the police doesn't want him to.\n\nThis is the blandest of PG humor from Kevin James. It has no bite and neither does his character. This super nice guy doesn't have anything funny. He's mostly sad and pathetic. Sometimes it's almost chuckle worthy but it's mostly snooze ville. The whole mass robbery scenario is just stupid and so is the movie in general. The bad guys are a strange mix of trying too hard to be hard, and hopelessly unweaponized puppies. Why try to be dangerous when the PG humor won't let it go there? It's all wrong."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kevin James is king in the comedy \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\". He plays the title character. Blart is a\u0085. (well, just read the rest of the movie title) who is a single father, lives with his mom, is a cholesterol poster boy, and is a klutzamaniac clown. But that is what makes Mr. Blart a piece of comedic art. He definitely takes his mall security job way too seriously probably due to the fact that he has never been able to be a full-fledged Police Officer because of failing endurance physical exams to get into the Police Academy. Blart goes into \"Die Hard\" radar when a group of criminals seize the mall where he secures. In the style of the Bruce Willis classic \"Die Hard\", Blart is entrapped in the mall with the criminals. He must use some John McLaneish magic my friends to save the day. The criminals do have held hostage several of Blart's loved ones including the female object of his mall desire Amy and his daughter Maya. Blart does do a lot of \"Yippe Me Calle\" falls through his slapstick stumbling adventures to catch the bad guys and rescue the hostages. Kudos goes out to Director Steve Carr for creatively incorporating the \"Die Hard\" homage within the \"Mall Cop\" plot. But Carr ran off the road way too many times with physical-comedy overkill turns, and gave bad directions with all the redundant subplots within the \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" storyline. Kevin James' screenplay of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" was not an easy sale at times, but thanks to his acting of his words it justified its existence. King James dunks it through with his side-splitting performance in \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" but the rest of the film's components died easy and was close to mal! *** Average"

He knew this masterpiece was coming, he saw it in my future. And now, I would like to explain how it has impacted my life. I was at a movie theater during the good ol' days of '09. I was very lonely, I came to the movie theater just for casual human interaction; I did not know what to watch. Suddenly, I overheard two teenage girls talking about a movie on display, \"This is such a stupid movie!\" one said \"Yeah, I can't believe losers are actually paying to watch this LMAO!\" the other said. As soon as I heard \"losers\", I knew this movie was for me. I went to go see what had caused all that fuss and it was Paul Blart: Mall Cop. No. Way. My father's voice engulfed my thoughts. \"Watch it son, watch it now\" and I did just that. I bought a ticket, the teenagers snickered as I passed, I got some popcorn and coke, and I made my way to my seat. Next to me, there was this middle-aged man. I accidentally placed my drink in his cup holder, so I said my simple \"Sorry\" (a riveting moment for me, for I had not spoken to a person whom was not forced to talk to me in a long time) and I started watching the movie. Paul Blart was so funny, he inspired me and made me feel less self-conscious. The middle-aged man then spoke up \"I wanted to be a mall cop since I was 7 years old, but now I have to live off mall cop movies because I am a criminal and they would never let me be mall cop\"; by the end of his sentence, he was almost in tears. I consolidated him, I told it was okay, that I too had a dream that I could no longer pursue. I forgot to mention, but I am SUPER rich, so I told him, \"You know, what if I buy a mall and just hire former criminals? I would hire you!\". He kissed me on the cheek \"You are the best! What could I ever do to repay you?\" he said. I said \"Marry me?\" (I am very rich so I had been carrying a ring with me just in case) and I got on one knee. He said yes! At this point, the movie was ending, and this is when I decided that I wanted Paul Blart to do our wedding vows. We got a look alike and he performed our wedding vows, and to this day, we are happily married. Thank you Paul Blart: Mall Cop for giving me the confidence to propose and being a movie about a mall cop!"

Just when his life seems to be at the lowest, however, he is thrust into a high-pressure hostage situation that tests his mettle.\n\nThe first thirty or so minutes of this film are legitimately funny, watching Blart blunder through situation after situation. James is an accomplished physical comedian who knows exactly how to comically move his oversized body.\n\nYet, the jokes stop being funny in the second half, when the film gets a little too repetitive. Those same \"fat jokes\" that worked so well in the opener are old hat once the climax approaches.\n\nThus, this is a decent little family-friendly comedy. It isn't great, but you'll genuinely laugh on more than a few occasions."

        "review_detailed_main": "This pallid offering barely qualifies as a comedy because it barely possesses any humorous moments. Its plot is so predictable \u2013 and mechanical \u2013 it might have been written by a computer. Kevin James plays an overweight loser who channels all his energies into his job as a security officer at a shopping mall. He lives with his mother and his daughter and suffers the mocking of his workmates with wounded dignity. Although he has a daughter, a five-line conversation informs us that she is the consequence of a marriage that was merely a trick on the part of the guy's wife to get into the States. He worships the owner of a stall that sells wigs, but lacks the necessary courage to ask her for a date because he believes she's out of his league (she is).\n\nIt doesn't exactly sound like a barrel of laughs, does it? But while the film is focusing on the pathetic slog of our hero's life, it is at least bearable. Although he's depicted as a loser, Blart doesn't have a malicious bone in his body, and he's amiable enough to make you want him to come through a winner. But then the story takes a Die Hard twist when a gang of thieves seal off the mall with the intention of stealing the takings from the major shops. From this point on, the story grows increasingly silly but still manages to avoid any humorous situations. Any meagre laughs are won by James' attempts at physical comedy as Blart tries to skid and roll around the mall like an action hero.\n\nThe lead bad guy pretends to be a decent sort for the first half of the film, and it's a little strange that he's more believable as a good guy than a bad"

I chuckled at the car-to-car leap scene.\n\nDuring the romantic parts, God help me, I started thinking about King Kong and Fay Wray.\n\nThe gang that takes over the mall is a bunch of acrobats on skateboards and mini bikes. If one has to leap from place to place, he does a somersault in mid-air. Food on the table for stunt folk, I guess.\n\nBlart's boss, the chief mall cop, asks Blart, Why? \"I took an oath,\" Blart says. \"We don't have an oath,\" chief says. Blart replies, \"I made up my own.\" That's clever.\n\nHe ends up wrestling with an aggrieved fat woman and her blouse pulls up, revealing a bra strap as wide as your hand. WTF?\n\nAll in all, pure out-of-the-can Hollywood B product. Professionally done, though.\n\nWhen the movie was over, my feet were nice and warm. I headed over to the mall to buy a space heater."

Just don't examine the movie and/or the plot too closely, and you will enjoy it. James plays a mall security officer with state trooper aspirations and frustrations over his love life and problems at home. (I love the scenes at the beginning setting these up!) He starts training a new recruit at work and develops a crush on a lady employee at the mall. New problems start to develop when she gets held hostage by the bad guys in the bank, and he has to come to the rescue. One of the rescue workers has a great role. This is a good movie for any comedy fans. I liked it.\n\n** 1/2 out of ****"

It had the potential to be a decently funny movie, something perhaps with heart, something that delivered a good deal of laughs and you walked out feeling good. I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning movie. Its definitely not Oscar-worthy. The real disappointment lies in the lack of humor in it.\n\nPaul Blart (Kevin James) is a mall cop that seems to have no direction in his life. They go to good lengths to show how truly depressing his life is. Paul sees a woman in his mall, Amy (Jayma Mays), running a stand for hair extensions. He realizes that he needs to be with her and tries to woo her, even though he has no self-esteem. Just as the story is falling apart, the mall where they both work is robbed in a supposedly sophisticated scheme. Suddenly our slovenly friend is thrust into a role where he can try to impress the love of his life and excel at his job at the same time. Easy to guess where this story is going, no? The acting was okay, the direction was tolerable. The problem is the script. As I said, the story itself had potential. It just felt as if the writers could decide where this was a character they loved or hated. It really could have used another re-write or two to develop the script a little more. The movie is tolerable, but realize that not only are you not seeing an Oscar-worthy movie, but you'll be a little disappointed in the laughs as well. 3/10 .Evren Buyruk from USA"

        "review_detailed_main": "Hey guys, I've just finished watching Paul Blart/Mall Cop, and now I really think I need a CAT scan to make sure I didn't get brain cancer....This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad it will make you puke..literally.\n\nLow budget would be a compliment...Acting.. what acting? If an average Joe grabbed an entry level (no focus setting or white balance) NTSC camcorder and re-shot this cow-dung-of-a-movie, than maybe this could be a bad C-category flick. I watched the whole thing, by-the-way. The beginning looked promising, I mean a couple of popular actors, Adam Sandler's name on the credits, etc. About 15 minutes into the action it looks like the screenwriter, director and actors said: \"F*** it! - Let the cameras roll and lets wrap this beotch up\". I have seen many bad movies, but this one takes the cake.\n\nQuestion for Kevin James: Dude, what the hell? Who's your agent? You were OK in that flick when you were a pretend gay fireman with Sandler, but now this? Hope you realize you just committed career suicide: you'll join Chevy Chase and John Travolta... RIP my friend\n\nJayma Mays (hope I spelled your name right) - history should be your major now, 'cos that's what you are about to be...i mean \"Epic movie\" was bad-ish, but this is rat-poison to you cutie pie...however, I got good news for you: you don't have to start waiting tables at Applebees - I'll help you out: hit me on my IM - na21ins@yahoo.com (I've been known to always help a damsel in distress)\n\n... In conclusion: If you want to buy a new flat screen and you're looking for reasons to destroy your old set, watch this \"movie\". Seriously, don't waste your time on this genital wart!\n\nPS: How in God's name did this flick get a 5.4 rating from almost 10,000 peeps? - Was that you Kevin James? Giving a 5 star to your own excrement is not cool... (or maybe Sandler got bored and hit the keyboard with his awesome good for nothing talent).\n\nHollywood, take notes: this kind of movie gives p2p sharing(you know what that means, amigos) super powers...If anyone had to pay to see this \"artistic creation\" you'd have a class law action suit on your hands....long live the Swedish pseudo-pirate guys!\n\nPPS: I am adding this to my original post: how the hell is it possible that some people gave a POSITIVE review to this crap...more than a star, etc... To the people who thought this was \"a funny movie\" , \"a great time\", etc: YOU ARE BRAIN DEAD... The world would be a better place without you, morons. You give America a bad name...your IQ all put together is - (minus) 500...etc. I admit that is is possible that Sandler and James hit the web with positive comments to their common diarrhea inducing flick... This is my 1st post on IMDb...this flick was so terrible it made me waste an additional 30 minutes to post this and warn potential viewers. This, for me, is like preventing a crime: DO NO WATCH THIS CRAP, it will hurt your insides and dumb you down!...no joke... read the rest of the comments here."

Yeah that is pretty much about it with some really overly use and predictable mild joke throw into the story from time to time, though I highly doubt anyone beyond 13 might actually these kind of comical joke.\n\nOne of the main reasons why anyone might watch was because of Kevin James; he is everything to this movie that I pretty much certain that if it wasn't for him this would have gone straight to DVD rack.

He gets attracted to a mall employee called Amy, His efforts to try to get a date with Amy are hilarious as he must first know how to work mobile phones and text messaging. One day, a gang of criminals put the shopping mall under siege and take hostages. Paul Blart becomes trapped inside, and because of his sense of duty, he refuses to leave. And he attempts to stop the criminals on his own, with very funny results.

Kevin James' character, while intended to be relatable, came off as more embarrassing than endearing, leaving me uncomfortable rather than entertained.\n\nThe plot was predictable, and the dialogue was often cringeworthy, making me question if anyone involved had ever been in a real comedic situation. Instead of feeling joy for Blart's underdog journey, I found myself rolling my eyes at the repetitive antics and lack of character development.\n\nOverall, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" felt like a missed opportunity, with little substance and far too many cheap laughs. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in the mood for an hour and a half of frustration. Save yourself the time and watch something else!"

Someone took a perfectly-good movie and tried to get clever with it, and in the process, ruined it by overstepping the normal person's ability to suspend disbelief. One scene I loved: Blart, his wife and daughter were eating breakfast and his wife was getting on his case for eating too much, and Blart replies, \"I'm just going to say what the kids say. Whatever. Whatever!\" His daughter comments, \"Daddy, kids don't talk like that.\" On the ropes, Blart counters, \"Yes they do dear.., the older kids...I've heard them at the mall\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Paul Blart is a mall cop with aspirations to join the police force but he always seems to fail with every test when he tries to get into the New Jersey State Police. The movie is all about how he deals with a certain incident at the mall one night and how he has to try and prove himself, you know what it's like, typical plot with typical characters and the people behind this don't even try to make this new or fresh. You see this movie is not well in my opinion an awful one, just a kind of very poor attempt at making a funny movie and what could have been a bit of guilty pleasure kind of silly fun, turns into something silly but dumb. From the team at Happy Madison Productions (who else do you expect) comes this movie and it definitely has the hallmarks of something Adam Sandler is involved in, just too reliant on Blart being inept and then the story is too.\n\nKevin James plays Blart and he is not very good in the role, I'm not saying he is again awful but he doesn't take the opportunity even with the slightest of possibly funny bits. The entire cast are pretty badly put together, its not that anyone acts really poorly other than James but the characters are so badly made that they are typical of a film like this but then really annoying as well. Kevin James and Nick Bakay write the film and don't do a good job at all, you know it feels at times like a decent joke is coming but then it is ruined by either James's acting or the direction of Steve Carr who seems to make jokes drag out more than these kind of jokes should.\n\nThe movie has very very few laughs but can raise the slightest of laughs, more of a laugh where you might feel guilty afterwards or just wonder why you found it the slightest bit funny. Most of the funny parts if there are truly any come from the physical side of the movie which is both it's best and worst attribute, Kevin James is no doubt game for the physical things going on humour wise but can't actually make it funny. Another thing the movie does is it takes itself a bit too seriously, I mean sure this obviously is trying to be a comedy but can weirdly try really hard to be serious and create emotion and thrills, that sort of stuff is not needed in a movie like this, especially one this dire.\n\nSo yes Paul Blart: Mall Cop, a film that gets a little but too much hate from some around but it is still a pretty bad film and one that should not have grossed into the hundreds of millions at the box office. I really can't see why we have to put up with films like this in the movie market these days, they are just too silly but not in a funny way and they serve as seemingly only money makers and the kind of film you see once and never again will you want to view it. I do actually think this kind of movie could have worked though but only with James not in it, James not writing it, James and Adam Sandler not producing it and basically Happy Madison having nothing to do with this, then maybe this could been a satisfactory comedy watch."

Everything he ever did was Barney Fife. Every movie, he was a bumbling, likable dunce who always got the pretty girl in the end. Same with James. James is the same thing. Everything is Doug Heffernan. Adding a mustache doesn't change anything. This movie was awful. Virtually every scene was predictable, and of course, a happy ending where he gets the girl that he could never get in real life. Yawn. His movies make money but they aren't very good."

Did you catch it? Clearly an amazing reference to Bicycle Thieves (1949)\n\nOr the fact that the lead SWAT office seems inspired by Michael Mann's HEAT? Another expert reference clearly woven into the screenplay.\n\nOr the Hello Kitty band-aid? Yet another reference, this time about a Japanese character being wrapped around a bloody finger, clearly about the J-Horror industry.\n\nNotice the way Blart moves from store to store, gathering and using supplies from each location. Clearly Director Steve Carr had a contemporary vision and message based on popular consumerism and their effects on people.\n\nFinally, let us look at the way Blart is connected to his Segway.\n\nEven Charles Kane, in all his glory, all his misery, searching for joy, wasn't as connected to his Rosebud."

What I will give this one credit for is being a comedy that is not profanity riddled or consumed with bodily function humor (except for the tummy rumblings in the air vent). Mostly though it suffers the same plight as most comedies ... it's just not very funny.\n\nNow there are some funny moments and it is really a pleasure to see a very NICE character in the lead, but just not enough laughs to keep the audiences coming back. Kevin James stars (and helped write) here as Paul Blart, who ended up as a mall cap because he couldn't control his blood sugar levels, and passed out during the state trooper camp. The bit here is that he takes his mall job very seriously and to no one's surprise, is a loser in love.\n\nI found his initial physical attraction to kiosk salesperson Jayman Mays (Epic Movie) a bit ironic ... since there are so many jokes about James' weight. I can only assume that Mays' performance is so over the top bad because that's what director Steve Carr (Daddy Day Care) takes has humor. Better support work was delivered by Keir O'Donnell (very funny in Wedding Crashers), Bobby Cannavale and the very classy Shirley Knight as James' mom.\n\nKevin James is talented and he likes to compare himself to Jackie Gleason, Chris Farley and John Belushi - other comedy \"heavy weights\". After Mall Cop, Hitch, and Chuck and Larry, he is still searching for just the right movie vehicle to compliment his TV success on King of Queens."

I find Kevin James hilarious in just about everything he does, and frankly, this looked like a pretty decent setup for a \"dumb comedy\" (I love dumb comedies, so that's not an insult in the least.) However, though this certainly had its funny moments, as a whole it really did not fit together as I found myself wondering if I were watching a Home Alone-reminiscent comedy about an under-appreciated maul guard protecting his mall in humorous ways or something serious. Not a good thing to be wondering.\n\nIt began well. It wanted to be good. However, there was a little too much exposition before the mall was actually taken over by baddies. All right, now the rest is funny stuff. But it seemed that most of the funny stuff was what was in the trailer, leaving us with awkward hit-and-miss humor and clumsy action.\n\nAnd then they started threatening people. And then Paul Blart's daughter got involved. And I started thinking \"This is pretty scary for a PG comedy\". Seriously, folks, these people were hostages. There was a little girl. Discussing shooting them dead isn't very funny.\n\nIt was well-intentioned, this movie was. Don't get me wrong. But the ingredients were, frankly, a mess.\n\nI'll stick with \"King of Queens\" reruns. It's funny and they don't threaten to kill people on it."

But slowly it does start to pick up again, and has a home alone vibe to it, but with an adult man battling other adult men. And it did get funny again in some parts, and was pretty violent for a movie like this.\n\nI did think it was endearing see the lead put himself through hell to try and rescue the woman he was interested in. My only gripe with this was that why couldn't he fall for someone who had the same body type as him? All the overweight women he does interact with, is in a negative way, besides his daughter. It would have been perfectly fine to have two overweight people fall in love.\n\nOne other thing, if the lead had a fainting condition, why didn't he carry sugar on him at all times?"

Star Kevin James, who also co-produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay, is a handsome, huggable cut-up who knows how to play to the camera; he gets easy laughs with a mean John Candy impersonation, and perhaps slips into Chevy Chase-mode for the 'poignant' moments, but he has no depth. When James is stumbling around drunk or bumping into things, our sympathies don't go out to him--it's just mean-spirited slapstick. The story is comedic \"Die Hard\" (with a little \"Bad Santa\" envy) and barely engages the attention. Jayma Mays is the wan salesgirl/love-interest with no personality or background; she's flung together with Paul Blart without us ever seeing how she really feels about him. Blart makes a cute video where he shows off his nerdy-cool moves, but it doesn't win the girl over (does she even see it?). Apparently, because she has big, round eyes and talks like a little girl, Mays is meant to be the perfect woman for our hero. It's an underachiever's idea for an action-comedy-romance, with moronic segues and supporting characters, and a child who keeps yelling \"Daddy!\" but is never allowed to lend a hand. *1/2 from ****"

We got it in the first ten minutes. We didn't need an additional 20 minutes of being shown that he was a looser.... get on with the plot!\n\nAnd predictable, oh my gosh, could they have followed \"the formula\" any closer? Looser, faces challenge, overcomes personal problems and idiosyncrasies in a ridiculously short period of time, he defeats all enemies, the end.

I just got the feeling from watching some of the scenes, they weren't worked out as well as they should have been. And the script itself needed some over haul, especially the ending. I did laugh at a few pranks, but I didn't connect with the girl who played his daughter, for starters. That was bad casting there. Some scenes appeared rushed, or just didn't fit the flow of the movie. It just seemed the director and producer said to Kevin, \"well, it's not great, but , what the heck, it's done, I laughed, let's go to the next shot.\" We kind of felt like that when we left the theater. \"it's not that great, but what the heck.

He falls in love with a young saleswoman where he works who sells hair extensions, but he's so clearly out of her league that all he does is make a fool of himself in trying to impress her. But Blart may get a chance to make a hero out of himself when \"his\" mall becomes overtaken by a group of amateur thieves one evening. About what I expected, which was pretty much nothing. I went to see it because my wife and I wanted to take our 13-year-old niece to the movies and after all, I am a fan of \"The King of Queens\" show. I didn't think this was too funny, and the character that Kevin James plays is his typical one-note type. But in this case, Paul Blart is so obnoxious and such an annoying \"wannabe cop\" to the mall shoppers that it's also not that easy to generate sympathy for him as we're expected to. I also can't believe that James has allowed himself to become way fatter than he's ever been before at this point of his life. I guess the short-lived period late on \"King of Queens\" where he had lost a lot of weight was just some kind of a temporary kick for him. ** out of ****"

I became a \"Die Hard\" fan moments into the film, even looking up Paul Blart merchandise to purchase later since I am a newly enthusiastic and proud Paul Blart fan. I relate to Blart's hypoglycemia and enjoy the use of humor to lightheartedly cope with the condition. Many people will relate to the themes in the film such as lonliness, doubt, insecurities, and overcoming adversity. This film will bring joy to all people just like it has brought joy to me. It has had a positive impact in my life. Some critics may be negative by calling the film kitschy and insignificant, but it is really a projection of their personal failures and lack of redemption arc in their own lives. I hope you all enjoy this film and it changes your lives as well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Paul Blart played by Kevin James, is the likable underdog in a movie that any child can follow. This is -after all- a PG rated comedy and exactly what I would expect from a family oriented movie writer. The story was your basic knight on electric Segway saves a damsel in distress.\n\nThe one critical point this movie missed on was the \"Black Friday\" build up. The plot could of had much more slap-stick gags added if they had expanded on the \"Black Friday\" being the maddest shopping day of the year.\n\nUnfortunately nothing happens in the movie on \"Black Friday\" and we jump from Thanksgiving Day directly to the mall closing up on Friday evening. Then we slide into the typical \"Die Hard\" spoof that will make the young children laugh.\n\nKeir O'Donnell and his crew was the poorest actors as they attempt to ninja their way through the last part of this movie. The director should have told them this wasn't a serious remake of \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\". Having the new guy as the criminal isn't that much of a surprise or plot twist.\n\nA few plot holes weren't filled in very well but this is a children's comedy and not to be taken as a serious real life drama. If you rent this expecting to see raunchy humor, action, or a deep meaningful plot with twists and turns you will be disappointed. If you plan to rent a movie for little kids to enjoy with their grand parents, then you won't be disappointed."

However, the plot is predictable, and the jokes can sometimes fall flat, making the movie feel formulaic at times.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" has a certain charm, thanks to James' likable performance and the film's heartwarming moments.

While it's your usual stuff that you see in any movies, it does do something different with the whole mall cop aspect. Paul Blart is a pretty developed character with his loneness on not finding a lover while grows attract to the wig shop worker. He's also does anything to protect the ones he care about and won't stop at all. The comedy itself is one of those that has a couple of funny moments in it, but some of it feel the same or dragged on too long. Half way in the movie he goes against robbers who trying to rob the mall while holding people hostage. That parts contains decent action scenes in it and the ways he take down the bad guys. Although the reveal of two of the characters aren't that impressive. The acting itself is fine for the most part and Kevin James does a good job on making the character likable to root for.\n\nMall Cop is one of those movies on if it your type of comedy or not."

However, he meets a woman who owns a kiosk in the mall but soon his life takes a twist and has to jump into action.\n\nStarring Kevin, Keir O' Donnell, Jayma Mays, Raini Rodriguez, Shirley Knight, Stephen Rannazzisi and Peter Gerety, this is directed by Steve Carr and written by Kevin James and Nick Backay.\n\nThis action / comedy genre movie has all the ingredients that can perhaps be said that, if this was only action then one can think of Bruce Willis. However, this is an action comedy genre and will have one in stitches of laughter all the way through. But one particular point that this movie has highlighted is that of being a diabetic has to be very careful when going into action \u0096 always keep something that has sugar in it with you in the event if the sugar levels in the body go down.\n\nNever the less, this is a good action / comedy genre movie and it will have you in stitches of laughter all the way through.

There were a few parts that yielded laughs,but nothing truly noteworthy. This seems to have a watered-down Home Alone comedy to it, so there are some creative and amusing parts.

He lives with his mother and daughter and soon falls for an attractive female co worker at the mall. On black Friday a group of criminals take over the mall and hold other mall co workers at ransom and it Blart takes it upon himself to save the day.\n\nJames I feel is good in the lead. His sense of humor fits the role well. Just dry humor that makes you chuckle. Good job. He also plays the character well and makes the character one that you sympathize with and root for towards the end.\n\nThe plot worked too. At first when I saw the trailer I thought that it would be a lame story that would be overly reliant on lame jokes. But it really is not. The villains in this film have a legitimate plan to take funds from the mall. SO the overall conflict of the film is real and I think this helps the film a lot.\n\nSurprisingly there is some really good action in this film. Its not often that you see great action in a film that is pretty much a comedy by all accounts, however this film has it.\n\nSo basically I feel James does a great job, it has a good story, good action, and its a good watch. I recommend it."

But only like one part or 2, but Kevin James is hilarious so I doesn't really matter to me but there is no reason to give this movie a terrible rating I just think people rather see a stupid comedy that has a lot of sex jokes and pretty much every line has a cuss word , but personally I like clean ones better sometimes it's nice to watch with your dad or mom without sex scenes every 5 seconds . And there's way more movies that are stupid than this and yet people choose this one cuz it's not a dirty movie and the movie the interview has a higher rating than this .

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow! Going into this movie I had really low expectations. I have always been a fan of Kevin James from King of Queens, I had no idea what to expect. This movie had EVERYTHING... romance, drama, plot twists, life lessons and amazing acting. Paul Blart is a nobody wannabe cop who works at a local Mall. His quest to win over the new girl was heart warming and romantic. He loves to ride his segway, and even offered to give her a ride. He *was* the knight in shining armor. The rest of the movie is focused on how he is going to save the day from the bad guys. Let me tell you, these bad guys are very high tech! Watch out. Even though Paul doesn't have a gun, he uses his wisdom and intelligence to beat the bad guys. I hope they decide to make Paul Blart action figures, because I would get 3 of them for myself. During the movie at times, I was day dreaming about how I too, wanted to be a mall cop. I believe Kevin deserves an Oscar for his acting in this movie. He does an amazing job by offering life lessons and encouraging big guys everywhere they too can get the girl of their dreams through dedication and persistence! Go Paul Blart!"

No vulgar language, gratuitous sex or violence (I mean REAL violence) and lots and lots of shoot-soda-out-of-your-nose laughs! I liked Kevin James in the King of Queens and fell for him in Hitch but this movie pretty much clinches it for me....I LOVE Kevin James! How can you not love this guy? He's cute, cuddly, smart, funny and doesn't take himself too seriously. But enough about the man, let's talk movie.\n\nThis movie is GREAT family-friendly entertainment. These days, you don't get much of that at the theaters, except maybe in an animated flick - and even those are sometimes iffy. This film has some of the best and most perfectly timed slap stick that I have seen in years. Paul Blart is a guy you can root for and probably see a little bit of yourself in, if you're honest. Plus, the values this film projects are those of family, honesty, integrity, hard work, love, friendship and honor. When was the last time you got all of those and popcorn too?"

It does go a bit far in the constant loser bashing verbiage, however the viewer will want to support the main character through to the end.\n\nMost of the fun was watching Blart move around the mall on his Segway while having hilarious encounters with the shoppers. Blart's love interest was a refreshing change from the usual loser girls with no values. This movie was well acted and the action scenes were impressive at times. I could watch Blart on a weekly series and never miss an episode as long as he is on his Segway and dealing with shoppers. This movie is Die-hard with a comedic twist and it works well."

I can't quite put my finger on whether Kevin James just carried the day by being so all-in on this ridiculous character or if there was some other sort of voodoo magick at play here, but I absolutely laughed my ass off from beginning to end.\n\nI rarely write reviews on here. I had to write one for this movie, because it's middling rating is an outrage to me. Before I saw it, I assumed this film sucked. Now that I've seen it, I'm calling it one of the best slapstick comedies in recent memory.

In fact, it's about a pretty athletic guy, who just happens to be overweight because of his hypoglycemia, and then gets the courage to use his abilities to defend the mall he's sworn to protect. Sure there's some bumbling along the way and a few lucky mishaps, but not nearly what I was expecting. It actually becomes a pretty bad-ass action movie.\n\nNow for the best part. It's clean. there's some semi-vulgar humor, but nothing I'd cover my 5-year-old's eyes or ears from. No real swearing, no real violence, no one dies, and it is still entertaining. It's not a 10 out of 10. I don't expect any Oscars, but you will kick yourself for missing this movie when you had the chance. Quit reading about it and go watch it."

The plot was in most parts fairly predictable but the laughs did do their best to help veer away from the obvious plot twist. Kevin James from King of Queens fame does a great job playing the bumbling no-body that ever one takes for granted but soon shows them that he is more clever and cunning than anyone gives him credit for. I'm sure that once in our life we ourselves have felt the same way so you can sympathise with the character and thats's where Kevin James and producer Adam Sandler hit the nail right on the head. They could have made this character into a know it all mall cop who always gets his man but they chose (and it was a wise move) to make him as bumbling and clumsy as Inspector Clouseau but with a hint of John Rambo and John McClane thrown into the mix. All in all Paul Blart: mall Cop is a fun filled laugh fest from beginning to end and yes it will even make you cheer by the end. \"Scuba-dooby doo\""

This film has some funny moments and not just the pratfalls and fat jokes. Kevin James, who co-wrote this, is not meant to be a leading man, so he's everyman. Films like this are either enjoyed or not, so don't take it too seriously. Of course some of it is ridiculous. However, I recommend it as escapist fun, so check your brains at the door and enjoy it."

Kevin James is at his best as a mild mannered-and lonely security guard at a shopping mall in the shopping mall capital of the world-New Jersey. He could't pass the physical for the police department, so he took this job. He is divorced, has a teenage daughter and lives with at home with his mother. He takes his job pretty seriously even though the other employees couldn't care less, and has the responsibility of training the new employee.One day at the mall, he meets a beautiful salesgirl at a kiosk, begins to fall in love with her. He also has to compete with her asinine boyfriend who really doesn't care too much about her. His mother and daughter have also signed him up for a computer dating service. Get the picture? After what is probably the most depressing Thanksgiving Day ever seen in any movie, he goes to his room, turns on his computer, puts on Barry Manilows \"Weekend in New England\" and sees if he has any replies on his on -line dating service. Nothing today, maybe better luck tomorrow.\n\nNext thing you know, on Black Friday, bike riding and skateboarding baddies take over the mall. Since he is not on his Segway scooter and playing a video game at the arcade, he is the last one to know. When he discovers the plot, its like \"Die Hard\" in a mall. He singlehandedly takes on the bad guys while the local police and a SWAT team wait outside and encourage him not to do anything. The film is fast paced, has some very funny scenes, and is comparitively non violent. You'll recognize all the standard mall stores like\" Sharper Image\", \"Victoria's Secret\" and the kitschy \"Rain Forest Cafe\" which is also used for good measure.The cast is likable and James, with a walrus mustache shows that he is a fine comedic actor. Even if you never watch \"The King of Queens\", his character is fairly convincing. You can believe that he is real and able to handle any situation that his thakless job hads him. The results are hilarious and heroic at the same time. With far, far too many terrible movies that come our way, this one stood out and delivered a good 91 minutes of fun and laughs. It was pretty heart touching too. You just want Paul to win the girl of his dreams.Definitely worth the rental, you won't be disappointed. Scooby doobie do!"

Any old intelligent dude can make up something original, but it takes skill to mold existing gags (jumping into break proof glass) funny in a new dimension, and i think Kevin James and Happy Madison handle this task excellently.

I will forever love this movie. I want to kiss the man who made this movie on the cheek, and give him all my money. I love both this movie and the sequel, they should make a third movie. I bought all the official merch and tickets to both when they came out. If they were to make a third I would buy tickets to the screening, please make a third one. Kevin James is a comedic genius, I will vote for him as president. If you hate this movie I will find you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't believe that I've read so many bad reports about this film, I almost didn't bother watching it based on what I'd read, however I'm a fan of King of Queens so I thought I'd give it a look.\n\nI have to say that I'm very glad that I did because this film has some laugh out loud hilarious moments, a lot of smirk inducing stupid moments and buckets full of soul. I felt genuinely sorry and frustrated on Paul Blarts behalf during parts of the film and exhilarated and happy for him during other parts.\n\nThe only reason for this is Kevin James breathing life into the character in exactly the same way that John Candy did with films like Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles and Cool Runnings. James has taken a rather sad, unfulfilled, unhappy character and turned him into a lovable, heroic, accident prone oaf that you will definitely have an affection for come the end of the film.\n\nThe storyline is weak, obvious and totally unbelievable but thats what makes it so enjoyable because you can just sit back and watch the hapless hero bumble his way through numerous hilarious set pieces. The parodies of other action films like Die Hard and Rambo are done brilliantly, the use of a Segway as his vehicle of choice is a master stroke and the warmth conveyed into the character of Paul Blart by Kevin James shouldn't be underestimated. I honestly felt like I'd gone back in time and was watching an old John Candy film. Bring on Paul Blart 2 because i'll be first in the queue to watch it.\n\nA great film for all the family and a solid 8 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" is a masterpiece in the realm of feel-good comedy, and here's why it deserves a solid 10/10.\n\nFirst, it's a unique blend of heartwarming storytelling and slapstick comedy. Kevin James' portrayal of Paul Blart, the lovable, well-meaning mall cop, is endearing and relatable. Blart is an underdog in every sense-overlooked and underestimated-but his relentless drive to protect his mall showcases the spirit of the everyday hero. This relatable setup makes his triumphs all the more satisfying to watch.\n\nThe movie also perfectly balances comedy with genuine warmth. Paul Blart isn't your typical hero, and the film revels in that. His quirks, his Segway, and his sense of duty all make him unforgettable. The humor might seem simple, but it's executed with such charm and sincerity that it elevates the film. Blart's awkward physical comedy and relentless optimism in the face of danger are not only hilarious but deeply humanizing.\n\nFurthermore, the action scenes are unexpectedly entertaining. The mall setting is clever and filled with opportunities for creative physical comedy, which James embraces with enthusiasm. Each set piece feels original, making use of the mall's unique features, from the play areas to the food court. The film makes you root for Blart not just because he's the hero, but because he's so earnestly himself-flaws and all.\n\nUltimately, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" isn't just a comedy; it's a feel-good story about perseverance, heart, and heroism in unexpected places. It celebrates the unsung heroes among us, wrapped in a layer of humor that's both accessible and universally funny. A true 10/10, this movie is a joy to watch from start to finish."

        "review_detailed_main": "Kevin James plays Paul Blart, a failed cop who is employed as a mall cop. He's pretty ineffectual at most things, still lives with his Mam, is obese and immature. But, he has a heart of gold. So when some creeps try to rob his mall he springs into action. How will things pan out?\n\nLet's be very clear about this: this is a comedy film, of the style of frat boy/slapstick variety. It's not utterly hilarious, but it is amusing and innocent in a na\u00efve sort of way. There's some scenes that in a more serious film you would cringe at, but this is light entertainment that the whole family can watch, and aside from latent heroism, it also features romance.\n\nIt's a far cry from some of the great comedies I've watched but it is non stop fun and sometimes laugh out loud. I really enjoyed it so gave it a solid 6."
