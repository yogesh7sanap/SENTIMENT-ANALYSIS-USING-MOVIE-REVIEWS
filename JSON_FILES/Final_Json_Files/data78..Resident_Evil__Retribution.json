        "review_detailed_main": "Let me put this simply as I can, this is a mindless action movie. I think Paul W.S. Anderson the director and writer was starting to run out of ideas and it shows, but I personally liked it because we had some of the same characters we already knew and I think it sort of works manly for the action.\n\nThe action scenes were great, the film makes no sense at all mind you, but mostly works because it's action scenes. Put simply, it's inconsistent in story for whatever reasons, I think some people that are fans of these films said there was more story from what I remember, but it was scrapped because \"Sony\" the studio I guess didn't like it, and they wanted it as a mindless action movie? I think?\n\nAnyway, Milla is good as always for this series and I like her sexy costume that fits well on her sexy shape and makes her look like an S&M dominatrix which is awesome. Also it's just fun seeing her kick zombie ass in slow motion, from what I remember she is in some kind of facility of Umbrella's and she has to get out for whatever reasons, that's basically the plot.\n\nMost may not like it but I did, for me, I'm an action fan and a fan of this series, it really hit the spot, this one delivers action unlike the others.\n\nI give it a 6/10. Not great in story but satisfying in action. If your a fan of these films give it a look. It's the last decent one."

Kills stuff.\n\nViewers hoping for a coherent narrative are advised to try Capcom's Resident Evil cartoons; viewers completely new to the series really have no choice but to let the images simply break over them like tsunamis. Despite 2 or 3 pages of exposition, series writer/director Paul W. S. Anderson clearly assumes that anyone rejoining him at this point is so familiar with both the movies and the various R.E./BIOHAZARD VGs that new characters (Ada Wong; Leon Kennedy) can be ported over from the games, and old characters (Rain; Carlos) resurrected without explanation (Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Luther West are back; Claire and Chris Redfield make cameos). Happily, I AM that geekish, so enjoyed the merry-go-round.\n\nThe CGI FX, which are virtually non-stop, are more varied, energetic, and original than in previous sequels. No more mutant dead dogs, thank goodness, although Anderson remains overly-fond of his tentacles- bursting-out-of-the-mouth shots.\n\nThe movie is less a script than a series of levels, as Alice, Project Alice, Leon, Ada and their ad hoc teams are dragged through artificial environments adapted from previous installments, from games (notably the new Manhattan and Moscow sets), from any spin-off that isn't bolted to the ground, even from absolutely unconnected franchises (e.g. DAWN OF THE DEAD). Each setting\u2014all controlled by The Red Queen--has its own horde of character clones infected with different strains of the T-Virus and/or Plaga Parasite and its own boss monster adapted from one or another of the games.\n\nIf...and only if...that paragraph made the least bit of sense, then this movie's recommended."

Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist entertainment with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack by Tomandandy . This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized , being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This sequel takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters , as there are 3 scenes from \u00a8Resident Evil : Afterlife\u00a8 that were reused in this movie , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women , as Milla Jovovich , Michelle Rodriguez , Sienna Guillory and Bingbing Li .

Here you have several blocks and a lot of stupid shooting and fighting without a hint to be a bit realistic. The final fight is like a raping of your mind - too much FX's, too less reality and common sense, it's against everything good in the world.\n\nActors are great. After a deadly injury a character doesn't show any sight of the pain except in his words.\n\nDialogs in the movie are fantastic\u0085 If you'll write down all the lines of all characters, you'll hardly fill 1.5 pages A4 size.\n\nWatching this movie a felt like I'm fooled - creators didn't want to work to make it interesting, they used CGI+FX+fighting+shooting without everything else that makes movie worthwhile, and sold it to me using a bright wrap.\n\nPeople were leaving the movie theatre in the middle of this picture.\n\nHope next movie will be much better."

On this level Retribution is a good fun night out with great 3D and plenty of action. It's fun to see almost all the characters from the franchise back, thanks to the Umbrella cloning programme and Ada, Leon and Barry from the games should please hardcore fans.\n\nRetribution really doesn't offer anything new, Milla is Alice and if she remembers anything at all she probably will have a feeling of deja-vu from the previous instalments but the movie barrels along from one gory, action set-piece to another without giving the audience too long to worry about how ridiculous it all is. Dressed almost identically to Selene from Underworld Milla looks great back-flip kicking zombies, rescuing the surrogate daughter and wearing two small towels again.\n\nThe action comes thick and fast with our various heroes running from the little girl Red Queen through various virtual reality zones including Moscow, Tokyo, American Suburbia and finally up top to the frozen Russian Sub dock.\n\nAll in all the movie delivers a undeniably fun but generic experience to the other films so if you're a fan, you probably will enjoy it and on the big screen in 3D is the only way to go."

        "review_detailed_main": "All I can say is, \"Stop.\" Just please stop. No more. Alice, shut up. We know your name is Alice. Enough. We're 5 movies in now and it hasn't gone anywhere and it's not going anywhere. It's not even enough eye candy for fans of the games. I blame myself for being a glutton for punishment I guess; I've seen all the Resident Evil movies so far so I guess I'm in for the long haul. An overlong-haul. The fact that I'm a huge fan of the games unfortunately doesn't help when passing judgment on the movies. Retribution is, in my opinion, the worst one to date. The story is just, for lack of a more sophisticated word, DUMB. *Spoilers to follow*An underground facility that uses clones to recreate outbreaks? Sounds like a huge waste of time and resources to me. And the reasoning behind having said facility? To show China what the outbreak would look like in the United States. To show Japan what the outbreak would look like in Russia. Really? You mean you couldn't just put a zombie in a room with 4 people and show them what happens? Or at least a computer simulation? Much more cost effective. Having a big dumb facility just makes for having a lot of big dumb plot holes and questions. With all of those clones running around down there, you mean to tell me you can't just repopulate the human race? How do you keep having enough clothes to clothe them all? Who cleans up the bloody messes after each simulation? Why does Wesker have a change of heart all of a sudden for the human race and wants Alice to help save it? Wasn't he hell-bent on trying to kill everyone in the last movie Resident Evil: I'm Lost? Why does Umbrella have a supply of leather costumes for Alice? Why doesn't anyone have to reload ever? Leon's not using the Chicago Typewriter and I don't see anyone shooting any BSAA emblems, so according to all reasoning ever, guns need to be reloaded occasionally. Why didn't Alice just F'n recognize the ridiculously OBVIOUS glowing \"bad-guy\" looking scarab on Jill's chest? HEY! That must be her source of evil! WHERE IS CHRIS AND CLAIRE REDFIELD? Whose bright idea was it to have a deaf clone?! THE LIST GOES ON AND ON!!!!!! Call this movie Resident Evil: Plot Holes. Although we love seeing our favorite characters and subtle nods towards the games, we don't appreciate them being utterly stupid. Please do it right otherwise you're doing us a disservice. Throwing in new characters doesn't do them justice. I'm really glad you included Leon so he could have such a stimulating conversation with Alice. \"I'm not letting you pass,\" \"Let me pass,\" \"Ok.\" And THAT WAS BARRY?! Seriously? Oh good, you gave him a Colt Python, so he's automatically Barry. Ada was at least legit; everything about her was right, if nothing else in the movie. Here they mentioned Las Plagas. According to this movie, Las Plagas are steroids you can inject into your Michelle Rodriguez to make her do X-Ray punches to people's hearts a-la the new Mortal Kombat. I'd much rather see her turn into a \"head sprouter\" than seeing her juiced up on 'roids. We've seen Girl Fight already. You know what, I'd rather just not see her at all, because she is in no way important. Oh, and hi Luther, I'm glad you survived the last movie and mysteriously teamed up with Leon. It's so important that you survived because you're such an integral part in this one...oh no\u0085 now you're dead. Great job. Everything about this movie is just stupid. I didn't see it in 3D thank God, but I'm sure that sucked too. It's time to just scrap the franchise. Matter of fact, it was time to scrap it 3 movies ago. Just make a REAL Resident Evil movie for the love of everything holy. Going in, you know the movie is bad, so I got what I deserved, but my God, I didn't think the franchise could actually get any worse. The bright side? This movie hit rock bottom so the next one couldn't possibly any worse\u0085or could it?"

Most of the action is just ridiculous...bad guys that don't die, guns that don't run out of ammo, characters that can be interchangeably good or evil at the whim of the scriptwriter. It's like a five-year-old playing with toy soldiers. The actors are so wooden, and look so plastic that I honestly couldn't tell if they were CGI creations or actual human beings.\n\nMilla and her husband should be ashamed of themselves."

The movie made it quite clear, early on, that there would be no complicated plot lines or character development. And the dialogue was equally simplistic. The lines sounded something like this - go to the 3rd mountain and collect 20 coins and 3 golden power boosters. One quickly sensed this was not a movie at all, rather a simple video game cut scene. Also problematical were the incredibly goofy scenes with thousands of bullets aimed point blank at the heroes and all of them missing. It just takes all of the fun out of a movie when there is absolutely no sense of danger to the heroes.\n\nOn the plus side, the action sequences were very well shot and the cgi was first class. That said, it just wasn't enough to make this reviewer glad to be sitting in the audience"

If you are a fan of the games and have been a complainer about the movies may not follow the game well this one fixes all of that. If you go see this movie I fell you must see it in 3D as I did. Every cheesy gimmick of things flying at the screen is in this and well it works that is what a 3D movie is supposed to do. You pay extra to see stuff come at you so why not do some overkill. A surprise in the plot comes at you within 10 minutes from the start. This movie is so entertaining with fights,action,sound and yes even got startled a couple times.

That have been true for all the others in the series so why not this one.\n\nWell was I in for a rude awakening. Honestly if you enjoyed all the former movies and you consider them \"part of their own story\" meaning that your pretty much ignoring the video games when watching the movies then you'll find yourself even more amazed by how terrible this movie is.\n\nI will avoid going into details about plot as others have done that and perfectly expressed the errors in it (I am of course referring to those more negative reviews you'll find as most of the very positive ones doesn't really put a lot of effort into mentioning it.. maybe because even they would have trouble claiming it to be a good movie then ;) ).\n\nBut I can easily sum-up the main problems with this movie: The plot and the acting. That is not a good thing for a movie and trust me it shows. The plot has some vague references to the former movie, but that's quickly forgotten and all your in for is a mess of action scenes and bad (and I mean bad) CGI effects. Somehow the actors manage to look not in the least interested in the gun battles they take part in, and at the same time do a damn good job to remove any sense of immersion you might have scrapped together, for instance by appearing utterly unfamiliar with handling their weapons.. There is some odd alien references.. or more likely \"inspired\" events that make no sense in the overall story and world.\n\nFinally the whole absurd-storm will end with you sitting back confused as to what you just watched, shaking your head in shocked astonishment, trying to comprehend just how bad it was. Then the anger will arise due to the disappointment of what this could have been and here I am writing a review to warn others.\n\nI personally will not count this as part of the series, I'll count it as the series failed little-brother rip-off that should never ever have been made.\n\nI cannot in any situation recommend this movie.. by far the most disappointing, meaningless and confounded mess I ever saw."

Until now. There is no way I can stick up for this movie or any reason I'd even want to. I can't really give you a synopsis cause I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its premise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening. Despite a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence, a best of franchise film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we than move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. I mean the choices are just astoundingly bad why make the little girl deaf and the film filled with sign language, why set it in this underground facility, why is all of this happening, with this type of technology how does the remaining human population even have a chance, how is Wesker alive and why is he good now? he's not human??? None of these questions will be answered and lets not even discuss the frustratingly awkward scenes like one in which one of the good guys has a double unnecessary death, an uninspired nod towards the Alien franchise and repetitive scenarios that get less effective the more you see them (really the squid face things). Also, the acting has never been good in the Resident Evil series but Milla Jovovich had evoked a cool sense of fierce heroine, this time around she just seems plain bored as do the other actors. Filled with insipid dialogue, questionable plotting,overlong pacing, a weird bad movie from the 90's score, mediocre fight choreography (except for the scene with the chain) and a crapload of wasted potential this movie just feels like a bad dream. Sometimes, when I'm really looking forward to a movie I'll dream about it the night before and it will be horrible well this is what this feels like. Because in no possible way, what I just watched is a resident evil movie. Despite all of my complaining the movie does have some decent scenes the suburbia one I brought up before was kinda neat, another featuring Ada and Alice against 2 ax men and the chain fight in Tokyo. Besides that it's all just a big plodding waste of existential cinematic trash. A brainless, soulless unintentionally funny horror/action/sci fi hybrid that despite a larger budget,returning cast members and more impressive production values feels like an overlong filler episode that leaves me with a big question mark. Why has this happened to my beloved franchise???"

        "review_detailed_main": "For me this series of films keeps getting better. I never liked the first two Resident Evil's (maybe I need to re-watch them seeing it's been a while) but I really never took much notice of them until Apocalypse. That was a game changer and they keep improving. It doesn't matter the story has drifted away from the computer game. In Retribution, the plot kind of swings back to origins with Alice back inside the Umbrella corporation through circumstances set straight after the last film when she jumped off an exploding tanker into the ocean. Milla Jovovich should be enough reason to watch the grass grow if she was lying on it and she does not let any of the fans down here. Her kick ass attitude remains as does her armory. Michele Rodriguez also returns in not one but two roles and the concept is an interesting one. There is also a subplot of a Young deaf girl who Alice protects. Escaping through artificial cities such as Moscow and American Suburbia being pursued by zombies, monsters and foot soldiers makes it different. Must see as far as I'm concerned, the 3D is quite effective too."

Apart from the once in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 & 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always, but that won't save the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting, especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil series and you don't mind wasting your money and time for the sake of this series."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Resident Evil movies have for years been a source of mindless popcorn fun, stylish, violent and fast paced. Retribution follows the same basic pattern, but it doesn't do it quite as well, resulting in a movie with some entertaining sequences that winds up feeling rather pointless and very nonsensical.\n\nThe film begins very well, with a big battle shown backwards in slow-mo. This is followed by a purposefully disorienting scene and then a few minutes of the traditional sight of Milla half-naked. Then we get some more wild, puzzling action scenes.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nThe central gimmick behind the varied locations of the movie, which include the suburbs and Tokyo, allows for some cool scenes, but also put the movie in danger of feeling episodic, a danger blithely ignored by the director. It is also one of these gimmicks that doesn't make much sense, and as the movie progresses, the number of things that don't make sense multiply. The movie also has the least character development of any in the series, which is saying a lot.\n\nThis should not be a movie, this should be a video game. Video games, for better or worse, have low story requirements, and work well in an episodic format. In fact, the \"greatest hits\" quality of the action, which brings back old locations and old monsters, reminded me of the game The Umbrella Chronicles.\n\nI still found this fairly entertaining, although I was torn between giving it 6 stars or 5. This movie looks like it's a set up for a series finale, but I'm not sure if the makers have any fresh ideas left for another movie; this one recycles a lot. Still, it wasn't so bad that I won't watch the next one when it comes out."

The only reason anyone seemed to like this movie was because they got to stare at Mila for an hour and a half. If all you want is to stare at Mila use a Google images search.\n\nThey could have cut this whole movie down to 20 minutes and given us a real story for the next hour. But that would require writing a decent script. If the dialogue in this movie was more that 20 pages I would be surprised.\n\nHow any one can defend this movie baffles me.

Even the action scenes themselves are horrendous, with mediocre at best special effects in most parts and ludicrous scenarios that never play well off of one another, not to mention the 20 page script for the entire film. The only lines delivered all seem like they were a Jr. High film project, and add nothing to the story except one liners and catchphrases.\n\nAll in all, this film is easily on my top 10 worst films of all time list, and I doubt many things will surpass it in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "The franchise divides opinions: fans of the games do not accept the fact that the protagonist is a character created just for the movies. But is Milla Jovovich who steals the show and has established itself as one of the greatest actresses of action cinema. His Alice is the soul of Resident Evil, and is even more comfortable in character. With mastery, the actress gives a show of girl power and performance.\n\nIn the first film, the characters followed by claustrophobia Beehive. With a more elaborate script and betting on terror to scare the audience with a few doses of action and characters more depth, it is still the best of them. Since then, the franchise began to exchange terror for action - betting on the clich\u00e9 \"more is better\".\n\n'Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse' Alice showed a genetically altered with super-powers, walking the night streets of Raccoon City, fighting not only against zombies, but also against other aberrations more \"evolved\" and deadly. The film presented the beloved Jill Valentine, but not wowed.\n\nIn Resident Evil 3: Extinction 'director Russell Mulcahy was able to resume the reins of the franchise, creating an interesting post-apocalyptic world and a Las Vegas desolate. The production was a bit better than the last, and presented Claire Redfield, Jill left in place (without much explanation).\n\n'Resident Evil 4: afterlife' was again directed and scripted by Anderson, who wrote a vulgar and superficial plot, hoping to unite all the outlandish action scenes with little dialog. The result was a range of characters shallow, betting on 3D effects. Neither the presence of the brethren Redfield managed to save the production.\n\n'Resident Evil 5: Retribution' (Resident Evil: Retribution), again written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, can regain the quality of the first film, and features a plot slightly more evolved than the last.\n\nThe film begins with Alice exactly where we last saw the end of Resident Evil 4: Restart - on the deck of the mysterious ship Arcadia, where she hoped to find more survivors of the epidemic.\n\nBut in reality, what awaits is a battle of his life, when his former ally, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), and a squadron of helicopters terrible V-22 of the Umbrella Corporation approaching with orders to shoot to kill .\n\nAlice awakens in the heart of Umbrella's clandestine operations, and discovers more secrets of his mysterious past as delves into the complex. Without a safe haven, Alice continues to hunt those responsible for the virus, a chase that takes her from Tokyo to New York, Washington, DC and Moscow, culminating in a mind-blowing revelation that will force her to rethink everything she believed to be true .\n\nWith a frantic pace, all scenes are loaded with zombies, explosions, monsters, shootings and fights. It's difficult to breathe between one sequence and another, since the great 3D takes you into the screen.\n\nThis is what most resembles the games: the Red Queen commands the action, announcing where the protagonists will then separating the battles in stages where characters must dodge enemies - like La Plagas and the Axemen. Just one joystick to get you into the action.\n\nAnderson came up with an ingenious way of bringing back characters who had suffered brutal deaths in the previous films, including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez, and always great playing several characters) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory in acting weak and full of catchphrases). Carlos (Oded Fehr, great), Luther West (Boris Kodjoe, good) and Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) also return in style.\n\nWho gives a show is China's Li Bingbing ('The Forbidden Kingdom'), who lives Ada Wong, Wesker agent that fights alongside Alice. Very comfortable in the role, she will win over fans of the games and movies. Johann Urb also shows great talent as Leon Scott Kennedy.\n\nThe sequence in which Alice appears as a simple housewife in the suburbs is the best, showing that what is missing is the action excessive leave aside and return to the horror genre - Anderson seems to know that driving with more wisdom.\n\n'Resident Evil 5: Retribution' will appeal to fans of the franchise and action movies, with breathtaking sequences and doses of suspense and laughs volunteers - but starts to show some wear. Is your brain off and watch a dazzling game without being in charge of the Joystick."

Is it worthy if you go with the 3D? I can say yes, i'm sure you won't be disappointed with it's 3D effects.\n\nOn the beginning you will be given a quite remarkable thrilling scenes.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, how to even start? I was looking forward to seeing this film, but didn't have high expectations and that was a good start.\n\nThe initial trilogy had sense and a bit of realism, but the last two...well, to be quite honest I don't even know what the hell am I watching, except sexy Milla Jovovich and enormously high quantity of CGI and action scenes.\n\nI remember when I've seen the first RE. It was different, scary, action packed, but about the T-virus, zombies and escaping the HIVE. The second one continued with the recipe and I was blown away when they introduced Nemesis. It was such an action movie with a soul and then they gave Alice super powers. Which was kinda cool. The whole concept of being a mutant in an empty, soulless world as shown in Extinction...was once again different and fun to watch. The fourth one, tricky at least, I was happy to see more characters from the game series, but somehow I feel new characters was all it brought. It managed to keep me on edge. i was waiting, expecting and at the end...NOTHING. Kind of disappointing, but it gave a hint that everything will be clarified in Retribution.\n\nIt gave a hint, but after the brilliant opening scene, recapitulating all the past events, we receive mindless CGI fighting scenes, no answers considering the Afterlife, just three questions; 1) How is Wesker ALIVE? 2) What the hell is this story about? 3) What's with the whole CLONE idea which was dumb even back in the 90s?????\n\nThis movie is fun to watch if you like mindless action, but if you prefer a good story and motivation for the characters, then you'll find yourself disappointed. Even the zombies became secondary in this title - weird, considering this is a horror/zombie franchise.\n\nTo conclude, i sure hope RE6 will return to its roots in some way and bring back REALISM and DEPTH to its story, considering it will probably be the last one, so at least don't screw it up, but conclude it in a respectful and decent way as it begun back in 2002."

I enjoyed the returning cast, Michelle Rodriguez has been one of my favorites that has been absent from every movie except the first one and whom I felt played a very compelling role in the TV series Lost.\n\nThe plot takes some reading between the lines, and I think an understanding that certain details are ultimately left out of the movie to build suspense for a later sequel, or at least I got that feel from a few details that were left open ended by the end of the movie. The movie does explain the previous movies in an acceptably short time frame to give just enough details so that a first time viewer can pick up on the Resident Evil story \"so far\" however I strongly recommend viewing the previous movies first for any new comers to the series.\n\nThere aren't a lot of character conflicts, There aren't a lot of overly long drawn out emotional scenes. I think these are all fine oversights because the movie focuses on what it is supposed to do and does well: Lots of action. It seemed like every moment of the movie something was happening to the point where there was no reason to slow down and clutter it up with a long dialog scene here or there. It was paced well, wasn't drawn out to long, and changed enough to avoid becoming tedious.\n\nI thought the movie was okay on plot, it did enough to be a movie and support the action. It scattered in some new details about Umbrella and it's opposition. I felt like a few details were intentionally left out for sequel(s), and like the other Resident Evil movies this one also ends on a cliff hanger.\n\nI think some of the other action movies this year have been a bit of a snooze because they tried to hard to be epic in every way with big dramatic characters and big dramatic dialogs, this movie picked action and did it well. I rated this movie based on the merit of being an action movie as a 7, maybe just below that but not quite a six."

Yet the general public's response was actually quite good. Looking back, that movie had its flaws but was very enjoyable and intense. Anderson managed to create a claustrophobic atmosphere whilst providing enough doses of action. The story was not really important at this point and Anderson played with the audience throughout the movie, making Jovovich's Alice a character very easy to sympathize with.\n\nThe sequels, however, did not provide enough character moments or story and opted to turn the franchise into a mindless action disaster. Even though the third entry (Extinction) managed to improve on the character development and story department(thanks to Mullcahy's direction)the craziness was still the spotlight. All these positive aspects were then thrown completely away in the fourth installment. The story was all over the place, the audience cared more for the undead than for the characters, the action goes from crazy to \"WTH?\" and so on.\n\nNow these movies are enjoyable no matter what.

It is a shame because something really good could have been made after the original since there was so much potential.\n\nResident Evil: Retribution is not different than the three sequels but does mostly everything MUCH better.\n\nFirst, Anderson makes sure he brings back the best characters the franchise has had in the past movies connecting Retribution with the first entries. He then provides the movie with a simple but interesting story (in a similar way to the original), immersive 3D, over the top action sequences and outstanding visuals.\n\nRetribution is the \"Fast Five\" of the Resident Evil franchise. It may not be the best but it is a very decent sequel that fans will absolutely love, the general public will enjoy and critics will hate with a passion.\n\nThe movie is as short as the others but is incredibly fast-paced with non-stop action. There are many continuity issues and plot holes but after four movies, you know exactly what you're going to get and be prepared for Retribution to exceed your expectations.\n\nThis is no masterpiece. There are no strong performances or a deep story with original ideas. This is a fifth installment in an mindless action zombie franchise and in that aspect, you CAN'T get better than this. It is certainly better than all the sequels as it manages to restore the sensible elements from the original (some jump scares and tense moments included!) whilst keeping the insanity and absurdity of the sequels.\n\nShort, fast-paced and visually impressive, RE:Retribution is a fifth installment that really works.\n\n8/10"

The trend continues as it's more of a action film than a horror film since the first one. And no real surprises which is disappointing ,also Afterlife is a better film than this one . You get some familiar faces also returning which is good, but things do seem rushed as the running time is around 90mins. plus the writing is lacking a bit, mashed up with lots of chaos to hide the weak points of the film & a borrowed element from another sci-fi film in the mix . It's entertaining enough & the return of Sienna Guillory is awesome but you'll want more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Two words for it: TOTALLY GARBAGE! Hollywood has butchered this awesome game-series to the level of beyond recognition, unlike the butchering of its previous movie-series. There are two types of people who would critic this film: the die-hard fan of Resident Evil franchise and the ordinary film-goers.\n\nI've seen this in 3D, and as a RE purist gamer, these four criteria are on my checklist: 1) Stick to the game's storyline; 2) Brilliant plot if criterion #1 is too difficult to visualize; 3) Awesome 3D effects and 4) Well-coordinated cast. Like being sucked by the virus of Las Plagas, Hollywood had sucked completely the first three criteria! Even criterion #4 is somewhat only mediocre to be mentioned of. If you're in the second group, you'd be also feeling disappointed. Guaranteed. At least the previous four movies though lack of criterion #1, they still have decent criterion #2.\n\nThe original storyline developed by Capcom are far far different and brilliant enough! I tried a little bit of the first PC-based RE game, watched my bro played RE Nemesis, and played myself PS2-based RE Code Veronica, RE 4, and X-box 360 RE5. Each of them has bloody brilliant storyline. I could never understand why Hollywood would deviate from them and introducing non-original character of Alice. We don't need Mila Jovovich. We need Chris, Jill, Claire, Leon, Ada, Steve and Sheva.\n\nWe've seen for the first time the adaptation of Ada Wong and Leon S Kennedy. Costume-appearance-wise, Ada is quite okay and she sticks to the agility of her character, though her voice is somewhat funny like a Chinese whom recently learned English. Leon, as my most favorite character in RE, was quite disappointing because in the film he's not much of a fighter and\u0085 he should be clean-shaved too. He's not Thor for God's sake!\n\nThe series have been transformed into typical Hollywood shoot shoot bang bang fantasy wrapped in so-called good CGI and without purity of original horror element. I feel like I'm watching Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter where there are endless mindless fighting scenes. And what's this tag-line about going global-sh*t?! You'll be deceived because the only truth of that comes at the very end of this pitiful short film, where you just starting to feel the hope and rejoice but then, \"The End\". 6.5? Really? Just save your money from watching this junk.\n\nVerdict: Worse than filthy zombies. Get it?"

The action sequences are overall pretty good, if repetitious, and the story line, although simple-minded, is a decent enough backdrop for the theatrical and showy action scenes.\n\nWhile I still think the third movie, Extinction, is the best one by far, this one I liked a lot more than the last one - \"Afterlife\", which I thought really stank. Nice special effects and visuals, and the 3D was not distracting or annoying, which was welcome (I tend to dislike 3D movies in general)"

Why would you want to watch any Resident Evil movie come to think about? Good acting\u0085nope. Intelligent and intriguing plot\u0085absolutely not. Zombies\u0085yep. Action\u0085most definitely yes! Anything else\u0085well if you're member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.\n\nNow that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.\n\nI think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvelous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I'm hardly among the younger part of the male audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.\n\nIf I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill's chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like \"did you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards\".\n\nI cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back. That she lost those was one of the big downers for me in one of the previous movies in the franchise."

I guess the wacky plot didn't really bother me too much though, since it is a zombie movie, so my belief is suspended pretty high anyway. But the movie just wasn't scary, and for a zombie flick, there should be some decent scares.\n\nWhen I saw that it was released on Blu-ray the other day, I started thinking about the movie all over again. But this time, I took it all in from an action-flick perspective. I realized I had to own this movie. Retribution is balls to the wall action and eye candy. It doesn't get much better than this. It's funny that that's all it took to totally change my mind about this film, but it did. Retribution has everything you'd look for in an action film, plus zombies. I'm not saying it's film of the year, but it's a very satisfying action movie experience. Something you'll watch for the action and graphics, not for the scares. If you take the movie this way, you'll enjoy all it has to offer. 8 out of 10 stars."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Retribution",
        "review_detailed_main": "Is there really a need for another Resident Evil movie? Writer-director Paul W.S. Andersen had come out to categorically state the next film will probably be the final one, and the finale in Retribution is pointing straight at it, but whether or not it will be made will depend on how well this film does. It'll likely make a lot of money, or enough to warrant a green light, but what a chore it was to sit through this film, which I rank probably the second worst of the lot after Apocalypse.\n\nIt started off where we last left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice losing her superhuman powers obtained in the last few films, and facing a full scale assault on board a ship, led by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). There was some unnecessary time wasting to provide the opening credits in slow motion, played to tomandandy's score which will pepper the entire movie frequently, for obvious lack of aural creativity, but who knew that would be ominous to what's coming up ahead in this installment, which made it seem too generic, and an unnecessary addition to the mythos thus far. The opening credits gave way to Alice giving a quick lowdown summary of what had transpired since the first film, which was good given that it is now 10 years since the start.\n\nBut then it went downhill from there. It seems that Andersen ran into writer's block, and with shooting deadline looming, decided to bring us full circle thematically to Episode 1, with Alice waking up in captivity in similar skimpy, well, non-existent costume, before it becomes a mad escape from the confines of an Umbrella Corporation facility, this time a testing grounds for the development of the T-virus. Help comes in the most unlikely form of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), and his trusted agent Ada Wong (Li Bingbing), with whom Alice must join forces in order to evade the clutches of The Red Queen (Megan Charpentier, voiced by Ave Merson-O'Brian), which had taken over Umbrella the time that Alice was knocked out.\n\nNeedless plot arcs involve the assembling of a motley crew of mercenaries, which included some characters from the past for a rescue and extraction mission, but you know it's all a smokescreen given that the Resident Evil films have always been girl power, so they were bound for the casualty list sooner or later. And gun fights are just plain ordinary again, ducking and shooting, and the planting of explosives just to pad the film out a little longer as they battle faceless, uniformed Umbrella foot soldiers, because the Alice-Ada half involved more CG creatures and environments that resemble modern day cities, and suburbia, which probably had cost more. And it's interesting that the Suburbia landscape was the most out of place, if only to allow Juvovich to celebrate her motherhood with Alice's daughter Becky(Aryana Engineer) thrown in for a small emotional arc, proclaiming something she would do in a real life parallel in never leaving a daughter behind no matter what.\n\nScenes seem to be haphazardly pasted together, with fight sequences done for the sake of, lest someone complains about the lack of action, especially involving Alice kicking serious ass. Scenes bring your attention to something, then get quickly forgotten or are inconsequential, such as the injury Alice sustained that got us looking at her blood stained palms, twice. The zombies here are few and far between, with one dedicated scene early on having Alice obliterating a Japanese zombie mob with chain and handgun, just for the sake of to prove she hasn't lost her edge, and probably to allow this film to world premiere in Tokyo. Fight sequences only picked up when they involve close quarter combat, and while the final big battle felt like an afterthought not to shortchange audiences given the rather plain and admittedly boring, stuffy moments, it was the best in the film, where Alice goes up against Jill Valentine, and Michelle Rodriguez's Rain, or one of many test clones imprinted with some basic memory, as explained in the film, going up against Leon Kennedy (Johann Urb) and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). You'd have to last almost 80 minutes of mediocrity though, to get to this point.\n\nResident Evil is actually about ogling at Milla Jovovich for 90 minutes, and in the IMAX 3D version, if her complexion is left digitally untouched, it's almost flawless, proportional, and silky smooth beautiful. Kicking ass becomes secondary here since the actress has perfected it for five films already, although her Alice here somehow lacked the spunk found in the earlier versions, as if already tired from yet another installment that didn't seem to go anywhere, until the epilogue that teased of a more hopeful sequel / final installment. Li Bingbing was supposed to be the other highlight, being the first Asian female to grace the franchise, but having limited screen time, her role was only made memorable in being appointed the details spokesperson using almost halting English, and perfecting the Angelina Jolie inspired sticking-the-right-leg-out-of-her-dress look, with every scene always requiring that pose. It's also a nice welcome back for Michelle Rodriguez, but having nothing much to do, pretty much makes it a boring comeback.\n\nStill, I don't see how this installment would deter its fan base, both from film and the video game. One can only hope that should another film be made, it'd be a lot more promising from where this movie left us off with a big setup for an all out war. To end the franchise here would make it incomplete, so hopefully Andersen can up his ante and deliver an ending worthy to sum up the franchise with. With a heavy heart, I'd say non fans may want to skip this movie because it doesn't add anything to the ongoing franchise, unless you'd like to watch Milla in action as her most enduring character yet."

This film feels like it was slapped together in a couple of months, not even. I didn't think they could make a worse one than afterlife, well it's not that bad, but it still numbs my brain.\n\nLet's start with the characters. You would think film has reached an all time low with these actors. This was a fairly big budget film, couldn't they have got better people. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, they should feel embarrassed, it is simply atrocious. Did I mention these characters are super-human and can deflect bullets. Take this for example, 6 guys versus 500 umbrella soldiers armed to the teeth, and they lose one guy, to a chainsaw man no less. Or how their car gets shot a couple hundred times, even point blank through the window, they still remain untouched. These have to be the worst actors i've seen in a long time. If you want wooden characters that sound like they are simply reading their lines out loud, look no further. This film came out in 2012, but the cgi looked horrendous, absolutely abysmal. I have to say Jill Valentine is bad ass, she beats the crap out of Alice. Oh, I should also mention Los plagues Rodrigez breaks just about every bone in Leon and that other guy's body, and they act like nothing happened. I mean come on, we see and hear their bones break, get real. Alice also manages to bleed out for an hour and a half straight, without dying. I could go on for another paragraph or two about this movies flaw's, but that would be too much. One more thing, there is an intolerable amount of slow-motion in this film, you know because the movie is so cool we have to see everything in slow-motion, just in case we missed it. And why is Wesker a good guy now? And lastly, what happened to the Redfields? Did they just forget about them or what.\n\nThis movie is so bad, you will find yourself laughing at how bad it is. If you are willing to stomp reality in the face and let your brain turn to mush, I dare you to watch this film, but please don't spend thirty dollars on it, you'll hate yourself if you do. I say stay away if you want to keep your brain cells, but watch it if you want a good laugh, there are many to be had.\n\n!update! I've just noticed that two Re fans came in here and disliked all the negative reviews, some people can't understand the facts and have to cry about it. Well they can enjoy their crappy movie, but I sure won't, thats for darn sure."

The storyline was better structured and the general experience while watching the first two movies was entertaining. I have come to realise however was how very short lived this thought was and that the series has now continued on well over its sell-by-date, and frankly i think the movie-goers are paying the price by having to watch such absolute drivel due to a complete lack of quality scripting and good story-telling.\n\nNote to the readers: I would try and say more on this film but i can't - it is that bad. I can only advise that you do not waste your hard earned cash and see yourself waste the better part of 90 minutes of your life as i have done and see a better film. If you the viewers are interested in seeing a movie that is taken from a comic book or a computer game (and is out in cinemas at the time of writing this), you should go and see Dredd.\n\nIn short - AWFUL!"

Like the zombies themselves, the film series based on the popular video game series refuses to die thanks to the ever persistent director Paul W.S. Anderson. While they're certainly no masterpieces, I must admit that I do enjoy watching these movies and they just get crazier every time. Right now, this is by far the craziest of them all!\n\nThe story is fairly simple: Alice and friends continue to battle their way through hordes of T-virus zombies, terrifying mutants, and the ruthless Umbrella Corporation. This time, however, old faces return to haunt our heroine and make things a little more difficult. Luckily, there are some new faces to help her out in an all-out fire fight. There's plenty to like here. First of all, the action scenes are just awesome with a never-ending line of insane twists coming around here and there. The effects are definitely better this time around to the finest detail and the fear-factor is adequate for those of you who like being scared. Seeing some of the familiar faces from the older films like Michelle Rodriguez was a real treat to watch and the new cast holds up pretty well. The music is also a real pleasure to listen to throughout the film.\n\nWhile the Resident Evil film series is starting to get tiresome with each new sequel, this is overall a fun movie to watch. Definitely worth seeing just for the action and seeing how the story continues. Nothing else much to say, so check it out!"

I was glad to see the writer & director of the first and last film in the franchise was back in his place for the 5th film. I was wrong to hope for such a thing and can only hope now that this be the last Resident Evil film.\n\nThe film begins with the writer, Paul W.S. Anderson, and his wife, lead actress Milla Jovovich, telling you that you are stupid. Yes, that is right. We, the audience of this new Resident Evil film, are dumb. They assume we are so dumb that we can't remember the events of the last 4 films. In fact, the time spent on explaining what we already know, we might as well have never watched the first 4 films at all.\n\nNow I'm not 100% against re-caps or montages that are done in unique ways to remind us of past events, scenes or films. Now I said \"done in unique ways.\" This isn't done in any original new way whatsoever. Instead it is just Milla, as her character Alice, re-telling the story directly to us, the audience. Immediately we are reminded that this is a film, all realism is flushed down the toilet along with any hopes that the Resident Evil film series can maintain any credibility.\n\nThe film continues to remind us how dumb we must be by using the absolute worse CG effects seen outside of made-for-TV sci-fi movies and children's television shows. 3D or 2D - it does not matter. It is clear to any film enthusiast that this is all shot in front of green screens and the actors/characters are never in any real danger. Therefore pack it up early, even the genius soundtrack masters tomandandy can't save this mess!"

Each iterations is just worse than the last with no improvement or no attempts to even try to make the movie half decent. It's quit embarrassing and he should really reconsider the direction he is going in.\n\nThe way I see it is, since he has the ability to make big screen motion pictures, why not make actually good movie instead of half-ass'd product?

U don't really care much for story/acting/dialog in a action movie, u just want to see nice illogical action packed scenes?? If the answer is yes to these 2 questions then watch this movie, if not, plz don't do your brain harm by watching this movie. Do u have to watch other RE movies in order to understand this movie? Well lets say its even better not to watch any of the RE movies before this one, u will understand more. So why 6/10? Its simple, from 1h30min its 1h15min of action, good action scenes although illogical (watch it and u will know what im talking about) and i didn get bored, woalaa!! P.s.

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never been a fan of Resident Evil movies, but I thought first one was enjoyable. It know exactly what it is, a action horror movie based on popular video game series. Second movie was campy, but enjoyable. After that, the only thing that RE movies did for me is surprise me how much awful next installment can be compared to preview one.\n\n\"Resident Evil: Retribution\" is fifth (I think) movie in the series. At it clearly shows. After a long and boring intro scene, we get recap of another pointless \"Previously on Resident Evil series\" where Alice explains what happen in the last four movies (pretty much nothing to be specific).\n\nThen we get to the main plot line: Alice must escape from point A to point B. That's it. Are you kidding me? The characters never had any development in Resident Evil series, but this one doesn't even bother with it. Few new characters from the game are thrown into this pile of mess, without even explaining who they are. If you never played any of the RE games, you'll have a big problem understanding who these characters are. What fallows after \"plot exposition\" is just around a hour of action scenes, which are not that interesting. Some scenes are just randomly placed, others are taken from preview movies, and others are just taken from video game (with replaced settings and character, but otherwise, they are just badly copied from games, like a Wesker- Redfields fight from preview movie).\n\nMilla Jovovich, while not the best actress out there in Hollywood, is still charming, but her character stopped evolving after second movie. In this one, she is just a female character who shoots other characters. I am not blaming Milla, it's not her fault that script is so godawful.\n\nSienna Guillory is no better. She might be pretty, but her acting skills are bit higher then acting skills of a spoon. She looks hot in that tight outfit, but most of the time she looked bit awkward in scenes she's in (and she's hardly ever there). Girl, go back to modeling, you can't act.\n\nJohann Urb plays fan favorite Leon, but aside from similar look, he isn't nowhere like Leon from the games. His character is just there so he could shoot other characters... and did I mention how boring action scenes were?\n\nMichelle Rodriguez returns once again as Rain, or clone of Rain... or whatever she is suppose to be. I actually like Michelle as an actress, but she is just badly directed here. It's like they wanted her in this movie but didn't know what to do with her, so they just throw her in yet another... you guest it, action scene.\n\nShawn Roberts plays Albert Wesker yet again... and yet again, he's nothing like Albert Wesker from the games. He's not menacing, he's not creepy, he just speaks slow and wears too much hair gel.\n\noh yeah, and I should mention that Ada Wong makes her appearance here, as a stereotypical Chinese spy character (even her voice is stereotypical). Again, this is nothing like Ada Wong from video games, where she can actually be interesting character (depending on which game we are talking about).\n\nNow, to the director and writer himself - Mr. Paul W.S. Anderson (a guy considered to be one of the worst directors ever). How can you put your name after \"written by\"? He seriously wrote this? This is no script, this is just compilation of action scenes connected by 30 second bridge scene. The whole scripts look like a bad fan fiction of a 10-year-old boy after playing the game. Direction is even worse. After being in a industry since 1994, you could at least hope Anderson picked up some skills, but no. He did not. He used some of the most boring angles. Edition is really bad, especially when it comes to action scenes. Scenes with RED QUEEN are just laughable (they look like some cut scenes EA Games could come up with)\n\nand Mr. Anderson, who the hell could you make fight between Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory wearing leather make so boring???"

There is something awe-inspiring when it comes to zombie killing spectacle from heroines. Milla Jovovich should be proud since she has evolved into the number one action female lead of all time. She has kicked ass in \"The fifth element\", \"The messenger\", 4 Resi films, \"ultraviolet\", \"the three musketeers\" and \"a perfect gateaway\"! Her presence is what solely keep this franchise from becoming a corpse. Not a bad actress at all, she utterly convinces that she is a killing machine. However, the rest of the cast are as wooden as possible although it is not their fault but Anderson's script. Most of the previous characters are back but have nothing to do most of the times or anything alike with their computer alter-egos besides sharing the same costumes.\n\nThe plot holes are gigantic, the characters completely one dimensional while their actions are lacking logical explanations and do not even follow the momentum from the previous films. One main baddie even assists Alice to fight off Umbrella who surprisingly still after the zombie apocalypse, has a large number of security guards, laboratories and test facilities that operate completely!? Does these elements mean that the movie is atrocious? No. You just need to switch off your brain, relax and enjoy a string of well-orchestrated action scenes patched together with intense industrial soundtrack and high production values. This is a vast improvement over \"Afterlife\" and there are many scenes that pay homage to the first entry of the series. It has a constant video game feeling to it, with our heroes going from arena to arena to fight off monsters, zombies and various other monstrosities in destructive and explosive set pieces.\n\nThe choreography is pretty impressive (the fight between Alice and Jill has been nicely done) along with excellent production design and action driven music, courtesy of Tomandandy. Anderson's direction definitely has style (the opening credits are all in reverse!) and I really hope for him to start directing other people's scripts besides his own. His dialogue is exposition at its finest with characters just explaining what is happening and where they are going next. No room for character development at all. And it is such a shame really because besides the first RE film, this one has lots of interesting ideas about biohazards and corporations that do not even get any exploration but rather mentioned briefly in a line or two. As I pointed out earlier on, do not expect a solid story. This is nonsense well-made zombie carnage crafted in such a way that won't generate any thinking but it sure is going to be handy for a movie night during winter. And the most positive thing: it looks bigger and has a better pacing than \"Apocalypse\", \"Extinction\" and \"Afterlife\" all together.\n\n+ music, production designer, fight choreography, visuals, nice script ideas, Milla! - script, one dimensional characters, heavy exposition, shame that the ideas are not fully explored\n\n6.5/10"

Of course the plot wasn't anything groundbreaking (or all that interesting), but how is this different than any of the other RE movies we've seen since the first one? The premise has always pretty much been the same: Mila Jovovich gets in a hot outfit and lays the beatdown on zombies. You want depth, go rent Doctor Zhivago. You want auteurism, watch some Fellini. This is a very simple formula for a very simple franchise: hot chick, shoots guns, kills stuff. Are you really complaining about the realism of a movie inspired by a video game about mutant zombies? Take this movie franchise for what it is intended to be, and maybe you won't wet your pants with shock and disappointment when the next installment inevitably comes out."

Tapping Milla Jovovich (Fifth Element, Resident Evil, The Fourth Kind, .45) being the bad ass lead and being simply gorgeous to boot was clever. The first three films in the series were great success's and did superb at the box office, as I'm sure the rest will and have as well. However, the series has gotten off track and the last two films have been terrible in acting and the CGI is an abomination. Do not get me wrong I love me some Milla and the video game is killer, yet the series needs a drastic overhaul and re-boot if they are going to continue.\n\nDid I mention Milla Jovovich is stunning."

This could be Anderson's worst, perhaps even worse than the mega-flop \"AVP\". It's a no-brainer, but not a good-to-enjoy no-brainer. It's simply so terribly bad and poorly written, it could easily be compared to some of Uwe Boll's worst. Not to mention the constant and ongoing Paul's masturbation over Jovovich in tight outfits shot in irritating slow-mo, the OVER-THE-TOP-BAD plot. To make things worse, the CG/green-screen scenes are ridiculous, even more than usual. The fourth film installment is actually watchable compared to this one. And I'm not even overreacting. Oh....and Jill Valentine's character seemed to have bigger breasts in the second film. I literally yelled \"NO,F****** GOD NO\", when I saw the ending. Paul Anderson was sometimes a dirty pleasure for me. But not anymore."

The movie's artificial and glossy look remains, but there is no heartbeat beneath the special effects.\n\nThe bullet and body counts probably exceed those in The Expendables 2, and readers know what I thought about the latter.\n\nAlice (Milla Jovovich) does the same thing that she has done in the four previous flicks. She wears her skintight black outfit and arms herself with all kinds of guns known to man, and then she blows up and kills everything and everyone that stand in her way.\n\nYou don't need a genius to create a story about her still battling zombies. Just put her in any situation and let her blow her way out her troubles.\n\nAlice now finds herself in a huge Umbrella underwater installation that's conducting Godknows how many tests on the virus that caused the zombie permutation in humans. So viewers find sites dedicated to scenarios such as suburbia, New York, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin.\n\nNaturally, our intrepid hero and a Chinese agent in a red slinky dress, Ada Wong (Li Bingbing), must go through all these scenarios with their customary gumption. In the process, they rack up a body count that would make male viewers tremble in their shoes.\n\nI presume that Li is starring in her first English movie, because her pronunciation is stilted, but it's certainly better than that of Jay Chou in The Green Hornet (2011).\n\nOn the way, Alice discovers the virtues of being a mother when she comes upon a cute female child who's in distress, similar to the kid rescued by Ripley in Aliens (1986). What follows is also similar to that in James Cameron's flick, and Alice even goes to the extent of saving the kid caught and placed in a cocoon.\n\n** www.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)"

This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was poor. The scenes looked like they were trying to mimic The Matrix. The action scenes were cartoon-like. This movie has ended my desire to ever see another Resident Evil movie come out. Zombies wielding weapons is one thing. Zombies operating vehicles and dressing in coordinating attire is another. The plot was something that appeared to be written on someone's lunch break. I would give this movie just 1 star but I gave it 2 since there was at least some pretty cool large monsters to see occasionally."

You should familiarize with what you are paying for before you spend money on movie tickets, return at home and criticize without understanding the concept.\n\nLet me get some things clear:\n\n* This is an action SCI-FI(=NOT REAL) movie - don't expect realism! This movie could only be compared to the 90's action movies with lots of cool effects. The first movie already set the tone that this is unrealistic story (do you believe that zombies actually exist?). If you want realism, become a volunteer in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n* This is a part of s sequence - threat this as another part of the series. Why would you otherwise expect 1hr of references to the old movies, if it is supposed that you already watched them? This is not Star Wars! This part was a pure 1hr action instead of 1hr talks and clich\u00e9s and like <1 min action. Find out what <<< holism >>> is and apply it to this movie franchise. Maybe then you will understand it.\n\n* Why would you still compare it to the games? If you played the games and expect a movie on the games, basically you will be watching a game play-through. (Then I will be laughing on comments like \"well spent money\")\n\nThe only criticism that I have about the series is that Paul drifted away from the zombies being the main issue to being no obstacle at all and focusing on bigger issues like Wesker and stronger mutants. But I understand his decision. If he dramatizes the zombies every new episode the script would be trivial like those TV zombie series. After all , the main character matures and learns how to kill zombies better.\n\nThis is a pure action SCI-fi movie, not a drama!\n\nAre you still confused? Then, probably the RE movie franchise isn't for you."

RE5 managed to top the previous ones--with the backwards scene. I liked all the action, it was less Alice and more of other characters including Ada, Leon, Luther, Jill and Rain. Also the new actors were great, Li Bingbing's English is fantastic, and she really looked like Ada. I did not really like Leon because I pictured Jensen Ackles (Dean from Supernatural) to act as Leon (because they are both emo and broody). This Leon is too \"not serious\" and he does not have a solid stage presence. Alice also looked hotter with age, did anyone notice she looked like Taylor Swift in her \"suburban housewife\" outfit. The parts I didn't really like is there are no real \"zombies\". I prefer seeing how normal humans survive in the apocalyptic world and not really action fighters). Also, I notice that RE characters like to move it movie. When Ada and Alice were \"hurrying\", they strode coolly then when they hear the \"standby\" they just said \"Let's move\", which is weird because they were moving already... Leon kept on telling the guys to move... And the first word that Alice said to Jill in RE2 is \"MOVE!\" The ridiculous \"repeatings\" of the word move and the totally serious tone they used made it funny. Also, many people were confused whether Alice is an original or not, so the director should show more, instead of suddenly have Ada telling the audience about clones. That being said, RE5 was pure solid action with spectacular sets and really, RE series just keeps getting better and better."

When will people realise films fully based on games are terrible! This film looks like the Director has unfortunately listened to the fans and made this film to be a game with level and lives which I feel ruined the film and seems to be any old excuse to get actors the director has worked with in the past back in the film even if they were previously killed off!\n\nThe opening sequence was good and I settled into the film but then it takes the route of computer game and the film takes a dive from here.\n\nThere is no tension in the fight scenes.\n\nI hope they make another Resi Evil so they can fix everything that is wrong in this film."

This is a loss of realism, I thought I was playing a video game instead of watching a movie. This feeling was amplified by the absence of mimic of the actors, and by the foregrounds, too often used by director.\n\nSecondly, the story is poor: without adding any spoiler to this post, I can confirm that no scary scenes are included, no suspense or twists in the story, but only a great amount of spectacular (and unrealistic) shooting scene. Furthermore think that every spectator can easily predict the following scene.\n\nFinally, the 3D version seen on theater is \"flat\": there are few scenes with a deep 3D (the opposite of \"Avangers\" for example), so if you want to see the movie in 2D you don't miss anything.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie losses the horror-thriller characteristics of the first chapter and the massive use of computer graphics divides the spectator from dynamic of the movie.\n\nThe only thing I can save is the beauty of the actresses."

        "review_detailed_main": "I simply don't get it that some people hate the Resident Evil film franchise for setting up a storyline different to the video game. If they have the same plot, the films will become a 90-minute cosplay skit or a live-action playthrough! The film snobs keep calling this \"trash\" and \"terrible\", but let's see if they can generate over $900 million in box office revenue. This is now the fifth film in the franchise and Paul WS Anderson definitely knows what he's doing.\n\nLocations are more diverse than the predecessors. Alice finds herself in Los Angeles's seaside, Tokyo, New York, Moscow, an American suburb, Kamchatka, and Washington DC. The enemies are more and fiercer. The trailer boasts a very large Licker, which is so much better version against the 2002 monster. The 3D is maximized, unlike in Disney's \"Frozen\". The story runs smooth, though lacking in emotions at times. The action sequences are so better than Marvel's \"The Avengers\". Jump scares are present. Plot twists include location, characters' fates, and Umbrella's next moves, and they're all awesome. This is the \"Resident Evil\" film with the most stunts yet, making it high- octane.\n\nGun reloading is an issue here. But other action movies are guilty of this flaw, so I tolerate the illogic.\n\nMilla Jovovich is an action star and her husband Anderson is an action movie director. Thus, \"Retribution\" is their best \"baby\" yet. A positive film reviewer said that this is the biggest and best \"Resident Evil\" movie yet, I entirely agree with him! I honestly cannot wait for the sixth and allegedly final film that I search for it every week for updates!"

And Anderson is obviously too tired of it all to give us any reason to care about either the characters or the story (limited as it is). Overall this installment made 'Doom' seem like a veritable 'Gone With The Wind' by comparison and that isn't easy to do.\n\nWith creativity the first casualty after the opening sequence Anderson has undeniably delivered up a movie as forgettable as the most droll of his zombies and leaving franchise badly infected by the banal. Milla deserves better than this and I can only hope Anderson takes better care of her off the screen than on it."

Most of the acting was terrible and very stiff and the characters had no real depth, I didn't even care when anyone died because they barley spoke or showed any emotion. Even with Alice I got a different vibe from the previous movies, she was a lot more stiff and her personality didn't really show. There were no real plot twists or \"wow\" moments for me. I felt like I was waiting the entire time for something awesome to happen and then it was just over.\n\nThe action parts were good, but I think they focused way too much on making everything slow motion and a lot of it ended up looking cheesy. Although this one wasn't the best I'm still optimistic for the next one!"

I was so pumped to see this one, but maybe after the first thirty minutes I was completely bummed. I even turned over to my roommate and said, \"This movie is terrible. It's so bad it's good.\n\nHonestly, my main complaint about this installment is the lack of dialogue. There weren't very many complete sentences, maybe six of them throughout the whole movie? Most from Wesker. That's me exaggerating -- the film is complete madness, the visuals are great and as others have review \"complete eye candy.\" Any fan of the film is of course already on board, but I can only hope that they felt the same way. This movie was terrible-- as a fan I loved it.\n\nYou'll make up your mind either way. Don't look for much plot development, character development-- no one is growing, neither is the story. The film leads with a great step into a sixth installment, I can only hope Anderson will grow some respect for the fans and have our characters actually SAY SOMETHING this time.\n\nI don't write many reviews, so I apologize if there is anything wrong with it-- if it's not the greatest.\n\nThe 3D is completely worth it... so if you are a fan of three-d movies, check it out."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've been a big fan of the very first \"Resident Evil\" movie because it had a unique horror film atmosphere, a twisted story and many intriguing characters. When I saw the second film, I was completely disappointed because it only focused on action scenes and had a very depressing and dumb atmosphere all the time. I disliked the film so much that I stopped caring for the sequels. In addition to this, the fascination of the initial concept has just worn out after numerous comics, novels, video games and movies. I feel that only the closed minded die hard fans will continue buying all this stuff and ignoring the lack of quality that has been replaced by an elevated quantity. As it seems, there are still enough of this people around to carry the whole concept on.\n\nI only watched this movie by pure coincidence as I passed a weekend with a friend who is a fan of the series and who asked me to go to watch this flick at his cheap local movie theatre with him. This new flick didn't inspire me at all to watch the flicks I've had missed or to continue following the series. It just underlines what I've already expected. The movie is filled with numerous action scenes, cheap effects and ultimately leads to another sequel while the characters have no development and while there is also a complete absence of any story whatsoever.\n\nThere are still a few good points about this film. First of all, the location of a complex Soviet bunker system somewhere underneath the permafrost of North-East Russia is quite promising and definitely has its charm even if the idea had been used before. The decorations are overall quite stylish and a few shots are in fact very well done. Apart of this, I also enjoyed the simulated places the characters cross in this movie such as Tokyo, New York City or Moscow. These scenes are especially intriguing for people who adore to travel and discover the world as I do and at some moments, there are certain deja-vu effects. As a last point, I might say that I liked the addition of Li Bingbing to the movie. I have seen several Chinese flicks with her before she rose to fame and she definitely is a promising actress. It's sad that she is not acting very much in here in fact just like all the other characters that have no development. She's just there all of a sudden, incarnates a tough woman and shows us her long beautiful legs. That's definitely nice to watch but she has clearly more than just this to offer and the team wasted a lot of promising potential.\n\nIn the end, this movie seems to be another continuous step down for the Resident Evil universe. There will be more movies but I hope it will stop anytime soon. While the makers of the comparable Underworld saga were able to pull of a quite decent new flick this year, the team behind Resident Evil fails while it tries. Let's hope for an explosive final chapter before the whole thing will finally be brought to an end. I can only recommend this movie to the die hard fans, anyone else should skip this, watch the first and best feature again and discover more movies with Li Bingbing."

Excellent 3D effects, and the storyline pulled everything from the other movies together, at the same time, if you never saw any of the other movies you could enjoy this one without being lost. I want to go back and see it again on the big screen!\n\nEveryone looked great, plenty of eye candy (for guys and girls). To all the negative reviewers: We know this isn't \"Gone with the Wind\" with incredible acting and deep characters, it's about a wild ride and fast paced action and it delivers! Thanks to all involved in the making of Retribution!"

They are mostly unrealistic and inaccurate but it's fun to watch and at the end of the day that's what your looking for.\n\nNow, about this last movie I have to say, from my point of view, this is by far the best one out of the series. Tons of action, zombies, shooting, fighting and nonsense that would leave you satisfied. Glad to have Michelle back, she definitely made the movie better. Definitely looking forward for the next movie and hopefully Paul can somehow bring Michelle back...hey, this movie is pure fiction/fantasy so anything is possible."

So if it was gunfight or hand to hand combat they should have taken some care to make her fight smart rather than hard. The storyline was not bad but if they have given some accounts by narration here and there it would been clearer. Resident Evil movies are usually innovative but in this movie there is not a single scene which had that innovative touch.

I love Resident Evil from little Boy on till now where Movies of my favorite Game took over.\n\nA really intelligent Introduction with Reversing the Storyline for a perfect reconciliation to the upcoming Story was a real Word to start with. There are nice shocking Effects in the following so that my Mouth couldn't stop smiling. The never ending Action-Scenes are the Stuff what makes this Movie alive. You and of course the actors cant get rid of it.:-)\n\nThe Story in general is not bad but could be better. Innovating Ideas in between- but not superior new. In between there are many unnecessary Dialogs which pull the Rating of this Movie down like an anchor. Also gratuitous is the Voice but more the Video Animation of the Red Queen through the whole Film. Finally i'd say this is not the worst Resident Evil but unfortunately I think the 5th Part had to reveal on the Cinemas to be shown. Who likes the Second Part will also like this One. Some nice 3D Effects top off the cinema experience so if you like Resident Evil just watch this One."

Despite of its ambitious looks, the movie is still stuck with the same problem of the last film. While the film seems to be cool and fun, the adventure refuses to go further than that. It's big and full of action, but most of them are throwbacks from the previous films. Nobody is actually asking for more than seeing Milla Jovovich slaying these zombies, but sometimes we kind of wish to see something new and interesting here. By its intro, Resident Evil: Retribution is ought to be an extraordinary part of the series. Unfortunately, it rather throw stuff at the audience to keep them distracted.\n\nThe ending of Resident Evil: Afterlife promises that the next installment will be bigger and more explosive than ever. In the ads, it shows that this will be some sort of a warfare adventure. Although it's never a good idea to trust movie trailers, the film becomes disappointing when the plot twists into a smaller and cheaper version of the expected one. Instead of being one of the climatic parts of the series, the film is still stuck at being a sequel that only exists because of its gimmicky use of the modern special effects and the 3D. It hardly has a build up to the story and it has more \"jumping off the screen\" moments than innovations.\n\nOther than its gimmickry, the film brought back some characters from the first three, but only for fan service reason. They also brought some iconic characters from the video game like Leon Scott Kennedy and Barry Burton, but sadly their portrayal is pretty bland. The action just got bigger but there is nothing new about it. We've seen the enemies before. The slow-mos are once again repetitive. It's basically meant to be cool, but in the end it's just another gloss. The only good thing here is Milla Jovovich's fighting, tomandandy's music score, and the special effects.\n\nJust like Afterlife, Resident Evil: Retribution is another unnecessary part of the series. It's disappointing because this sequel did nothing but to show some random nonsensical set pieces and bring back some old characters. Some new characters were introduced but they turned out to be useless. I understand that it's about the action and the fans swallowing the awesomeness but it's the same thing all over again. It's like combining all the memorable elements from the first four films and made it into a large scale action fare in 3D. Overall, it's mediocre and a cash-in nonsense. In the end of the film, it reveals that the next film will be exaggeratedly bigger than this one. I hope the next one will finally step up as a true apocalyptic onslaught than being a repetitive sequel."

Especially nothing advances! And even for a filler, a filler could at least have a good story of its own, even if it doesn't connect with the main storyline. Here I can't even say the story is bad, because there is no story at all. They didn't even try.\n\nBut we have good effects and plenty of action at least. And that's the whole point I guess: They just needed some empty space to dump them into, and sell it in cinemas. Though those effects are just wasted on this movie, still can be watched once if they are there anyway, but just expect nothing else."

Although there were a few minor complains that I have\n\nFirst off, Johann Urb, Kevin Durand and Li Bingbing didn't really fit well into the roles of Leon, Barry and Ada in my opinion and after watching this Leon, I really missed and preferred Chris (Wentworth Miller) and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) back. Hopefully those guys will return in the next sequel if there is another one. Oh and it was also great to finally see Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) turning over to the good side as well although Jill did turn evil for a while. Interesting to see how Wesker fairs off in the next sequel\n\nOverall, an excellent film but character wise a bit disappointing since everyone else in this film apart from Alice didn't make much of a impact to compared to RE:Afterlife. In my opinion, its not a film worth watching again"

        "review_detailed_main": "'Resident Evil: Retribution' offers lots of action and shootouts galore, but what's the plot? There clearly isn't much to tell in this franchise anymore.\n\nFrom the very confusing opening to the cliffhanger ending, 'Retribution' has very little substance, but plenty - and I mean plenty - of shooting. Many of the familiar characters from previous installments are back (Rain, Carlos, Jill Valentine, Clarence...), but in very different roles. There simply is no way you can watch this and understand what's going on if you haven't seen the previous films. Hell, I've seen them all and I'm still confused!\n\nMany of the action and events are simulations, and not real, causing further confusion. Alice now also fulfils another role: that of Mother. Yup, mother! But only because of a memory imprint in a little girl (Becky)'s brain. Her capture and rescue scene is so reminiscent of Newt in 'Aliens', it's almost identical. The action scenes are fast-paced and relentless, so action buffs will have a great time with this movie. As for a sequel to a zombie franchise, it is very disappointing. There are hardly any zombies here, and the story itself is...well, erm... there is no plot, really. It's just running, shooting, fighting, running, shooting, fighting, running... you get the picture.\n\nIt felt as if the writer/director had too many ideas for one movie - just like 'Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse' - and blended them all together, hoping it would gel. Well, honestly, I'm going to have a difficult time remembering what this film is actually about. It doesn't contribute anything to the series. I will remember all those muscled hunks, though! At least they make the film more watchable. Oh, and Wesker - the ruthless antagonist from 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' - is back, as well, but this time to help Alice.. Ok, talk about confusing...!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Each installment in this Resident Evil film series has gotten less and less like the games, and I am not sure if director Paul W. S. Anderson even cares about the games or what he is making, because these Resident Evil films seem to be getting slowly worse with each installment; I did not like the fourth film, so I am at least hoping this fifth installment is at least good enough. The fifth installment directed by Paul W. S. Anderson called Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) was bad with bland performances, bad CGI effects with an occasional practical effect, laughable action sequences, pointless scenes that matter little to the plot, moments that needed more of an explanation, and the editing from scene to scene would occasionally be hard to follow; the movie also had annoying 3D effects that come at you, and the film felt like a rip-off of the Matrix films with how certain characters like Albert Wesker acted and how certain action scenes were executed.\n\nThe main character Alice, played blandly again by Milla Jovovich, who is trying to escape this Umbrella Corporation facility, with her just dealing with zombies or mutants trying to find an exit while running into other characters who do not do much but get in the way; Alice barely has any characterization to care about her in any situation, especially since she can flawlessly kill zombies and mutants without any trouble. One of the added characters from the games in this is Ada Wong, played generically by actor Bingbing Li, who looks like the character, but she has no personality to make her an interesting character; also, all her dialogue is badly dubbed over her performance, so the voice does not sound like her real voice and it did not match the any of her lip movements when talking throughout the film. Lastly, the other character from the game that was added was Leon S. Kennedy, played badly by actor Johann Urb, who was just a generic good-looking soldier with no personality; the rest are soldiers made to come and get Alice out of the facility, but also get picked off as they go through each area in the facility that replicates cities or towns around the world.\n\nThe antagonists include The Red Queen from the first film taking over what is left of Umbrella and trying to keep Alice from escaping, mostly by taking control of Jill Valentine, played again by Sienna Guillory, who gives a dumb performance and wears a stupid looking outfit the whole film; also, Albert Wesker is in the movie helping Alice escape the facility without an explanation on how he is alive, and actor Michelle Rodriguez is back playing her character from the first film somehow with no reason to how she is alive in any way. The action sequences are laughable with the terrible physics and constant use of slow-motion that was clearly used to pad out the runtime, along with the bad CGI effects, an occasional use of a practical effect, and a bad use of green screen; also, there were a lot of moments that made no sense and would feel like a rip-off of the Matrix films and the Alien films with how the action sequences are executed and cut together, and how some of the mutated monsters would act towards certain characters in the any situation they were in.\n\nThe fifth installment Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) was not good with bland performances, bad CGI effects with an occasional practical effect, bad uses of green screen, laughable action sequences, pointless scenes that matter little to the plot, moments that needed more of an explanation, and the editing from scene to scene would occasionally be hard to follow. I tried giving this movie a chance to be good or better than the other films, but it fails as an adaptation based of the games for those who have played the games, and it fails as a regular movie for those who have not played the games; if you have played the games before, do not waste your time with this, and if you have not played the games, I highly recommend that you do instead of watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, what I saw in this movie is that it seems our director Paul W.S. Anderson took lessons from the mistakes he did in the previous sequels, so made some improvements. What are those? Firstly after the first film, the focus was shifted from zombie battle to some other sub stories and that caused the story to scatter, in other words lost its focus. In Retribution, we come back to the \"zombie\" horror which is good. The movie has some good zombie action. The first movie was subtle, solid and stylish, then in the sequels, As for the style, it turned into almost garbage. In this installment, Anderson brings some \"art\". Remember the suburbia scenes which also reminded me Kill Bill. The movie is not subtle may be like the first one, but at least it is stylish and not superficial like Afterlife. Thus, Retribution is not entertainment without \"cinema\" Yes there are such movies believe me! You may find the story clich\u00e9, you may find the movie shallow, you may find the movie average etc. but at least it is not an \"empty\" movie. Thirdly, Anderson got rid of \"Matrix trend\" which is good too. This movie has his own action style. Afterlife was lack of real violence and horror, in this one, you will get these! Except for the first movie, especially the second and the fourth one was pretty boring at times because of lack of action. Retribution is almost non stop action! And it is better action. I always hated that all the sequels had a very ugly monster mostly as the climax, this installment has a different (and better) climax! In Apocalypse and Afterlife, there were some ridiculous moments, this movie avoids that and catches a serious tone. And if you liked the giant hatchet scene from the previous movie, the extended version is here, it was a great scene and this time it was not pointless (Sucker Punch logic, good) Michelle Rodriguez, the problem was her character isn't a well written character, so don't expect \"Avatar level\" However, to see her was real good. As for 3D, it was worthy, but worse than Afterlife and Three Musketeers. I don't know why. In the second half, the movie has some very clich\u00e9 moments, but not a big deal. And yes, at times, the movie repeats itself, may be it doesn't add anything new, but I've gotten used to that. It has a better direction, better visuals and even a better, more solid script without any ridiculousness and that's enough for me. As said it is better than all of the sequels and it is like almost a masterpiece in comparison with the recent Underworld Awakening. If Anderson plans to make a sixth movie, I hope he can surpass this one, We have enough disappointments."

        "review_detailed_main": "After two movies that were enjoyable if flawed to varying degrees, and a third that was a significant improvement and almost genuinely great, Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Resident evil' series descended to a flummoxing nadir with 2010's 'Afterlife.' Troubled from the outset, it got worse and worse as the length advanced until by the end its value had entirely withered away: astonishingly phony, overproduced, and insincere, a cavalcade of tiresome dreck that all but comes off as an effort by the filmmaker to sabotage his own creation. Charging headlong into the fifth movie, again written and directed by Anderson, it's safe to say that my expectations were very low. The first seven minutes and forty seconds seem to bear out those low expectations as we're treated to an action scene played in reverse slow motion, a recap of the series so far, and that same action scene played out again at full speed.\n\nSigh.\n\nWe know the filmmaker can make good films; I'm unclear why he feels the need to make bad ones. We see again in 'Retribution' that the man's predominant ethos of \"Slick And Cool\" over \"Thrilling And Impactful\" has taken on life of its own and become his master, for the same issues that dragged down the immediate predecessor are just as surely present here. Overproduced, over the top, plastic, bogus, false, fast pace, slow motion, bad dialogue, bad scene writing, thin and flimsy narrative writing, forceful direction, forced and flat and unconvincing acting, forced plot development, heavy-handed, overzealous cinematography and editing, excessive use of post-production visuals (and looking ever more terrible in the process), dubious costume design, exaggerated hair and makeup: am I missing anything? The horror is only a weak flavor; the action is overcooked and artificial; the science fiction is overbearing. From Tomandandy's original music to the use of CGI, from the way scenes are shot to the way that would-be imposing, fearsome monstrosities are effectively caricatured, this picture was approached less as an action-horror romp and more as a cartoon, or the most dull and stereotypical videogame no one has ever wanted to play.\n\nTakashii Miike's live-action adaptations of manga and anime have been more real; works churned out by Uwe Boll or The Asylum may be better points of comparison than some of Anderson's own past endeavors, but then, Uwe Boll and The Asylum have also made better features than this. Whatever sensible through-line of a plot, continuous through each 'Resident evil' in turn, may have been penned before is now just all but completely abandoned to assemble a haphazard, highfalutin hodgepodge of hollow high-octane hokum, hurriedly hurling heaps of hit-or-miss hoopla and wildly far-flung ideas into something that is recklessly hoped to form something resembling a workable story. That, I should add, is on top of just listlessly borrowing ideas from the previous entries in the franchise. In fairness, I suppose \"workable\" is an apt descriptor here. \"Workable,\" however, does not equate \"something a viewer should care about at a basic level.\"\n\nSome titles keep one readily invested by one means or another. Others are comparatively light, fare that is entertaining but which doesn't necessitate active engagement. Then there are those titles that are so poorly conceived and/or realized that they actively encourage us to split our attention, for paying heed to our screens is an aggravating, masochistic act of self-torment. 'Resident evil: Retribution' is one of the latter. Anderson should be ashamed himself, and frankly, so should everyone else who participated here. Sparing good ideas receive awful use, and they are far outnumbered by ideas that are just rotten in the first place. Whatever it is one hopes to get out of this - whatever sparing good ideas it might claim - you can find it elsewhere without subjecting yourself to utmost tawdriness. As if 'Afterlife' weren't indication enough, this series really should have just ended on the high note of 'Extinction' instead of pointlessly droning on."

And making up for Afterlife, this one has plenty of her naked, possibly more than the first three combined) wakes up. Several times(presumably to encourage the audience to do the same). She's stuck in an Umbrella(who I swear are part of Aperture, or the other way around \u2013 their resource-spending is unbelievably wasteful. Only here, it's not meant to be laughed at. The actual attempts at humor here are trying too hard) facility, has to get herself and others out, the Red Queen is trying to kill her, you know the drill. Yes, this is like the first one, only complete nonsense. It adds in remaining fan favorite characters from the game, and they only share appearance and name with their counterparts. No one has personality in this.\n\nThis plays like watching someone play a poor VG \u2013 it's all action. Worse still, these set-pieces are overlong, usually uninspired(or rip-offs of better originals, that aren't even passable), and we simply do not care. There's almost no continuity between these, as they change their focus, direction and style. And this certainly doesn't try to give us something to feel anything about. Shoot-outs lack drive, ignore cover and/or has no one ever get hit, fights fare a little better, on account of good choreography and stunt-work. FX are quite well-done, including practical ones. I did not watch this theatrically(it didn't come out in Denmark), so I can't comment on the 3D, but it looks like it might have been enjoyable(if entirely obvious, and like a ride). There are far too many \"faces\" in this, we're meant to get attached when all we do is recognize them. Clones and simulations explain people coming back from the dead and including Tokyo, New York and Moscow, whilst addressing none of the compelling concepts brought up, and raising more questions than it answers. This barely reaches 82 minutes not counting the end credits(if you do, it's 91), feeling far longer, and somehow finding no place in there for plot or relevance.\n\nThe DVD comes with two interesting commentary tracks with Paul W.S. Anderson: #1 joined by Milla and Boris Kodjoe for funny MST3King, #2 with producer Jeremy Bolt, the informational 6 and a half minutes featurette(that contains spoilers) Drop (Un)Dead: The Creatures of Retribution, 4 and a half minutes of hilarious Outtakes, and trailers for BluRay, Resident Evil: Damnation, Total Recall(2012) and Premium Rush. There is a lot of brutal, bloody violence in this. I recommend this to others who ironically enjoy these, for how hypnotically terrible they are. 5/10"

I may be being a bit critical about the movie, in the beginning until it's cool with scenes and details explosion in slow motion -like I said just to show 3D-, but honestly, I do not believe that Hollywood producers approved spending money on it . As I'm from Brazil, was reading a magazine very famous in our country called see and they say that ideas just Hollywood! And this movie confirms everything honestly do not even want to waste my time talking more about a movie as bad as this, but warning to all who love the Resident Evil games: will be disappointed, and the truth is cruel and hurts ..."

The fourth one was alright, as was this one. I'm not a huge fan of action but this was just pure action. It was sort of like a fancy 80's action film. It had terrible acting, no character or plot development, characters I didn't care about, but it looked amazing. When action is done right, like cool slow-mo shots of one person conquering about 100 people, it looks cool. It's mindless, but looks cool. This whole film was mindless but looked cool. It didn't try and be more than it was, it knew it was cheesy, action and it ran with it. It is a bit predictable at times, but all in all, it is enjoyable. It's mindless, unrealistic and horribly written in terms of dialog, but damn it, it looks like a whole bucket load of fun.\n\nA solid 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a devoted RE fan, I watched and enjoyed every other movies they made until this one. I am utterly disappointed by (1) the script (2) the characters (3) the FX effects (4) the crap they did by diluting the sequels so they can squeeze an extra buck.\n\nI wish I could understand what happened, I really do. I used to say that what they did with RE was terrific, I watched from 1 to 4 countless amount of times and I still find them great. Good amount of horror, the acting's good, the characters are interesting, the storyline is great ...everything was great! For a couple years, they were on my to-watch list.\n\nI think they took their fans for granted : *oh, let's cook a real piece of crap, I bet they'll still be happy and buy the movie* Let's go into details a bit : First : the first 15-20 minutes = What the hell? Everything we took for granted is turned upside-down. As if they wanted to make us believe that what we saw in the previous movies was either in Alice's mind or some cheap TV trick to fool us? I hate when they pull that stunt.\n\nSecond : They bring back interesting characters like Rain and Luther so they can do what exactly? Luther dies by some punch in the heart? Hell, the guy survived a freaking zombie army so he can die in such a cheap way? Why did they bring him back? I think they brought back good characters and made them CHEAP really CHEAP.\n\nAnd, my favorite but not the least ...Becky ...oh Becky. Why should the public care about her? I mean, let's be honest here, they focused on her WAY TOO MUCH, why?????? It's not like your usual fan were soccer moms. She brings nothing to the story. We watch RE to see zombies, fights and MORE ZOMBIES AND MORE FIGHTS. Please stop trying to make us relate to people we don't care about.\n\nThird : The FX effects .. don't get me wrong, I don't mind them at all. But I miss the old bite-them-in-the-neck-or-arm zombie action + they really overused them. The final fight is really an anthem to fx effects ...they really lost me there."

This is all to do with the well-reasoned tactic of making this a full-on Action film for the majority of its running time and making the horror come from what's doing all the chasing. The action is pretty much relentless here without much let-up as this is packed with nearly every kind of action here with chases, martial arts, gun-play and stunt-work that almost all the encounters result in and makes for a highly enjoyable time. The initial sequence overrunning the suburban locale as there's all sorts of ravenous zombies infiltrate the house leading to plenty of fun here going throughout the different rooms in a fun, lengthy chase before the escape from the horde outside, the encounter on the car-lined city streets with the blade-wielding monstrous behemoths is an explosive blast with all the crashes, stunt- work and furious fights which is great fun while the big scene here is the gunfight in the computer store that turns into a thrilling car-chase with soldier-zombies and a hulking dog-like gorilla among other monstrosities human and non-human that all offer up plenty of explosive fun which are part of what makes this one so much fun. There's also plenty of fun to be had in the finale as there's even more action here in the massive gunfight in the bay-docks that comes off incredibly well, the chase after the hulking beast is a suitable diversion and there's the exceptionally fun brawling at the end where there's plenty of fine martial-arts brutal action give it enough to matter highly. The other big factors here come from the continuation of this one going for the series' trademark of fantastic creatures and monstrosities that look really great and creepy which makes for quite a fine time, providing enough gore to satisfy as all of these are enough to overcome the lone flaw in this. The one factor to hold this one down is it's absolutely lame CGI used here for the 3D gags and other scenes, oftentimes coming in unnecessarily which proves to be quite a distraction or taking so long to occur that it's possible to forget it was supposed to be one anyway. Beyond this issue, there's more positives than negatives here and overall make this among the best in the series.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you like zombie movies you will like this movie. If you just like action you will most likely like this movie. If you like neither action or zombies do not see this movie.\n\nThe bad: The acting is on par for most major charters, but for minor charters the acting is sub par; it's not horrible or bad just not good. I would give the overall acing a: \"meh\". The plot is okay for a zombie movie though it does have a few things and leaves something to be desired. The script can be cheesy at times but its nothing that would make me not like the movie. The action was never bad but it was standard for non-realistic movies; the bullets never ran out unless the script called for it and even though there was some cool flips/kicks I did feel like I wanted more.\n\nThe good: The CGI is great giving a bonus to the movie. I am zombie fan so I enjoyed all of the undead, there where not many just regular undead people mostly mutated monsters though. The action had a few good parts, some cool face kicks and heart stopping \"palm thrusts\". There wasn't anything amazing bout the film I can think of except for the CGI, most of it was just okay.\n\nBottom line: as I said before if you like zombies you will like this movie. Zombie movies are rare, there are tons of horrible movies about zombies but those are just no fun to watch. If you're like me and a fan of these movies you will understand that an \"okay\" zombie film is a \"great\" zombie film because of the rarity. A \"great\" zombie film is a \"classic\" zombie film. Because of the scarcity of these movies anything that is watchable becomes enjoyable. This movie is absolutely an okay film id say even a good film which in the zombie lover world makes it a great film to watch so all zombie lovers GO SEE THIS FILM. If you are looking for an action flick this movie could go both ways, the action is decent and almost constant but if you are not interested in zombies, well that's what the movie is all about so I am not sure what to say to you. And again if you neither like zombies nor action and are just looking for a film to watch don't see this film. There are a few bad parts but I expected those knowing the Resident Evil franchise, and a few good parts since it was a big budget picture but mostly everything was just plain old okay. I enjoyed it and wished it was longer but again I'm a zombie fan. I'm giving it a 7 because I think a 6 is too low, but a 7 is too high. 6.5 would be perfect.\n\nTL;DR: Zombie fans: Yes. Action fans: Maybe. Neither: No."

My wife use to play the original game, and thought the first couple of movies did the game justice, as did the Silent Hill movie, but as the RE movies have went on, the story line got little worse and worse and further away from the games which it was based. Retribution was incredibly horrible. Even the first 10 minutes of the movie playing the last 5 minutes of last movie in reverse was so stupid, to only have it replay again normal. Made us wonder if they were really that hard up for story line that they used it as filler. I would say if the plan was to continue down the current path with the RE movies, don't, as its just a waste of studios money on production. #Milla Jovovich\ufeff you have some very good movies on your resume. Please don't let them insult you with another one like Retribution. Don't mean to offend anyone, just giving honest feedback."

I think just about every fight sequence was shot in slow motion; I'm not sure why but for me it didn't add any excitement. Nobody will win any prizes for the performances, although I thought Michelle Rodriguez as Rain did a pretty good job. Okay, from an entertainment perspective, yes, it did its job; an easy to follow plot that has plenty of action and some very pretty ladies; this red blooded male was not disappointed on that front. On the down side; it does look like you're watching someone else playing a first person shooter video game. It's left wide open for another sequel (hopefully the last one), so I guess there will be more\u0085 And I will be watching.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Purely for entertainment\u0085 If this is your sort of thing that is\u0085)\n\nMy score: 5.7/10\n\nYou can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

Was I ever bored throughout one single moment in this movie HELL NO! The visuals were dramatically well done, the 3D was used effectively and the music was fantastic once again for the 5th chapter in the RE franchise.\n\nIf you enjoyed the last 4 installments and aren't one of those annoying \"It was SO bad because of this and that. I hate this because it ain't like the freakin Capcom games.\" type of people than you'll enjoy the living daylights out of this film.\n\nFrom the moment the movie starts the action, the music and the visuals pick up intensity. We rewind through a scene where Alice is fighting the Umbrella Corporation on the Arcada and from there on out the action continues until the very last scene.\n\nI truly have to give 50 thumbs up to Paul on this one. I never felt so entertained and exhilarated after seeing a Resident Evil movie like this one. The last 4 installments were missing something, you know that UMPH! To me this one got it! The fight scenes were incredible and the special effects in every scene were well done. The last scene where Alice has to fight Jill Valentine and where Rain has to fight Leon and Luther was just EPIC.\n\nDid I feel like this movie did its job? YES! Would I go see this again in the theaters over and over YES! Did I enjoy this more than the last 4 installments? Yes sir! I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the last 4 films and has a true interest in the franchise. If you have seen the last 4 films and have some kind of interest in the story of the previous films and of Alice you'll like this film all the much more! So stop reading these reviews and go watch the freakin movie!"

Zombies, mutants and Lycra clad vileness's are never in short supply. The guys who do the bullet-time effects, who I'm sure are paid by the hour, make a killing from this film.\n\nThe plot is stupid, the acting and dialogue cheesy. The action predictable and in places monotonous.\n\nBUT saying all that they never intended to remake Citizen Kane here. The premise is set out right from the start in plain English: Alice is here, she needs to get over there, kill a million bad guys along the way, set up for next sequel. The film sticks to this premise rigidly, so really it is your own fault if you carry on watching and are disappointed.\n\nThe setting works well and gives a the director a lot of scope to legitimately empty out his box of CGI toys.\n\nThe ladies look lovely, the zombies look disgusting and in ninety minutes they get through World War 2's supply of bullets.

Resident Evil needs a reboot, with a director (yes, because nobody will convince me this movie actually had a director), a decent plot line that's actually based on the games and WITHOUT MILA.\n\nI'm actually too frustrated to keep on going, so that's all i got to say."

I love her actor and her dress is an absolute masterpiece (I wish they made merch of it).\n\nIn conclusion: The film is bland but it has a few good characters which are worth the watch."

        "review_title": "Not for newcomers",
        "review_detailed_main": "Until this point, for all intents and purposes I hadn't seen any of Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil films (I think I saw the first, but don't remember it at all. Were there scary dogs in it?). Entering into a franchise at the fifth installment is probably not the best strategy, but so it was that I found myself sitting down for Resident Evil: Retribution, not entirely sure what to expect. I played a few of the games as a teenager, but again, nothing has really stuck with me. So, how does the movie fare with (essentially) a newcomer such as myself?\n\nNot well. Not well at all.\n\nThankfully (or so I thought), Anderson opens the film with a lengthy sequence bringing viewers up to speed with the story so far, and surprisingly it seems that the Resident Evil film series has all but evolved past being about zombies. There are a few sequences involving the undead in Retribution, but the real antagonist here is a malevolent artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, who controls the central computer system of the nefarious Umbrella Corporation.\n\nEarly on the film is actually pretty fun, and shows potential. Our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself in an Umbrella testing facility, where the Red Queen runs simulations to see how the company's biological weapons affect various cities around the globe. Jovovich, perhaps the only thing holding this series together, fights her way through the Tokyo simulation, culminating in a highly entertaining hallway battle with a dozen zombies.\n\nUnfortunately, it's at this point that Anderson drops Alice into the real story, which I can only assume is continuing from the previous films, as I really didn't understand or care what was happening. As a stand-alone film, Retribution simply doesn't do enough for first-time viewers. What little structure the narrative has never really builds to anything, and it's more or less one long gunfight with an inexplicable rescue mission mixed in. Aside from Jovovich, the acting is atrocious across the board, with particularly shoddy work from Sienna Guillory and Bingbing Li. The performances, and Anderson's direction, are appropriately on par with that of a bad video game cut-scene, and get so bad at times that it almost seems intentional.\n\nResident Evil: Retribution is not a film for new audiences but for die-hard followers of the franchise, although it's difficult to imagine even the most ardent fans finding much to enjoy here. Jovovich looks terrific and delivers the necessary butt-kicking, but that's really all there is to enjoy. Judging by the conclusion, the inevitable sixth film is probably going to be the last, although so little happens in Retribution that Anderson perhaps should have skipped this story all together and moved on the finish Alice's story sooner.\n\nSide note: I'm no fan of 3-D, but surprisingly Anderson seems to be unafraid to have fun with the format. Although the film suffers from some of the worst light-loss (one of the biggest arguments against 3-D) I can remember, Anderson grabs the gimmick with both hands and is clearly having a blast throwing bullets, axes, and gallons of blood at the audience. The native 3- D (not post-converted) actually makes a difference, and if you must see this movie, then shelling out the extra couple of bucks might be worth it.\n\ntinribs27.wordpress.com"

Until now. There is no way I can stick up for this movie or any reason I'd even want to. I can't really give you a synopsis cause I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its premise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening. Despite a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence, a best of franchise film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we than move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. I mean the choices are just astoundingly bad why make the little girl deaf and the film filled with sign language, why set it in this underground facility, why is all of this happening, with this type of technology how does the remaining human population even have a chance, how is Wesker alive and why is he good now? he's not human??? None of these questions will be answered and lets not even discuss the frustratingly awkward scenes like one in which one of the good guys has a double unnecessary death, an uninspired nod towards the Alien franchise and repetitive scenarios that get less effective the more you see them (really the squid face things). Also, the acting has never been good in the Resident Evil series but Milla Jovovich had evoked a cool sense of fierce heroine, this time around she just seems plain bored as do the other actors. Filled with insipid dialogue, questionable plotting,overlong pacing, a weird bad movie from the 90's score, mediocre fight choreography (except for the scene with the chain) and a crapload of wasted potential this movie just feels like a bad dream. Sometimes, when I'm really looking forward to a movie I'll dream about it the night before and it will be horrible well this is what this feels like. Because in no possible way, what I just watched is a resident evil movie. Despite all of my complaining the movie does have some decent scenes the suburbia one I brought up before was kinda neat, another featuring Ada and Alice against 2 ax men and the chain fight in Tokyo. Besides that it's all just a big plodding waste of existential cinematic trash. A brainless, soulless unintentionally funny horror/action/sci fi hybrid that despite a larger budget,returning cast members and more impressive production values feels like an overlong filler episode that leaves me with a big question mark. Why has this happened to my beloved franchise???"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's pretty amazing that Hollywood keeps throwing money at Paul W. S. Anderson to make films with his wooden wife, Milla Jovovich. RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION is yet another instalment in the endless franchise, and there are so many of these cookie cutter movies that by now I've lost count of where we are in the series. This follows straight on with the last one and tries for freshness with a few 'virtual reality' scenes of zombie attacks, but for the most part it's just incessant CGI action.\n\nJovovich has always been poor in these movies; a supposed kick-ass heroine, she continually fails to have any screen presence whatsoever. As she gets older so her body becomes unable to do some of the tougher stunts, so the films get more reliant on CGI as they go on. This one sees Jovovich fighting villains ripped off from SILENT HILL, teaming up and fighting some old faces, and going up against various unstoppable bad guys. It's completely yawn worthy, with nothing we haven't seen before, and I frequently checked my watch, hoping it would all be over soon. Anderson's direction is awful, obsessed with flashy slow motion which looks like a teenage boy was directing.\n\nRealising just how poor and plot less these films have become, Anderson tries desperately to draw in old and new fans alike. So we get a Chinese character (Li Bingbing) for Asian audiences, plus the return of Michelle Rodriguez and Colin Salmon after they died in the first film. Sadly, Salmon only makes a brief cameo, although Rodriguez has more to work with and seems to be the toughest out of all of them. Jovovich is a bore, but her acting is sublime in comparison to the excruciating Sienna Guillory, who gives the most wooden line readings I've ever heard. This is a dud all round."

She wakes up after dreaming about her husband and child, and it turns out that she's in this huge underground dome where hallucinatory images can be created within some buttons. With someone hacking computers to help her escape with at the same time 5 experienced agents sent down below to retrieve her to safety. Lots of action sequences, many of it helped by CGI but does contain some scenes I had never saw before. Written, directed and co-produced by Paul W. S.

So I was really looking forward to Michelle Rodriguez's return in Retribution but, sadly, I was in for a major disappointment. Whereas the first four movies still had something resembling of a story to tie all of the action sense together, it seems like in this one the makers just got together to brainstorm ideas for their new movie but since they couldn't come up with anything good, they just shot every single idea they did come up with, edited them all together and called it a movie. The result is so messy it's hard to believe it was directed by the same man who made Soldier and Event Horizon. In my opinion, as much as the makers of The Walking Dead got the Zombie genre just right, that's how badly Paul W.S. Anderson missed the ball with Resident Evil: Retribution. The ending does leave an interesting opening for a 6th and hopefully final instalment but it's going to be tough to make up for this one."

Are you in camp that has complained for 10 years now like a broken record that the movies aren't a carbon copy of the video game storyline (which, as I recall, started out as essentially a haunted house type of game)? Are you in the camp that has complained for 10 years now that this isn't a studious courtroom drama? or Are you in the camp that thoroughly enjoys the always-inventive, always-surprising & twisting plot line that Paul W.S. Anderson has consistently brought to screen (either as writer or director, or both as in this one)? If you're in the latter-most camp, I think you'll enjoy Retribution. The budget is higher, the action set-pieces more numerous and over-the-top, the zombies are faster and more-varied, the 3D more in-your-face, and Milla just somehow keeps looking hotter with each film. What's not to love?\n\nHaving just seen this in multiplex-theater Imax, I was remarking with my friends that what's really cool about the RE films is how they add something subtle to each movie, which can make you look back on the previous ones in a slightly different viewpoint. Maybe not every plot-point is cleanly 100% covered every time in the series, but I give the film makers an A+ for having gotten to #5 and still having this much energy & purpose (with a #6 obviously being setup). Name another franchise with as much vigor & fun that has arrived at #5, hasn't been rebooted, and is this good.\n\nAnd to any true RE Movie fan who might be hesitant to see this based on rumors about returning characters who were previously killed-off: rest-assured that it's handled in a cool way which is definitely not the most obvious."

Kills stuff.\n\nViewers hoping for a coherent narrative are advised to try Capcom's Resident Evil cartoons; viewers completely new to the series really have no choice but to let the images simply break over them like tsunamis. Despite 2 or 3 pages of exposition, series writer/director Paul W. S. Anderson clearly assumes that anyone rejoining him at this point is so familiar with both the movies and the various R.E./BIOHAZARD VGs that new characters (Ada Wong; Leon Kennedy) can be ported over from the games, and old characters (Rain; Carlos) resurrected without explanation (Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Luther West are back; Claire and Chris Redfield make cameos). Happily, I AM that geekish, so enjoyed the merry-go-round.\n\nThe CGI FX, which are virtually non-stop, are more varied, energetic, and original than in previous sequels. No more mutant dead dogs, thank goodness, although Anderson remains overly-fond of his tentacles- bursting-out-of-the-mouth shots.\n\nThe movie is less a script than a series of levels, as Alice, Project Alice, Leon, Ada and their ad hoc teams are dragged through artificial environments adapted from previous installments, from games (notably the new Manhattan and Moscow sets), from any spin-off that isn't bolted to the ground, even from absolutely unconnected franchises (e.g. DAWN OF THE DEAD). Each setting-all controlled by The Red Queen--has its own horde of character clones infected with different strains of the T-Virus and/or Plaga Parasite and its own boss monster adapted from one or another of the games.\n\nIf...and only if...that paragraph made the least bit of sense, then this movie's recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review is being written for a very specific purpose. Resident Evil: Retribution actually surprised me! After all, everybody knows what to expect from these movies at this point. The tone shifts from film to film, often the first few minutes of each film destroys the setup from the previous film and then forges onward in a new direction, the acting is generic, the action is stylish and perfectly choreographed to fit the music, etc.\n\nBut Retribution feels different. In a way, it seems to be created to be a \"greatest hits\" merger of the previous films. The video game atmosphere of the first film returns but at this point Alice, Paul WS Anderson and the audience are much further down the rabbit hole, and in gorgeous 3D, no less. The word of the day is \"trippy\".\n\nThe movie begins with the first of many cinematic ballets summing up the end of the last film and then proceeds to what feels like three separate beginnings: a longer recap than we are used to, a scene that feels like a dream sequence, and a self-referential beginning that borrows from the best of the previous films. RE5 feels the most like a video game out of this series and it starts here with a labored outline of the quests and perils to come. The end results is that the first 20 minutes of the movie start to feel like the cut scenes of a video game rather than good storytelling: start disoriented, loot the environment for clothes and equipment, get quest, get map, join party, etc.\n\nThe \"quest-giver\" approach backfires on Anderson, because the set design in this film is absolutely fantastic, and there are an appropriate set of environments and challenges that the characters have to move through in a set time limit (adding to the video game feel). I would have liked to add 'surprises' but there are almost none, because the characters are too well briefed, and so are we as the audience. I realize that it is logical to outline mission parameters in detail, but it does not make for great or suspenseful storytelling, and so Anderson clumsily avoids as many 'WOW moments' as possible which in turn mutes any sense of horror the characters should feel.\n\nThe final surprising part of RE:5 is just how bad the dialog is. Child actors put the adults to shame (except Milla), and you can drive a truck through the Shatneresque pauses in the stilted delivery of most characters. I have fond memories of the original Playstation 1 Capcom game for their primitive live-action cutscenes and abysmal acting, but that is not something we need to see recreated on the big screen in the year 2012! The stilted delivery was forgivable in some characters because at least we could rationalize that they were mind-controlled, but really it is a blessing that there is very little speaking and so many many action sequences.\n\nBecause after the first 20 minutes or so, RE5 finally kicks into high gear and refuses to downshift. The director milks every opportunity for slow-motion possible, and we are glad of it because each movement looks fantastic. The deadly ballet feel is present throughout the whole film, and is set to what is probably the best score of the 5 Resident Evil movies. The electronica pulses the action along, and an orchestral touch is not overt until the end where it exists to make each punch, bullet, and raised eyebrow feel epic.\n\nFor all the movie's flaws, the over-the-top unapologetic action is what we're there to see and Retribution continued to improve in that department. Here's hoping that the next movie capitalizes on Anderson's strengths and turns out to be the orgy of violence that is promised and doesn't try so hard to pretend to have a plot or provide exposition.\n\nP.S.: I have tried to avoid spoilers and instead reference only those characters and events that you might expect if you've seen the other movies. But if you haven't see Retribution yet, here is a fun drinking game you might try: quaff each time you see something that is overtly inspired by or is just plain a rip-off of \"Aliens\"!"

There is also no inconsistency in the story flow of the movies, no matter how cheesy and popcorn it is, that would bother me. In order to attract the audience who loved the movie series, they included the actors of dead characters in the script. And even in this, they have done it properly, in a way that does not disrupt the flow of the movie and is not lazy.\n\nBut they also tried to play to game lovers, and this was a decision that was doomed to fail from the beginning. This point is now the 5th movie of the series, 10 years have passed since the first movie. You have created an adapted but irrelevant world of your own, ignoring the atmosphere and ambiance of the games. You can find actors who are very similar to the characters in the game and bring as many of those characters to the screen as you want. You can also refer to them as much as you want. But in this point, at most you can make cheap imitations of them and you won't be able to sell them to game fans. Actually, I can't say that I'm complaining personally. This way, I saw an Asian who got into the action and killed monsters in a sexy local dress."

Special effects were good, the fight scenes were good but nothing new, so all in all, if you have seen any of the resident evil films already don't bother with this one. This film is what I like to call easily forgotten. Evidently the makers of this clap trap just want to continue the series so they can make a buck or million, because this film was made with no effort, I can't believe that these actors and actresses are no fed up of this by now."

Anderson said that \"he wanted to keep the franchise fresh\", little he knows that this kind of experimentation could actually kill the franchise. And he was not even that innovative, because movie felt (suspiciously) similar to \"Sucker Punch\". I just hope that producers, and franchise owners read reviews, and next movie will be much better (if they get the financing). They should not even change the director, because Paul W.S. Anderson can direct good movies (\"Resident Evil\", and \"Resurection\" were my favorite movies in the franchise)."

While the other Resident Evil films were executed well as horror and action flicks, this film is somewhat devoid of a plotline that it really plays out like more of a video game.\n\nThere were more emphasis on video game structure with its effects. The aspect with Alice's daughter brought a new real life aspect element which showed a new side to Alice.\n\nBringing back recurring characters in Michelle Rodriguez and Sienna Guillory was a solid decision, despite them being rather bland."

        "review_detailed_main": "My first encounter with the Resident Evil franchise was some years ago when I saw a chunk of \"Afterlife\" (the fourth in the series) on TV, and really enjoyed it. So when I saw the whole franchise was available on Prime (albeit for an extra fee), I jumped at the chance to watch them all.\n\nWell, it turns out that the first three movies in the series aren't up to the standard of Afterlife. But after watching the latter again, it pretty much lived up to my positive memory of it, and made me look forward to the next in the series - the subject of this review - Retribution. And I have to say I was disappointed. Because if the first three movies were kind of silly, Retribution is silliness on steroids.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out what happened with Retribution. Basically, the creators of the series must have sat around and said to one another \"what can we do to top what we have already done?\" And their answer was: \"Action! More action than ever before! Nonstop action from start to finish!\" But something else clearly occurred: the creators ceased to take their creation seriously. I guess after doing four consecutive Resident Evil movies,they must have been getting pretty tired of the whole concept.\n\nSo what you have in this movie is action - lots and lots of it - but ludicrous, cartoonish action. How cartoonish? Just one example: in one scene, a bad guy shoots a bullet at one of the heroines, she sees the bullet coming, so she points her machinegun vertically downwards, cuts a 360 degree hole around her feet with the bullets, and then drops down through the hole in the floorboards before the bad guy's bullet can hit her! So now you know what you are in for with this movie.\n\nHaving said that, it's not all bad. The production values are high. Milla Jovovich is always watchable. And once you accept the premise that you are watching a live-action fantasy where almost anything is possible, the movie is kind of enjoyable on its own terms as a sort of pure action romp. It's just a shame that they couldn't build on the intrigue hinted at in the previous movie. Still, I'm giving it a six for the sheer nutty exuberance of the thing and the laughs."

The last 3 Resident Evil movies are lack of good story, only full of actions but meaningless fighting. Without zombie, the movie could be recognized \"pure action movie without purpose\".\n\nDisappointed but not surprised by this 5th Resident Evil movie. It is still pointless, lack of story, only with show-off actions.\n\nI rate it 6 for its \"not bad\" graphics"

It's really upsetting that a franchise that started so well has disintegrated into this. The first two films, I thought were outstanding but the next two were plagued with absurd levels of ridiculousness and this film had the worst plot development I've seen yet. It's unfortunate too because the acting is good enough and the action sequences are entertaining but the cheesy 3D elements and the garbage plot development show just how a terrible director can destroy a movie. I'm glad they're only making one more... though, how they made this many just shows how stupid Europeans actually are."

Even the most optimistic viewers wouldn't expect anything more from this than another zombie flick full of running, jumping, fighting, shooting, infinite amounts of bullets being fired, a little gore, and a shallow plot.\n\nAs a horror, it's a disappointment; but to be honest, can you really expect to be frightened by a movie that you've seen four times already (this being the 5th sequel, and all of them are practically identical)? As a sequel to the franchise - yes, I must agree that this one is probably the worst and least amusing of all five movies, but that doesn't come as a surprise, because with this type of movies it's always the same, each new sequel is worse than the one before.\n\nBut all of this didn't come as a surprise to me, and to be frank, this movie didn't disappoint me personally, in any aspect, because my expectations weren't that high anyway. It may have been done better, of course (there is always room for improvement), but I don't mind, really.\n\nThere were numerous hilariously illogical \"mistakes\" in the movie (as one might call them), but I don't consider them as mistakes, as such \"mistakes\" happen in all R.E. movies and since all the movies are based on a video game (and we all know how video games can be). If this were an independent movie, I would totally trash it, but while watching it, I kept thinking to myself that I was actually playing a PC game, and of course you can expect that, for example, in a game a character runs through a rain of bullets and comes out unharmed. Because such games are essentially not about the story and logic, but more about the adrenaline. Though this raises a dilemma - why would anyone keep creating such movies, when we HAVE video games, and they serve better for that purpose? The answer is simple enough - to raise some more money living on old glory. The first movie was legendary, and the sequel to it was expected and welcomed - everything else was pretty much the same - mediocre and rather poor.\n\nI sincerely hope this one will be the last sequel of this franchise, just for the sake of keeping dignity of the original story. But, if they do make another one, I'll most probably watch it anyway."

In this review I can only voice my own interest in the franchise, I should also note that the Resident Evil series should not be seen as films, but as mere products to help sell the next video game. That is of no consequence to me, I understand what to expect before I pay for my ticket, and I've known what to expect ever since I paid to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse.\n\nI have been a loyal fan of the series since its inception, and I managed to see the first movie on DVD when I was about 14 years old. At first I didn't think the movie was good, I thought it was disgraceful. But, gradually the first Resident Evil movie became my guilty pleasure. I've somehow learned not to pay attention to the storyline, because there is none, you won't find a storyline in the Resident Evil movies, they purely stand on their own, and the only thing that holds them is its leading lady, Milla Jovovich. The reason for such an ambiguous approach is that more sequels could be milked until people get sick of them.\n\nHere's what I love about Retribution, and all those other movies that came before it. Two words. Milla Jovovich. Milla Jovovich is an iconic and legendary figure in the action genre. Just like Greta Garbo was queen of the silent era, and Bette Davis the queen of the talking picture, Milla Jovovich owns the action genre. There is never a dull moment when Milla Jovovuch is kicking ass, shooting her weapons in glorious slow motion, and not to mention her high-flying kicks.\n\nThis babe is what has transcended the entire Resident Evil series into art. Yes, I said ART. The art of ass-kicking has never looked so good with Milla in her tight spandex, blazing sub-machine-guns in 3D. If you want a reason to watch this movie, then there it is. Paul W.S. Anderson is no hack either, he's interesting as an action director, more so than abysmal hacks like Luc Besson, even more so than Robert Rodriguez. I also love his futuristic set piece, you must admit that they are very creative. As long as Milla Jovovich stars in these movies, they can count on my 15 bucks to watch her.\n\nFor those complaining about the movies not being like the games, you try and a adapt a video game into a movie! To make a film out of a video game, you need to recreate the entire thing, because all you do in the games is solve puzzles and shoot at zombies for countless hours. How can you make any kind of cinema out of that? It's impossible. It;s like trying to drive a car without an engine, you have a good looking body, but no engine to make it go. And that's what Resident Evil games are in a nutshell, they look good and scary - but that's about it."

They spent way way too much time on action scenes and there was very little story. I agree with another reviewer that the whole movie felt like an opening scene. I literally checked the time into the movie at one point and it was 1hr 10 min and i thought to myself, well there is still 50 minutes to round this out and give us a story. And then the movie ended....\n\nLike another reviewer said, the whole movie could have been condensed to 20 minutes and they could have given us more to the story. It is disgusting that they would drag this out just so they can add another sequel in this franchise.\n\nThere is little plot, little dialog and really not much mentionable about the movie. I wish i could demand my money back!"

The first four \"Resident Evil\" movies were more of a traditional type (A story inspired by characters and events from a video game). This one goes a different route and is more like watching an automated video game with the characters of the previous movies.\n\nI don't need complicated plot lines, character arcs or a believable story to be entertained. Personally, I could watch Alice (Milla Jovovich), Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) & Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) kick butt video game style for 12 hours straight. But maybe that's just me. I'm the kind of guy that watches an entire season of \"24\" on my one day off.\n\nI own the first four \"Resident Evil\" DVDs and after renting \"Retribution\" I'll be buying it too.\n\nI'll sum it it with the fact that I really enjoyed this movie. No, the movie isn't thought provoking, a social commentary or an exploration into the human psyche. It just get's Alice through another day."

This film is nearly as braindead as the Umbrella-engineered zombies found in the film's first half.\n\nThe film is so bad that during a zombie attack scene, I asked myself why nobody on the streets fleeing had carried a black umbrella ... they were a multitude of colors with nary a black one in sight. It doesn't matter at all ... but neither does the film.\n\nIf one wants to continue the tales of Alice, by all means watch this one; but you've seen this before. The entire premise of this fifth film is Alice escaping from a training facility and so every door she enters is simply a new scenario -- that is it. Yawn ... it is always more of the same!

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was made for 2 reasons and 2 reasons only... to squeeze a few more dollars out of a very tired franchise, and to cash in on the ridiculous 3D craze that's been inexplicably sweeping globe. Few things annoy me more than scenes that are in a movie for the sole purpose of showing off a 3D effect, and this movie is chock full of them (a distant second to The Harold & Kumar Christmas movie however, which was shot almost entirely for the purpose of dazzling the audience with pointless 3D effects).\n\nThe movie was almost entirely devoid of a script or plot, the writing was amateurish, and the acting matched the writing. There's no emotional investment in whether a character lives or dies anymore, because at this point in the franchise characters can be resurrected and interchangeably turned into a good or bad guy, or in some cases the characters can't die at all. You don't have to worry about zombies infecting people, because now there are cures for the T-Cell virus as we saw from the previous movie, and they can simply re-infect people when they want.\n\nIf you're a die hard Res Evil fan you probably don't care about any of that and will enjoy the movie, but if, like me, you enjoyed the first movie but felt that they've just been getting worse and worse with each successive sequel, then I suggest you spend your time doing or watching almost anything else. The good news is that this short 95 minute movie is actually only 84 minutes long, with an almost record setting 11 minutes of credits. Amazing for a movie that only has about a dozen roles with any spoken lines. Probably 10 of those 11 minutes are dedicated to those responsible for the special effects and CGI. My suggestion is to skip to the last minute or so of the movie, which just sets up the next crappy sequel, since it's probably the best scene of the entire flick (and that isn't saying much)."

Its a simple story about a bad corporation who wanted EVERYTHING! Even if it meant eradicating the human race then comes our heroine Alice who never dies (which I find cool and silly at the same time) and fights this corporation GUNS FREAKING BLAZING!\n\nBy this time, I am pretty sure you know how the story goes and how future sequels will go through with this (which I am sure there will be MORE)unless some outlandishly good and creative writer and/or director comes in to play and decides to revamp this series (I will welcome that person with open arms hopeful that with a new approach the old action scenes are kept with the same intensity)\n\nActing is okay... I mean what do you expect? HELLO?? Get out of your hole for one minute and just enjoy! The actors were just full of bad- assery I didn't mind it that much that none of those performances were in the levels of Meryl Street or Philip Seymour Hoffman but still it complimented the show's playfulness and brute.\n\nStory - mentioned this before already, ITS A NO-BRAINER!\n\nWORD TO THE \"SERIOUS\" CRITICS: Stop being to harsh on this film. It wasn't made to satisfy your insatiable longing for the next Slumdog Millionaire and frankly, I don't think they care much about what you say. They just shoot some zombies, monsters, etc. and just have some damn fun with it! If you want a morally upheaving movie don't watch this. It will not get you anywhere.\n\nFINAL NOTE: I gave this a 9 not because of its story, acting, or anything that I would consider if I am seriously critiquing this movie but my rating is based on how much I enjoyed myself and not once did I yawn or even lean on the back of my chair it was a fun ride and I wouldn't mind watching RE6."

Whether you are a fan, semi-fan, or even a hater, this movie is such a step down from any of the previous four.\n\nMistake #1 Everything was done in one warehouse, one cul-de-sac of houses, and a whole bunch of computers. I doubt very seriously if Milla Jovovich even had to leave the same room for 85% of the movie. I would not surprised me if all her scenes were done in a couple days, and the computers did the rest. There was no need for costume designers, stunt people, stunt cars, or even makeup people, everything was CGI, including the bruises on the face.\n\nMistake #2 The guys that essentially did all the CGI, also wrote the dialogue. The conversations are on par with the dialogue in a bad porn movie. You will have a hard time finding a conversation involving more than 20 words...total...for both people.\n\nIn short, this is the world's best movie done with Photoshop, or you could say it would be the winning entry of a movie composed by film students(first year community college students). But for a movie that people pay money for, it was almost as if the producers/directors were purposely trying to find the minimum effort needed to stamp the 'Resident Evil' nameplate to. It would have been better if they advertised it as a comedy."

For those who are not particularly familiar with the series, this film gives a complete synopsis of what has transpired in the previous films from the very beginning up to the current circumstances. Anyone looking for a high body count, loads of action and a hodge-podge of nonsense should see this film. The trailer shows that some of the original characters have returned in this installment and I wanted to see how it was done, since I had personally seen the demise of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and others in the first film. Then I thought 'duh', if they can have an inventory of Alice then Umbrella Corp can have a bunch of anyone and everyone. One of those nonsense moments that I mentioned was when Rain first shows up on screen and I thought, if you are trying to escape zombies why would you have your windows open? There were so many other WTF moments, but hey it's based on a video game it doesn't have to make sense, says the woman who at a time frequently played Frogger. The fact that this story originated from a video game was oh so obvious this time around. Almost every scene was reminiscent of being in an arcade standing behind your best friend who has mastered the game and continues to survive through to the next level. The problem is that you quickly bore with cheering your friend on a want some action for yourself. Even with all the acrobatic fights, the mutants, the zombies and the big banging explosions, there were moments when I keep thinking 'how much longer'? The climatic fight scene wasn't even that climatic with Alice squaring off against Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). It was too drawn out for my taste and in the end she did exactly what I was thinking should have been the first defensive move. I am giving this film an amber light, and the only reason it's not a red light is Boris Kodjoe (Luther West)."

Alice is always in the center of everything, the characters are only set. I really hope that the next comments will know how to criticize the movie as it is necessary, we can be a fan of the movies but defend this opus it is simply impossible. We can emit only one positive point: we are not bored. Ridiculous is the word which would summarize Retribution. In the others we took some pleasure to follow Alice's adventures. This time it is just a big joke, Leon, Ada, Barry and even Jill are useless. I even cannot spoil so much there is nothing interesting! Even the action is average, it is more a movie of fight than a Resident Evil. Find the movie on the internet and avoid paying."

Since the last episode was this problem already obvious enough, and we should probably see a \"in slow motion\" sign next to the film title if we use a microscope.\n\nBesides, the repetition and sudden change of music can seriously cause mental damage, I wonder what happened during the editing of the last part of the movie, what happened to the music?!

I would never have thought of complaining about this movie. Don't listen to the reviews these fat losers don't even know what a good movie needs to be. They are a pure embarrassment to the true fans of this movie series. At the times that you couldn't tell whether characters were cgi or not those were not movie breaking moments. Seriously this movie is amazing i highly recommend it, and it makes me wish they released a sequel already! This movie is awesome and any person to say otherwise is just a pompus fat bloak that doesn't even have friends so they go on the internet to attempt and ruin the image of a perfectly awesome movie. I guess the future of movies is going to be bleak for everyone if the majority of sheep humans cant even enjoy a good movie when they make one. These losers will always find something to complain about because they want to feel heard, feel important, or feel betrayed. The series started off as a video game, so i really cant understand someone who calls themselves a fan why would they complain about the plot line being like a video game? That just means they actually aren't REAL fans of the series at all! Resident evil promises to keep you wanted for more and thats a garantee, take it from me. This movie has HUGE replay value. And pls don't take someone elses unjust opinion of the film if you have not seen it yourself. And to all the haters, if you don't like this movie than clearly you were NEVER a real fan of the series anyway, perhaps just a fanboy following some fad. Hipsters stop trying to give a bad name to the stuff that you misinterpret. Because misinterpretting this movie would be the only reason why one would not enjoy it. Cant enjoy it?

        "review_title": "The zombie apocalypse just got boring.",
        "review_detailed_main": "You go into a RESIDENT EVIL film thinking you know exactly what you're getting. A statuesque beauty kicking undead ass while attempting to uncover an overarching corporate/government conspiracy, and also while saving the lives of assorted, improbably well-coiffed, survivors of the zombie apocalypse. There'll be impressive feats of insane bravery, a whole bunch of wire work, slow motion replays of previous events, assorted sidekick types lost and found, the occasional fright provided by the lurking legions of the undead, and lots and lots of gunfire, all scored to a calculatedly pounding baseline you can feel all the way to your spine.\n\nYou're not expecting high art, not for a second. But neither are you, I would hazard a guess, expecting to be bored.\n\nFrom the outset of this, the fifth in the franchise, that was my predominant emotion. Oh, I jumped a little every now and then at the advance of a particularly heinous zombie horde, I was able to call forth at least a modicum of appreciation for the continuing splendor of the action sequences, and there was more than a little perplexity in there as well as the tale got ever more convoluted, but almost from the moment our heroine, Alice (Milla Jovovich) began her usual deadpan recounting of previous events, her \"My name is Alice, and I'm about to exposition the hell out of you people\" straight-to-camera Story So Far, it was all I could do to muster any interest in proceedings.\n\nThis is a shame, as there is not a single other entry in the series that I didn't, at least on some level, enjoy. Perhaps my major problem with this movie is that it is by far the most video game-esque of all of the series thus far, and since I have never played the game, I don't really understand these scenes' appeal. Director Paul W. S. Anderson has dispensed with even the semblance of plot now, and instead is relying on the thrill of vicarious levelling up to appease moviegoers. Oh, there has always been an element of this in the movies, as is only right and proper; one should never ignore one's roots, and not throwing in the occasional sop to the gamers in the form of a subtle reference to one of the more beloved design elements would be not only disrespectful but foolish. But there is subtle homage and then there is outright cinematic LARPing; Jovovich and co. basically spend the majority of the movie as live-action Player 1, working their way through level after level, all the while shooting almost indiscriminately and surely taking hits that should have killed, or at least inconvenienced, them in all of the chaos. I swear, I saw the guy beside me in the theater flick his fingers in what looked very like someone mastering a PlayStation controller, his sense memory clearly telling him that for all of this stylized, almost ritualistic carnage to be erupting on screen in front of him then surely he should be X-Y-bumper-right-left-ing to make it happen.\n\nThe premise is this: picking up directly from where the last movie left off \u2013 and yet, not entirely \u2013 Alice is captured by the ruthless Umbrella Corporation and is due for extermination by the rogue company artificial intelligence, the Red Queen. She experiences a memory, or perhaps an hallucination, where she was married to Oded Fehr and had a hearing impaired daughter before the zombies took over the world, and when she awakens in her cell, it takes her a moment to recapture her badass. Capital-E EVIL corporate lackey Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) frees her from her cage for inscrutable reasons (he tries to explain, but his stentorian, Agent-Smith-\"Mr. Anderson\"-style delivery of his every line makes it hard to focus), and then Alice and her wooden, if dexterous, new helpmeet Ada (Li Bingbing) must battle their way through the Umbrella complex, defeating the antagonists in each new room \u2013 and, of course, the hard-to-kill Big Boss \u2013 before moving on in an attempt to escape. Oh, there are other people involved here, too; some from previous movies in the franchise, some new faces, but the main objective is just to kill as many extras as possible, be they zombie or Umbrella minion or clone.\n\nI may be making it sound more interesting than it actually is.\n\nThen there are the performances. Milla Jovovich does her valiant best, but this is a hard plot to rise above, and it is really only when she is sharing the screen with the most abysmal of actors \u2013 and there are many \u2013 that she truly shines, if only by comparison. Michelle Rodriguez, who is way too good for this, is fine, considering the few scenes and limited dialogue she has to work with, and Oded Fehr, whom we see in this one for barely a second, is WAY too good for this, and must have really needed the paycheck -- but then, he was way too good for APOCALYPSE and EXTINCTION, and they were exponentially better films.\n\nMost of the remainder of the speaking cast \u2013 excepting the aforementioned Roberts and Bingbing \u2013 are fairly inoffensive, and Boris Kodjoe always brings the pretty, but Sienna Guillory as friend-turned- Umbrella-puppet Jill is truly terrible, going for possessed-by- malevolent-artificial-intelligence but achieving only petulant, I-was- rejected-from-THE HILLS screechiness.\n\nThe movie ends on a cliffhanger (as has become the norm in this franchise), and for the first time I just don't care at all what happens next. So perhaps I should be happy, now cured of one of my more pointless enthusiasms of recent years. And should a sixth movie in this series be made, as seems unhappily likely, here's hoping the zombies win.\n\n\u2013 Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine"

        "review_detailed_main": "I need to hang my head in shame for enjoying this film as much as I did as I can see by the score here that most people did not care for it. However, I did enjoy it...I thought it was a fun, fast and action packed movie. It did not overstay its welcome and had a lot of fun within. Milla is back and she does what she usually does in these films, kick a lot of butt. Also back are a few old friends...I saw their names in the cast and I was unsure how some of them would come back, but I thought they did a good enough job reintroducing them.\n\nAlice has been caught by umbrella as she has to once again escape one bizarre installation. She receives help from the mysterious Ada Wong and from another surprising source. They must battle their way out of an underground hive facility in Russia...this facility being so huge it has areas that look like a Tokyo street, a suburban environment and a Russian area too. A group of mercenaries has also been commissioned to help the two girls out. So prepare for lots of action and lots of zombies and of course lots of wtf creatures too.\n\nThe Resident Evil films, to me, are like those old serials of the 30's, 40's and 50's. Do not take it too seriously and sit back and enjoy the show. Heck, most of the films of this series are an hour and 30 minutes usually so they are short and do not take forever to get started and have no sections where nothing is happening. You get your surprising revelations, that you know could not be possible, but that is the fun of it. You start looking for plot flaws and of course you are going to find them, just like the old serials of yesteryear. I also enjoy how they pick up where the last film leaves off, and for a series with a relatively low budget compared to other films, at least they can keep bringing back the same actors and actresses to play the parts...'cough' Batman 'cough, cough'.\n\nSo yes, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. At times I do feel the series relies to much on computer generated effects, but so do most movies these days. I kind of wish they would go back to making monster effects using rubber and stuff found in a normal household. While I did enjoy the film a lot, I did not like it as much as part two, three and four. I do hope they make another one, but it should be the last one...period. Have a conclusion as sooner or later these things are going to stop making enough money to justify a sequel, and it would be so annoying for the series to stop and leave those of us who enjoy it hanging."

I enjoyed that they brought back a few of the cooler characters from the franchise, but they all felt very hollow, there for show and shock value rather than for any real meaning or contribution to the plot.\n\nIn terms of the dialogue and acting, Retribution falls below the already relatively low standard set by the rest of the franchise.\n\nOn the bright side I did enjoy the action in parts. There were a few generic bits that were going through the motions, but mostly it was fun. Hopefully, based on the final scene, we are now set up for an action packed sequel.\n\nThis is a necessary watch as part of the franchise, but it definitely feels like a chore at times."

Paul Anderson script and direction made this movie a fun one. The cast ensemble is great. The visual effects are awesome. The music score by Tomandandy is beautifully done. One of the best in the series. The climax delivered one awesome fight scene. I cant wait to see where the sixth movie goes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay so Paul W.S. Anderson really didn't seem to care much about this franchise as long as it's a cash in. And it really really shows with this one. Cause out of every \"Resident Evil\" movie in this franchise which is based on a video game series has almost nothing to do with the games. The plot is the most stupid one in this franchise and there is just way too many obvious plot-holes. In fact some of the audiences walking out even couples were talking about how dumb this movie is. Yeah for how dumb this movie is, it does have few entertaining action parts. But by giving credit for that would be complimenting all of Michael Bay movies. Just throw in bunch of actions and explosions that is incoherent to the story kinda deal. This time it introduces three new characters from the video games to this movie. But they just have the same name and similar attire and that is it. The characteristics and mannerism of these characters are so different from the video games. They even look very different. Leon S. Kennedy is suppose to be this cocky, reserved and sarcastic character that does everything it takes to get the mission accomplished and yet he is likable and cool. But in this he comes off as sorta a doofus and a bit too tall to be Leon. Ada Wong is suppose to be this sly, manipulative character and also sassy and is proficient in what she does. But in this she comes off bland and confused. Her character seemed more like Sherry Birkin. And lastly Barry Burton is nothing like the game character with the slow and yet corny lines he is suppose to have. If they are gonna make a corny movie at least give it to characters that have those characteristics. There is just way too many pointless slow-mo scenes, some critics bash on Zack Snyder for using slow-mo in his movies. I personally thinks he uses well for the most part that actually makes the scene more invigorating. That isn't the case here, and there is pointless kung-fu. The main protagonist Alice uses Kung-fu or whatever on the zombies and than shoots them in the head. Seriously what the crap. And that is not all, the list is almost endless. If your in the mood for a really really dumb zombie movie with lots of action this might be for you. I am guilty to say I was entertained by few scenes. The way this one ends there might be one or two more left in this franchise before it gets rebooted. There is also a partial nude scene with Milla Jovovich like in all of these live action \"Resident Evil\" movies and it got a bit tiresome.\n\n4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked the first Resident Evil film (and even the - much maligned - second instalment). I sat through numbers three and four then promptly forgot them and now tried number five. I kind of wish I hadn't.\n\nConsidering it's the fifth in the series, it starts off as if it's trying to reboot itself by being overly clever and bringing back all the dead characters and putting the existing ones in new settings and locations. Maybe I'm just being dim, but it came across as pointless and confusing. Then, when you find out what's really going on, the beginning seems even more unnecessary and serves no purpose other than to fill time.\n\nAs most people know, the Resident Evil films are based on computer games. Most films based on computer games get a hard ride for trying to make a story out of a medium which isn't really 'narrative-based.' However, this Resident Evil film seems more like a computer game than most games themselves! If you're playing a computer game, you may expect to play one level set in a desert then the next level set in a city, followed by another level in the jungle. And you'd probably think little of it, as that's how video games work. However, films are supposed to be stories and therefore follow some narrative. Resident Evil 5 doesn't. When the confusing and pointless bits are over, you're left with one action scene after another, simply moved to another location.\n\nThe same baddies run at the same goodies and get kicked or shot to death. I know you have to suspend your disbelief when you're watching films, but this one took it too far. No one ever really runs out of bullets, the baddies (despite being an army) can't hit five men standing in the open, women in spandex can outrun lasers and every time anyone enters a new scene (or should I say 'zone?') they have to stand their posing and posturing before finally getting down to (yet more) action.\n\nThe film goes on for the usual ninety minutes, however there's only about twenty of those with dialogue in it. Seriously, the script was probably the shortest ever written. Then again... that could be a good thing as the lines are diabolical and the acting even worse.\n\nThen, just when you think it can't stoop any lower, it blatantly rips off Aliens with a 'Ripley rescuing Newt' scene.\n\nThere is no story to see here, just action scenes. You might as well play Streetfighter 2 or Tekken on a games console for all the story you get.\n\nI give it 4/10. I would give it 2/10, but the action scenes are well shot and stylish. Paul W S Anderson is clearly a good director who can handle cool visuals. It's just a pity he can't write a good script.\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

It hes superb Atmos sound troughout the whole movie, including the opening logos (pretty good show off with the helicopter sounds for the 1st second of logos). The only sounds that i didn't like are the fighting crunchy sounds that were kinda off for me.\n\nAlso another minus for the movie is that they stopped using the amazing OST they had in the 1st movie...

There is no plot, sub-plot or any kind of storyline what so ever. The fact that a movie doesn't make sense isn't what bothers me, the very least it must have a beginning and an end (or something).\n\nThis movie starts with a slow motion scene and I wanted to walk out of the theater after 10min of slow motion, I'm not kidding, the scene lasts 15min, my wife stopped me and now I wish I walked out. Characters...what characters? I don't even know what I just watched and I was hoping to wake up from a bad dream.\n\nThis review isn't very coherent is it? Well expect the movie to be, far far worse.

After being neutralized in RE:Afterlife, Alice (Jovovich) continues to bring down that evil corporation. She would later gain a new ally named Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) who wears a similar dress like Alice in the first series. It was nice when Alice has a daughter named Becky (Aryana Engineer, \"Orphan\") who was involved in an simulation where the undead attack her mom and dad. And of course dealing with the mutants as well. Since the cities were well simulated by Umbrella, The dreaded Red Queen will do everything in her power to stop Alice and her crew. With the return of Luther (Boris Kodjoe) the chances are good. The downside is Rain(Michelle Rodriguez) is a foe. And she really wants to destroy Alice the best she can. The coolest scene for me was the pimped up Rolls Royce Alice drove when she found the team. Slamming that mutant, and driving it to the subway was awesome! This movie was a big turnaround from the last I think. It has plenty of action, a lot of intrigue, and Milla can still kick some serious zombie butt! It has not lost its charm one bit. 3 out of 5 stars"

With an overdose of CGI, explosions and mutated monsters, you wonder what's the point of it all? Yes, Retribution can draw parallels to a video game format where the protagonist has to make it through levels but....so what? Whats, the, point!?\n\nPaul W.S.

An epic intro, followed, as always, by Alice's story, or the \"previously on Resident Evil\", going into another weakly outlined, shallow story, this time tying in more with the very first movie, bringing back multiple characters, albeit some of them are a little different. In a way, \"Retribution\" is an ode to the franchise itself at that point, and, well, wasn't necessary.\n\nWe learn that the situation at the end of \"Afterlife\" has led to Alice being captured, and tampered with by none other than Umbrella Corporation, which is now solely controlled by the Red Queen, the AI from the beginnings of the franchise. Similarly to the first part, decent portion of events take place inside one of their huge facilities, though it's not claustrophobic no more - the spacious facility is meant for simulations, so various settings are explored. Anderson has tried to make it all fun with use of various terrains, locations, different infected etc., but, again, all in the name of variety in action and eye candy, not story and, frankly, neither atmosphere. I'm not sure if I have seen zombies riding cars and jumping motorcycles before...\n\nThe nature of the system of characters don't change, old and new pals, acting cool, come to rescue. Ada Wong existed for exposition and fights, Leon got entirely disrespected as a character, and so were a few other one-function, one-off guys. Characters of \"Retribution\"don't evolve, except to die or partake in paper thin melodrama. Milla continuously shows devotion to the franchise and Alice, having more range this time around, as one plot line deals with her living the \"normal\" life as a suburban mom right when the apocalypse starts. I complimented the miniboss in \"Afterlife\", and they literally pulled the same guy again, this two of them for an action scene. Big scary boys from \"Apocalypse\" also made second appearances. C'mon guys, to have more of exactly the same wasn't my point. The franchise's standard entertainment value and where it's rooted, in flashy, occasionally even reasonably tense, action sequences, is still alive and well, as is the lack of depth. By the third act, the formula has become a little tiresome, and you find yourself slightly relieved when the climax has passed.\n\nIf you're looking for a for an action packed adventure (with a sense of emptiness), this here is a good contender, dramatic, loud, flashy, pointless. My rating: 5/10."

As it says in the film they are still experimenting in how to control the T- virus. When you would think they would try to eradicate it by this point, as i imagine profits are dwindling. Also if it is about power with the post apocalyptic landscape if they successfully got rid of the zombies/monsters they would be the most powerful entity in the world still.\n\nAs noted in the film quote Alice spends a lot of the film in a nice skin tight S & M style outfit, which reminds of something that did distract me, when Alice is in her cell. How comes Umbrella cannot afford a full gown for her to wear just essentially two pieces of paper connected by string. Then after a power cut suddenly the S & M outfits comes out the wall. WTF. what was it doing there?, is the Red Queen developing some odd tastes? or is the surprising ally still bad and they put it there? i don't know.\n\nI could go on ranting about this film, but the actors do what they can with the script. Also a lot of the action is predictable and boring. But there is some decent action set pieces in there to. In the end if you've seen the others in the series you may as well still see this one. But if you haven't watched the others, don't bother."

This is a movie shot in a studio alone, not a single frame has seen the real light. Retribution reminded me of kill bill movie, but with worst direction and screenplay. Most of the scenes looked like a video game with background music. I don't know what happened to the director all of a sudden after directing wonderful previous sequences. May be this movie was taken to stop the series without hurting it's fans. After watching this part there will be no more fans. According to me this movie should not have got 5.7 rating. I don't know what is happening to IMDb reviews these days."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did go see this movie with expectations of it being as good as Afterlife. While I would give Afterlife a 10+, I only gave this a nine. Sure there are some plot holes which could have been filled in. However, The RE series is about effects, action, sci-fi technology, the end of the world, massive explosions, Milla Jovovich as Alice kicking butt. One thing the movie was - unpredictable. I think Capcom have hit the nail on the head with Andersen, he is a great director with a great, intensely vibrant vision. The finale was epic, both story wise and visually, and yes - a fantastic cliffhanger. It is my 2nd favourite movie of the year, first being The Dark Knight Rises. I do think some parts of the end of Afterlife could have been touched on more, been better explained, but at the end of the day, there were more mutants, the zombies were the most creative I have seen yet. This movie is getting mixed reviews but I hope it makes a killing at the box office - I still want a sixth film! GO SEE IT WITH AN OPEN MIND!"

        "review_title": "There's More Ugly or Bad than Good.",
        "review_detailed_main": "I did enjoy the first four Resident Evil movies, but less with each new installment. Retribution is the same story. As my review's tittle says, there is more ugly or bad than good. First the ugly: 1. Returning stars look like they are not trying anything new with their characters. Especially Jovovich and Rodriguez. The only other movies that were the fifth installment of their franchise or saga where the cast tries this are Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (Yoda fights Dooku), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (a lot of characters), X-Men: First Class (tell an origin story of every character), and the upcoming A Good Day to Die Hard (take John McClane to Russia). 2. Paul W.S. Anderson's directing is at its weakest. Maybe do not need to explain this. 3. There is no character development which I find frustrating because Anderson finally adds Leon Kennedy. Leon is always a character that the fans want to learn more about because he was immediately so cool when he was first introduced in the second game and has never sunk to a level this low. Even in Degeneration and Damnation which are both much better than Retribution. When you do a movie you need to give each character a background story. Bruce Wayne's is a childhood without his parents. Jack Sparrow's is a life as a pirate. All the best characters in movie history have an excellent back ground story. 4. The writers were also very lazy in coming up with the story. Instead of a story that is not cannon with the games, why not give one that is. 5. What ever is going on in Retribution is tough to follow for the first half-hour except for about five minutes. 6. The acting is awful. Awful acting could easily kill a movie while great acting can save it. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy needed a great cast and got one. A lot of actors or actresses in video game movies really can not do anything. Retribution clearly backs that up. 7. The movie will not put you at the edge of your seat. You will just wonder when are they going to put you there. Movies like 1964's Goldfinger, 1977's Star Wars, 1989's Batman, 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, 2003's Return of the King, and this year's Dark Knight Rises are great examples of how to put an audience on the edge of their seat. Second the Bad: 1. The movie tells you what is about to happen instead of staying silent about it. Staying silent about what is going to happen in the next few minutes is what made the story ark for other movie franchises or sagas great. Just watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes or Die Hard. 2. The ending. If you just watch it you will see why. And finally the only good that comes out of the movie: 1. The franchise still does not care. It just tries to be fun. I am fine with that. That is what movies are suppose to be. Unfortunately Retribution is no fun. Maybe Anderson should ask Titanic's Oscar winning director James Cameron how to make a follow up better than its predecessor. Two of Cameron's sequels have followed one of my favorite movies. If I have not reviewed them here yet, then when I do you will probably know which movies I am talking about. You may already. So that is both good and bad. 2. The only crew members who do not seem to be getting lazy is the visual effects team. With each new installment they have been getting better and better. They also took advantage of the 3D technology they were given to use. Retribution is the best looking live action Resident Evil. I can not think of any explanation needed here. Final verdict: Resident Evil: Retribution is visually awesome and that is the only redeeming value. Retribution is a soulless and uninspired installment in the most successful (and only one too) video game movie franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's just like come on every time with this film series, it never ever improves and yet again this movie is a step down from the last outing. We see again a movie full of action, easy to follow yes but fun, my word no, this is awful and that is not a word I have had to previously use on the franchise before. We see this time Alice (Milla Jovovich) fighting yet again, things pick up from where the last film left off, down to the second actually and from then on we see a mass adventure that goes nowhere and only provides glimpses of some decent action choreography that just doesn't mean anything among all the terrible lines spewed out. The man behind this all is Paul W. S. Anderson who is a producer on this film as well as the director and writer, and oh how he screws this one up, a movie I feel just didn't need to be made, or actually, just made well!\n\nJovovich is typical in her role as Alice and for those who have come to get used to her acting it is same old, really though I do feel the writing makes her feel worse as an actor though. This movie is obsessed with throwing things from the past right back at you and none of them work, it feels like Anderson ran out of ideas within the first 5 minutes and just couldn't be bothered to make something even half decent. The plot is full but flimsy, in fact so full it is that by the end it is breaking off and becoming increasingly run of the mill with every passing second. We see some new faces and some we have seen before but truly none of them work, the villains seem like the shoddiest creation of this movie(the story isn't far off though).\n\nAnderson just doesn't seem to get it that he's not making good movies, sure you can make a few poor one's and they'll blow over eventually, but this is something else. The series started out under average and was poor too but never was it truly very bad but now it is has reached that and maybe it is the annoyance I have for this series or that it just gets worse every time but, I just had to describe this as awful. Let's talk about the technical points and the CGI is OK at times but even that is used stupidly, the sets are something from a weird dream that is also a nightmare and all the time I just felt what a waste of not only production designers, but also of imagination.\n\nI'm not going to rant for nine pages about how I hated this, I'm going to leave it for you to see if you haven't all ready, I know even some like these kind of OTT action movies but this one really does not stand out and can't even rank well among it's not even OK predecessors. I hope one day Anderson can look back on his career and realise this was not a good move, I even hope he can make one film where everyone likes it and says \"Hey great job Paul\" and not \"Remember when you made those dumb zombie movies Paul, they were real bad\". So yes, Resident Evil Retribution, a movie that is hard to recommend unless you're either really into zombies or really into Milla Jovovich, and even then there are many better zombie movies out there, and movies with Jovovich in that are also much better."

RE (the games) 1, 2, and 3's stories were all 10 times better than any of the movies Paul Anderson has made. For the love of all things sacred we need to boycot these films.

Guns that never, ever need reloading, until the character's plot armour fails. Plot lines that get sold up then go nowhere (Alice's bullet wound). Invisible inventory slots - where exactly was Ada Wong carrying that grapple gun? Intelligent, tool using, team working zombies - the very thing that Umbrella was seeking and failing to create in Extinction.\n\nNothing in it makes a damn bit of sense. How did Alice get from the Arcadia to the facility? What did the Red Queen need her for anyway? What's Jill Valentine being doing since Apocalypse, why has she gone blonde, and when did she get Goddamn superpowers just like everybody else seems to have developed?\n\nThe movie just expects you to suspend your disbelief, hold all questions to the end (and then forget about them), and just watch some sub-Matrix extended slo-mo fight scenes over and over and over again.\n\nAll of it I could forgive if at the entire point of the Afterlife / Retribution arc wasn't that Alice was supposed to be de-powered. Well, you could have fooled me. Here she is, flipping and fighting and neck snapping and tearing up armies of zombies and soldiers exactly as before. Anderson the director seemed to have no idea what Anderson the writer was doing.\n\nThe plus side is that are some great visuals here and Jovovich is as compelling as ever. But that's it. That's the entire draw of the film. There's simply nothing else here to like, and it's so insultingly mindless that I couldn't kick back and enjoy the spectacle."

But from there, this franchise goes downhill lightning-fast. The last movie was already stupid beyond comprehension, the story didn't make any sense at all anymore, and characters and scenes from the RE games were inserted randomly just to create some connection to the games that didn't really exist at all.\n\nBut why bash the last RE movie, when this one is so much worse? I truly, honestly believe that it can't get any worse, except maybe if Uwe Boll takes over the franchise. Apart from the Hollywood-Level production values (special effects etc.), the whole \"RE: Contribution\" movie reeks of lack of competence and interest. The writing and pacing is abysmal, the whole movie is literally just a series of action scenes with no meaningful plot to connect them all; worse, many of those scenes are cringe-worthy and painful to watch, because they're so ridiculous, and many actors are playing like robots on sedatives; I've never seen a worse performance from Michelle Rodriguez; she must have been ashamed to be part of this catastrophe. And don't get me started about Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine); someone please tell her to get a new job outside the movie business!! The only slightly redeeming factor was Milla Jovovich; while not really a great actress, she performs as good as she can, and is pretty much the only person to convey some actual emotion sometimes.\n\nDon'get me wrong, I like corny, simple action movies in general, but this is just not acceptable anymore. I think Anderson must have been forced at gunpoint to make this movie; that's how I felt while sitting through it. I only watched it to the end to see if there would be at least ONE good plot idea at some point, but to no avail.\n\nDon't watch it if you don't have to, no matter how much of a \"Resident Evil\" fan you are; this just isn't worth the time."

All it does is grab Andersen loose ideas and scenes of Resident Evil video games, and use it completely out of context and place.

And I Sep. 14 I went with some friends and we had a blast. The movie was amazing, Milla was kick ass as usual. and you can see Paul Anderson's touch in the film. I loved it, nonstop action and gorgeous babes kicking ass....Retribution was made as a Action/Horror film, so all you people complaining that there's not enough character build up and blah blah, shut up!, its not a drama and its prob. not gonna win an Oscar, but if your a RE fan, you'll simply love Retribution! 15/10 :) enjoy"

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\nI'm a big \"Resident Evil\" game fan. To me, first three \"Resident Evil\" games and later fourth were among the best video games ever. I've played first two games hundreds of times. And then the movie came out. The first \"Resident Evil\" film wasn't bad, neither it was good. The second part probably was the best, only because it was the closest to the material. Now with the fifth installment i can safely ask - why in the name of fans they are putting title \"Resident Evl\" in the front of this movie and series? It's NOT the \"Resident Evil\" i know. It's just MIla Jovovich every two years playing some kind of character in some kind a world that somehow supposed to be relative to Resident Evil game franchise. But it's not. They (creators of movie franchise) are just putting names from game series in to a movie series without ANY connection at all. In this fifth movie i saw a character of Barry, from the first \"Resident Evil\". I recognized him just from his costume. But so what? How is he connected to this movie nonsense series at all? \"Resident Evil\" the one i love became some kind a creepy family business (you know what i mean) for a B list star (once an A list star) and a shitty director. Please, STOP. I really hope and inside of me i really believe that one day some good movie maker will reboot this mess that is done now, like Ch.Nolan rebooted Batman. I believe that in rebooted series characters from the game will be CHARACTERS, not just the names thrown in for the marketing purposes. I hope that in rebooted series there will be plot. God, i so hope that after seeing that movie in a theater i will walk out and say, \"you know what, now that was a great \"Resident Evil\" movie. Hey, can you even remember that trashy series now?\""

The rest of the film was filled with battle sequences that, while fairly visually impressive, are ridiculously long, tedious and, once it passes the ten minute mark for one battle, very boring. Shoddy script, appalling miscasting of Johann Urb(-a-derp) as Leon, and an extremely weird performance from Li Bingbing as Ada, as it appears they've overdubbed every single one of her lines in post-production. Even given the relatively low expectations of the Resident Evil films, this one is a dud. Awful, awful, awful."

This is a series of movies that I have yet to fully watch, but at times it seems frustrating to watch good source material poorly used. From some parts that I saw from the original,I think that might be the best. After that I've also seen a bit of Apocalypse, all of Extinction, and have yet to see Afterlife. So far the things I liked about these movies are some of the action, Milla Joviovich in general and for the better part Extinction (Saw it when I was younger). As far as Retribution goes, one shouldn't expect any more than what we get as a standard in Hollywood: All boom boom, no blah blah. On a side note, the ending kind of had me a bit interested, but had this franchise had any sort of impact on me in the last few years, and I would have been pumped. The only reason I don't give this one is because of Milla's physique (Sue me, I'm male) and a generally good set up for the upcoming final movie in the saga.\n\nRating: 3/10"

I'm a big fan of the game and that's the origin to all movies, if you are not a fan of the game for sure you won't like the movie. We were playing the game, waiting for an animation, cinematic scene to show to enjoy watching it. Now that we have a complete real life movie, you would complain? In contract to other movies, the more they release the better it gets. I liked the last 2 movies (after life & retribution) more than the 3 previous ones. More familiar faces, characters were introduced and the intensity of the action has increased. I did not realized those 2 movies were done while watching until i saw the ending already! So please stop rating or reviewing, if you don't have an idea what's Resident Evil is all about because you would never judge the movie right."

Some kind of a freak with zombie super-powers who should never be in any of the movies. IT'S A RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE, THE FANS WANTS TO SEE OUR BELOVED CLAIRE, JILL, CHRIS, LEON, ETC AS THE PROTAGONISTS, NOT HER!\n\nOK, all of those were present in the last movies, but they were nothing but supporting characters for Alice. Ada for example couldn't be worse: in the video game series she is a mysterious woman, full of herself, with legendary abilities, in the movie, she's no more than a Chinese little girl who barely got out of her 18's. Leon is just a selfish coward who wanted to let everybody die to save himself, Barry is a weirdo, and there's Jill.. the worst character of them all, who became a umbrella hybrid or anything like that. And I'm still trying to forget that shameful presentation of Claire in the third movie.\n\nOf course they're all there to watch Alice save the day and could be easily replaced with any nobody in the plot. Maybe that's what's went too wrong with those movies: they insists with Alice, when all of the fans wants her far away as possible and our beloved video game heroes taking the action as they did in the games.\n\n3 stars because the fighting scenes were definitely nice, and I wouldn't mind paying attention to the story, because it's simply one of the worst that I've seen in a long time.\n\nIt's actually great that this movie revenues didn't payed the costs, maybe they'll have to listen to fans and finally make a decent, loyal to the game sequence, or to finish this horrible series, let the zombies (are they still zombies anyway?) take over the world."

        "review_detailed_main": "Straight from the sour success of capturing the freighter Arcadia and the incoming attack by Umbrella Corporation forces, Alice (the undying Mila Jovovich) is torpedoed straight back into ultimate undead warfare. After capture by the Red Queen, Alice finds herself locked down in an underground (or rather under-ice) research facility, which tests outbreak scenarios on cloned populations, despite having almost no safeguards whatsoever, which would allow for the situation control. Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) reappears to switch allegiance to humankind, disabling Alice's prison and sending in Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) to assist with her escape. Meanwhile reinforcements come from above in the shape of Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Button (Kevin Durand) and the ex-basketball star, current special op Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). Together they must break Alice out from this deadly complex...\n\nDespite all its faults and dumb-downed premises the Resident Evil franchise has always been - for lack of a better word - entertaining, even captivating. Action sequences performed with flair, whilst the endless charisma of heroine Alice makes for easy and endlessy appealing watching. Essentially the best video game features on offer with an ever-expanding story and universe to get engulfed by. Nonetheless this time Paul W.S. Anderson fails to follow through on the base promise, basically throwing everything at the audience, except for the kitchen majini. In an attempt to out-explode and out-kill previous outings everything is bigger, stronger and more visceral, but lacks similar charisma and deathly charm. Instead of one Executioner Alice now has to face two, while lickers have seemingly grown in size, stature and durability. Anderson basically rehashes almost all that worked in previous parts, mixes in a bit of \"Aliens\" iconography, then fails to build it around anything resembling a script. Whereas the action sequences and fights (apparently now heavily inspired by muay thai) are consistently top grade, the same cannot be said about the cast, who apart from several passing grades, fail to deliver quality, instead churning out leaden and uninterested performances. Much probably owed to the lack of plot, which unlike the previous stories always felt focused on an intriguing ordeal.\n\nFrom my side I also sincerely despise the fact that Red Queen has been converted into a malicious computer AI, whilst her ulterior motives set out in the original were logical, obvious, even if homicidal. That said there is still chance to sensibly disclose the logic behind Red Queen's current actions, but this episode in the realm of Resident Evil severely limited faith in Anderson and his overall outlook."

It pretty much feel like they didn't know what to do for the next movie, so they had Paul Anderson's kid or nephew or whatever write something that he tough would look cool on cam... It feel like it. Characters are randomly pop out of nowhere, are nothing except costumes from there video game counterparts, enemies have pretty much the same treatment and this movie just feel like a big mess.\n\nIf you like the video game, stay away from this movie, its basically like hearing your little sister that have absolutely no talent for singing trying to sing a song you like... it may be the same tune, but damn it has nothing to do in common with it.\n\nIf you don't like the game, don't care about story and just want good visual effects and action scenes, well it may suit you, cause its the only thing good about it."

An action movie that is slow does annoy me some but not enough to lessen the fun of the action scenes.\n\nWe leave behind the horror genre tag and become a sci-fi/action movie so the scares may be gone, but the excitement does not go away with it.\n\nKnowledge of the first and fourth movie seem to be the most important here so you may want to revisit those before watching the fifth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Upon my viewing of Resident Evil: Retribution last night, I was left with an action-packed but ultimately hollow experience.\n\nLets start with the pros. Resident Evil has action, some of it is really well executed - especially with regards to choreography of fight scenes and encounters with large monsters where 3D was used quite effectively. The film also has plenty of opportunity to have some interesting battles with hordes of zombies however a lot of the film has \"opportunity\" so that's unfortunately not saying too much.\n\nOkay, now the cons. I have more to say here and don't necessarily have to spoil any of the plot. The film feels very isolated, often like a B-movie. It occasionally remembers that Resident Evil began as somewhat of a horror franchise when it projects a jump scare onto the screen but a majority of it just falls flat. The plot begins as a convoluted mess then straightens up and just turns plain average. The acting is fairly awful with the occasional exception of Jovovich demonstrating distance from people yet implying a longing for closeness. The script is cheesy and zombies feel limited in number which is something unusual for a film franchise notorious for having zombies at its core.\n\nOverall the film is edited and hollow. That's how I can best describe it. Despite being a zombie/monster film, it's surprisingly clean and fuelled by green screen. Though I'll likely see the sequel in the hope it rounds off well - this film feels like a stand in and just more of the same in the series.\n\n4/10"

There is so much shooting that they really should of hired a sound guy who knows what guns sound like. Now we have just random gunsounds for all weapons. A pistol might sound like a pistol and the next round is a rifle sound for no reason. Assault rifle shooting full auto has a random rifle sound in the middle of a burst.\n\nIf you hit something the size of an elephant with a car, the elephant might get hurt more - but the car sure would have a huge dent. Not in this \"movie\".\n\nSomebody really should of shown Sienna Guillory has to shoot a gun. Now she's shooting like she's puching with the weapon.\n\nMost of the movie happens in a holographic joke that they should of left in the 80's Star Trek where it belongs. The holographs are somehow solid but the people are real (or clones) and the scenery can change any time to completely different city. So do half the people get stuck inside walls and other solid objects just appearing out of nowhere when that happens?\n\nThat's just a few that come to mind."

This is hands down the worst one in the series so far and considering what the series is as a whole that's really saying something."

Sequels (SOME remakes & reboots, too) just for the sake of making sequels have to stop. They're (almost) always terrible. And before anyone mentions 'The Godfather II' or 'Aliens', those were released over 25 years ago - let it go, FFS. This movie just seemed like an excuse to reunite cast members from the first film (for the weakest of reasons), and also to have many, many unnecessary fight scenes that never end. The film's first, second & third acts don't really seem to even come from the same storyline and the film's plot is all over the place. Also, I'm not quite sure how much longer the audience will continue to believe that these specially-trained, martial arts & combat experts (as they all seems to be) can barely hit a single target while shooting at another main character. If you're going to waste your money, spend it on the video games instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8 My name is Alice, and this is my world. \u00a8 Resident Evil was in my opinion the best movie adapted from a video game thanks in most part to Milla Jovovich. Almost all other films have failed to make the transition from video game to film, but there was something special about seeing this heroin fighting off the undead. What began as a horror film eventually turned into a nonstop action film in the following sequels: Apocalypse, Extinction, Afterlife, and now in the fifth one Retribution. I enjoyed some of the previous sequels although to a much lesser degree than the original. I was just fascinated with Jovovich's character, Alice, that I didn't mind that Resident Evil was quickly turning into an action franchise. Finally in Retribution I realized it was just getting too old and mind numbing. I was really disappointed with this film, although my expectations were lowered by the previous sequels. I was hoping that since some of the characters from the original film would be back that the film would go back to the horror genre, but instead it was much more action packed than the rest with so many characters that I just lost interest in the film. My love for Alice diminished after the first 30 minutes of Retribution and I was hoping the film would end soon. The acting in this film is terrible (not that it wasn't in the other sequels, but it is even worse here) and I really didn't enjoy any of the characters. The plot was also very hard to follow at first and I feel that every time a new film starts they forget about everything that was left untold in the previous films. It's as if they want these films to stand on their own, but they keep on raising questions and then never answer them.\n\nRetribution picks up right where Afterlife ended with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the few survivors from the apocalyptic world in the Arcadia ship being attacked by planes from the Umbrella Corporation with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) commanding them. During the attack Alice manages to bring down one of the planes before jumping off the ship to the water. After she awakes we see her locked up somewhere in a clandestine Umbrella facility where she is continually interrogated by Valentine who is receiving orders from the Red Queen (a computer that controls the entire Umbrella system). Then all of a sudden there is a security breach and Alice is able to escape and finds she's in Tokyo or some place similar. She is attacked by the virus infested people and manages to make her way back to the facility. Here she is helped by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) who tells her she has been held captive by the Red Queen and that she has helped her escape. She also lets Alice know that she was still in the facility and that she just had entered a simulation of Tokyo created by the evil corporation to train their soldiers. Ada works for Alice's enemy, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) who claims to be helping her since he needs her help after having lost control of the corporation. Albert has also sent some other men to rescue her including Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Leon (Johann Urb), and Barry (Kevin Durand). Together they will have to find a way to survive the undead and escape the facility, although the Red Queen has some surprises along the way: Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and One (Colin Salmon) have been cloned and also receive orders from the Queen.\n\nDespite being introduced to some of the old characters, in Retribution the Redfield brothers and K-Mart are left out along with several other plot elements. The main problem I had with this Paul W.S. Anderson film was the over abundance of action and characters. It was just too much for me. The best part of the film happened in the beginning in a scene that reminded me a lot of the original and had me fooled it was returning to the horror genre. It was a scene involving Alice waking up in her suburban home along with her daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer) and her husband Todd (Oded Fehr). Everything seemed like it was back to normal until some zombies began invading their home. Those 5 minutes where the most suspenseful and intense moment of the film. I just wished the film would've stayed that way instead of returning to the action packed scenes with hardly any scares or dialogues. It was just one action scene after another and nothing new was added to this film. I was really disappointed with Retribution and it will probably be among my list of the worst movies of the year.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

If you like a lot of spectacle and not much else, you may find it entertaining. I kept finding myself bored by the lack of plot.\n\nEven the 'creatures' were exact rehashes from previous films in the series. Nothing new or interesting there.\n\nThere was also a particular male character - played by Johann Urb - whos acting was so wooden that it was actually distracting from the story.\n\nThe film makers knew they could cash in on this one without making too much effort to think about what they could contribute to the story or the character, and thats exactly what they did.\n\nDon't bother, unless you are a die-hard fan."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off this review by saying that i've never been a huge fan of the Resident Evil films. I hated the first one, the second one was so bad it was fun to watch, the third film was decent, and the fourth I actually had a fun time with. The main reason I watch these films are because I am a huge fan of the games and I always thought the action sequences were actually well done in these films. With each film in the series getting a little better, I figured that i'd give Retribution a shot in hopes that it would be similar to Afterlife with over-the-top action and amazing 3D effects.\n\nUnfortuantly, Resident Evil: Retribution is a step backwards in a franchise that was never that good to begin with and while it may not be the worst film in the franchise, it's easily the most pointless. First off, the tagline \"Evil Goes Global\" and trailers for the film are incredibly misleading. They presented the film as if it was going to be Alice and the rest of group traveling around the world fighting zombies and taking down Wesker. The film is actually about Alice and a team of survivors trying to escape an underwater located Umbrella Base while they go through simulations of locations around the world such as Tokyo and New York City. I couldn't help but feel ripped off by the end of the film as I expected something totally different and got something that just seemed rather lazy.\n\nBefore I go anymore further into the negative aspects of the film though, I do want to mention some positive things about it. The action sequences in the film are once again really well filmed. While Paul W.S Anderson may not know how to direct a film as a whole, he knows how to shoot action. The action sequences in the first act are excellent and the climax scene had me on the edge of my seat. While I would say the film is non-stop action, the middle section of the film consist of generic shoot-em up scenes that are just not that entertaining or fun to watch. As a result, the film ends up feeling dull from this point up until the climax. On another positive note, the film is well paced and moves super fast so we never feel too tortured by even the dullest of scenes. It also provides a video game like feel to the film which is always a nice touch. Speaking of the video games, I have to admit it was pretty cool to see Leon in the film as he is my favorite character in the games.\n\nHowever, thats where the positives end for the most part. Back on the negative aspect, as I said before, there is almost no plot in the film and it's more of just a set up for a bunch of action sequences. I wouldn't have minded this as much if all of the action sequences were as equally entertaining instead of falling back on lame shoot-em-up scenes by the halfway point. I've also got to say that this film is incredibly stupid, and I mean stupid! I know that these are turn-your-brain-off action movies, but I just couldn't get over how incredibly stupid this movie was! Almost nothing made sense and the fact that Alice spends half of the movie trying to save a little girl that she finds in one of the simulations who serves no purpose what so ever and isn't even a real person. It was probably one of the worst plot devices i've ever seen in a movie and all the action sequences could've been set up just fine without her, in which would've resulted in a much less mind-numbingly stupid movie. Now i've never been into the story of this series, but the fact that this movie had none and did nothing to advance the progression of the already thin story in the previous films had me wishing they would've. While watching, it's hard to not feel as if Anderson and Jovovich have finally grown tired of this franchise (as they should've a long time ago). And while nobody goes into these films expecting good acting, it's worth mentioning that the acting here is by far the worst in the series. On a side note, one thing that also got me into the theater was the 3D effects. After Afterlife and it's amazing 3D, one would expect Retribution to at least be on par with it's 3D effects. Unfortuantley, the 3D here is rather mediocre. It doesn't add much depth to the film at all and while there are plenty of gimmicky moments, none of them pop out like they should. This lackluster 3D effects are most likely a result of Anderson switching to using Red Epic Cameras (a cheaper brand of 3D technology) instead of the Fusion Camera System that was used for Afterlife. This was most likely done for budget reasons, but at the expense of the 3D technology for the film.\n\nEven for fans of the franchise, Retribution is a hard film to recommend because it does nothing to advance the story that many of the fans enjoy and is nothing more than just 90 minutes of filler for a 6th film in the series. What saves it from being downright terrible are the action sequences. Judging by the ending, there's not doubt that a 6th film is on it's way. Lets just hope that the series ends there because Retribution is only more proof that this franchise should've have never gone as far as it has."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film essentially picks up where the last movie \"Resident Evil-Afterlife\" left off with \"Alice\" (Milla Jovovich) fighting a desperate battle aboard the old cargo tanker \"Arcadia.\" Totally outnumbered and outgunned, Alice is eventually captured and upon regaining consciousness, wakes up to find that she is being held captive in an underground facility with her former ally \"Jill Valentine\" (Sienna Guillory) now working for the \"Red Queen\" (Megan Charpentier) and attempting to brainwash her into compliance. During this process, her other enemy \"Albert Wesker\" (Shawn Roberts) hacks into the computer mainframe which allows Alice to escape from her cell. She then meets one of Wexler's agents named \"Ada Wong\" (Bingbing Li) who explains that they are also at war with the Red Queen's Umbrella Corporation, and suggests that they team up to fight their common enemy. To that effect, Wesker has sent a small commando team to help extract Alice from the Red Queen's clutches. The problem is that both Jill and the Red Queen have an army of computer enhanced zombies at their discretion and plan on throwing everything they have within the facility to prevent their escape. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, once again, the director (Paul W. S. Anderson) discarded tried-and-true cinema techniques like horror or suspense and decided to utilize action and CGI instead. No real plot. No real acting. Just action and CGI--and lots of it. On that note, I must admit that the CGI is quite good and as such the film wasn't a total waste of time. Even so, in the hands of a good director the final product could have been really outstanding. Unfortunately, that just wasn't the case and I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly below average."

        "review_title": "Resident Evil 5: Retribution seeks in a distant past some references to build its plot, but the excess of action tires the audience",
        "review_detailed_main": "The best feature of the feature film by Paul W. S. Anderson offers are references to games. The narrative is built to look like a game. There are stages - each set in a different country, with different bosses and enemies for each - virtual transitions, new weapons or powers unlocked at each new stage, among other elements taken directly from video games. The whole movie has the look of a Playstation game, from photography, to costumes and characters from the game universe. In addition to Alice and Jill Valentine, join the franchise old acquaintances from the games, who had never shown up in cinema. Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton are examples of this, gaining space in the films to the delight of fans of the franchise.\n\nAfter so much running and running, it's really hard to get a sense of where our protagonist Alice (Milla Jovovich) really is, but suffice it to say that her quest for revenge against the Umbrella Corporation continues unabated, which here imprisons Alice in a kind of complex that, you see, it simulates experimental realities that are very similar to the game phases that need to be won in popular electronic games. Once again, Alice will have help to escape this challenge, as she will come across (in a clever trick of the script) with the return of some familiar faces of the franchise.\n\nRight away, \"Retribution\" shows what it came from: a burst of visual effects. Carrying on the legacy of \"Afterlife\", 3D is widely used. However, it seems that Paul Anderson learned from the exaggerations of the previous film. The strategy of making things \"fly\" in the audience's face is used more modestly and when it is done, it has a less obvious impact than it did in the previous film. Slow motion is also used more intelligently, at times when the effect is needed. The opening scene is unusual and has a very positive effect - it's like we're inside Alice's mind, trying to piece together a recent memory. Not only does the feature film start right where the previous one left off, it explains the entire heroine saga so far. If you haven't watched the other films, you won't be parachuted into history, even if it's not that complex. It is the first clue to Anderson's tendency to relocate in \"extra-film\" everything - contextualization, exposure - that does not refer to the action itself. In one scene, where Jovovich teaches Michelle Rodriguez how to use a gun, she says, \"It's like a camera, you just point and shoot.\" This phrase synthesizes Anderson's work - a vision of cinema at once simple and simplistic -, which treats diegetic space as the domain of action and action alone.\n\nPerhaps it is thinking about this that Paul W. S. Anderson promotes in this fifth film the return of a figure that was absent since the first feature, the Red Queen artificial intelligence. The sinister computerized little girl (now played by Megan Charpentier) is not only the main element of the \"extra-film\" in Retribution, giving information that situates and moves the plot, but also behaves like the master of the game, triggering scenarios and bosses. -stage every mission from Alice and her friends. The fact that Retribution is set entirely in an Umbrella test facility, from which the heroine needs to flee, obviously gives the film a game face, but it is more in Anderson's direction choices than in the script itself that this kinship is established in fact.\n\nDespite the crazy proposal to conduct the story in an underground Umbrella complex used for simulations, the plot actually makes sense. Unexpectedly, the installation's existence, construction and purpose are explained, a rarity in Anderson's scripts so far (with the exception of the first). In the end, the idea of \"global evil\" (which theoretically has been around since RE3: The Extinction) is somewhat exaggerated. Even if we visit Tokyo, Moscow, New York and Raccoon City, the changes of scenery are not so relevant. In the sequences where the characters are in these cities, the location itself doesn't seem to make a difference, since the biggest interaction is not with the environment, but with the creatures. The proof of this is that the sequel in Raccoon City, with the simplest scenario, is one of the most interesting. Meanwhile, in NY the Axemen steal the show and the giant Licker makes you forget you're in Moscow.\n\nOnce again, the filmmaker explores as much as he can the beauty of his wife, Jovovich, placing her in situations, clothes and poses that evoke only mildly masturbatory images for the male teenage audience (but without showing too much, unfortunately). The promise of a human Alice is definitely fulfilled. Finally, Milla Jovovich showed a more interesting, more empathetic character than the \"killing machine\" of previous films. In \"Afterlife\" Alice was supposed to show her human side after losing her powers, but all that was shown were sequences of impossible feats, not worthy of mere mortals. Yes, Alice from \"Retribution\" is still the badass who kills zombies with impossible stunts and unnecessary explosions, but the fifth feature shows that there is a woman there inside that thick shell. This impression is not restricted to scenes with \"Suburban Alice\", but also with \"Real Alice\" and using a child to bring out the sentimental side of the character was an excellent strategy. What is strange is this human side awakened by Becky not causing any kind of commotion in Alice when she sees her friends who died at Umbrella's hands being used as clones to hunt her down.\n\nWhile there is better development for Alice, again, the secondary characters are completely smothered by her presence, especially when considering Leon and Barry. Requests to bring the character from RE4 to the movies were finally granted, but the script doesn't allow the character to be explored, known and become empathetic. Still talking about game characters, Ada Wong is definitely a standout. Li Bingbing manages to get very close to the spy, despite lacking sensuality. The character is better constructed and explored by the script than Leon and Barry, mainly because of constantly sharing the scene with Alice. However, at a certain point in the film, Ada loses space and prominence - we practically forget that bitch in the red dress is one of Albert Wesker's main agents. While Ada is a surprise, Jill is a disappointment. Sienna comes in as the featured villain, which supposedly makes her an important character in the plot, but what has happened to her since RE2: Apocalypse is unknown. When and how was she captured? Since when is it controlled? Sienna had said in an interview that, like Jill from RE5, she would be aware of her actions while acting against her will. At no point was this shown. Luther could have died in \"Afterlife\", as we came to think, since his participation is insignificant. Chris and Claire are named, but after the battle in Arcadia and the destruction of the Umbrella compound, I'm not sure how Paul Anderson will explain a possible return of the two to the plot.\n\nThe clones' proposal, which was used as a rather lame justification for bringing Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr and Colin Salmon into the cast, was passed over. Wesker is now, we might say, a former villain. Despite not showing any clear intentions (again, the script fails to explain a relevant point), the character is determined to bring Umbrella down and, as in Umbrella Chronicles, put an end to the Red Queen supercomputer. Now, the girl is a kind of Skynet, who controls Umbrella on all its levels - and hates the human race? This is likely to be the loose end of Alice's journey in the next film.\n\nA lot can be said about Resident Evil 5, unless it's a boring movie. The action scenes start right in the opening credits - with a bombastic air raid sequence. It's gunfire, zombies, huge monsters, races and car chases, all at high speed and noise like action fans love so much. With that, any kind of development in relation to the central characters is left aside so that there is more space for the adventure. In other words, don't expect to understand who Alice is or who are her friends. They are just instruments for the action to run as smoothly as possible. Again abandoning zombies for much of the narrative, this new chapter in the Resident Evil saga continues what the previous ones had been doing, increasingly moving away from the undead movie label. Here, the villains are Umbrella and the freaks created by the corporation. Zombies are a small part of the whole. Interestingly, brain-eaters are all the rage lately and it even sounds strange that Resident Evil producers don't take advantage of this good moment to fill the story with zombies.\n\nDuring the entire projection, what the director gives us is sequences and more sequences of brawls \u00e0 la \"Devil May Cry\" (another Capcom franchise, by the way) that occasionally impress aesthetically, especially due to good 3D photography. But these scenes soon become tiresome and repetitive, not least because the figures we see on screen are extremely two-dimensional, with most serving only to die suddenly or as mere fan service. Well, games can even support unrestrained action because we put ourselves in the characters' shoes, their risk is ours. Here, we have a rather passive experience, with Anderson alternating between unruly slow-motion and abusively fast cuts, like in the final battle in the snow.\n\nDespite having a video game look and being a 3D movie series, Resident Evil 5: Retribution seeks in a distant past some references to build its plot: the open endings, which give clear cliffhangers to the sequel, showing how the Earth is after the last events of the War against Umbrella causes chills and fear of what is yet to come, since the sixth part is confirmed, with the release date already set, with what should be the final chapter. The production of Resident Evil is increasingly worn out, carrying a boredom that increases with each new Alice film against the Umbrella corporation."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike most of the video game based films, the Resident Evil franchise has managed to keep churning them out. While not all are on par with the fun of the original, they each have had something of their own to bring to the table and the fans that enjoy them really get sucked in. The latest installment Resident Evil: Retribution, sported a trailer that seemed to tease the return of previous characters in the series, but does it have anything new to add to the series?\n\nResident Evil: Retribution follows Alice alongside a resistance movement in her continuing war against the Umbrella Corporation. The latest installment is decent enough, but falls short in a lot of ways becoming the weakest of the series so far. There is a lot to digest here in such a short run time and not all of it works or makes sense. As with most of the films there are a lot of holes in the story, but you let a lot of that go in exchange for the zombie killing action. Here you get tons of action, but still just didn't really have the same vibe as the other films. Jovovich steps into the role delivering the character pretty much exactly the same way she always does, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast. Most of them are pretty stiff and feel forced or like they just aren't feeling it. There are plenty of returning creatures and characters, but most of them just didn't feel necessary other than to try and add that missing something. The problem is they don't really do much with most of them and they feel like a wasted opportunity. The location of the film is both good and bad. There were some great opportunities here to do some really cool things with their environment all over the world, but instead it just felt like they really served no point other than to attempt to explain how the T-Virus spread. Yes this info is important, but it could have just been in dialogue without the other aspects, and in some ways it pretty much was which was an overall waste of space. The action was really well done for the most part and there was plenty of it. Easily most of the movie was just gun fights and hand to hand combat which keeps you entertained while suffering through the other nonsense.\n\nOriginally it was said that the fifth and sixth film would be filmed back to back and it shows here. This isn't a horrible film, just feels more like filler to something else instead of the standalone films with an obvious more to come ending like the others. If you are a fan of the series be sure to check this out, because it defiantly sets it up for another and if done correctly could be a great cap on a fun franchise.\n\nhttp://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

This one has the most characters from the video games but they all feel underdeveloped with nothing to them but to serve fan service to whoever's still watching these. I don't even get why they even bothered bringing Michelle Rodriguez back cuz she feels wasted here compared to her appearance in the first movie. Not to mention the whole cloning Alice concept is just getting real old now. Obviously at this point the box office dollars were talking louder than the scripts bein written."

The inclusion of the 'child in peril' is also completely pointless! The Zombies are a rare sight in this instalment too which i found a great disappointment, and are replaced by poor CGI Lickers and other 'arena constructs' (Hunger Games anyone??)\n\nPersonally I think this is the weakest of the series, it's only redeeming feature is that it has some great action sequences which are shot brilliantly. The reverse shots as the film opens are stunning. And Milla Jovovich is on top Ass Kicking form!\n\nIf you've seen the rest of the films, this one is worth a look, but if you are new to them, then I wouldn't bother, you will be left wondering \"WTF is happening\"!"

The movie is undoubtedly spot on for their action scenes and will be a treat for an eyes for the action lovers but apart from action the movie disappoints in a big way.\n\nApart from Milla it seems that rest of the characters are forced to play the part and seems disinterested.

        "review_detailed_main": "Where does this new hype of vanity on the story's and character's profoundity of action movies come from? That's so ridiculous! I am actually not a fan of zombie movies (I've seen around 4 apart from the Resident Evil series), but this movie can not be counted as a regular zombie movie. The intention of this movie isn't telling a story or creating interesting characters that one can empathize with. But to me this is a totally wrong trend of Hollywood, since movies shall show us what we DON'T experience in our everyday life anyway. A movie is a piece of art, and not the biography and analysis of a character (although this can also be very entertaining if it's innovative).\n\nThis movie is a superb composition of compelling sounds and 3-dimensional pictures of an amazing quality. Resident Evil 5 constantly generates an atmosphere that I have hardly ever felt before.\n\nThose low ratings here are nothing but what happens, if the regular action-slasher movie audience, who doesn't understand anything from arts, prides itself on being oh so intellectual and vain. So far too vain to enjoy something, that provides the best of its kind. There were many engraving scenes or even just pictures that have the potential of becoming standards.\n\nPeople who now talk about how abstract or illogical this movie is are bonkers, action and horror movies mostly have a similar background logic to cartoons or operas, which means - non! But if Maggie Simpson shoots the mafia or if Don Giovanni suddenly begins to sing while in a dialog nobody complains! Because this is what it is all about, because nobody expects science there, nobody expects reality, still everybody is wonderfully entertained! Why do you suddenly expect it here? I hate this reality show trend, shall even our movies now lose all their creativity and fantasy? Movies are for gaining a distance from our boring lives by diving into a world where nothing is impossible. Movies shall not just become mirrors of our society...\n\nThis movie gripped me and only released me, when it ended. There were only very few seconds where the thrill wasn't perfect. As the title says, the 3D is ideal for this movie, I would even say this movie benefits from it more than Avatar. The parts of the Resident Evil series that I have seen before were boring and gray in comparison to this one. The creatures which appear are not really disgusting or shocking, you don't have to be afraid of bad dreams after watching Resident Evil 5. A few scenes could be a little too thrilling for some people though."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was quite intrigued by the Resident Evil series last year and I was that pumped for them, that I watched the first 4 within one single period. I was so glad to hear that they were making a 5th one, I was dying to see how this next entry would expose more of the series, more mindless zombie action and how they would make more tribute to the games.\n\nMy first impression of the trailer back in September was that it looked like it could be of some decent promise. I had a feeling the film could still be better than watching the trailer itself.\n\nI then see the film, and here's what I thought of it in a few words: confusing, mind-numbing, sometimes out of context and even unethical to plot lines.\n\nThat's what I mainly though about this film. This 5th installment had so much promise, but instead decided to take things to extreme heights and go in some of the most confusing, most mind-numbing scenes and story lines I have ever seen in a Resident Evil film. Sure, the Resident Evil films partly have twists in their stories over time and all the time, but this one took the bait. It made me as a viewer really confused about where they were taking the story, characters, action and the entire premise of the elements and meaning. Did I mention I was already a tad confused??? I don't expect there to be well-developed things happening in a Resident Evil film, but I do expect there to be some form of entertainment, to say the least. The beginning and most of the first hour is nothing but flashes for what I could see of the 1st and 2nd film, and then there were many different plots happening and jamming in at the same time which made me lost on what was happening.\n\nI also found that there were hardly any zombies in this thing. Where were the zombies in this film! They are the prime source to what made this series. I see them and I saw chaos occurring everywhere in the first four films which actually do a good job at creating some form of tension and action. Here there is none of that. And why is it that the character of Leon, who is in the 4th and 6th game installments suddenly thrown into this??? I'll never understand that.\n\nIn my opinion, I believe they should have just continued the battle on the boat and went from there. It would have created more realism and stay true to the series. This film feels like a differently, filmed entry on it's own.\n\nOn a positive note, I would say the action sequences and soundtrack score were excellent as always. They were the only elements that kept this film at it's feet (barely).\n\nOverall I don't hate this film, but I certainly was disappointed by it. I mean what were the creators thinking when they were throwing scenes around in this film??? And hardly any zombies??? I'd say stick with the first 4, yes even Afterlife. If you think Afterlife is bad (which I really liked a heap), try this and compare them. 5/10"

I'm guessing it will be an epic movie considering it's called \"the final chapter\"! So I'm sure everything will all tie together and make for a climatic end! Super stoked! But jeez if I can't be in the movie at least name one of the bad asses TARA (after me of course ; ) ) Keep up the great work! Anxiously waiting!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This part of the Resident Evil franchise is the quintessential Apple generation movie: it looks perfect, with thin lines and swiping motions, but it doesn't do much. They removed any screenwriter from the equation and replaced them all with XD (Experience Design) people. Except a few situations with zombies and undead monsters (that may or may not have been real anyway), it wasn't horror either.\n\nSo what are we left with? Milla Jovovich is still gorgeous and we even see her partly naked. I guess that was the highlight of the film. The script is ridiculous, the special effects are over the top, but not in a good way, and they finally attempted to mix together elements from the game, the animated films and the motion picture movies by bringing Leon and Ada and Barry (and removing any semblance of a story). Only they were superfluous and could just as well have not been there. Oh, and they show mutalisks at the end...\n\nConclusion? (in the dub step soundtrack that ends the film) It feels like you would see someone playing a really dumb game. It looks pretty good, but you can't play it, you can only watch. You wait for a few minutes, then you just screw it all, get a tablet and google for pictures of Milla."

To be honest I only wanted to see this film due to the fact Leon was finally in it! I needed to make sure they portrayed him well and I've got to say... I was disappointed and it's not because of Johann Urb he played Leon fantastically they picked the right guy to play him, plus he's hot!! But Leon wasn't witty! That's the best thing about Leon he's quick witted, but he was just boring and didn't really have that many lines... was basically a bit part like Barry who didn't say much either and was way too tough than I remember him being in RE.\n\nThe story line's for these films are just awful! The red queen i just don't understand, why is she being portrayed as a child, i know its mentioned in the first film but can't remember, they should at least stick to the games scenario. There was way too much action in this film also, it was just action, after action, after action, after action there was hardly a break in between the action sequences, i was hoping for something more dark and for a big arse creature that wasn't so easy to take out! oh and as for the Las Plagas that Rain injected into herself and Leon and the other guy couldn't kick her arse... Leon would have know how to have killed her, the las plagas virus isn't unbeatable... just so disappointed and they've left it open for another one... The only way i'll see this one is if Leon is in it again :D LOL"

Special effects were fine (some were realistic, others were very unrealistic but still pretty); the movie was lengthy enough to include some plot development, but most of the script felt rushed. It wasn't horrible... but it was as if many of the scenes were shot in just 1 take too few (or 5 minutes of post-editing too few). \"That's where you're wrong\"... \"This is a mistake\"... \"Get out of my way\" could be an very plausible exchange if the two characters just took 3 seconds of pause in between; without any pause it seems forced, amateurish, and actually disgusting to anyone who grew up in the years before the internet caused such a drop in the dramatic quality of movies. The immediacy which seemed to plague the first 3/4 of the movie combined with the fact that combatants fired weapons, without cover and standing with their whole bodies in view of on-coming fire, yet barely got hit... made me think that somebody is not taking this franchise very seriously.\n\nI think this could have been done a lot better... but it does as the prior two movies have; it continues the plot in a new direction without wholly disappointing viewers... though it could have been far more pleasant."

And OK, its not that easy to follow the storyline, if u don't know the games or have been watching the other parts of Resident Evil. But all others i cant understand, what they r xpecting from the new part.\n\nFrom start on, the action, showed in the movie, was fabulous. Its no difference between this movie or the ones before. If u expect a new changed action to the other parts, then u shouldn't watch this, cause nothing has changed. Zombies running over the world after a virus broke out and umbrella is creation new creatures, after the world is almost being destroyed. So u ll see zombie in different version every part and this one showed up a real well made realisation of the game.\n\nI really love the scenery \"copied\" from the game and i think this is the best of the five movies. The hole film took me in his ban from the very first second. Surely the little review wasn't enough to make u understand the hole storyline but, who cares....(only if u don't know the other ones). 90% of this movie are in a well made 3D quality. Surely its possible to make it better(like avatar), but i looked many 3D films before and this is one of the upper league. I just took away one Star cause of some logic mistakes, but if u r a man(or woman) who likes this part of action-,sf-movies or videogames , which don't need a big \"wow\" storyline u will love this movie. Its just simple but very well done realisation of the video game.\n\nFor addition: The expendables don't have a big story 2 but there are so many people out there, who love this film too."

The result is a long, messy and illogical crash bang wallop fest for 95 minutes, culminating in an overlong and tedious anti climactic fight sequence on the ice.\n\nThis film never gets exciting or witty or moving it's just a lot of explosions, guns and zombies.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen and heard many negative reviews about the latest installment of the Resident Evil series, and that Paul W.S. Anderson has ruined the Resident Evil franchise but I really have to disagree with all these critics.\n\nSure, the movie does have it's flaws, especially plot wise, dialogue wise etc. But I still found it to be an awesome action movie with dazzling 3-D effects, cool and exciting fight sequences and enough action to keep your heart pumping non-stop!\n\nThe opening sequence for this movie was just EPIC, especially with the music composed by Tomandandy. Being able to see the action unfold in reverse and in slow motion was just the coolest thing ever. It also introduces us to the Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil 5 game with her mind-controlling scarab in action for the first time, with her machine guns blazing. Another thing i really loved was how Alice used her coins as ammunition for the last time against one of the umbrella helicopters.\n\nThe story of how they were all racing against time to escape from the Umbrella facility reminded me of the first movie and also in some way the games, where you have a certain time limit to escape before the building you are in explodes.\n\nAnother thing i loved about the movie was the introduction of characters Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton. I believe that Li BingBing played the role of Ada Wong rather well. Like the games, there are moments where she will exude a certain confidence, and appear tough, while at times, she would appear vulnerable, like when she gets caught.\n\nJohann Urb also portrayed Leon well, though i would definitely hope to see him in more action, and with more dialogue (smarter ones).\n\nKevin Durand was an interesting take on the character Barry in my opinion. In the games, I would think of Barry as a more grumpy, rugged and older man. Whereas here you get a younger and more humorous Barry, which i thought was alright.\n\nThe final battle on the ice boasts some of the most creative and amazing fight sequences, (in amazing 3-D). This fight is also the first time where i find myself actually fearing for Alice's life (watch it and you know why) and I really enjoyed seeing her in this vulnerable state. She is human after all.\n\nOne major flaw in this movie was the dialogue. Although i do appreciate the occasional cheesy one liners, I do think there was way too many cheesy lines here. Also, i find that some of the dialogue makes it seem like the characters weren't really conversing, but rather making statements. Especially the one where Alice was talking to Leon before she heads off to rescue *someone*.\n\nAnother flaw of this movie was the discreet introduction of the Las Plagas parasite. Fans of the Resident Evil franchise would know of the parasite from the 4th game, but they should have at least dedicated some time in the movie to introduce the parasite, and explain it's origins.\n\nOther than these little flaws, I still found the film enjoyable. I have watched it three times already and each time i left the cinema i find myself being mind blown by it.\n\nI will definitely look forward to the next Resident Evil movie, which i am sure will happen.\n\nBe sure to catch this movie in IMAX 3-D! Worth every penny."

The more times I watch this chapter, the more I'm finding it to be a guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, it's still bad and just has the odious whiff of Paul W.S. Anderson. Poor and utterly cheesy dialogue blended with the occasional bad CGI and 3D gimmicky nonsense. The plot is so convoluted that everyone is being brought back as clones or are somehow still alive. I don't know...I just go with it now. However, despite all this I do find enjoyment in the small crevices. Those cracks being the musical score (which is the best in the series by far) and the supporting characters that actually have a tiny bit more personality. Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy's actors have less range than a ticking metronome, but reintroducing past characters felt rather nostalgic. Visual effects have improved dramatically. Milla Jovovich keeps on increasing her \"badassery\". The final fight scene is the best choreographed action sequence in the series. The editing was abysmal but watching Michelle Rodriguez annihilate two guys in hand-to-hand combat felt satisfying to watch. Retribution went for full on action with sci-fi traits, and to be honest I'm on board now. This franchise has ended me, plus I'm slightly drunk so there...cheers! One more to go!!"

As always the actors are great, (and lets face it, great to look at). It had a cool intro as well.\n\nThe bad? The plot. Why? Because there basically isn't one. There is no character development (although there was some fun in seeing different characters). For all the action that does occur in the film, the plot could be done within five minutes. This movie is very obviously a filler, just a short piece of blood and explosions to explain how Alice and the others fared from the end of the last movie to the start of the next.

I am a fun of the games I have played Resident Evil 1,2,3,4 and a bit of the 5, My favorite game is Resident Evil 1, a truly lovely horror game, Resident Evil 2,3 are OK, then I has just become a shooter game with less horror.\n\nSame with this sequels, Well comparing this to other Resident Evil movies, the first resident Evil was OK, not bad, in the second one it was OK, in the 3rd one it was getting bad, the 4rd one not a really good movie, and this one, is also not a really good movie.\n\nThe action parts are really bad. Eda Wong is such a weak girl in this movie, and Resident Evil Damnation or even within the game, (cutscenes) she is really strong and she never lets her guard down so easily. If you look at the game and the live action films, there are a lot of gaps.\n\nA lot of the scenes are simple pathetic, they are making a complete ridicule of the game.\n\nIf you are a fan of Resident Evil, watch Resident Evil Degeneration, Resident Evil Dammation or, Resident Evil 4d executer. All of the are CGI films.\n\nTo summarize if you are a fun of the game don't watch the movie."

Retribution continues from there, with Alice getting captured and interrogated in a top secret, bottom dwelling facility.\n\nThe T virus, which has mutated almost the entire race of humans into extinction, has gone out of control, and the erstwhile villain, Wesker, seeks Alice's help in fighting human extinction. He arranges a rescue team who will break into the facility and get Alice's hive.\n\nThis is the plot; or as much of an excuse for a plot you can get. The truth is that the Resident Evil franchise stopped creating plots by the end of the first movie and now markets acrobatic zombie sequences tied together by one common character.\n\nFor a movie that is almost exclusively full of action sequences, it falls short compared to the previous installment. The scale of ridiculousness, however, is maintained, despite sequences featuring Nazi zombies. And these Nazi zombies ride bikes, cars, and use guns/ rocket launchers, etc in a marked departure from the average zombie who just walks slowly with arms outstretched.\n\nThe movie ends on another cliffhanger, promising an even better plot less string of action sequences for the next movie."

        "review_title": "More of the same, \"Resident Evil: Retribution\" is unfortunately a step down after the previous two entries, but thankfully is far from being the worst in the series.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Resident Evil: Retribution\" is the fifth entry in Paul W.S. Anderson's loose (and I mean very loose) film adaptations of the video game series. Although at this point, Anderson has implemented his own agenda for the series, and removed it so far from it's origins, I don't really see them as video-game adaptations anymore. But I digress, because the series' unfaithfulness to its source material is another topic altogether. Let's just focus on the film itself.\n\nMilla Jovovich returns as Alice, this time awakening in a remote Umbrella research facility following the events of the previous film's finale. She is greeted by her former enemy, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who has evidently defected from Umbrella's side after realizing that with their current agenda, there will be no end to Umbrella's evil scheming, which will inevitably lead to the extinction of the human race. Together with a clone of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) from the first film and a young girl (Aryana Engineer) who thinks Alice is her mother, Alice is forced to navigate a series of experimental test grounds in the facility, modeled after major world landmarks, to escape.\n\nThe acting is pretty much par for the course. There are some good performances and some bad. Jovovich is as charming, sexy and cool as ever in the role of Alice, and this film thankfully forces her to stretch her emotional range a bit more than prior films, due to her relationship with the girl. Roberts is flat as Wesker, though, due to his limited screen time and odd delivery of dialog. Rodriguez is a joy to have back, although her roles (since she portrays multiple versions of herself) aren't well developed. Engineer is a lot of fun as the little girl. Supporting roles from the likes of Johann Urb, Kevin Durand and Sienna Guillory range from decent to poor, unfortunately.\n\nI found the writing and direction to be a step down, however. I hold the previous two films (\"Extinction\" and \"Afterlife\") in a decent regard, and see them as probably the best the series has to offer- they were tightly written, well-directed and a lot of fun, even though they weren't particularly good films. This movie feels more dead on arrival, though. The script is very rushed, characters are much more under- developed, and it's actually quite bland. It's too much of a paint-by- numbers situation. The direction also isn't quite up to snuff. Even though I found the direction of the prior film distracting, due to its obvious overuse of gimmicky 3D, this film just feels... assembled and without character, and I honestly would have preferred the gimmicky direction of the fourth film, since it at least had style. This just doesn't feel like the work of a filmmaker that is fully invested.\n\nThe rest of the production also feels as though less effort was put in. Set and costume design ranges from great to awful, and everything feels more generic than ever. The musical score is not memorable in the slightest, nor is it particularly compelling outside of the fantastic opening credits theme. The only real step-up was the visual effects, which were actually very good for the most part. Particularly in the new variation of the \"Licker\", a creature seen in the first two films. While it was never convincing in those movies, here, it's fully realized and looks quite realistic.\n\nIt's really a shame. Although I was not a particularly big fan of the first two films (in fact, I outright hated the second film), I was very entertained and quite taken by the third and fourth films, due to their fun, action-packed atmosphere. This was definitely a step down, and a step in the wrong direction, and arguably the second weakest film in the franchise. Though thankfully it is nowhere near the disaster that the second film was.\n\nI still am curious to see the sixth (and allegedly final) entry in the series, but after this film, I most certainly won't be as excited as I could have been. \"Resident Evil: Retribution\" gets a very mediocre 5 out of 10. Strictly for fans and nobody else."

        "review_detailed_main": "I honestly never thought I'd be sitting in the position to review the 5th, and soon to be 6th, film of the Resident Evil franchise. Usually by the time a franchise is 5 films and over a decade old, the series has gone through many changes and underwent several aesthetic iterations. You'd think they would reinvent the films several times over right? Well, with Resident Evil it's more of the same with every movie.\n\nEach film has their entertaining qualities. 'Retribution' has probably the finest action and most polished visual effects of the entire series, but there's nothing under the surface. It should come as no surprise to people familiar with the series as each film holds the same problem, but I'm foolish enough to think the next film will change. Here's hoping that 'The Final Chapter' does more than just impress the eyes.\n\nThe funny thing is, 'Retribution' plays like it already is the \"final chapter\". Bringing back Michelle Rodriquez, Sienna Guillory, Boris Kodjoe, Oded Fehr, and Shawn Roberts, all of which whose characters were supposedly dead to the franchise. Which brings me to the most frustrating thing about this series. Characters come and go, actors come and go, settings come and go, without any real direction. It seems to me like every time one of these films goes into production they try to gather everyone from the franchise that they can, and then try to write a story around the actors. The story should always come first. This is the reason why when characters die in any Resident Evil film there is no emotional impact. Is it asking too much to develop characters a bit more in an action film?\n\nI can't say I can differentiate the plot of this film to any other in the series. Alice is going after Umbrella with the help of her friends and is forced to take on creatures of higher abilities and everyone's lives are at stake. There's nothing new and it's actually likely the least inventive of the series. Some cool action and certainly some polished CGI can save the experience. I guess.\n\n+Nice action/CGI\n\n-Characters come and go, and who really cares?\n\n-The story is exactly the same as it always is\n\n4.1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "All style but no substance is always best characterized Paul W.S. Anderson's directing efforts. In his new movie, RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION -- the fifth installment in the lucrative series -- continues his similar trend of filmmaking style. Suffice to say, whoever expecting Anderson to learn a thing or two about cohesive structure will be left disappointed.\n\nBut the movie does show some striking potential -- at least in the first 15 minutes. From the minute one, Anderson dazzles the viewers with an innovative opening credits sequences that runs backwards and in glorious slow-motion, showcasing the explosive attack on the Arcadia by a swarm of missile-launching helicopters. It's certainly an attention-grabbing opener, and Anderson continues to strike gold with the following scene involving Alice's (Milla Jovovich) hallucinatory zombies outbreak in a daylight suburbia. For a while there, Anderson shows some credibility in crafting expertly-staged suspenseful moments rarely seen since his EVENT HORIZON (1997). After a few quiet moments in the Umbrella Corporation where Alice finds herself being held captive and slowly tortured for information by her old friend-turned-brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the movie jolts back to vivid life when a system reload allows her to escape (together with a S&M-like skintight suit). She subsequently enters into a simulated Tokyo city at night and gradually being chased by a number of Asian zombies. Again, Anderson makes great use of slow-motion to depict a highly-stylized fight scene. No doubt they are all cool stuff. Of course, if only Anderson continues to maintain that creative momentum for the rest of the movie, RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION could have been hailed as his most entertaining entry in the series.\n\nUnfortunately he loses steam so fast that the subsequent running time is awfully formulaic. From here on, the action -- chase, fistfights, shootouts -- are repetitive and executed in the utmost conventional way possible (Is it because Anderson has exhausted all the budget in the first 15 minutes?).\n\nWhat about the plot? Let's just say Anderson has seemingly thrown away his previous scripts he has wrote for four RESIDENT EVIL movies, jumbled up all of them, and ends up as a patchwork of half-realized ideas. So whoever who are looking for coherent structure to tie back what happen in the previous movies, are best to left their brains at the door and enjoy the mindless ride instead. Oh, wait -- even the word \"enjoy the mindless ride\" isn't enough to warrant this as a solid B-action picture.\n\nAs for the cast, they are basically the same old stereotypes. Even the presence of Li Bingbing in her first Hollywood role as Ada Wong is particularly wasted here. Her textbook-like line delivery in English is simply wooden, while Johann Urb's performance as the fan-favorite Leon Kennedy is reduced to a thankless role.\n\nLikewise, Anderson concludes the movie with an open ending that seemingly promised for something big will happen (the sixth installment is reportedly will be his last series). Let's just hope the sixth entry in the future will be truly his last in the series.\n\nhttp://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not a faithful follower of the games franchise, having played only Resident Evil 3: Nemesis before switching to Parasite Eve, Postal and Left4Dead. But I like horror/slasher/zombie flicks and support the R.E. movie series because it doesn't pretend to be more than what it simply is--mindless indulgence.\n\nIf the project had originally landed in the hands of Neil Marshall (Doomsday, The Descent), potential to kick ass and wow the audience would've been higher but I'm not complaining. Milla Jovovich has carried the role of genetically engineered Alice very well and Retribution returns to a familiar legacy. In its sixth installment; there is bad government, mad scientists, a reluctant heroine and her friends set in a post-apocalypse.\n\nThe formula exists and over the years, Paul W. S. Anderson has responded to fans' expectations. I see faithful effort in every movie. There are more references to the original game this time in the vein of Ada Wong, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy and stylish fight choreography (look out for the scene where Alice battles zombies in Tokyo's simulation). Even the format progressively emulates the gaming experience, moving from one level to another. I get that the acting, script and plot can come away seeming mindless in appalling taste; but they are guilty pleasures and my views are skewed towards the positive.\n\nOnly complaints are Albert Wesker's (Shawn Roberts) funny accent; the casting of Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo (I'm a fan and feel that the role failed to do her justice), the lazy execution of her demise and just maybe, not enough zombies.\n\nThat said, there are many \"Oh man! *swoon*\" moments at Alice's corny one-liners. Resident Evil: Retribution is kinda like Battleship; Doom and Thor, the awesomeness is irrational."

Until now.\n\nThe plot of this film is pretty much nonsensical garbage. Alice wakes up in a lab, and with the help of Ada needs to meet up with Leon, Barry and... 2 other people (I've already forgotten who they are) while being chased by Jill and her squad of clones of the characters in the first film. Along the way we meet 2 executioners, a huge licker and a young deaf girl who is clearly a cynical copy of Newt from Aliens. There is even a scene where she get captured by the licker and Alice has to detour to save her. Yawn.\n\nSuffice to say, this film is dreadful. It's just one ridiculous action scene after another with no character development, pacing that never leaves top gear, stupid action scenes and is about as far removed from the games in terms of tone as you can possibly get. Imagine if a 10 year old kid took all their favourite Resi characters and made up some OTT story as they went along. \"Ooh wouldn't it be cool if we had a car chase in a lab? Yeah lets do that\". \"Ohh, ohh, lets have the computer from the first film return, because red is cool\". \"Oh, what if we had a girl get kidnapped and put in a pod for Alice to break like in Aliens!\" \"Ohh, ohh, lets have the lazer grid back as well. Oh, and what if Wesker was good?\"\n\nWhen you realise that the main star and the director are married it all begins to make perfect sense. It seems to be 90 mins of \"look how cool my wife is\", and 5 films in its getting extremely tiresome. The previous 4 films aren't great but this is the worst by far. Thankfully, I'm writing this in 2024 where this series has been binned in favour of rebooting it following the games more closely. Thank God...."

The script is stupid and wants us to care for undeveloped characters with parts that just seem too rushed and skipped. Also the main antagonist of this film (Red Queen) just keeps popping up and it seems really cheesy when she does, as they follow the antagonists through the scenes.\n\nOverall, instead of spending money on a piece of s**t action movie (Which will definitely get bad reviews and make a profit) , they should invest in a reboot of the whole franchise, creating a much darker and scarier film. Preferably based off Resident Evil 4 (The Game) and lose all of the stupid writing and pointless action. They also need to get a good actor for Lyon, as the actor in this movie was horrible and had too much muscle on him.\n\nIt is a B movie at best, due to all the pointless action and CGI, but other than that it has taken a new route of stupid in the Resident Evil franchise."

This one is the most unique of the first five films, however that doesn't necessarily equate to quality. In fact if anything it ended up making things even more bland than before.\n\nThe acting in this one was noticeably worse than any other entry in the series. There were some truly horribly delivered lines at times. Milla Jovovich on the other hand continues to be a bright light in the series. She does what she does well. She's likable and pulls of the \"badass\" tag very well.\n\n'Resident Evil: Retribution' is almost certainly the worst entry in the series to date. This film is living proof that this set of films has outstayed its welcome. If you're not adding something to story each time then why are you continuing to the make the films, other than for money? There is still one more film to go, 'The Final Chapter' which I plan to see this week. I can only hope that the series goes out on a high note, and maybe achieves some originality and freshness. Based on this entry though, I'm not going to get my hopes up."

This sequel was kinda extraordinary. If you want to have action with gore watch this definitely ! Hopefully they will release a new one that continues from where this movie ended, bad ass ending as well :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, let's remember that Resident Evil, like a number of other movies, was originally a video game. While never having created a deep and ponderous story-line, a few of the episodes in this series, (let's see now...this is number 5 I think), managed to produce some intriguing action sequences as well as generate interest in the characters. OK, maybe not that much interest, but the flicks weren't too bad as far as these kinds of kill-the-zombies movies go.\n\nOur heroine, clad in skin tight black leather suits, always managed a certain charisma, or something like charisma anyway. Needless to say, the series managed sufficient fan support to go all the way to number 5. The Matrix didn't even get to number 4.\n\nBut in this episode, the entire movie is as about as interesting as watching your dumb kid brother spend an hour and thirty minutes on his video game blasting the zombies on the screen. Maybe watching your kid brother would be more interesting. Maybe the first 30 minutes of the movie really is footage of someone's kid brother blasting zombies in his video game. It might be hard to tell the difference. And, it's all downhill from there. Don't waste your time, even if you are a fan of the series. You will be disappointed."

Instead they laid another egg.\n\nAgain the acting was poor, the story half-brained and the fight sequences putrid. There was nothing redeeming about exposed gun fights with high powered automatic weapons yielding no target hits (besides the faceless goons), or the slow motion, bordering paranormal fight sequences that were horribly choreographed and terribly executed. And is it too much to show someone actually running when they're running? You know: arms moving, head bobbing, face contorted with heavy breathing and other known characteristics associated with running. Instead we get glamour running. Hair neatly flowing in the wind, face at ease and arms and legs moving symmetrically all in slo-mo.\n\nThis movie did nothing to atone for Afterlife. This was no retribution."

Overall, however, this film felt like a very mild bit of foreplay ahead of the next installment hinted at at the end of this movie. I just hope that one goes off with a bang. (bigbadmoviereviews)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Paul W.S. Anderson and the Resident Evil films get a lot of hate, mostly from gamers who aren't happy with the way the story has been adapted for screen, but for me the whole series has been consistently entertaining, light on logic perhaps but heavy on the mayhem, with Anderson's latest offering, Retribution, being no exception.\n\nFrom the visually stunning credits sequence\u2014Alice battling the Umbrella Corp in reverse slo-mo\u2014to the apocalyptic final\u00e9 that looks like Hell on Earth, the film is non-stop popcorn fun, packed full of impressive action sequences, stunning special effects, excellent monsters, cool weaponry, and some very lovely ladies in impossibly tight battle dress. And as long as Milla and her sexy co-stars keep on slipping into figure-hugging outfits to do battle with corporate soldiers and hideous mutated zombies, I'll keep on watching.\n\nAdmittedly, this one feels less like a film and more like a video game than previous installments, the action moving mechanically from one scenario to the next, each presenting new dangers for Alice and her pals, but it is done with such energy and visual flair that it never proves boring. The film also offers up the rather appealing idea that The Umbrella Corp have been cloning employees to populate their massive testing grounds, keeping thousands of specimens in storage waiting to be activated. I'd like an Ada Wong and an Alice if there are any going spare! 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."

        "review_title": "If a bad fan fiction writer got a multi million dollar budget",
        "review_detailed_main": "Paul WS Anderson takes \"style over substance\" to its limit in his fifth installment in the Resident Evil movie franchise. At least half the action scenes are in slo-mo, similar to the previous franchise entry. What might be more stylish than slo-mo? Slo-mo in reverse! And that is exactly what the opening sequence delivers; it wastes almost 5 whole minutes picking up from the previous film: Umbrella Corporation forces attack the ship that Alice and her friends are on, there is lots of shooting then Alice is blown into the water. All that IN REVERSE, then forward again. Alice is captured and trapped in a vast underwater facility that houses replicas of the world's major cities like New York and Moscow. It is revealed that Albert Wesker (the main villain so far) has splintered off from Umbrella corporation (which is now being run by the artificial intelligence program \"Red Queen\"). Alice must escape, but not before fighting her way from one movie clich\u00e9 to another.\n\nFor those new to the Resident Evil movie franchise, it is everything you'd expect from a skewed piece of fan fiction. Paul WS Anderson's wife, Milla Jovovich, stars as the ultimate Mary Sue character named Alice; effectively reducing main characters from the Resident Evil video games to supporting roles. Stripped of her superpowers, Alice is still unnaturally agile, sickeningly strong and uncannily durable. Bullets magically miss her, convenient tools and weapons appear to her when she needs them and her guns never run out of ammo.\n\nIf all the slow motion scenes were played at normal speed, this already short movie will be a lot shorter. Its actual narrative is already THAT thin, not to mention that most of it is a pastiche of scenes and concepts ripped off from other films. James Cameron's Aliens, Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and many others are blatantly and shamelessly plagiarized. In what I suppose is meant to be a \"smart\" reference of a reference, Paul WS Anderson rips off the \"X-Ray vision bone crunching\" fighting gimmick that was used in 2009's Mortal Kombat video game (not surprisingly, Anderson directed the very first Mortal Kombat movie).\n\nWithin the zombiefied narrative, we are treated to more \"startling\" revelations that only serve to muddle up the already messy story of the Resident evil movie franchise. New creatures pop out of nowhere without any conceivable explanation, a new zombie infection called \"las plagas\" is introduced, and we get unsurprising origin of Alice and who she truly is. Speaking of zombies, they feature very rarely in this movie; or at least the traditional human zombies that Resident Evil is known for. Giant Mutant creatures only make occasional appearances as \"mini-bosses\" for Awesome Alice to kill (as usual). Most of the fighting involves Alice, former Umbrella operative Ada Wong and a mercenary team led by Leon Kennedy going up against cloned Umbrella troopers including a few familiar faces.\n\nYes the special effects are top notch (considering its huge budget), and the slow motion will keep ramming that fact into your face. But other than that, there is little else to enjoy about this movie (perhaps some will get off on a near nude Milla Jovovich's torture scene). There is no sense of peril for the characters and even the fight choreography is more like dancing than fighting.\n\nWith a story that feels like a filler episode in a TV series, shallow characters, blatant plagiarism and a overall \"been there done that\" feel, Resident Evil Retribution shows a zombie movie franchise in the literal sense; the same thing that just keeps coming back from the grave, more mutated than ever. What we have, at best, is a multi million dollar tech demo for fight choreography, slo mo cinematography and 3D."

The 3-D was used very well, not a zillion things constantly flying at you, but when they did it was Awesome. The action scenes did not disappoint ! Even without her powers Alice was still a force to be reckoned with . Be it with Bada** guns or just her body , Umbrella was going to have to bring All it had to take her & her crew down! Loved the bringing back of familiar characters, but hated you know who was on the other side this time. : ( Love the fact that the females are the lead bada**es & don't hide in a corner waiting for someone to rescue them ! Yeah at times the situations are unreal , but hey people it's a Movie , it's meant as an escape from the \"real world \" ! So if you want a mind numbing , action packed ride see it & hold on tight ! It won't win an Oscar , but this installment ensured I'll be there opening night for the next installment ! Enjoy !"

For those of us who know what we're in for with the series, the fifth instalment is for better or worse, more of the same - albeit with the familiar levels of ridiculousness from its maddeningly inconsistent director/writer .If you liked the other Resident Evil films, you'll like this, and the end suggests there'll be plenty more. A mildly entertaining piece of eye-candy.Paul W.S. Anderson's writing may not have blown minds and our characters may not be up for any awards, but Resident Evil: Retribution showcases tantalising big budget action on a stylistically provocative level.You either enjoy buff female and male characters in tight, form-fitting outfits shooting at zombies and each other, or you don't. It's really that simple. We do not expect quality from Resident Evil any longer. We expect our brains to be expunged of common sense and pumped full of endorphins wearing fetish costumes.The movie is convoluted, of course, but it is also slick, savage and thrilling."

Fans of the games with be happy to see their favorite characters on the big screen and also like the elements it incorporates from the games. If you've played Resident Evil 5, there's a part you'll recognize from the game in the movie.\n\nAlso Jill Valentine's back(No complaints about that at all)-said in a smooth voice. Along with her there's Michelle Rodriguez who is always welcome.\n\nOne thing that is also great about this film is the fight choreography which an upgrade over previous installments. More action, more explosions, more awesome.\n\nIf you want to just tell logic to screw itself and watch an entertaining film, you're in for a treat.\n\n9/10"

Can't understand those who don't like this movie. you want action? This movie has allot of it. Superb how they used previous character's from all the different Resident Evil movies.

The storyline cleverly ties things from all previous movies. 2.Milla looks superb - sexy, beautiful and having a blast. She looks much more prettier here than in RE4. 3. The return of my all time fav Milla's outfit - two sheets of papaper covering naked body ;-) 4.Action never looked better in Resident Evil (the car chase in Moscow is amazing). 5. Milla's fights - as good as in RE3. G-R-E-A-T. 6. The scene in the factory of clones. \"I'm your mother now\". Great moment 7.Cool homage to Aliens. 8. Inventive score. 9. Visual effects - more photorealistic than in Avangersand other plastic-fantastic 4-times-biiger-budget summer attractions. 10. Epic scope. Grand scale. 11. Paul Anderson's direction - wide shoots, some Mulcahy's style shoots. 12. Doube ending with a nice cliffhanger. 13. Suburban sequence. 14. \"The return to suburban| sequence. 15. Some unexpected twists.\n\nAll to all - The great return to the for RE franchise."

The fight scenes lacks of what i expected, specially the highly anticipated Alice-Jill brawl. I was all like \"OMFG that was it? done already??\". Im happy because Anderson changed or added nothing cause it is based on the video-game. The costumes, the Plagas, the bosses. All smoothly done. Of course there were flaws, all movies have :)\n\nOverall, its worth the money and the time. Im a huge fan of RE so i really really enjoyed the whole movie :) my Favorite part was the end, Where Jill,Leon,Ada,Wesker and Alice was all like, The Dream Team :D\n\nThanks :3"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by saying that these films should not be screened for critics. Of course they will complain! Theses films are made for the fans, not the critics. Yes the plot is a bit thin but escaping from an Umbrella Lab has Resident Evil written all over it. Yes the characters have maybe two lines each but this is a crazy-action-zombie movie, the emphasis is on the crazy action not the dialogue!\n\nNotice how no one mentions the 3D effect. The 3D is consistently phenomenal, the best available. The recap at the start of the film was above the heads of the viewers in front of me. If you disagree, go and watch it again in a better cinema with better equipment. Further, there was hardly a second of blur. Everything was sharp, crisp and vibrant even during the crazy action.\n\nThe choreography was incredible. Milla Jovovich spinning about perfectly with her chain and gun was more of a dance than a fight. A bad ass dance though! How can anyone not like this? I'm trying to think of something better in life than Sienna Guillory in her \"battle suit\", flipping about shooting things. There's nothing better! Maybe some reviewers would rather see Christian Bale in skin tight black leather and sure, Dark Knight Rises is the superior film but Retribution is everything a fan could ask for and some people just need to sort out their expectations.\n\nWe are not trying to win an Oscar here, we just want zombie brains splattered into our faces in glorious 3D.\n\n10/10? Why not."

The story is relatively simple but straightforward(in strong contrast to the last film), the action sequences are exciting and fun to watch, and Milla is well, Milla.\n\nIt doesn't aspire to be more than a fun action movie, and Resident Evil Retribution delivers exactly that. Well worth your time, definitely the best of the RE films since the original classic. Rodriguez and the other guys do a nice job in their appearances in this film, and the decision to bring back Jill Valentine was definitely a plus.\n\nThe movie isn't exactly original, certain elements of the storyline are basically plot devices from the first film that were rehashed & repackaged for Retribution.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I didn't mind that at all. Anderson manages to deliver exactly what I was expecting, an exciting action- packed movie about a heroine who beats up on zombies. For what it sets out to do, Resident Evil: Retribution really does deliver."

It was OK.\n\nEveryone who doubts about seeing Retribution: Do NOT listen to the critics, just go see it and judge for yourself.\n\nOverall, I am excited for people to see the fifth installment and I recommend it to everyone.

        "review_detailed_main": "I will admit this review is a little bias as I am a very big fan of this franchise and there isn't one of these films that I haven't loved, but honestly this fifth installment is indeed a great one. The big thing for me is the shift in direction this movie took, I cant pinpoint what it is but it just feels different to the others, at the beginning we see the usual \"My name is Alice\" introduction that we've all come to know and love, from then on its a non stop pulse pounding thrill ride that is sure to keep you on your toes. Yes you have to kind of suspend disbelief while watching a Resident Evil movie but that's like most scifi type game stuff, it's not realistic in the least but that's what makes them all so excellent.\n\nA lot can be said about Milla, she is the absolute driving force in these films, they wouldn't be as good as they are if someone else were in the role, she never overdoes it and she always kicks ass, however it's good to see a more vulnerable side to her in this installment as she tries to protect a young girl who is her make believe daughter, she's just frakking awesome to put it down to one word. The effects are top notch as usual and as expected, the score is fitting and the colour palette is suited well also, big props for the closing credits song by Bassnectar and Chino Moreno, very cool. Another thing ill mention is the very clever way two characters from previous films were introduced back into the series, Michelle Rodriguez is one tough broad and the Sienna Guillory is cool playing the same character but doing it in an entirely new way.\n\nAs the film ends we see a set up for the 6th film, and by the looks if it, it's going to be epic. Once it ended I was sitting in the theater just thinking to myself \" ooohhhhh wonder what they'll do with that\". I cannot wait for the next one, hooray.\n\nFans will love it, non fans will love it, and I hope it gains new fans. Excellent. Probably the best in the series."

This is the second movie in the series that actually kept me engaged to the end, same with first movie.\n\nIf your a fan of the series or the games you will probably like this movie. If your looking for cinematic excellence, you wont find it here.\n\nI gave it a solid 9 out of 10 despite it's flaws."

        "review_detailed_main": "This franchise has garnered a strong fan-base, yet each addition has had it's critical lashing but been huge at the box office, grossing just short of a billion over it's five feature run making it the most successful video game adaptation. I will always thank one of my mates for getting me into this series, as each addition has been released these zombie slashing movies have gotten better and better, and Retribution is the defining entry, a magnificent adventure.\n\nMilla Jovovich is back as the ultimate female action hero in \"Resident Evil: Retribution\", a brilliant addition to the Zombie-Slaying franchise. Some may think this franchise is running on empty, but I disagree, and this entry features a neat twist added to this instalment which will take you by surprise and keeps things fresh (The film is actually set in artificially controlled environments)\n\nNot without it's flaws, there is one moment between Leon and Alice where he tells her not to go after her daughter, it's either the editing here between cuts or the acting, this part felt off key and it's rather cringe, but for every awry line there are plenty of bad-ass lines before and after fights. There are some great stand offs where the characters stare down at each other, there's tension and an element of surprise, getting you ready for the action to explode! And when it does the 3D effects are perfection:- Debris, zombie limbs, gun barrels, bullets and numerous objects soar out the screen at wild speeds, and spectacular depth effects enable the landscape to stretch far into the screen leaving you jaw dropped. Paul W.S Anderson proves yet again that he is the master of 3D immersion, action scenes have never looked so good!\n\nRetribution sees Project Alice continue her battle against Umbrella, who have built a giant facility underwater to further test the deadly T-Virus. Using the virus, Umbrella manipulate the world around her and turn people against Alice, most of whom she used to work with, forcing her to up her game in her mission to finish them once and for all. The cloning plot allows Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Salmon and Oded Fehr to reprise their roles, although they don't have much dialogue they still prove they are worthy to make a comeback.\n\nFor me, this movie has one of the utmost best opening sequences ever, it's like watching 3D action-movie perfection unfold on screen: All edited to go in reverse, Umbrella reign hell on the Arcadia ship, every single camera work is an action shot, it is jaw dropping, beautiful, the definition of epic and masterfully constructed, and Tomandandy's soundtrack plays over it upping the scale of awesome to the top.\n\nThe Tokyo Corridor of Light fight scene also is one of the best fights I've seen in a movie, the fight choreography is truly spectacular, the editing is swift and cut perfectly making sure continuity flows, which is does perfectly, and the use of 3D here is utterly astounding, in fact a reference quality moment that I'd use to demo my set-up with. Retribution does focus on action more than story, but not at an alarming level, the twists are relatively interesting but obvious yet it pushes the story into exciting territory.\n\nWould I watch this again? Already have, at least a dozen times, with near perfect 3D, tough characters, mind-blowing fight sequences, stunning visuals, a rocking soundtrack and a truly epic finale, Retribution is a soaring entry that hits hard and stands tall in the franchise, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again, unless you rated it rotten."

But seriously it wasn't trying to be anything else and I personally liked that.\n\nIt's pretty much a video game in movie format. I thought it was really cool and very entertaining. The CGI was pretty well done, the special effects were awesome, the fight scenes were fun. A bunch of boss battles. The best worst movie I have ever seen.\n\nJust for reference I generally like thrillers/mysteries that really make you think and this is certainly not one of those. I did grow up playing video games though so maybe I'm biased.\n\nNonetheless, this guy liked it."
