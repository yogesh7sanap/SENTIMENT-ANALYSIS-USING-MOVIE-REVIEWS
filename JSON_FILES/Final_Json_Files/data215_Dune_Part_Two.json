        "review_detailed_main": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.\n\n\"Dune: Part 2\" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.\n\nDenis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.\n\nWould highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.\n\nHans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.\n\nI believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.\n\nWhile the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.\n\nExtremely recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.\n\nFor book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.\n\nI know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol."

This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!\n\nI beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find!

It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10."

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.\n\nI am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.\n\nThe final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.\n\nI want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.\n\nIt is like he can't see the trees for the forest."

Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.\n\nOverall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema."

It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible.

This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.\n\nHaving left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience. A kind of secular, profane Dune. Still nice, but also a bit disappointing."

Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.\n\nOverall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.\n\nIt's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not."

Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.\n\nIn the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression."

The acting is also top-notch! Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!\n\nThere are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!\n\nDune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired! There's so much to take away from this masterpiece! Definitely my #1 favorite movie of this year as of now! Bring on Dune: Part Three as fast as possible!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it's as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.\n\nEnough good things have already been said about this movie, so I'll just point out the negatives:\n\n1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.\n\n2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.\n\n3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.\n\n4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.\n\nOverall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine."

Scenes don't connect, they start an assignment or story branch, then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests. No idea is complete, nothing gets resolved, and the dialogue is horrendous.\n\nThese movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow. If you haven't read the books you won't understand anything that's happening here. What we have here is a movie that is really pretty. It maxes out in the visuals category. The sound was hit or miss, but the plot, pacing and characters were all bad.\n\nNot a masterpiece. Sorry."

The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.\n\nIt's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.\n\nOne of the best movies of 2024 for sure."

But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.\n\nThey changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.\n\nIt goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.\n\nI am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.\n\nBehaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.\n\nYou know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.\n\nBut as we know it would never come out.\n\nRest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.\n\nYou will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.\n\nLet's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.\n\nI believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make."

Characters spend some much time talking philosophizing whining and complaining you wonder why a production would spend millions on such a badly written boring story. That's the trend these days, when a network wants to cut down expenses it's making characters blob to death.\n\nChalamet not my cup of tea in this part 2, he looks out of place, feels more like a choir boy rather than an action movie hero.\n\nPart 2 misses the mark."

        "review_detailed_main": "Here I'll conflate both of Villeneuve's Dunes within one critic: It is a slow, wide, deep and bare opus, best viewed on the biggest possible screen and sound system, in typical Villeneuve fashion.\n\nI didn't read the books but I saw the 1984 movie, and Villeneuve's version is built to become a classic, even if less spectacular or outrageous. What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.\n\nAlas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.\n\nOn the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.\n\nWith Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.\n\nThe real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.\n\nSee this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed."

This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come.

There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nNone of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.\n\nI don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books."

It makes me wonder what the goal of making these movies (besides money, duh) was; a modern interpretation of Dune? A deep dive into the character dynamics? A story that would be better appreciated with improved CGI? Beats me.\n\nMy opinion might be controversial, but despite being a well-made movie, I just don't think it's that remarkable. Lynch's Dune was bizarre, had that beloved retro sci-fi vibe, WAY more memorable character designs, and just left more of an impression on me. Accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic, but unless the author is making the movie themself, why expect perfect duplication?\n\nMy recommendation: unless you're a die-hard Dune fan, you can definitely skip this one."

I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.\n\nIt just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past.

Believable choreography & acting to boot.\n\nA star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery.

Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year!\n\nP.s.s. Can I make \"ride the worm\" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty?\n\nThis is a clear early 2025 Oscar candidate for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Score.\n\n...potential in acting categories as well..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen.\n\nThough I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Paul and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen.\n\nAustin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance.\n\nAnd here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time."

I was captured by the sound, by the most crystalline screen I have ever experienced, and since the guttural sound of the opening shook my stomach, I didn't think about anything else for almost 3 hours.

        "review_detailed_main": "I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.\n\nOther than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.\n\nI would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \"twist\" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is."

But part 2 was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movie.\n\nEveryone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces. It's really drab... And in the end I really didn't care about any of the characters. It was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deep.\n\nThe music is faux epic and sadly doesn't lend any particular weight to what's ultimately a decent story told in a very boring way.\n\nI'd say the VFX is good - yeah... not bad. But the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring - like going through the motions.\n\nThe film has a few good moments, but an epic sci-fi masterpiece of our time this film is not. The silly desert walks are pretty funny though! XD haha."

And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.\n\nHans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped.\n\nWithout giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent."

Much like the celebrated sequels \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2003), \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007), this film elevates the franchise to new heights.\n\nVilleneuve's atmospheric and deliberately paced direction, complemented by Hans Zimmer's enigmatic score, creates an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning. The vast, sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giant-worm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape, leaving audiences mesmerized throughout.\n\nThe introduction of Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence, while the demise of the Harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate, avoiding simplicity. The film culminates in an epic duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha, delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusion.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides, the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen. The narrative remains faithful to Frank Herbert's novel, capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that \"the war has just begun.\"\n\nWhile the novel doesn't extend to a Part Three, the expansive universe of Dune offers numerous sequels in the books. With the right efforts and approvals, there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future. For now, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen, and I eagerly anticipate experiencing it again, this time with my beloved by my side."

Therefore, it showcases more depth and details, plus good plot twists, that justifies the journey and conflict.\n\nBut also, by having more storylines, the pace and edition style feels rushed in some moments. The storytelling with its half-explained moments and all of a sudden time jumps doesn't gives the same fluidity that the first one had.\n\nThere are several backstories that needed more buildup or evidence to be believable, or else, less cutting out details from the book (even though that means longer movies and more fast & furious type of movie fans complaining about \"way too long\" movies).\n\nOf course, the ending is grandiloquent as a space opera like Dune should be. But the first two acts of the movie could have been better. Not in its photography, music or overall production value (which are amazing), just in the telling of a story that evidently has a lot of branches that needed more room to grow."

Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.\n\nIf you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.\n\nReason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievement\n\nReason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.\n\nCaught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.\n\nTimothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are \"just fine\", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.\n\nThank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.\n\nOnly Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.\n\nCome to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.\n\nLetter Grade: B\n\n7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

But it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities. It was big...but also a bit disappointing despite this bigness. Fortunately, this second film, while also slow, is a bit more interesting to watch and it's battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen. And, fortunately, it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting. While not a perfect version of the second portion of the Frank Herbert book, it is very good and well worth seeing.\n\nMy only regrets about the film were minimal. First, the worm scenes were far less interesting than I'd hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground. Also, I had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swords...in a sci-fi epic?! So many swords...when a machine gun or tank would have been so much better! Still, these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your time.\n\nI might say more but there are well over 2000 reviews. So, 'nuff said."

Like the first film but even worse, this was a child's Cliff Notes version of the actually books. To know the storyline you'd have to have read the books or watched the previous, superior versions. Chani is especially poorly done and again the characters are mostly just long gazes.\n\nI understand the simpletons who enjoyed the visuals. This movie has made a good deal of money but there's a reason it won't ever reach a billion mark like truly epic films. And the IMDB meter on this will probably drop closer to my score as non-fanatics see this film over the coming years. Again, the 3-part Frank Herbert miniseries is the best, the 1984 is the classic nostalgia and this one looks pretty but says very little."

Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely."

It's a masterful blend of action, drama, and science fiction, delivering an immersive and unforgettable experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the Dune universe, this film is a must-watch."

Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me.\n\nI felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening.\n\nAnd then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One.\n\nAnd oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch. I just think Part One is measurably better."

The movie itself visually is a masterpiece, but my problem stems from character development and plot rushing. To me it seems like the last half of the movie was supposed to be 3 hours long itself but the whole movie itself was cut under 3 hours. The climactic finish to the film was super fast and felt like the stakes were low because it just went from one thing to the next with no time to breathe. Also Pauls attraites or how ever you spell it, his character pulls a game of thrones esque queem of dragons vibe, where there goals and personality are one thing then dramatically shift seemingly out of no where. Overall it was a good film, a bit long for my taste, but Its worth a watch if you like sci fi."

        "review_detailed_main": "The perception of this movie really depends on several factors: books read, Lynch's version watched, inclination to SF (and any combination thereto) or none of that. No one can deny that visuals in this movie are fantastic (including SFX), but what else there is? Some occasional acting (strictly routine, nothing enthusiastic), strange editing (at moments being nonsense - the short scene wit Paul drinking water of life), routine music (lately modern woman's voice screaming, or \"vocalizing\", as they like to say), bad writing, uneven pace, no science and a lot of fiction. If one wants great visuals with dense substance, right pacing, music, editing and direction (with occasional connection to the literary template by P. Dick), one should watch Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, for example. Dune has nothing to do with it. The books are too complex for a literal adaptation anyway. Second part has more substance than the first one, but stretched and lost in (too) long \"symbolic\" shots of everything else. Almost typical modern Hollywood. So, if you'e among first three mentioned categories - avoid disappointment. The rest might find it even great (although they cannot explain why). Pity."

The visuals are stunning and there is finally a little (I mean a little) more time spent developing plot lines in a more digestible format. In the first Dune, characters appeared and disappeared so quickly that you really didn't care what happened to them. Dune 2 is very long, but I guess that's a given with such a dense story.\n\nWhat is missing is any true connection made with the characters. There is no exploration of Paul's inner thoughts or struggles or conflicts, he's just always the hero. The love story doesn't develop, it just happens, and Zendaya basically just scowls or looks confused throughout the movie. Also, there is so much crammed into the movie that there were plot leaps that weren't fully explained, so that diminishes your full investment, you just let the visuals and spectacle roll over you. To be a successful movie doesn't mean that every book element needs to be included; editing would have created a more well-rounded and emotionally impactful flick.\n\nI do recommend, as a spectacle and fascinating other world creation. But great it is not in other aspects."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dune: Part Two\" is an outstanding continuation of the epic saga, deserving a perfect 10/10 for its intricate storytelling, breathtaking visual effects, and the depth of its political and romantic subplots.\n\nOne of the most captivating elements of \"Dune: Part Two\" is the love story between Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya). Their relationship is developed with a genuine emotional depth that enhances the film's narrative. The chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya is palpable, adding a layer of warmth and humanity amidst the grandiose and often harsh environment of Arrakis. Their love story is not just a subplot but a driving force that shapes their characters' motivations and decisions, making the audience deeply invested in their journey.\n\nThe exploration of different factions and space politics is another area where \"Dune: Part Two\" excels. Denis Villeneuve masterfully delves into the complex political landscape of the Dune universe, where alliances are fragile, and power struggles are constant. The depiction of the various factions, including the noble House Atreides, the sinister House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic Bene Gesserit, is detailed and compelling. Each faction's distinct motivations and strategies are intricately woven into the plot, creating a rich tapestry of intrigue and conflict.\n\nThe film's visual effects continue to be a standout feature, with the same level of artistry and attention to detail that made the first installment so visually stunning. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with breathtaking realism, and the depiction of the space battles and the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes immerse the audience in this vast and detailed universe.\n\nVilleneuve's direction ensures that every frame serves the story, balancing grand epic moments with intimate character-driven scenes. The pacing of the film is expertly managed, with each scene building on the previous one to create a crescendo of tension and excitement. The fight scenes are choreographed with precision, making them feel both brutal and graceful, and the strategic battles highlight the tactical brilliance of the characters involved.\n\nThe performances are uniformly excellent. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet continues to impress as Paul Atreides, capturing the complexity of a young man burdened with immense destiny. Zendaya brings strength and sensitivity to her role as Chani, while the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, deliver powerful performances that add depth to the narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a masterful continuation of the saga, blending a captivating love story with intricate political intrigue and stunning visual effects. It not only meets but exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessor, making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. This film cements the Dune series as a landmark in cinematic history and deserves a perfect 10/10."

I loved the fan intro before the film and they called it a saga, so...I'm expecting they are making more, but I heard recently, this is the last Dune film from this director sadly. I hope they take this like they did Harry Potter and keep the same style and fluidity.\n\nThis film definitely had more action that the first film. They got up close and in person with it, which worked really well.\n\nGreat character development which wasn't rushed. The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.\n\nCinematography was epic like the previous film \ud83c\udfa5\n\nActing was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.\n\nThe whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.\n\nThe \"Narrating\" was done properly and not distracting.\n\nI'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.\n\nP.

Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance.\n\nThe acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica.\n\nGreig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies.\n\nThe sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand.\n\nI also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top.\n\nOverall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production."

The perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a Messiah. Chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world. Please go see Part 2 as quickly as possible and in IMAX. This movie deserves to go down as one of, if not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. IMAX IMAX IMAX."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dune Part 2 is a visually stunning yet somewhat disjointed cinematic experience.\n\nVilleneuve's direction is undeniably ambitious, and his signature style of breathtaking visuals is on full display in Dune. The black and white scenes, reminiscent of archival footage from fascist Germany, are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytelling.\n\nHowever, the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired. The narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes. It appears that an abundance of material was shot, and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one. Despite these efforts, the film still clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours and 46 minutes.\n\nThe plot of Dune Part 2 bears some resemblance to the TV series Game of Thrones, with its complex political machinations, warring factions, and power struggles. However, the film's storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the HBO series. The limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers' ability to fully explore the richness of the source material. Perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the Dune universe and its characters.\n\nIn terms of performances, Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha is a standout. Butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role, overshadowing even the lead actor, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides. Chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of Butler's Feyd-Rautha, and his performance is merely a shadow in comparison.\n\nOverall, Dune Part 2 is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution. The visual spectacle and moments of brilliance are undeniable, but the disjointed narrative and uneven pacing prevent it from fully realizing its potential."

        "review_detailed_main": "Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.\n\nDune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.\n\nThis movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.\n\nVisually and technically this movie is masterpiece.\n\nThere are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.\n\nDirection and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.\n\nStorywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timoth\u00e9e Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen \"jihad messiah\" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timoth\u00e9e Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.\n\nHowever, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.\n\nFirstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.\n\nSecondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the \"epicness\" \"darkness\" and sense of \"doom\" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.\n\nOther movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.\n\nDespite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.\n\nRating: 8,5 stars."

With his green eyes, androgynous face and smooth curly hair, he is so photogenic all the time, that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments, you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials he's recently been in under the direction of Martin Scorsese. And Denis Villeneuve knows this.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that he's decided to hype us up even more in \"Part Two\", again taking his time, making sure the light on Chalamet's should-be insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to \"Lawrence of Arabia\"--the timeless masterpiece epic that Villeneuve also adores. So yeah, the teasing here has intensified; but so did the good things: the anti-elitist themes found in Frank Herbert's novel now go deeper into themes of faith, religion and manipulation; the scope is grander; the cinematography? Jaw-dropping! Especially the black and white homeworld of the Harkonnen, Giedi Prime, on which Austin Butler's villainous Feyd-Rautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin. And for the first time in Villeneuve's career, there are genuinely funny moments too.\n\nOverall, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a better movie than its predecessor. And it's quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie. Instead, Villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting Herbert's novel to its full power. And it pays off. Even if there is no catharsis in \"Part Two\", the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal. Without going into the chunky plot, just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for what's to come.\n\nIs a dangerous game director/writer Denis Villeneuve is playing by making so many promises. Or maybe it's not. I am sure a lot of people already felt fully satisfied with this movie even at this point. My friend whom I saw the movie with absolutely swears by it, calling it one of the greatest sci-fi movies in recent history. Me? I hope to be able to say the same about its sequel--or sequels? Because if they will turn up on par with their hype, my friend will be absolutely right."

        "review_detailed_main": "While it without a doubt is a masterclass in editing, cinematography, SOUND DESIGN :0, casting I can't seem to ignore the glaring flaws. The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.\n\nEven though there is no doubt about its \"epicness\" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.\n\nThe third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.\n\nOverall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past. It is one of the great modern sci fi's but dare I say, didn't exactly live up to the hype. See it at the biggest screen possible, 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I see quite a lot of positive reviews here from younger audiences. It seems dune struck a cord in all born after 2000. Which I guess is a good thing. Calling it the best movie of all time is something else. It means you first have to watch all films of all time to make such a bold assessment. And secondly Villeneuves rendering needs to be something special. It is not.\n\nThere has been other and better movies displaying the same story line, scenes and composition. Sorry to disappoint you Gen-Zers or below.\n\nEven Frank Herbert confest himself to be inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. Now this film is one you need to see (no sand worms there unfortunately)\n\nThe story-arch and intrigues are also not new. Even cliche. The high-rise hero falling for the lowly dame and ultimately dump her? Nothing new (but Dune 5 will show something different) Apart from the well orchestrated mass fight and one on one fight scenes we have seen way to often this movie has very little to offer. There really is no suprise only quite a lot of wasted talent on Rampling and Walker (those are boomers btw) There is no surprise, no novelty in this movie. It is a boring arrangement of boring repeats. Even Hans went back to a repetition of what we have heard (before Interstallar, that was truy awesome)\n\nIf you want to see a movie in the desert go watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see a messias go watch Matrix. If you want to see a good sci fi movie go see, ehm. 2001?"

I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth. Go and Watch this movie. It is mesmerizing."

Beautiful, complex, thought-provoking and epic. The movie that can extend his world into a fantasy realm that's not about wearing latex and shooting everything that moves.

That said, by the sparse music soundtrack, my hunch is the producers, director, and music editors went too far in the other direction.\n\nDune Part 2 continued the same awe-inspiring cinematography and breath-taking visual effects. However, its sometimes-mundane script and pedestrian storyline was held together by a superior, solid acting and editing. The costuming was, for the most part, magnificent. However, in a couple of battle scenes, the nearly identical battle garb made it very difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. But the scenes of the good guys riding atop the gigantic desert worms was absolutely thrilling! Wound I recommend watching Dune Part 2? Absolutely."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dune Part Two: Interestingly Compelling\n\nReligion can be a controversial topic, some (like me) believe in it, and others do not. With so many people believing different things, and so many religions in the world, it can be hard to make a movie around this topic. It is not impossible however, since other shows have done it, such as His Dark Materials, Lucifer, and Dune. Dune Part One and Two is directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya from Spiderman the Homecoming Trilogy.\n\nPaul Atreides (Chalamet) is now with the Fremen people, trying to fulfill the prophecy. Paul also wants revenge on Baron Harkonnen, who killed his father. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens want to take over the desert (Arrakis) from the Fremen.\n\nDune Part Two is a movie with lots of action, people riding cool creatures, and has incredible acting. What makes this movie so compelling is the religious aspect. Chalamet is compelling when portraying Paul, someone who at first did not believe the prophecy, but soon learns his purpose in life. From part one he grows into a good fighter, and someone who people wanted to follow. Zendaya portrays Chani, one of the Fremen people. By the end, I felt bad for her since she was alone. However, she stuck to her beliefs, even when everyone else decided to go in a different direction. Zendaya does an excellent job at playing someone that does not believe in the prophecy but cares about Paul. I enjoy seeing Zendaya expand her horizons, going from a love interest in a superhero movie, to a love interest and a strong warrior in a drama. Rebecca Ferguson played Paul's mother (Lady Jessica), who was the first one who wanted her son to fulfill the prophecy. She is a part of the Bene Gesserit (a religious sisterhood). Her main goal is to train her son to become who she thinks he will be. Austin Butler is the nephew of the guy in charge of house Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha likes to kill people for fun and is a good fighter. The relationship between the two houses (Atreides and Harkonnens) is complicated, which makes the audience want to know what is going to happen.\n\nUnfortunately, no one taught me anything about religion when I was younger. My first Introduction to it was watching the show Lucifer (which I think is sad). This is why I think making movies with religious meaning behind them is a wonderful thing to do. I have had a hard year (with death and sickness in my family), and religion has somehow become a topic I like to discuss. Therefore, this is why I found Dune Part Two better than Part One, the religious aspect made the movie more interesting and compelling to watch."

All that and an absolutely breathtaking soundtrack thanks to hans zimmer. My only issue with the film was that, in my opinion, the pacing was a bit off. A friend of mine who has read the books was a little bit dissapointed in the film, according to him the books go more into deatail about some caracters backstory and overall weaves a much more interesting story, but i am not reviewing the book, and he's not reviewing the movie, and i think that as a stand alone film, it is a masterpiece."

If you're going to make a movie three hours long, fill it will interesting characters a d good dialogue. Don't just fill it with scenes that add nothing to the story.\n\nSecondly, and this is my biggest gripe. Why do Timothee and Zendaya sounds the like they're a couple of Californian kids there for spring break. Paul's mum doesn't even bother hiding her British accent, Javier is the only one putting in any effort to sound like an indigenous population.\n\nPlot holes, so many plot holes. In the beginning Paul's mum magically transports to kill someone about to kill Paul, how?\n\nThe freemen attack the harkonnen and no the ship has guns, Zendaya has a gun but everyone else sword fights for some reason.\n\nPaul rides a worm, worm could at any moment dive deep and the rider is dead.

        "review_detailed_main": "Dune: Part Two is about Paul Atreides's self-doubt of himself being the Messiah of Fremen and his desire to take revenge on his Father's murder and extermination of his house, contrary to his father's view on revenge.\n\nThis movie dwelled mostly on Paul exploring whether he needed to be the Messiah of the Fremen or not, but that made his revolt plot against the emperor look underwhelming. Chani loves and helps Paul for his dedication to knowing the ways of Fremen but she envies him that he is the Messiah as most Fremen expect to be. That's a contradiction to be within one character. Feyd-Rautha tried to be badass in his introduction scene, but it failed instead making him look like a puny who thinks of himself as badass. There is no weight in this character: The Worst Villain portrayal.\n\nNow, I am interested and delved into what Paul will do to the Bene Gesserit for the game they played with his houses and turning other houses against him in the name of Prophecies. As they are the actual villains, convincing the emperor to slay the House Atredies. They are getting ready to accept and adapt themselves to whoever will win the emperor. By marrying the emperor's daughter to a new emperor, they will make sure that they exist after the Holy War.\n\nAs the movie is slow-paced while watching for the first time I paid full attention without getting bored, but the second time I got bored mostly, especially with the scenes I felt as drawbacks.\n\nThe actors did a great job, especially Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya. The director built the world amazingly. He focused more on how Paul Atreides evolved in the dilemma of being a Messiah or being a part of Fremen's revolution. The cinematography was good as it captured the dune desert in a stunning way and amazing shots on the Worm riding scenes. Dialogues and giving meaning to characters' names as the prophecy describes them were a good touch to the movie. The music and Sound effects were great and not more or less than the scenes required.\n\nOverall my opinion is that it's a good movie but with some flaws as I mentioned and it had more story and character depth than Dune: Part One. I would definitely recommend this movie. If you enjoy the movies in which the story happens in a completely fictional world or universe, then you'll enjoy this movie and its prequel.\n\nI know nothing about the book, these are my thoughts just on the movie."

Various scenes of action, thrills, and tension were all well-executed and done beautifully. With many all-star cast members, all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place.\n\nSince I haven't read the original book yet, I may not be too familiar with the lore of Dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts, characters and themes explored are pretty good. Including a great soundtrack, uses of dialogue and structures throughout. I honestly don't have any complaints about this one because I was enthralled with the entire movie.\n\nOverall, Dune: Part Two is a great continuation of the first film and Villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now."

The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way.

        "review_detailed_main": "Rating: 9.5/10 Watched on Feb 25th, 2024 @ Fan First Premiere event Format: (Digital) IMAX\n\nIt's safe to say that Dune Part 2 is basically an expansion of Part One. More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.\n\nHowever, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.\n\nThe VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.\n\nThe film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.\n\nHans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.\n\nFor the negativities:\n\n-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.\n\n-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?\n\nAlso, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.\n\n-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE) Lastly, in case you didn't know, during the London premiere of Dune Part Two, actress Anya Taylor-Joy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film. Can I understand why this was announced and why wasn't it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time????? Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere? This makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think that watching this film in a regular theatre or on TV must be a very different experience than what I had watching it in IMAX, in fact I've only ever seen Dune (both parts) in IMAX, so I can't really judge the movie in any other format. However, the crushing sense of scale is so important for the feeling you get from this (and the previous entry) that I really can't imagine the same effect from watching it on your phone or something. So, do see it on the largest, loudest screen you can find.\n\nWith that out of the way let's get to the film proper. At nearly 3 hours long, I could have easily sat on my chair for double that time and still not be bored. The second instalment of Dune is a miracle in several ways, a miracle of special effects, set and costume design and of storytelling, that manages to make a famously unwieldy story perfectly easy to parse, but it is above all a miracle of pacing. There isn't a second of boredom or a low point in the movie, it's an epic in the true sense of the term, you spend half the time crushed by scale and the other half lost in the details of the movie.\n\nManaging to tell a complex political tale with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue or exposition, the film also makes several very smart changes to the book which I really want to see pay off in the third movie (there will be one, as this ends in a cliffhanger). In terms of acting everyone is pretty good, but the addition of Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the real standout here. Florence Pugh is promising but has a limited role, which if this is anything like the books will be greatly extended in the third movie. A real masterpiece."

I've read the book, and saw the original with Kyle McLaughlin and I just love this type of genre. I even published a few books myself, but the ending just did not satisfy me at all. Seems like there are a lot of remakes anymore and they usually end up, so so. To be fair, I love the actors, I love the way it was directed and overall the movie was well done, thank you! The cast and crew did an excellent job on this movie and I will watch it again. I was just disappointed in the ending. This movie deserves 10 Stars but in good conscience I can't do that. Just my humble opinion, that's all."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think most the ppl who claim dune to be the masterpiece are not familiar with cinematography at all. Perhaps they are young generation ppl who missed real masterpieces of the past, when acting, dialogues and story telling were the most important aspects of the movie. Not just flashy special effects like we have nowadays in movie and music industry. I really liked the first part but it was still far from a masterpiece , the second part I rate even lower. Both are good and entertaining movies but acting and story telling is not there to even consider a good 8/10. The highest notes go to the scenography and music. Very well done."

        "review_title": "Dune has always has a length problem..",
        "review_detailed_main": "With David Lynch's dune being over the span of 2 hours covering the course of the entire dune book, causing very large pacing issues, and Jodorowsky's Dune never being made due to production issues planned to be 14 hours long. With the first two Dune adaptations (one not releasing) having length issues, one being long and the other being too short, the adaptation of Dune by Denis Villenueve took a different approach by splitting the book in half. With the first coming out part one being phenomenal and a near perfect sic-fi epic with a perfect pacing. Each individual plot event feels impactful and heavy. The lack of time constraints on part 1 made the movie able to convey its story with weight, allowing for a very immersive and enjoyable experience. However, because Denis Villenueve decided to split the book in half when adapting it to the big screen, a large portion of the story was left for one singular movie. The compression of all the events in the 2nd film lead to a very fast paced movie. Dune part 2 massively suffers from this extremely fast pacing as each event that should be absolutely epic and meant to leave you in awe instead make you overwhelmed and thus makes the exciting events much less epic. The film is absolutely fantastic. As anybody who read the book knows, the book is split into 3 main parts. I believe it would've been perfect if it were to be a Dune trilogy instead. Dune part 2 is henna sci-fi epicness, but I simply cannot give it a 10/10 due to its extremely fast pacing. By squishing all of the awesome events into one movie a lot of the moments that left you in awe from the part 1 are quite lost for me. Still amazing and if you ever see this movie getting a rerelease in theaters for when Dune: Messiah releases (or the miniseries on max) I fully 100% recommend checking it out. If you love sci-fi and just want to watch an entertaining movie, I really do recommend Dune Part 2. I also should add to never watch this on a tiny screen. Do Frank Herbert's and Denis Villeneuve some justice and give it the big screen it deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "A fan of Dune should absolutely read the books. The rich tapestry of details and stories present in the novels are often missing or condensed in the film adaptations. The depth of world-building and character development in Frank Herbert's work transports readers to an expansive and immersive universe that the movies can only hint at.\n\nHowever, my current rating of the Dune movie takes into account the overall quality of films released in recent years. Compared to the many lackluster movies that have flooded the market, Dune stands out for its ambition, visual splendor, and attempt to faithfully capture the essence of Herbert's vision, even if it inevitably falls short of the book's depth."

I appreciate good casting.\n\nI happen to have read the books, which I thought were so-so (unlike my friends), so I don't understand the reviews whining about the movie being disappointing. The story and specific effects are top-notch. The experience is highly immersive. What else do you need?\n\nI give this seven stars, plus a one-star bonus for the excellent adaption, a half-star bonus for the perfect pacing, and quarter-star bonuses for Javier Bardem and Florence Pugh*, whose performances I particularly enjoyed. That's nine (9) stars total.\n\n* She didn't get much screen time, true, but I thought she was great. She seemed a tiny bit awkward and/or uncomfortable, which (for me) is just part of her realism and stage presence. Oh, what complexities must lie hidden beneath the surface."

        "review_detailed_main": "An absolutely gorgeous, austere piece of film. Denis Villeneuve is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images we've seen on the 21st century cinema screen. It's impossible to say this a bad film or adaptation.\n\nVilleneuve treats each shot as if it were a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.\n\nHerbert's dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader, who can't tell a Sandworm from a Sardaukar - which is one of the reasons Villeneuve's approach felt like such a breakthrough: It pared the mythology down to something manageable, serving up visceral action set-pieces at regular intervals. The movie air-dropped audiences in a world where foreign customs, politics and technology had long been established, never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytelling.\n\nThat's not to say Villeneuve's \"Dune\" movies are fast-paced. Channeling the austerity of Andrei Tarkovsky at times, the director takes nearly five hours to cover what David Lynch did in just slightly more than two (though iconic in some respects, the now badly dated 1984 version barely scratched the surface of Herbert's concerns). If \"Part Two\" feels slow in places, it's because Villeneuve takes time to develop the connection between characters, as in a handful of scenes dedicated to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and Paul, aka Muad'Dib (or Usul), whose undeniable attraction doesn't align with Jessica's plans for her son.\n\nIn many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first (pacing overall felt better, obviously less setup, the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe). But still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space. Some beats that need to feel pivotal, felt rushed to me and there's not much room for character performance to do the heavy lifting. You hardly notice though because you're inside a such stunningly realized alien landscape for the length, with so much to look at and take in. I enjoyed every moment and can't wait to revisit it soon.\n\nAudience will find in Villeneuve's multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer. It's an enormous gamble, given the expense of creating at this scale, and a vote of confidence in cinema, which still hasn't recovered to the pre-pandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived. The fate of far more than Arrakis is riding on \"Dune.\""

Ive seen the original Dune movie from the 80's , many times and frankly, it blows the current away as far as creating a surreal world and drawing you in with fascinating characters..Even the old by todays standards, effects and cinematography were levels above the big budget attempts of the current movie...This one today, feels effects laden, but devoid of soul, that essense that was captured in the original so well... I also really like the children of Dune series, its characters surpassing the interest I found in the current story here... to each his own..Its visually very good but visuals alone do not make a story hold the interest of the viewer.. that takes good writing and compelling acting, qualities absent in this movie."

Or simply people without artistic sensitivity.\n\nYou can deny it. If you watched in the cinema, when you got up from your seat, you felt like you've just come from an exciting ride on a sandworm. All my senses were excited. Dune 2 is a delight in every department, and Timoth\u00e9e's transformation in this film is something we haven't seen from him yet. The strength, the range of variety and scope really surprised me. Austin Butler steals the show, and establishes himself as a solid actor in the industry. Rebecca Ferguson shows that she is at her peak. And Dennis\n\nVilleneuve is established as one of the 5 directors of this century. In a single film, he manages to handle several rhythms to an almost perfect level. The last hour of the film is a scary adrenaline rush. The opening sequence is a feast for the eyes and the scene of Paul riding the Sandworm is magical.\n\nDune 2 has revived epic sci-fi cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Dune: Part Two\" delivers a breathtaking continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction masterpiece. This installment expands upon the intricate world-building, character development, and thematic depth established in the first film, solidifying its place as a landmark achievement in modern cinema.\n\nVisually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing short of spectacular. The stunning cinematography, combined with the awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis, creates a sense of scale and grandeur that immerses viewers in the epic scope of the story. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that every frame is a work of art, capturing the harsh beauty and otherworldly nature of the desert planet.\n\nThe narrative picks up where the first film left off, following Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as he embraces his destiny amidst political intrigue, betrayal, and the struggle for control over the spice-rich planet of Arrakis. Chalamet's performance is both nuanced and powerful, capturing Paul's transformation from a young nobleman to a leader of the Fremen.\n\nThe supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from Zendaya as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar. Their characters are given more depth and screen time, enriching the story and adding layers of complexity to the relationships and power dynamics at play.\n\nThe film's pacing is well-balanced, blending intense action sequences with quieter, character-driven moments. The epic battles and intricate political machinations are thrilling, while the exploration of themes such as destiny, loyalty, and survival adds emotional weight to the narrative.\n\nHans Zimmer's evocative score complements the film's visuals perfectly, enhancing the sense of wonder and tension throughout the story. The music underscores key moments with a haunting, otherworldly quality that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\nWhile \"Dune: Part Two\" is a remarkable achievement, it is not without minor flaws. Some viewers may find the dense mythology and complex plot challenging to follow, particularly if they are not familiar with the source material. Additionally, the film's focus on world-building and thematic exploration occasionally comes at the expense of character development for some secondary characters.\n\nDespite these minor issues, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a masterful continuation that elevates the epic saga to new heights. It honors the legacy of Herbert's novel while delivering a cinematic experience that is both visually stunning and intellectually engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a triumph of filmmaking that solidifies Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as a definitive version of the classic story. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it stands as a monumental achievement in the science fiction genre and a must-see for fans of the epic saga."

The reason this movie is so significant is because it wasn't scared to tell a story in an untraditional way. I find it funny that everyone says \" it's much better than the first, I hated the first movie it was too slow\" . So why the heck did you watch the second movie? Seems like most people feel this movie directly threatened Star Wars so they chose to pick sides no matter what brilliance they watched. Part of what makes Dune so unique is the fact that they don't explain every little thing to you like you were a child. But most people like their hands held . We need more movies like this and less movies from Disney/Marvel/Starwars with predictable outcomes and setups we have seen for decades. Something fresh, real and not shot in a studio."

Some development happened so fast that the audience were still on the previous planet while the movie already jumped to the next one. I felt like I couldn't enjoy those Villeneuvishly spectacular scenes as much as they deserved to be enjoyed. A second round with this movie is definitely coming for me."

While the cinematography and CGI are undeniably captivating, the story's coherence is as elusive as an oasis in the Sahara.\n\nSet against a backdrop of shifting sands and sun-bleached horizons, \"Babel Babble\" immerses viewers in a world where communication is as tangled as the desert undergrowth. Dialogue flits between languages like mirages on the horizon, leaving audiences to decipher a linguistic labyrinth with no map in sight.\n\nAs the plot meanders through the dunes, viewers are left to wander alongside the protagonist, whose motivations are as inscrutable as the shifting sands beneath their feet. Attempts to unravel the narrative threads are met with frustration and confusion, as the story twists and turns like a sandstorm in the desert.\n\nYet, amidst the narrative quagmire, \"Babel Babble\" shines as a visual spectacle. Each scene is a testament to the beauty of the desert landscape, from the golden hues of sunrise to the eerie glow of moonlit sand dunes. The CGI seamlessly blends reality and fantasy, creating vistas that are both breathtaking and surreal.\n\nIn the end, \"Babel Babble\" is a film of contradictions. While its visuals transport viewers to stunning desert vistas, its story leaves much to be desired. It's a cinematic journey best enjoyed with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to embrace the absurdity of it all. So strap in, hold on tight, and prepare to be whisked away on a whirlwind tour of linguistic chaos and visual splendor. Just don't expect to find much coherence along the way."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dune part two is a very good movie. It is a masterpiece in terms of visuals, stage designs, use of sound, acting, and the subtext it adapts from the book. It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.\n\nThe film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.\n\nThe second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.\n\nIt's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.\n\nDune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time. I loved how they changed Chani's story arc and gave her a personality, and I loved how they showed Jessica's role more clearly than in the book. I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo, it is not free from some flaws. Still, it is such a good movie that, while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again, I love this movie even more by watching it over and over again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a long time fan of Dune, and the books by Frank Herbert, I left Dune: Part Two with a sense of confusion at what I had just watched.\n\nDenis Villeneuve did a phenomenal job with Dune: Part One, hands down, no question. He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.\n\nDune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a \"masterclass of filmmaking\" and \"best science fiction movie of all time to date\".\n\nI am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.\n\nSo, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.\n\nThere are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by \"holy crap!\" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.\n\nHad Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.\n\nThis is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.\n\nI leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning. If you want to see an amazing movie, you will be pleased. If you are going for the story - be prepared."

        "review_detailed_main": "Denis Villeneuve's *Dune: Part Two* is a bold and divisive sequel that fully embraces the epic scale and moral complexity of Frank Herbert's original novel. It's a film that will undoubtedly provoke strong reactions, as it delves deep into the dark consequences of messianic prophecies and the destructive power of unchecked ambition.\n\nThe film picks up where the first installment left off, with Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) embracing his role as the Muad'Dib. His powers grow exponentially, enabling him to manipulate sandworms, control minds, and predict the future. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and Paul's actions begin to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.\n\nThe Fremen, under the leadership of Chani (Zendaya), become a formidable force under Paul's guidance, but their victory comes at a terrible cost. The holy war against the oppressive galactic empire, is unleashed, leading to unimaginable suffering and destruction.\n\nThe film doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of Paul's character, as his thirst for power and control grows. His relationship with Chani becomes increasingly strained as he becomes consumed by his destiny. The performances from both Chalamet and Zendaya are exceptional, capturing the complexities of their characters with nuance and depth.\n\nThe supporting cast delivers strong performances, with Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen standing out as a charismatic and ruthless villain. Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan is a complex figure, caught between loyalty to her family and a growing admiration for Paul.\n\n*Dune: Part Two* is even more stunning than its predecessor. The desert planet of Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail, and the large-scale battle sequences are both thrilling and horrifying. Hans Zimmer's score continues to be a highlight, providing a powerful emotional backdrop to the story.\n\nHowever, the film's exploration of themes such as religion, ecology, and the dangers of unchecked power may be challenging for some viewers. The ending is particularly divisive, leaving a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty that will linger long after the credits roll.\n\n*Dune: Part Two* is a bold and uncompromising film that demands to be seen and discussed. It is a sequel that expands upon the world-building of the first film while also exploring the darker implications of its story. While it may not be for everyone, it is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement that will be remembered for years to come."

Sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story. What a time to be alive. Faith in cinema restored completely. Zendaya's Chani, though she doesn't impact the narrative much, frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that can't be silenced. Chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet, reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path. Javier Bardem brings the deep reverance, teacher, philosopher, and comic relief elements seemlessly. I don't know where to stop with the cast, so I'll just leave it there. The whole cast is wall-to-wall bullet proof. Absolute feast for the senses. Definitely see it in imax if you can. I could go on for days. Two thumbs up with a tear in the blue-within-blue eye.

        "review_detailed_main": "I read the first 3 Dune books about 15 years ago, I was a pretty big Dune dork back in the day, but then my interest waned and life got in the way. So I'd say my POV is somewhere between a mega Dune fan, and the general audience who doesn't know anything about the books. Zoom forward to 2021 and though I was excited for Part 1, I wasn't blown away by it (though I must admit I've enjoyed Part 1 more and more each time I've watched it). I went into Part 2 more curious than excited, but my gosh was I surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! I was running a little late to my showtime, and didn't get a chance to use the restroom before. I kept waiting for a \"slow\" or boring scene to sneak out--and that scene never came. Every moment felt important, and each scene held my attention so completely, that I decided the discomfort of needing to void wasn't worth missing a beat. So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. It's been a really long time since I've had such a visceral reaction to a movie; I kept thinking to myself, \"the movies are back!!\" And even though it's long, by the end I was actually sad because I wanted more...although at least I could finally pee! ;)"

The world building is spectacular, the fights are action packed, the emotional weight in certain scenes is palpable. The actors all played their rolls flawlessly with stand out performances by Timothy chalemet, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem and Zendaya. I can't think of anything more they could have done to make this film more enjoyable.. except perhaps add another hour. 10/10 no question."

The music in the movie was one of my favourite parst because it fits perfectly in to the world and help you get immersed even more. I think that the languages where implemented really well to the point where i can see it being an actual language. Like i said this movie is not pervet it has its flaws i feel like a lot of the ideas could have been explored more and i wish we could have seen more ot the desert an the south of Arrakis.

Everything was going along just fine until you changed the ending. Frank Herbert wrote a great story, a great book and a great ending and I just don't understand why you needed to change the end It's very disappointing and it's not worth watching again because it's not the story that I am used to. So as I said, after the Kyle McLaughlin version of Dune, what book did you read? Because it certainly wasn't Dune."

Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe, he must prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.\n\nI'd like to start off by mentioning that I didn't really like the first Dune. I felt like it was too slow and lacked significant events and was just setting up this part. Looking back, now I understand why that was the case. This part wouldn't have been as good without the setup from part one. The first scene in this movie is really visually beautiful and sets up the tone for the rest of the film. The movie is a 3 hour adventure in this incredible world were time just flys by. The production was fabulous and the action and fight scenes were super entertaining, big credits to the director Denis Villeneuve. Hans Zimmer's score is also a big selling point of the movie as it elevates the watching experience and changes the viewer's mood. The cast is also perfect and you can sense that there's a strong chemistry between all of the actors. The story is incredibly good but the storytelling could be a bit better. There are some points that leave you with question marks. But maybe that is left to be explained later. Which brings me on to the next point, I need closure. This film seems like its also setting up a next film so that's more than five hours of set up (with the durations of part one and two combined) with no clear end or a bit of closure. I get that this is supposed to be a big Sci-Fi film series but there has to be a point of where I feel like i didn't spend 5 hours on a journey with no sense of ending. Hopefully they change my mind regarding this point by the time Dune:Part Three releases. Other than that, it was an absolutely amazing film that has to be watched.\n\nScore:8.5/10."

New characters are introduced in a way that makes you care just enough about them to make it impactful. The telling of the stories of the Bene Gesserit is done masterfully, conveying stuff from the book that is hard to put on screen.\n\nIf there was one thing I was missing, it's the use of the word \"holy war\" instead of the book accurate \"Holy Jihad\".

Giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing, and explosive action scenes never more raw. The CGI is exquisite. Never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial. The best part, though, has to be the cinematography. Almost every single shot could be a wallpaper, poster, or painting.\n\nIn an age where big-budget movies are floundering, and tired franchises are puttering out, Dune is bringing crowd-pleasing, epic movies back.

Disappointed the new films didn't utilise the Bene Gesserit 'Weirding Way' power, so no weaponised modules. \ud83d\ude22 the 'voice' is still used though of course.\n\nI'm all for diversity. And given the books mirror on the worlds religions and politics this was fitting to have all cultures involved. But was there a need to gender swop as well as race swop a character? \ud83e\udd14\n\nIt's a great sci fi film but it's not quite the masterpiece it's being heralded as imo.\n\nI'm sure it will predictably win countless awards. FX. Couple of actors performances.\n\nThe script shouldn't though imo.\n\nThe ending felt totally rushed and zero resistance felt, no tension. Far too easy and brief a victory imo. Could have done with at least another half hour to really feel them gaining ground and getting ever closer to the Emperor. But no........they were there at the doors in a heartbeat which I was surprised by. Missed opportunity to build tension, suspense and bring great performances from the cast especially Walken is wasted here. (More on that later)\n\nFeyd actor wasn't great and looked like a cross between Matt Lucas (Little Britain) and the Engineers from Prometheus \ud83d\ude01and his 'Birthday' scene in the arena seemed pointless and badly executed.\n\nBatista's lack of acting abilities showed in this to the point he just shouted all his dialogue and hoped for the best.\n\nChristopher Walken seemed wasted and was never really allowed to embrace the role with the little screen time he had. Didn't come across as Emperor at all. No grandeur at all. This is the Emperor of the Universe !!?\n\nAnyone elsenspot the almost Monty Python Life of Brian moment. \"Only the true Messiah would deny he is the Messiah\" (or words there abouts) nearly had us shouting out \"He's not the Messiah he's a really naughty boy!\" Ha ha. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAgain. Well worth the watch though. The religious nods to real life from the book, the jihad, the politics are there although most is skirted over as it wouldn't make quite an exciting film. It's more style over substance. Visually nice yet not hugely engaging intellectually.\n\nThe designs for the spaceships seemed a little bland also, no real style or identity for each 'House'. At least Lynch film had some well thought out difference in the look of each houses palace and ships etc.\n\nBland. Especially after seeing what H R Giger had designed for the Harkonen style (for a film that sadly never got made many years ago). Oh how incredible that would have been If only it had happened. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udda4\n\nNownif only we could see Lynch's first 14hr cut. Ha ha. Love to see what treasure we're inside that version.\n\nBring on pt3. I'll still watch. It will be popular. But they tooling themselves with all thebgushing about masterpiece."

Poor Zendaya was so underutilized that it made no sense why Paul was having dreams of her in the first part. His premonitions were so useless, his dreams in the first part didn't warn him about the massacres about to happen to his family but kept showing him Zendaya (really useless superpower to have). There are multiple oscar winning actors who have been criminally underutilized (Josh Brolin, Javier B, Chris W).\n\nAgain the production value is great and makes it watchable but was too slow, nothing really happened and when it happened was underwhelming."

I want to note especially the love line of Paul and Chani, I was moved to the bones. Also, the Music, it is simply incredible, I am extremely delighted with the fact that , what Hans Zammer wrote for this film, great work. Go to the cinema and enjoy, if possible better in IMAX)"

Everyone gave a performance of a lifetime, the action is grand and epic, the hand to hand combat is fast paced, the cinematography and vfx are the best I've seen, writing and storytelling are at its finest, the score and sound effects are beautiful and loud. This movie is super immersive. The stand out are timothee, Zendaya and Austin Butler. Pacing is perfect as you are super immerse in the movie that you lost the sense of time. Watch this in an IMAX theatre. There is a little bit of comedy in the first half and there is some quotes to be remembered for decades. This is cinema baby!! Definitely in my top 10 fav movie ever. Watch it."

The characters, plot, action, cinematography, sound design; every aspect of this film was finely tuned to perfection. Every scene is masterfully crafted, ingrained in my brain. The fight scenes were as tense and thrilling as the Dune Part 1, if not more so. The dialogue was engaging, the sound effects beautiful, and the music was the perfect backdrop to each scene. The directors and writers also use silence incredibly well, providing stark contrasts to the booming bass that tends to be used in larger fights. The characters feel believable, and have their own motivations, purposes and personalities, allowing their relationships to flourish. All this without even commenting on the visuals. This film is a cinematic masterpiece, the CGI and the practical effects being stunning. The way the various worlds are portrayed is expertly done. Absolutely one of the best films I have ever watched, 10/10 would recommend."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film starts exactly at the moment the first part ended. Although according to Villeneuve it is designed to be understood without having seen the first part, I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One before.\n\nThe first half of the film is poetic. Great shots of the desert. Developing new characters (especially Fremen) that we had seen briefly in the first part and, above all, we can see an evolution of some characters that we already knew. I highlight here the character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film. Bravo to Villeneuve for having developed Chani's character (wasted in Herbert's novel), here Chani shines until the end. Bardem, is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot, adding dynamism and even funny moments.\n\nThe second half of the film goes to Paul Atreides. I can't say too much here, only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that I've been seen in cinema. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply some of the best I have ever witnessed on a screen. Everything that was harvested in Dune: Part One now makes complete sense. The characters of Florence Pugh and Austin Butler stand out, the first one, in the background but being a totally key character, especially for everything that is going to come (Messiah); and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain (far above the Baron, a villain who personally never convinced me).\n\nAll of this is great, however, an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was: the music of Hans Zimmer. Spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate (literally... if you see it in Imax) every moment inside you. It is no coincidence that Nolan's best films have Zimmer's seal. His music creates art. His music creates blockbusters. Not because it's commercial, but because it creates emotions within you. Every note, sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film. Hans Zimmer's music is undoubtedly the specie, the Water of Life... of Dune: Part Two.\n\nWith all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created, but what is (be careful what I am going to say) the best film of this 21st century (at least to date), with permission from the Dark Knight and Interstellar.\n\nVilleneuve gives us a great masterpiece. Here, however, the Messiah is not Paul Atreides, nor Villeneuve himself... The Messiah is the spectator. You. This film will push you to be a better you, it will make you dream big, it will remind you that, like Paul, you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others. You are the Chosen One to, within a simple movie, find the Gold that will make you better in your daily life.\n\nThis valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art, but only by a few works... which some of us dare to call... MASTERPIECES.\n\nBecause... in the shadows of Arrakis lie one secret... Dune 2 is a MASTERPIECE."

Hans Zimmer really knows how to match those instruments with scenes that we see. Next part is acting, and... oh boy... Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Austin Butler were my favorites.

        "review_detailed_main": ".. there is a wall. Not a shield wall, that protects Arrakeen from the deep desert, but rather a cultural wall. A wall where those who came before are used to a higher quality, a finesse in filmmaking, which is lost on those who came later. Who like LOUD, BIG, and absolutely on-the-nose film.\n\nWhile i place on a pedestal the immortal masterpiece by Lynch, Dune 2 was just mediocre. Not as bad as Dune .. uh .. 1? But still not really good.\n\nI mean, i can't forget that i have seen 1984 Dune, so maybe i could like this a bit more if the first film never existed. I could forget the magnificent sets, the fantastic costumes, the amazing soundtrack, the superb direction and pacing, the acting of Jose Ferrer, of Kenneth McMillian, of Max von Sydow. We could forget that Lynch figured out that Space Kungfu wouldn't work and fixed the fighting and the ending, but then i would be left only with what little Dune 2 has to offer - a bunch of bland CGI stolen from the internet, horrible costumes, and a story which would maybe have better impact if it had anything like a decent direction. While VIlleneuve did the fairly good Sicario, to me he will always be the guy who made a mockery of Blade Runner.\n\nAnd here is the wall. You either do, or do not like. You are on one side or the other. You can't like the new Blade Runner and also like the old one, you can't like Dune 2 and Dune 1984 at the same time, because if you grew up with the cinema sensibility that created such masterpieces as the original Dune and Blade Runner, you will simply be bored at the complete lack of artistic quality that their remakes have. And if you DO like the new ones, you don't even know what to look at, when you're shown the old ones.\n\nDune 2 was bad. Not horrible bad, but disappointing, sad bad. Sad that we insult the intelligence of our audience so much, and sad that they can't even tell.\n\nMy vote: i don't know, 10/10 if you are a teenager, 5.5/10 if you are an adult."

The amount of details in the movie can be compared to the greatest movies ever made, everything was on point the designs of the locations were outrageous, the accent difference between the Northern and Southern people of Arakkis, the clothing to be honest everything was on point.

Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in \"part two\". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.\n\nThe other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to \"Empire Strikes Back\" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of \"Episode V\" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that \"something is more to come, the final battle is nearing\". \"Dune: part two\" is instead cut anticlimactically.\n\nUnfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by \"Dune: part two\" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential. It could have been something truly epic and for the ages, instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself."

That is not Hype, I agree. Despite game of thrones being inspired by Frank Herberts Dune and sharing many themes, and despite similarities used by Lucas in Star Wars, if anything the plot elements work even better here in the priginal."

Timothee Chalamet is a complete let-down. He has exactly two facial expressions: the boyish, somehow stupid smile (fits for Willy Wonka, not for Paul Atreides) and another look of a freezing disappointed puppy. Not enough. There are scenes wre you desperately wait for him to act, but it is all compensated with the massive allways-sounding-the-same score. Yawn. Another let-down: The new version of Feyd-Rautha. I don' t like Sting, but he was much more convincing as a madmen, while Austin Butler just treis hard to act one. And than there are all those plot holes and illogical scenes: The Fremen hide under the sand to attack the harvester, but after some face-to-face-combat they destroy it with laser canon from a long distance. Why the first assault? Just to risk lifes? Stooooopid! Not even Zendaya or Xavier Bardem were worth watching this pathetic attempt of making a SciFi-movie.

Her chemistry with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is off the charts, and you can feel the tension and tenderness between them in every scene they share.\n\nZendaya's presence on screen is captivating, and you can't help but be drawn into her world. She's not just an actress playing a role; she becomes Chani, embodying her strength, courage, and vulnerability in a way that's truly inspiring.\n\nAnd let's not forget the rest of the movie - the visuals, the storytelling, everything is just top-notch. Director Denis Villeneuve has created a breathtaking world that feels both epic and intimate, and Zendaya's performance is a shining beacon in the midst of it all.\n\nOverall, Dune Part 2 is a cinematic experience you won't soon forget, and Zendaya's talent and charisma only add to its brilliance. She's truly one of the brightest stars in Hollywood right now, and I can't wait to see what she does next."

Plus the political and religious undertones advance the storyline so much more than anything Star Wars could have envisioned..guess it's only fair since Dune influenced Star Wars. And if you are a fan of Game of Thrones this will be right up your alley!\n\nBut overall this is a special masterful moment in movie making and Sci-fi. Bring on Dune Messiah!"

Such a shame. I think it has been overrated. I would recommend watching it, but go when well rested and feeling patient..."

The actors are convincing and the environment, even if generated in places, is incorporated so that it is almost imperceptible. However, where the film's problem arises is in the dramaturgy. Working with film time is not goot at all. The movie sequences don't always fit together, and the closer we get to the end, the more problems there are in this area. In some places, the tension is cut off, and then the tension is missing and the logic of the characters' actions begins to hide. The worst thing is exactly the feeling of watching a movie. It's great that the film captures and hits, but it can't sustain interest all the time without problems. Just the fact that the viewer asks what time it is and how long it takes in the cinema, he notices the people around him and has to literally struggle to keep watching. When the real world starts talking to him through the illusion of the screen. That's a failure. As the film moves forward and nears the end, it becomes boring. The dramaturgy and the position of the characters in the story, their value for the story completely collapses towards the end and is saved only by the vision of a possible sequel. Well, it's not exactly a bad movie, but as a whole it lacks a pull at goal."

Part One was a little too slow pacing; Part Two was a little faster paced but so much more interesting. And I loved Paul's relationship with Chani. I've seen so many cringy, stereotypical, and generic romances, but theirs was moving. I loved how there was so much passion and emotion displayed in their eyes, but left out most of the dialogue associated with other romances. The Emperor may have been the overarching villain, but the climactic fight was Paul's single combat against Feyd-Rautha, and that was something. The choice to not use music or slow motion shots was atypical, but it made for one of the most stressful heart-pounding hand-to-hand fights I've ever witnessed. As a whole, Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest movie experiences of my life, so just imagine watching it in theaters instead of on a mobile device."

        "review_detailed_main": "So. Frank Herbert told a story of religious fervor and how it warps the minds of people. Dennis Villeneuve wanted to capture it and did so very well.\n\nWith this film Villeneuve creates a grand tapestry of cultural expression which we have never seen before. The different planets have their very distinct feel to them, in both sight and sound and one never feels like it's too much or too weird, it's just the right amount. Villeneuve managed to capture and create his own totality of the world of Dune. Some could say he leaves certain parts of the book out which they miss, but just as with Peter Jacksons trilogy, this movie eminates a passion from both director, cinematographer, composer, vfx artists, sound designers, it's clear they wanted to tell Frank Herberts story, and they certainly did!\n\nHollywood is in a crisis, why? Just because people have stopped going to the movie theatres? Well, as we see with this movie which has already broken many box office records, people haven't necessarily stopped going to the cinema, they just don't wanna waste money on bad movies. So the Hollywood crisis is, sure, partly due to technological change, but also to a severe lack of good stories to tell. And funnily enough, the lack of stories to tell in 2024 has a parallel to the story of Dune 2, mainly in that the prophet of Paul Atreides is precisly the story the Fremen need to reach beyond the dunes and out into the galaxy, we need a similar story to reach beyond ourselves today too. But as Dennis Villeneuve and Frank Herbert so brilliantly shows us, it can very easily go bad.\n\nI tell you though. When watching this film, you cannot help yourself, you are just dragged along whether you want to or not. Chalamet, Bardem, Ferguson, Zendaya, Skarsg\u00e5rd, Butler they all do their parts so well. I would say Zendaya has a tendency to be in the permanent \"I carelessly dissaprove\"-role, but even she manages to break out of it for this movie.\n\nThe thing that impressed me the most is the authenticity of the different cultural expressions as I mentioned before, the Harkonnen aestethics, the choice of having a black and white sun, the Fremen funeral rite, the accuracy of shamanic rituals, the costumes, it all feels like a window into a different reality more than a movie.\n\nI have blabbed on, what could have been said in just a few words, so here it goes in case I wasn't clear: This is an amazing movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is something about Dune. You either dig it or you don't. I dig it. In fact I love it.\n\nDune came out as a novel in 1965, it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of 23,352 AD : ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it created.\n\nThe demon of AI has already been conceived and defeated. So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.\n\nIt could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.\n\nIt is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.\n\nIt is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.\n\nBut at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.\n\nDune is influential.\n\nIf you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).\n\nI have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.\n\nThe casting in this version is perfect. The effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagery.\n\nDune has almost become a holy book for the sci-fi fan of a certain age, it even has a messiah. I am that kind of fan. Watching it has become a religious experience. You feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true. That makes it powerful.\n\nThat makes Dune part two simply superb."

The certain thing is that the part two doesnt disappoint in any section, I thing that only improves and when I mean improve I dont say in technical terms but the viewer appreciate even more the scenario the characters every spectrum of the film. Thats because you start to be more familiar and you start to like that you have a bigger picture on the lore. Dont mistaken me the first part in my opion it was at the same level of quality as the second both movies awesome and the mystery on what happens next even at the same scene is there and it does it nice. I think that with this movies warner bros bring back a franchise who deserve movies like this and I am very glad that I watched them both. They deserve your time dont miss them.

Do yourself a favor and watch it in IMAX, seriously, you won't regret it.\n\nWho didn't read the books (I envy you, to be able to read it for the 1st time \ud83d\ude00) may talk about minor issues with the script but the director was so faithful to the books and you don't see that in Hollywood nowadays. Of course, you can't cover and entire book in just 2 and a half hour of a movie, but he did it! Villneuve cements his place in the pantheon of top tier directors with this movie.\n\nI can't wait for part 3, I refuse to believe there won't be one, over the years he said his dream is to make a trilogy and close the circle.\n\nIn the end, all I can say is go watch the movie, do it in IMAX and enjoy a mind-blowing journey, in one of the best movies ever done.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack has not left my head since the movie began. The cinematography is some of the most visually stunning across such a variety of scenes. Austin Butler was an absolute force with the little screen time he had, a terrifying and psychotic villain that rivals some of the greats. Timothy Chalamet's command of attention of all was unmatched. The chants of \"Lisan al Gaib\" have replayed over and over in my head for the past day. I already have tickets to rewatch and will be shocked if that's the last time I see it."

As i mentioned before it felt a bit rushed sometimes but that is to be expected when you make a movie adaptation of a book so that did not bother me that much. I do however believe that this film needs to be rated R in order for it to reach its fullest potential. Showing a bit more realism in the battles etc would have made this a 10/10 for me. However the action was still great and the final fight scene was so f*in good."

My only complaint is I wish the final battle scene was a bit longer. It felt too short, but I'm nitpicking. Go out and spend your hard earned money, this film was meant to see on the big screen.

The debunking of the messiah myth. The conflict is perfectly recognized in this rendition. I can't wait for the next part of this and seeing how you render the God emperor.

Yes I would, if you enjoyed the first film, books or even Sci-Fi generally. The plot was well written and well executed. Can't wait for the next instalment."

The narrative is all about the increasing complexity and darkness of the choices facing the lead characters, and like both the book and other Villeneuve films it has no qualms about not answering all the questions it raises.\n\nThe second is the pacing - I'm not sure there's a two minute sequence in there I would have cared to miss.\n\nFinally this is a Dennis Villeneuve film and you absolutely getting his trademark sensational visuals!"

The stellar performances, meticulous plot execution, and awe-inspiring cinematography collectively contribute to an outstanding film. Each actor excels in their role, and the costume designs are commendable.\n\nWhile the movie shines in various aspects, it occasionally leans heavily on visual effects, reaching a point of excessiveness. Despite this, the overarching narrative brilliantly delves into the theme of religious fanaticism. The spiritual motifs in Dune draw striking parallels to messianic concepts, echoing the biblical narrative of Jesus and his mission to liberate humanity from tyranny over 2000 years ago in our world. Overall, Dune Part 2 successfully navigates the delicate balance between visual spectacle and profound storytelling, making it a noteworthy cinematic experience."

I felt if i has not read the book, then i might not have known what was happening to Paul via the spice. I did miss seeing his sister, and I don't quite understand why they changed that, even though I read the explanation.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2\u00be hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!"

The kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family. As a hard-working man, finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare. I can enjoy a trilogy again as if I were a fan, just like in the old days, finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment, the outside world fades away. It makes me feel young again, reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility I had back then. This movie is brilliant, not just in its execution but in its vision. I love how they incorporated Islamic prophecies. It's a testament to the film's commitment to not just entertain but to educate.

The scenery, world-building, character development, music, sound effects, pacing, and overall feeling, in my opinion, perfect for this story. There were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen, which I felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the book.\n\nI especially loved this movie's depiction of Paul's internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for Chani and the Fremen people. He is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations, controlled prophecies, love, loss, and fear of greater loss and suffering. All of this internal turmoil is heard in Paul's words, tone, and seen on his face. Lady Jessica's portrayal is terrifying and unsettling. Chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with. Stilgar is devout and unironically hilarious at times.\n\nEvery shot of the movie is a work of art. I plan to go back for a 2nd viewing."

As a devout fan of Frank Herbert's epic saga, I approached this sequel with high hopes, only to be met with profound disappointment.\n\nThe most glaring flaw lies in its butchered storytelling. The intricate plot of Herbert's masterpiece is treated with a careless disregard, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. Instead of delving into the depth and complexity of the source material, the film meanders through superfluous scenes that add little to the overarching story.\n\nWhere the1984 Dune adaptation succeeded was in its faithful and nuanced storytelling. Each scene served a purpose, advancing the plot and deepening our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The pacing was deliberate, allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe.\n\nIn contrast, \"Dune Part Two\" feels like a series of missed opportunities. Important plot points are glossed over or omitted entirely, leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied. Characters lack depth and development, reducing them to mere caricatures of their literary counterparts.\n\nWhile the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and the performances commendable, they cannot compensate for the film's fundamental narrative shortcomings. \"Dune Part Two\" is a prime example of style over substance, a hollow shell of what could have been a truly remarkable cinematic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dune Part Two\" fails spectacularly in capturing the essence of Herbert's masterpiece. Its rushed plot and inclusion of unnecessary scenes detract from the overall experience, leaving audiences longing for the depth and nuance of the original 1984 adaptation."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the best movies I've ever seen. True to sci-fi, dark, intense, amazing cinematography, quality acting, and with exciting action. I still find it hard to believe that a movie with so much in it is so well put together. As well, I'm quite surprised that it's received so much mainstream buzz because it partially feels like a real sci-fi movie if that makes any sense. But I can understand how there's enough here to appeal to all fans of cinema.\n\nIt's an instant classic for me. It actually surpassed Dune Part One and delivered on all fronts. Part One did a great job at setting the scene and Part Two knocked it out of the park. I would give it a 9.5/10 because it's a bit long and there's a lot to follow throughout the entirety of the movie, it can get a bit taxing. Loved this movie!"

It will go down in our history as one of the greatest films ever made."

        "review_detailed_main": "I very rarely give 10/10 ratings to films, but DUNE II is easily the best movie I have ever seen!\n\nThis is why you go to the cinema: to be entertained!(not to be educated or being pressured to think a certain way).\n\nWhen I go to the cinema and pay for a movie ticket I want quality, I want to be taken on a journey, very simple.\n\n'Legendary Pictures' and 'Warner Brothers' have given Denis Villeneuve the respect as an artist and as a story teller to allow him to create his vision on the big screen - as it should be!\n\nWhen studios interfere and micro manage projects it dilutes and spoils the quality of the film (Alien 3 is a perfect example of this).\n\nDenis Villeneuve, Hans Zimmer, Jon Spaiths and Greig Fraser are the future of cinema!\n\nThe 2 hour and 46 runtime just flew by - the pacing was spot on. I easily could have sat there for 3 and a half hours!\n\nThe score by Hans Zimmer was just unbelievable and perfectly transports you into the world of DUNE for the entire runtime.\n\nThe cast and performances were all incredible, in particular Javier Bardem as Stilgar, he absolutely believed in Paul and his journey.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Paul Atreides, was just awesome. I haven't seen much of his work prior to DUNE - his performance in part one was more subtle and this film sees him transform intimate a reluctant hero then gradually fully accepting his destiny - his speeches to the Fremen were incredible and gave me the chills.\n\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as the Baron, just perfect casting, absolutely terrifying, a highly intelligent and repulsive character. Very well done.\n\nThe other stand out performance was Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha - just gave me the creeps anytime he was on screen and totally unrecognisable in the role, he is a chameleon.\n\nI want to see DUNE 3 and DUNE Prophecy - let's make it happen!\n\nWe need to support films like DUNE 2, films that are of a high standard are very special and do not come along very often.\n\nTicket sales unfortunately are what dictates which films are made and we need to pay to see the films that we want to see at the cinema and stop paying for low quality, rubbish films.\n\nWe need to vote with our own money for the type of movies that we want to see, I am going to see DUNE 2 again."

This time there are even outstanding scenes in black and white.\n\nThe sound is captivating and Hans Zimmer gets the blood flowing again. This gives the scenes in almost complete silence a special meaning.\n\nThe storybuilding is also remarkable. You can really see the characters' development and also increasing tension between them.\n\nAll in all this movie is the epitome of filmmaking. After almost 3 hours I still didn't want it to end. Some scenes gave me goosebumps and I can't wait to see the next chapter."

I can easily say that at this point Dune part 2 is the most representative movie of all the art of Denis Villeneuve, it contains a lot of ispiration from 2001: a space odyssey and also from his pasts films like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival. He did a perfect sequel for the first film that was also on point, but this one is more strong and we can see the beauty of the character and story development that leave us with the need of another sequel. Last thing but not for importance, the end of this film gived a sensation of excitement and curiosity for the future of this incredible saga."

From taking his position as rebel leader to conqueror of the universe in 15min... Love story is. The love story is unconvincing and without any chemistry between the two leading characters. All in all, a big disappointment after the successful and good first part. You can watch this film at home with no problem."

        "review_detailed_main": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.\n\nAs a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.\n\nDenis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.\n\nThe movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.\n\nI believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "To be succinct, my issue with this movie is that many of the most interesting, clever, and unique story features that makes Dune so iconic were oversimplified and/or completely changed to make a very generic story that does not mirror the book in most any respect. Sitting in the theater, having only just finished my re-reading of Dune the day before, I realized that only about 20% of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context. The characters are simply not the same characters from the novel, but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations. Overall, the movie is not bad. I give it 5 out of 10 because it is a generic, middle of the pack movie. Which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score. Quite disappointing."

After watching this one though I feel like I should just watch them back to back to really soak it in. The glimpses of the inner politics (and of otherworldly things) is downright fascinating. Battle choreography fantastic, setpieces, fantastic.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of is one particularly bad cgi wide shot which stuck out because everything else is immaculate, as well as one line from Chalamet that did not meet the quality of the performance of the veteran actor he said it to. (Maybe he felt he has to act up to him?l Anyways, great stuff, I'll see you all when Part 3 comes out in 2030."

But what really had me wanting to contribute is the 1 star reviews. I love them so much. So much anger and vitriol over a movie. Everything I loved about this move seems to be what they hate. It was long but thick with character development. The fight scenes were there for the plot only and didn't make me fall asleep to 30 mins of cgi superhero action. Instead it furthers the plot. It wasn't action packed but layers of lore and story building.\n\nBut the rage from the reviews of slow action, boring characters, \"lame\" sci-fi makes me laugh and worry. This is epic storytelling, not force fed action. You will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time. If you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch, you don't be disappointed. Obviously not for everyone but what is. But one of the best film (franchises) I've seen in years. Truly hoping to see the full arch of Paul's story with a 3rd."

Maybe less likable.\n\nI'm blown away by how disappointed I am in this movie. I'll give it another watch or two in hopes it grows on me, but I'm struggling to see how it could.\n\nMaybe if they make Part Three based on Dune Messiah it will be better because there are less battles in that book to use as a crutch.\n\nIf you want to see a bunch of people you barely know anything about stab each other for 3 hours.

This film is definitely made to be seen in the cinema as the outstanding visuals translate amazingly onto the big screen. The music of this film is absolutely amazing and in my opinion it's one of the best soundtracks ever made. The story is gripping as it is fascinating and fantastic to see the rise of Paul Atreides . This film series seems to definitely be the Lord Of The Rings of the 2020s and it will be praised for generations. Overall a perfect film that I hope will preform well in awards season."

Oh my goodness I mean like wow, let me just say Austin scared me I couldn't look him in the eye when I saw him and his voice was very creepy but captivated and his voice sounded like video game character kinda of and also some Stellan in his voice as well, I love this movie it was amazing so much wonderful work for Denis, You need to run not walk to watch dune 2 in March YES!\n\nGo see part 2 in theaters March 1st! Austin performance captivating, outstanding, menacing, creepy, and will having you want to see his performance even more. Also Austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was Tex Waston and more I feel like both are kind of equal but Austin in dune was insane and I would love to watch it over again. I am so proud of how far he has came he is so brilliant in what he does he is so good with how he portrays his characters I can't wait to see more things he does and accomplish but wow way to go Austin congratulations."

        "review_detailed_main": "This really isn't a Dune-the-book movie but a related tale that takes away all the sci-fi and deep intrigue that makes Dune-the-book such a fascinating tale. Instead what we get is super-stylized black-and-white with the details and the context rendered nearly superfluous in order to propel a simple tale of political ascension. Why is spice so important in use and action? What's the background that has set this whole conflict in motion? What's big deal about the worms? Why is Paul so reliant on the myths spread to \"pave the way\" versus his own abilities? Is Paul something special or not? Surely you've seen Dune I, now finding its natural continuation in Dune II which furthers the cause of gorgeous special effects, environmentals, sound, etc. But somehow it's all bland and as colorless as much of the landscape despite the spectacular costuming. Without context it's another ho-hum story of moderate manipulation that aims to succeed via Paul's riding the coattails of religious parable and meaningless miracles via a pushy Mom. P. S. Zendaya is only marginally better in D-II but far more annoying but T. C. has really grown up and greatly compensates for the overall plot dullness. My Oscar predictions: Every single technical award; in acting, nominations for Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson."

This story is so dull and boring with characters you care nothing about. They are shallow and lifeless. They might as well have been cardboard cutouts. They're not convincing and there is no feeling. It is literally 3 hours of visually and musically stunning footage. If that's your thing then I guess it's a great movie.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I like a good story. I like characters who reach into my heart and my mind. I like to be convinced they're the real deal. This was so disappointing I wish I could get my money and three hours of my life back. I hoped this second part would at least make up for the long driven out part of part one, but it is just more of the same.\n\nWhere is the love between Channi and Paul? The only one who did any acting was Rebecca Ferguson, and she over-acted so much I was almost convinced she was trying to make up for the lack of depth in everyone else. Yet, Lady Jessica is supposed to be stoic. It's the director's vision, I suppose-mix it up so it comes across fresh.\n\nSpeaking of fresh. How anticlimactic was that great uprising? I don't want to give anything away, but wow! Way to work your audience up for a surprise like that! I sure as heck didn't see that coming. I sneeze faster than that.\n\nI really have no idea how this load of garbage got so many rave reviews. It was terrible. Save yourself the money. Read the books or watch David Lynch's version. At least his wasn't drawn out for six boring hours."

This and the first part are the only two films I've paid the mortgage to go and see in a large screen and they absolutely need and deserve to be seen. This takes all of the expectations I had from the first part of Dune and exceeded them ten-fold. There are some decisions made by Denis Villeneuve which are so jaw droppingly exquisite I'm not sure exactly how his announced rendition of Dune Messiah is going to have any room left to improve upon this. This is a beautiful beautiful film which builds on itself, and special mention must go to the sound design which literally shook my seat in the cinema. Perfect."

Its really refreshing to have a movie improve on a book. OK they have not stuck to the plot 100 percent and are obviously planning a war of the great houses etc. Overall its everything I have ever wanted from Sci fi and cannot thank the people who have made this work so well enough.

The imagery created in this movie was beyond anything I had ever imagined while reading the book. The visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of Herbert's writing to focus on romance, revenge, betrayal, fundamentalism and transcendence. It is a different ride than part one. I won't provide any spoilers, but here are a few other random thoughts.\n\nI got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special IMAX showing. I hope they start doing more of these. Hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because Dune: Part Two is an experience in IMAX that made the story better that I can't get at home. I love watching movies at home with subtitles, but I would have missed a lot visually if I focused on reading those.\n\nI left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the IMAX technology and pace of storytelling, but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt, evil powers focused on maximizing wealth. The fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement. I'm looking forward to rereading Herbert's books again."

        "review_detailed_main": "For all its stunning visuals and action scenes, Dune: Part 2 is, more than anything else, about people-the grand inter-house politics of the Imperium, the outsiders among the insular Fremen, the believers in prophecy versus the younger self-reliant generation. But at its core, the movie is about motherhood and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect and uplift her child.\n\nLittered with lingering landscape shots of Arakkis, the movie pays respect to the planet that gives both the Fremen and the galaxy life, its most valuable resource being spice. But much like a planet raises and nurtures people, giving them the space and protection to grow and learn for themselves while also guiding them with and through challenges-sandstorms and scalding hot days-Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (now Reverend Mother) guides Paul's life, shaping the path she set when she first decided to have a son rather than a daughter.\n\nAnd as much as the power of belief has the potential to corrupt Paul, causing countless deaths across the galaxy, the unconditional love of Jessica for Paul is itself a use of power, a transference of opportunity and protection that confers advantages onto its recipient. Jessica, so confident that her son is the Kwisatz Hadarach, she used the myths that the Bene Gessirit planted in Arrakis to propel Paul into leadership of the Fremen-a substantial feat given that both she and Paul are off-worlders and relatively new to Fremen society. In addition, in both the first and second films, Jessica physically protects Paul while simultaneously training him, using those moments to instruct Paul on how to better himself. Ultimately, it is this belief in her son, training in her ways, and protection as he reaches his potential that allows Paul best Feyd-Rautha and usurp the throne.\n\nSpice may be the most valuable substance in the galaxy, but belief is the most powerful source in the Dune universe. But more than a struggling population's belief in a savior, the belief of a parent in their child has truly transformational consequences. In that way, Paul may be the dagger of change, plunged directly into the heart of the Imperium, but Jessica is the knife wielder, living up to her role as a Bene Gessirit, controlling everything from behind the scenes. And it is that same power that she will grant to her unborn daughter when the story continues."

This film is nearly flawless in every imaginable way. The sounds can be both subtle and booming, the visuals are breathtaking in nearly every single scene, the special effects are absolutely top notch and the acting is stellar AT WORST.\n\nI do NOT typically enjoy paying too much for snacks and being stuck in a moderately comfy seat for hours on end, but this is a movie worth giving up any comfort you might have at home to see in a theater.

Just seeing the pew pews will get them going.\n\nThis is a good movie and it owes its strength to its incredible predecessor. But in the second installment lost are the sound design, the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in - that made you \"live\" the movie. Villeneuve, having spent 3 hours in Dune:Part 1 building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole Part 2 to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequels.\n\nThere is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot. Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.\n\nCharacter development is lost here. While he allows the young Atreides to mature a little and discover himself, he quickly turns Stilgar into an almost comical, caricaturized fanatic. While trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarily.\n\nThe visual design is beautiful to behold as ever. May be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them, the impact is less but still there.\n\nThe sound was one of the strongest aspects of Part 1. Somehow I feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue. And I think it is a great loss.\n\nConclusion to my rant: By any standard this is a good movie. Worthy of a glowing 7 or 7.5 score. However compared to what it could have been, it unfortunately falls short. And it definitely does not deserve a 9."

How can you transform a great book with great former adaptations and turn it into a boring AF waste of time.\n\nThere is no tension, no convincing acting and the pace will make you fall asleep.\n\nThe casting was made with pleasing the crowds in mind and not with the story, Timothy has the magnetism of plastic and the pairing with Zendaya feels forced and boring.\n\nThe magical and mystical elements of the book are completely missing or underplayed, as are the political motivations, there is no pending feelings of doom.\n\nAlso it feels more like a movie set in ancient Arabia rather than in space. In summary save yourself time and money and watch the 1984 version instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "A great film that delves deeper into the characters, and more of a study piece here with our Characters. Who are wonderfully portrayed inside this film, I always new how talented the likes of Timothee S and Zendaya were, who arguably had there best performance here [Timothee Chalamet), although haven't seen Wonka.\n\nThe futuristic style of the film is wonderful, so gorgeous and astetically pleasing on the eye. The effects are very good inside this film, and it's used effectively with the long range photographic image. So many wide shots which are tremendous, and as said look wonderful.\n\nAnd the film delves more into the human body and it makes it more interesting. Certainly the power elements with the 'revenge' plot which is a good way to expand the world and are characters, and makes Dune Part 2 great. There's some political aspects here, but for me it didn't drag the film down.\n\nAnd the length of Dune 2 is perfect. The pacing of this film is also very good, it never feels like it's dragged out at any point in time, I was always entertained and I think it's a captivating sequal that should not be ignored. It's also a perfect world that projects imagery and some great use of colour and effect. Makes it a great fun film to watch, If you liked the first part, I strongly suggest you watch this one. Because it's even better!\n\nOverall Rating:9/10, Would I recommend this film? Absolutely 100% Enjoyed it very much!"

It will take you deep in to desert and reveal many secrets Arrakis has to offer.\n\nIf you watch closely and inspect every detail the screen presents to you, you will find yourself to be taken down to a path through the history of Fremen and our own.\n\nThere are no words to describe the feeling i got everytime the music started. Hats off Mr. Hans Zimmer, you surprise every time. And ofcourse an applause for Mr. Denis Villeneuve and all the cast for presenting such a wonderful experience.\n\nIf you have a problem with my opinion, duel me in a hand-to-hand melee and let the best win."

        "review_detailed_main": "**A Cinematic Triumph: Exploring the Epic Sequel \"Dune: Part Two\"**\n\n\"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor to deliver an epic saga that surpasses all expectations. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.\n\nFrom the outset, it is evident that \"Dune: Part Two\" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.\n\nVisually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.\n\nAt the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.\n\nSupporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.\n\nYet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \"Dune: Part Two\" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, \"Dune: Part Two\" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond."

The scenery was breathtaking and in regards to acting it was clear the actors have embraced and portrayed their characters to \u00e0 T in direct correlation to the novel they are portrayed in the most perfect way. I admit I was weary before watching because the first one was just incredible .. but this does not dissapoint, I can only think of 2 other movies in history where the sequel outshined or performed on the same level of the first part and that would either be T2 jugement day,and of course the godfather 2. These titles are renowned and beloved by all, and quite Frankly that's the direction The Dune Saga has broughtforth, your left glued to the scream and asking what? I'm gonna have to wait another 3 years ... what if I don't live that long... Even if you haven't seen the first film, one can pick up and follow along as long as they pay attention to the narrative and direction the film is going in. Because the final showdown does not dissapoint and as I said prior.. Why do I have to wait another 3 years and here I am writing my commentary before healing to work and buying another ticket to see it on the big screen again this evening. Dune delivers in the opposition direction of every failed sequel and just leaves you in awe as the cr\u00e9dits come on screen as your left in disbelief that 3 hours has just passed. Anyways trust me kiddos GO SEE IT IN THEATRES!! You will find yourself in the same situation as me... stuck waiting more."

After seeing him in Wonka and then in this I think he is the most versatile actor at this time. Same thing about Austin. You won't recognise him here. Zendaya interprets one of the most powerful and badass female characters of all time in the most amazing way and she is perfect. Love her. There is no one bad thing I can say about this movie. But I think we need more kind of these movies. Don't miss it for anything in the world and by the way the IMAX really worth it."

There were many moments where the cgi was so good that I honestly couldn't tell if it was practical or not. I just finished reading the first book before seeing this and while there was a lot of stuff left out or changed, I had no issue with it.

Scenes seemed to move from one to the next because the story needed to move on, not being driven by character or emotion. Some relationships felt underdeveloped, and the story progression at times felt incohesive (like someone accidentally pressed the \"skip to next chapter\" button and you feel like you've missed something).\n\nA very good movie - visually and acoustically perfect - but with some story and pacing issues that had it fall short of total perfection, for me."

There is no rational why Spice is so valuable or how the Bene Gesserit are involved in the whole scheme of thIngs and these are two of the three core tenets of the whole saga. This rendition omits any explanation of the Emperor, Spacing Guild or of Paul's sister Alia.\n\nIt's sad that the story in these films is so diluted that the spectacles have no attachment."

The recent (say last 7 or 8 years) output from the industry has been worse (much worse) than lack-luster, most of the the \"tent pole block busters\" have been cinematic garbage (see for example, The Marvels and as far back as The Last Jedi, basically most anything from Disney but certainly not exclusive to Disney) .\n\nHere we have a movie created by a team free of the DEI quotas and agenda driven malarkey and they have produced nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!!! Probably the best science fiction movie of the decade, ranking it up there with one of the best sequels ever constructed (if you can call it that ... it feels more like the second half of a very long movie). Every aspect of this movie, from the cinematography, to the directing, writing, acting, CGI, sound, score... it is spot on perfect. The amount of talent that went into this movie shows and the end product is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise decaying industry poisoned by toxic one-sided politics, nearly dead and left to rot. I was truly emotional at the end, tears running down my face, not so much moved by the story (which was excellent) but having finally witnessed a truly great movie after years of absolute garbage, the emotion stirred in me was one of relief, a calming repose that great movie making has not been completely killed off and that it is still possible to make a movie that is not promoting \"the message\" or clubbing me over the head with a bunch of nonsense."

Denis Villeneuve did it again. He blew my mind.\n\nHe portrayed the world of Dune in a way I didn't believe was possible. Everything is cinematically grandiose and glues you to your seat in awe.\n\nThe sci-fi elements of Dune are out of this world, not since the release of the first Star Wars have I seen so many innovative solutions to visualise it. Everything from the Harkonnen desert suits to the mortar ships are things never seen before that excites the mind. This paired up with the amazing sound effects offers a cinematic experience like no other.\n\nThe movie itself, the storytelling, pacing and the acting is stellar.

The use of color is sublime, the black and white scene is incredible job well done.\n\nThe performances are all incredible. Zendaya is the true stand out, but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is phenomenal, He speaks with such conviction and power This young man is gonna have an incredible career, his acting range is absurd! But the likes of Christopher waltz, Florence Pugh, Javier Bardem are all great! But let's not forget Austin freaking Butler delivering a villainess performance that will be remembered for the ages, menacing, cruel, brutal. The introduction to this character is perfect. You hate him, but you love him.\n\nThis film doesn't shy away from politics and how it's used is so relevant to todays time, and it also doesn't shy away from the manipulation of politics and manipulation of power and Messiah like figures. It dives deep into religion and It's not afraid to show how it affects the characters.\n\nThere truly is so much that happens in this film and it's done almost perfectly. I can't think of a flaw. I sat through the whole credits roll and I never do that. I was just speechless with this film. The third act is of the likes of The Two Towers, of the likes of Empire Strikes Back!.\n\nNone of this would've been achieved without Denis Villeneuve, this man is putting together a resume that stands up to some of the greatest film makers to ever do it! His direction in this film is sublime there's a scene towards the end, where they specifically choose not to use the score and you feel the intensity of the fight on screen and it's powerful.\n\nA euphoric experience, a once in a lifetime theatrical experience, A film that isn't afraid to touch on subjects that some would consider taboo, it's simply a masterpiece through and through."

I really think this movie is amazing in every aspect.\n\nStarting with the world building, this was my favorite aspect from the first movie, and this movie builds further on that in such excellence, and in combination with the astounding cinematography I really felt like I was there on arrakis. You will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating. I'm still in shock and I want to go back.\n\nAll the performance are also so good. The story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great, especially Austin Butler! His performance makes his character truely scary, such a good villain. Timothee Chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things Paul is going thru this movie, which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold. The same goes for all the other actors, I just can't say there was a lesser performance, everyone really gave there all and it shows!\n\nAlso, the score is (again) incredibly good! Hans Zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie, which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher level.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, it starts slower, but that's a good thing. It needs that, so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes I have ever seen! I'm really still in awe, and I could keep talking about how great everything is, but believe me, just watch the movie. Go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it. You will be blown away, this is really one of the best films of the generation. Thank you, Dennis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this movie, and I'll eagerly be waiting for Dune: Messiah!\n\nLong live the fighters!\n\n100/100."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released. While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing \"special\" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for \"best sci fi film of all time\" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.\n\nDefinitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the \"goat\" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.\n\nAgain, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol.\n\nUnlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...! Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP. In my book, that's the TRUE definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went in with high expectations and they were surpassed. Saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser. Sound design/score and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way I've never experienced. I'm at a bit of a loss for words other than generational, masterpiece, theatrical cinematic experience like nothing I've witnessed before. Loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material. What's so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation. You experience the story from the mind of the character. In the film, the dialogue is there to support the film, which is primary here. The visuals, the cinematography, the sound, the score are all the story, and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that. It's so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story.\n\nWell done. Still riding the high. It will take something truly special to replace this as my new #1."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll precursor this by saying 1) I have not read the books 2) I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan 3) I found part one underwhelming.\n\nWhile I find there to be many issues with this film, perhaps its biggest weakness imo is that I hold no emotional connection with any of the characters, despite the film's lengthy runtime. The protagonist's mother is written as incredibly annoying, the villains are underused, Florence Pugh's character has 0 likability and acts simply as a story device. Bardem's character is OK and funny at times and Brolin doesn't have a standout moment. Zendaya's character is the sole exception to this, who is the beating heart of the film.\n\nAt times, I also felt that Chalamet, despite being an amazing actor, is perhaps miscast, though having not read the material, I cannot comment further on this.\n\nThe pacing felt off, as it stays too long in places it shouldn't, while sacrificing moments that could linger longer. This coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films. The movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats. The direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earned.\n\nPerhaps the second biggest issue is that I do not totally buy into the world that has been created. It feels large but empty and lacking character. Almost too clean and strange for the sake of it. Style over substance. We stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesn't help. There were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the film.\n\nWith that said, there are a couple of epic moments that stood out, which are 1) the whole Zendaya bazooka scene and 2) the giant worm riding.\n\nOverall, the film is enjoyable. However without engaging characters, a believable world, and pacing issues, the film falls short of greatness, perhaps way short."

The Soundtrack will leave you a heart full of emotions when you leave the theatre. It doesn't fail to deliver the universe it promised.\n\nDune-I was just the staircase.

        "review_detailed_main": "A love story to the original trilogy.\n\nThis is how you make a movie out of a book, for all future movie makers out there. While there are divergencies from the books, it thematically follows and still captures the heart of the corruption of power, religion, ecological transformation, ethics, war and violence that Frank Herbert played on in his masterpiece. The multiple shots, sometimes only a few seconds, that paid tribute to conversations and interplay within the books was excellent. I wish they had had time to include the full story given how beautifully choregraphed each scene is, but its already almost 3 hours and somethings just have to be cut.\n\nIt impressively does all this while still spending enough time on character building and capturing the \"plan within a plan within a plan.\" Just well done, I hope there will be an extended trilogy cut in the future. Perhaps someone will even make the sequels/prequels in the future."

        "review_title": "Absolutely outstanding!",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here. A big thank you to AMC Theatres and WB for the opportunity to experience this in IMAX tonight. I highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience. I'm already looking forward to watching this again. Great flick!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Contrasts with Marvel and Star Wars in that it takes itself completely seriously. There is no humor, which allows the intensity to build and lets the world building be immersive. Similar in some ways to Batman movies like The Batman or The Dark Knight.\n\nIt was a nice experience, I gave it a 10 because asking for more from a movie is unreasonable.\n\nVery fast paced, similar to Infinity War, full of action. There isn't much in the way of day to day scenes. At 2:45 hr I don't see any way around that in 1 movie.\n\nThe Chosen One motif seems well suited to cinema since it allows telling a big story while following one man, but it's definitely disconnected from reality."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought Dune: Part 1 was amazing, but Denis Villeneuve cranked out a masterpiece with Part 2! Every moment was spellbinding, the cinematography epic, the acting authentic, and the world building was astonishing.\n\nThey made changes form the book, sure, but the changes they made fit in with the tone of the narrative. Zendaya's Chani is strong yet feminine, and you feel both her growth and her struggle throughout the film. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet shines as Paul, he conveys a quiet strength throughout the film, and you believe his struggles as well as his ascent to leadership, he earns it and owns it. The rest of the cast brings their best to the film, every character feels well lived-in.\n\nThe film is truly visually breathtaking, so many wonderful directing choices. I love that Villeneuve allows us to linger in scenes, to extend the feeling of each world as you visit them. You feel like you have a sense for the Dune universe simply though the visual and sound spaces.\n\nHollywood, this is what we want. Heroic Masculine and Feminine characters, good writing and pacing, authenticity. This is how you do it right, Dune should be a guidebook for the rest of the industry."
