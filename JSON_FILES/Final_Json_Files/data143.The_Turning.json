She is constantly harassed by Flora's older brother Miles (Finn Wolfhard). Caretaker Mrs. Grose (Barbara Marten) tells her that Flora is haunted by the death of her parents.\n\nThis sets up a good moody horror and it has some good actors. After setting everything up, the plot basically stops moving and developing. It feels stuck in place and the story becomes a muddle. Then the movie truly stops in a confused abrupt ending. The style is like an old horror ghost story which is intriguing. If only, the story would flow better than this."

Unfortunately, \"The Turning\" is a poor remake of \"The Innocents\" without any explanation of the original story. The conclusion is ridiculous (or inexistent) and never provides the ambiguity of the original film to the viewer. The performances are not bad but the screenplay is terrible and forgettable. If the viewer seeks out an explanation for the story, reads the plot and reviews of the original film to understand the plot. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Os Orf\u00e3os\" (\"The Orphans\")\n\nNote: On 11 December 2024, I saw this film again."

So I expected to enjoy this update on The Turn of the Screw. I did not enjoy it, I'm sad to report. There was too little story or suspense to hold one's attention throughout, and that's a shame.\n\nThe cast certainly did their jobs -- Finn Wolfhard is no longer the nerdy little kid, and Mackenzie Davis was convincing in her role as a driven-to-the-edge tutor -- and it was visually beautiful throughout a lot of the film. But early jump scares suck a lot of the suspense out of it all. And a distinct lack of backstory/characterization leaves way too many questions about what, exactly, there is to be afraid of in the giant, creaky house. The little girl's fears are left unexplained, at least in terms of being satisfactory; the huge personality shift in the boy is sort of waved away; and the many unexplained deaths in the history of the estate are just confusing. I kept wondering if cuts had been made to the script or in the editing room, because things didn't flow at all and it really affected the atmosphere.\n\nThe ending will drive a lot of viewers to yell at the screen. Our half-full opening night theatre did a lot of groaning and saying, \"You've got to be kidding me!\" as the credits suddenly began to roll. Maybe that finale would've worked better had everything leading up to it actually added up to more...but unless we get a Director's Cut we'll never know. I wish I could recommend this movie. I can't. Not scary, nonsensical, and not enough to be worth the price of admission. -HV"

Heavily dependent on the overused, stereotypical, music & sound effects to startle you. Yawn. The usual ghostly apparitions in mirrors, windows, and in background. Very uncreative, and cheap looking. The usual isolated mansion/house w/lots of rooms w/stuff, and usual dark basement. And, a maze garden. A brief scene of a creepy tree which had no bearing on anything. Supposedly scary scenes in which our future victim has portending nightmares, and of course we don't know they're just dreams. Future victim, unfortunately in this genre is female, does not respond intelligently to what's going on. Ending, and alternative ending which was worse, was one of those \"viewer decides\" could be anything."

While I wouldn't go anywhere near as far as to say I loved 'The Turning', or even that is remotely without fault, I would suggest that an IMDb score of 3.7/10 is a crime.\n\nThe film is based on the novella 'The Turning of the Screw' which I have never read, nor seen any adaptions of. So this was all new to me. The opening scene in the movie is pretty weak and doesn't get things off to a good start. I say it was weak only because it cuts off so abruptly. It was actually building quite nicely to that point. The opening scene of a horror movie is incredibly important to set the tone for what is to come, so I wish they had extended this a little and made it have more of an impact.\n\nThen early on in the film came a jump-scare that completely caught me off-guard and gave me a genuine jolt. It's very rare that a jump-scare catches me by surprise any more, so I have to give the film props for that. Then in the next 5 minutes of runtime they tried about 3-4 more jump scares (a truly odd little cluster of them) and obviously they had no impact because the audience is ready and waiting for them by that point. A little bit of inexperience perhaps showing through from director Floria Sigismondi.\n\nSomething that really surprised me in this film was the quality of the acting. I make no secret of the fact that I find 95% of child actors very annoying to watch. This film had two of them, Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince, and both were extremely easy to watch. Take into consideration that the characters they were playing were supposed to be unlikeable and annoying and that makes it even more impressive. Also Mackenzie Davis in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. This is one of the stronger acted horror movies I have seen in recent times.\n\nThere is a good atmosphere maintained throughout the film, and it all builds towards the ending. I loved the ending. People seem to hate it from what I'm reading, but for me it was the strongest point of the film. It requires some thinking (I had to go back and watch it again to make sure I had it right) but all the clues are there if you're willing to look hard enough. I think people just don't want to think. They want everything handed to them on a silver spoon.\n\nIt annoys me when audiences hate horror films that try to mix up the formula and do something different, because that is the reason we keep getting the same old stuff over and over again. You can't complain about every horror movie being the same old thing, but then hate on any movie that tries to do something unique as well. I enjoyed 'The Turning' and would recommend it."

Dont waste your money. If you really want to see it, wait till it comes out on redbox. But be warned, you will be bored of this film. Its not even scary.

        "review_detailed_main": "I buy a lot of movies. Many of them I buy \"blind\" having no experience with the film or real knowledge of it. Tuesday just comes around and brings new things and I can't help myself. Well, worth COVID effectively halting that I've been going back and picking up ones I missed. I can honestly say that I have been blown away by how good some of these are and disappointed with a fair amount as well. I just take that as the risk, the gamble in buying blind.\n\nAll that to say that not one time have I bought a movie, watched it and then immediately wanted both my time and my money back, until The Turning. What a wretchedly awful experience this was. So let's just rip this band aid off and get into it.\n\nThis movie has no real plot. No real narrative structure. No character development or growth. No context for the who, what, where, why or how. Things are introduced once as though they're important and then never mentioned again FREQUENTLY. The acting is underwhelming. The atmosphere is there but not strong enough because they never take the time to establish ANYTHING so I don't care about ANYTHING.\n\nNow, it's only about an hour and a half long, so you might think that's good. Problem is it feels like it takes forever. I was halfway through this and still waiting for the movie to movie at all. The cherry on top is the (no spoilers) atrocious non-ending that explains nothing and feels like they just suddenly ran out of film and decided to call it quits. Only for the credits to feature this nonsense of a hand on a wall that reminds us this was directed by someone that primarily makes music videos and suddenly things make sense. In music videos you don't need a plot or a story or anything to make any sense at all, I just wish someone at some point in this things production would have nudged her and said, \"Hey, you know this is supposed to be a movie, right? We don't start the Taylor Swift video until NEXT week.\" Seriously, why was there nobody on set for this asking what in the world was happening?\n\nAlso, maybe this is more a personal peeve, but this is another horror movie trying to use mental illness as an easy button and it seriously annoys me. Just because someone has mental illness in there family does NOT mean they are going to go crazy and kill people and this rhetoric that horror movies push is offensive and insensitive to those struggling with their own mental health and the anxiety of what others will think if it's found out. It's 2020 now, let's try a different angle.\n\nThe not quite so bad is that if you're unfortunate enough to have wasted money on the blu-ray, like this dummy did, you may be treated to a few deleted scenes and an alternate ending. These do help flesh things out a bit, giving more context and clarity as to what's happening but are still a pretty muddled mess that point to a lack of oversight and cohesion on set and behind the camera. To be clear, these added scenes do NOT make this thing good or the blu-ray worth buying.\n\nAs for the good... Uh... It looks pretty sometimes? There's an attempt at atmosphere here but again, with no context for ANYTHING it doesn't matter how spooky a shot is because I. Don't. Care. Not about a single thing happening.\n\nFinal thoughts? This is absolute garbage. I'd like the 96+ minutes of my life back, along with the $25 I wasted and a letter of apology from everyone involved. This is absolutely one of the worst things I've seen in a long time and I will actively discourage anyone and everyone from seeing it.\n\nUgh."

It nails the proven formula of anticipation and jump scares.\n\nThe main disappointment is the ending that leaves only questions. After more than an hour of buildup, the director does not offer resolution for the characters or an explanation of what has been transpiring. The intentionally cryptic ending is the director's unapologetic take on the source material. Unfortunately, the extreme level of ambiguity is not an audience pleaser. The story would have been better served if the conclusion offered more subtle feelings of unease or doubt.\n\nHalf the theater was talking after the credits trying to figure out what had happened in the last 20 minutes.\n\nIt was entertaining enough to watch, but The Turning is a middling horror movie.\n\n6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Harnessing a large majority of talent, potential, and an interesting setting- The Turning unfortunately has no clear idea on how to handle its own material, and no idea how to manage its own story. I will stop and say, that even though the script of the film is very messy and confusing, I did feel the actors did their best with the material provided. Mackenzie Davis provided a good performance for the lead, even though her character was oddly mysterious and vague for no apparent reason. Finn Wolfhard, Brooklynn Prince, and Barbara Marten also give the best they can to their performances, but unfortunately they fall more victim to the script than they deserved. The film, simply stated, is a mess. It has no clue which direction it wants to take, and instead provides a vague sense of plot, story, and elements, to get by as a film at all. It's often predictable with its scares, full of various cliches, and its writing is often nonsensical and incredibly random, even impulsive. It does have a very interesting premise, and can be interesting to follow at times, but eventually the struggle to watch the film and comprehend it seems far from worth it, and I can definitely see why so many people gave up watching this film, let alone making it into anything worth watching. The editing is horrendous in this film, and possibly why the reason it suffers most. It's ending, as noted by anyone that has seen this film and written a review on it, is quite vague and honestly pretty terrible. It feels lazy, forced, and honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I can see that they struggled with this film, and I almost feel bad for the production team making it, but it is no excuse for the sloppy mess that it ended up turning into (no pun intended). I do adore the look of the film, and some of the atmosphere, but ultimately a compelling setting does not make a compelling film, and it was dissapointing to see the film unfold into such a case. In the end, The Turning is not a total waste of time, but a large waste of talent and opportunity. Here's hoping that Mike Flanagan's series adaptation later this year will do the story justice. My Rating: 4.5/10"

I, myself, didn't think it ended abruptly and I really don't have many questions after watching. Whether or not you like this movie may depend on what type of horror you like. If you like ghost stories with lots of jump scares, this is the movie for you. However, if that's not your thing, maybe don't judge the movie so hard.

A modern take on Henry James' novella \"The Turn of the Screw\"\n\nThis film was panned by critics severely..... I however found a lot of promise here,despite the convoluted W.T.F. ending. I enjoyed \"The Turning\". The Turning isn't a complete disaster. The cinematography is really well done, there's some nice camera work here and the long, drawn out scenes with the kids to open the film does add an unsettling air of uneasiness to a lot of the artsy imagery. It's helped further by the musical score too which is fantastic, doing a wonderful job of building up to scares. One rather important beef, \u00b7 bellyache, complain, \u00b7 crab, \u00b7 croak, \u00b7 gripe, \u00b7 grouse, ...\n\nSigismondi's version relies heavily on lazy jump scares, they are somewhat effective but this film could have risen to \"rarefied air\" if Sigismondi had chosen to communicate the fright visually with a Classically surreal style of psychological horror akin to 1961 The Innocents to deliver fright sequences . I also must be clear the film had such moody, stylish slice of old-fashioned Gothic atmospheric cinematography that ultimately it delivers.\n\ncinematographer David Ungaro creates a terrific atmosphere in and around the stately house. From the chilly but livable grounds, there's a beautiful hedge maze that seems easy to get lost in, a stable of horses, and a koi pond . Inside, there's an indoor arboretum with headless dolls in a bird bath; a creepy sewing room, made creepier with a human-sized mannequin of an old maid; and hidden hallways. The set design is lavish, dripping ambiance and production value.\n\nThe acting is first rate .Mackenzie Davis (Tully 2018) sells her performance with warmth and backbone. Davis is quite good, conveying Kate's descent into madness as her restless, nightmare-laden nights worsen and her entire demeanor gradually changes over the course of the film. She might be overwhelmed and seeing things that aren't there, but no matter the real answer, her disorienting confusion is shared by the viewer. Brooklyn Prince (2017's \"The Florida Project\") and Finn Wolfhard (2017's \"It\") are both unnerving in their own way, the former playing Flora as a playful innocent and the latter playing Miles as a disturbed adolescent, and Barbara Marten is quietly chilling as the cold Mrs. Grose.\n\nThe ending of the film . A little bit of ambiguity that leaves the audience to interpret the rest can be a pitch-perfect way to end a film. In the case of \"The Turning,\" it doesn't end so much as stop with an abrupt shrug. Does a film live or die on an unsatisfying wrap-up, rendering everything that's good about it all for naught? To me absolutely not. \"The Turning\" proves that there can still be enough to like for most of its run time. See \"The Turning\" For its Art House sensibilities , it's excellent Acting and Cinematography. 7/10\n\nDirector: Floria Sigismondi Writers: Carey W. Hayes (as Carey Hayes), Chad Hayes Stars: Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, Brooklynn Prince 7/10"

When I saw the credits roll, I was literally like \"wait, that's IT?\"\n\nOnto the positives, I really liked the clothing used for this film. It really gives a nice 90's feel. The aesthetic of the film was also very beautiful and almost ethereal in a way.\n\nAlso, I wanted to talk about how fantastic Finn Wolfhard was. His acting was the highlight of this movie for me. He is already so talented at such a young age, I can really see him becoming one of the Hollywood legends who are hired in every film when he grows up. This was my first time seeing him in a role where he played an antagonistic, sociopathic character and he absolutely blew me away with how great he was. He has such an amazing range and I'm really excited to see more of him in the future. Hopefully he goes on to film movies that have a much better script.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend anyone see this movie unless you're seeing it for free or you don't mind movies that have confusing endings. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a lower rating is because Finn Wolfhard really impressed me with his incredible acting ability."

The Innocents (1961) and The Turn of the Screw (1992) were great British versions. The 1985 Spanish version was good with a controversy script about male homosexuality around this ghost story, meanwhile the 2006 American version was a decent version using a lesbian theme. Now this 2020 version, a co-production between The United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and The United States is a very weak film. The gothic atmosphere is perfect like Henry James described it in his novel. The cinematography is cool and creepy, the locations are wonderful and the cast is great too. Davis is so lovely playing Kate. Even the film is a decent adaptation but something went missing almost the last minutes. The horror or psychological horror is a second element because the film works as a drama. The soundtrack is terrific, specially at the end credits. Could be a better film."

She gave easily the best performance in the movie and stole the show in most of her scenes.\n\nNow the rest of the movie... well it was a pretty terrible. The first 2 acts of the film is just filled with cheap unearned jump scare scenes one after another and really starts to wear you out. None of the scares really landed and as I said they were rushed and unearned.\n\nAnd the ending, oh boy the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but it was bad. Very bad it didn't make any sense and it left me feeling empty after the film.\n\nThere is much more I could go into but that would dive into spoilers so I'll just leave it at that.

The story wasn't hard to follow (like I've seen some other reviewers saying) and it didn't feel like a waste of time.

To make things even worse, the ending plot didn't make any sense whatsoever. It felt disconnected from the movie, almost like someone else wrote it after just reading some catchwords, OR the ending was rushed and not well thought out.

The ending isn't very clear and the rest of the movie doesn't make it very easy to interpret. The problem is that the ending tries to be more intelligent than the actual movie. The movie itself plays out pretty straight without beefing up the story very much.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say they have tried to compromise between making a generic scary movie and more of a drama movie and ended up with a mess. It felt like some scenes have been made scarier in post just to speed things up, like quite early in the movie when the new teacher goes to the horse stable to look for the girl, it's made really creepy with music etc even tho there shouldn't be any reason to be scared at that point. There are also scenes that make no sense nor are explained (the east wing, mannequins..) and whatever the relationship was between the boy and the riding teacher was left really vague, leaving the boys actions a mystery. Actually there really is no proper story told here, just randomish events leading to randomish end.\n\nThe movie was surprisingly fun to watch tho, but ultimately not very rewarding. Had they built up the ending with better care and focus it would have been a real winner. My guess is that this is not the directors vision nor cut, but rather producers wanting a more crowd pleasing cut, ultimately failing at it. But that's just a guess.\n\nActing and cinematography are great, the girl is quite funny as she's much more naturally \"kid\" than kids often are in horror movies, like she was just being herself and not acting at all. At first it felt a bit off, but there are enough horror movies with serious kids acting like grown ups. The girl as a character is surprisingly meaningless tho, now that I think about it."

Perhaps too many jump shocks, some of which are inserted for no discernible purpose as they don't advance the narrative. It's the non-supernatural which work best, an angry horse and a trapdoor spider. MacKenzie Davis is good as the new governess Kate and it's not really her fault that the script makes her ignore all of the warnings. Even a Terminator would have difficulties with the children, Brooklynn Prince as Flora cuts the heads off dolls and takes advice from a special doll; Finn Wolfhard is Miles, a truculent teen, he likes spiders and knows what Kate dreams about and has a friend who lives in a mirror. Barbara Marten is the creepy housekeeper, Mrs Grose. The house itself is rambling but less so than the screenplay. This is a just about watchable horror film with a confusing ending or perhaps two endings. Directed by Floria Sigismondi from a script by Carey and chad Hayes, adapted from The Turn Of The Screw by Henry James. 5/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? Its been making a buzz for the absolutely wrong reasons. Yes, that ending. I wonder what was going through the filmmakers mind when drafting that ending. I won't say what happened but I must say that ending alone brings the films rating and quality down by a lot. What you get with The Turning is atmospheric nothingness for a full 90 minutes. Only saving grace, are the performances from its actors.\n\nThe film is about a woman who becomes a governess for a child who lives at an estate. Once there she realizes that the girls disturbed older brother is also back from boarding school. Soon she starts realizing that the children are not what they seem and that there is a ghostly presence in the house related to the wicked former horse riding instructor who stayed at the house. The woman is curious to find out more about all this while protecting the young girl she is tasked to serve.\n\nThe best part of the film is definitely the acting of Mackenzie Davis and especially Brooklynn Prince. Prince was tremendous in The Florida Project and she brought a lively energy to this film, and it was needed. Finn Wolfhard is plain annoying in this film and is now in that annoying teenager phase of life. The film opens with the announcement of the death of Kurt Cobain because? The film falls for the usual horror trope pitfalls that plague films today. Jump scares that are so predictable and just not scary. A plot that brings up different issues vaguely but fails to focus on any of it. Above all, the worst offender is the ending.\n\nThe ending was heading in a decent direction before doing a fake out that made absolutely no sense. I could hear the theater become perplexed. After that, guess what? Another twist! Not only that but then it fades to black extremely abruptly. I don't know how they came to this conclusion or what the artistic merit to it might have been but it was resoundingly awful. A mediocre horror film at best made infinitely worst by its ridiculously stupid ending.\n\n4/10"

        "review_title": "Fantasy Island is absurd, but The Turning doesn't even have an ending...",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nI... am... in shock. The Turning had tons of development issues, switching directors (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was the first choice), cast, producers (Steven Spielberg was once responsible for the project), and who knows what else. It's yet another adaptation of the famous ghost story, Turn of the Screw by Henry James, so it was always going to be a challenging task to bring a horror flick with something unique that the others didn't possess. After so many changes, the film finally decided on Mackenzie Davis as the adult protagonist, and Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince as the young kids.\n\nThey replaced everything and everyone, except the people who are behind the main reason why this movie fails so miserably: the screenwriters. With all due respect to the Hayes brothers, but this is the worst kind of a bad film. It doesn't have a single redeemable quality about it. It's a movie about... nothing! It has no message, no purpose, no structure, and last but not least: there's no ending. I'm not joking, The Turning doesn't have an ending. It's like someone abruptly shouts \"roll credits\" way before any sort of payoff is delivered.\n\nThe whole film is a collection of repetitive, dull scenes that only vary in location. Scareless and predictable jump scare sequences spread throughout the entire runtime with no meaning or objective underneath. Close to ninety minutes of build-up to utterly nothing. This isn't one of those cases where the ending is just ambiguous, and people can interpret it in several ways. As baffling as it might sound, this monotonous, cliche, boring horror movie doesn't possess an ending. I have to repeat it, so you actually believe what I'm writing.\n\nEven if I simply ignore that last (nonexistent) act, the rest of the film is still awful. As the viewer, knowing more than the main character about what's happening or what's about to unravel is almost always a lousy aspect concerning the horror genre. Not only there's a lack of a scary or eerie environment, but the narrative raises dozens of logical questions that eventually get no answer. The movie actually starts reasonably okay, it got me slightly invested in Davis' character, but it quickly becomes one of the most yawning-inducing experiences I've had this year.\n\nUsually, I can turn to the acting to help me get through the hardest portions of the film. However, Mackenzie Davis (who I liked a lot in Terminator: Dark Fate) gradually starts to become uninteresting, and Finn Wolfhard delivers the worst performance I've ever seen from him. Brooklynn Prince is good for her age, but she's still a 9-year-old kid, so... you know. Barbara Marten is probably the best as Mrs. Grose, but just like the movie itself, she has no real impact on anything. Technically, the score is weird, and instead of elevating the scary sequences, it turns them into a rock concert. The editing also lacks consistency.\n\nHonestly, I thought that Fantasy Island was a safe bet for the \"Worst Movie of 2020\" prize, but The Turning just entered the race. As logically absurd as the former might be, at least it has an ending. It's a ridiculous one, but it's, in fact, an ending. The latter not only lacks a payoff to the ninety minutes of build-up, but it has absolutely no redeeming quality. Describing a film in a one-word sentence was never this easy: \"nothing\". It's a movie about nothing! No meaning, no message, no purpose, no logical sense. An extremely boring journey through a mansion with predictable jump scares, an awkward score, and disappointing acting. It's an emotionless story packed with unanswered questions, and no, it's not one of those \"ambiguous narrative\" cases. I definitely don't recommend it, unless you desire that frustration of watching an incomplete film.\n\nRating: F"

The book and original movie (the innocence) do very well at not making it clear if the nanny has gone mad or if the house/children are possessed. The Turning removes that wonderment at the end, but does so in a way that you become disappointed with the result instead of wanting more. So, not a bad film and it certainly deserves a higher rating, but if you were to compare it to its predecessors, it will likely be ranked the poorest."

I was able to feel for the main character Kate (Mackenzie Davis) and the struggles she has to go through thoughtout, although I think the scenes where she's just wandering about get excessive. Miles is my favorite part of the film, Finn Wolfhard does a great job at a more intimidating and chilling role. I also have a feeling young Brooklynn Prince, who plays Flora, has a bright career as an actress ahead of her. Mrs. Grose is played well by Barbara Marten, but her character is really bland, I didn't know what to think of her during the film or after it.\n\nAs far as the film itself, I'm still wondering nearly 24 hours after watching what it was trying to do. I love that the film takes place in the 90's, and the sets look really nice, but what a strange ride this film goes on. When the credits began to role, a number of people (including myself) threw their hands up at the screen, exclaiming \"what\"? Not only is it difficult to follow, the film isn't very scary. It's more of a Thriller that relies on jump scares to technically make it a \"Horror\". I guess maybe if you have a fear of spiders, you might get a scare, but otherwise, disturbed is about all you'll be.\n\nI can also give credit for a couple of scenes involving the gate to the house. I wouldn't call them scary, but definitely intense, and I was able to feel for the characters involved.\n\nA few decent things about The Turning, but as a whole, I didn't know where it was going and it ended before I could figure it out. It's like an album with only one or two good songs on it. Kinda disappointing. Perhaps the book has more answers?"

Nothing happens, we don't move the story along until the very end and when that happens we get quite possibly the worst movie ending in a while. The ending somehow made an awful movie even worse. The only things that I can recommend is Brooklynn Princes amazing performance, she's so talented and plays her part very well, and some of the gothic imagery looking very pretty. It's an awful movie. Skip it"

Nothing was unique. It was so unoriginal and so boring. This movie was absolutely horrible. I left the theater so confused. The only time I enjoyed this movie was when I was laughing at how stupid it was. The script was terrible and felt so forced. Brooklynn Prince was absolutely amazing in The Florida Project, she isn't bad at acting. Finn was great in It(the movie) and is great in Stranger Things. When it comes down to it, they couldn't do anything with that script. This movie did both of them so dirty. Don't waste your time watching this movie. It is 94 minutes of your life you will never get back."

        "review_detailed_main": "(1 out of 5 stars)\n\nThe Turning is a horrible supernatural horror film that lacks scares, plot, and the acting was dull. It's one of those supernatural horror movies that delivers the same similar premises. Governess played by Mackenzie Davis goes to an estate. To accompany a little girl there. And her older brother. The older brother is rude and creepy. While, there is some ghostly figure that she is trying to discover. Or unless it's her own delusions.\n\nThe concept is boring. Seeing a character wonder an old house. With something lurking in the shadows or reflections in the mirrors. Almost similar to the woman in black movie. But this films story is just terrible. Mackenzie Davis character mother suffers from a condition which not much is discussed with the movie. Besides, she is questioning her reality if it's real or all in her head. The ending is one of the worst endings ever which there is a twist. But a twist that lacks logic and it does not make any sense. May confuse the audience than deliver a spine chilling ending.\n\nThe script and direction is horrible. It's a slow moving script. With boring characters. Mackenzie Davis is the only best thing in the movie. But even her character is dull. The acting is tedious. The direction tries for a lot of jump scares but fails at it. Cause it foreshadows for the predictable scares.\n\nOverall, The Turning is one of the worst films ever. Boring acting. Boring direction. Dumb story. And a twist that leaves you feeling like you just wasted time watching this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure what these low reviewers expect, maybe they are just too used to modern blood and gore horror movies, but I thought this was a worthy adaptation. Creepy and atmospheric the cast does a good job to maintain the suspense. Kate, the central character, is hired to care for a child in a remote stately but spooky house inhabited by only the house keeper and young Flora, or so she thinks. Her elder brother Miles is away at boarding school but soon returns home and trouble ensues. The actors playing Miles and Flora do a great job at 'playing' the two rather spoilt charges - entitled children who have been raised by paid staff after the death of their parents and Barbara Marten as Mrs Grose the the epitome of the tightly wound classic Governess who thinks the children can do no wrong. For a story that was written in the nineteenth century I thought director Floria Sigismondi did a great job at giving it a modern touch without taking it too far from the original's essence. Sure, it's not a movie for everyone but if you like spooky, ghostly tales set in grand surroundings with the gradual suffocating revelation of what the unknown central character has walked into give it a go. It is not the flop others have made it out to be."

When this film came out I read the reviews and they were absolutely atrocious! Scoring only an 11% on rotten tomatoes, I was horrified so I skipped it. Later on obviously I saw it, but only because I recently saw another terribly reviewed horror movie \"Brahms: The Boy II\" and I didn't understand the atrocious reviews I honestly thought it was better than the first. Anyway I bought the Blu-ray on amazon only $10 good deal. I was throughly impressed. The acting from everyone is great. It is absolutely beautifully shot. It kept my interests nothing seemed to be wrong on my viewing, this is just how I felt. Yes the ending was abrupt but it didn't make the film horrible. I feel that so many of the 2020 horror movies released between January-March were badly reviewed. I enjoyed it and that's why I am writing this review. I do recommend going with an open mind because lately critics have been wrong about films such as US, The Lodge, and so forth I didn't like those I was immensely disappointed with US especially so I trust my gut and my viewing of films."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie had great potential, my guess is they were in a rush to get it released. The performances were perfectly adequate, the sets were too, but something just kept it all from becoming a successful MIX.\n\nMost likely studio heads butted in and caused it to be hurried and harried, who knows? But had the movie makers been allowed time to make the effort to make appropriate cuts and craft this movie in the way it should have been, it could have been GREAT! It simply wasn't. Watchable, yes. Great, unfortunately not.\n\nThis is an updated remake of Henry James', \"Turn of the Screw\" which has several movie incarnations already. In this version, they're attempting to make statements about mental illness, and it's a shame they missed the mark so completely. There is nothing overtly frightening in this, it's more psychological in its scares, and would have been a wonderful way to broach the subject of mental illness too, but alas, they failed.\n\nStill, the movie is worth a look, if you like grand old homes and their grounds and snooty housekeepers, and Hellion THOROUGHBREDS disguised as children being cared for by incompetent governesses."

A young nanny takes a job to look after a couple of orphaned entitled spoilt brats (not original) in a rundown mansion estate where a series of not scary at all events take place to frighten her to near death, to be honest I thought she would be scared of her own shadow at one point! because she seemed to jump at every minor thing going on in the house.

Except they did it better.\n\nThis has really bad acting and relies on really cliched scares movies from 40 years ago did better (e.g. Humanoid mannequins moving). I know it sounds cool but it ain't... It's just an actual mannequin in one scene, and OBVIOUSLY a woman in makeup in the other, turning her head. Which reminds me - I forgot to mention the few \"effects\" there are, are bad also.\n\nBut hey, it's not all bad. Finn Wolfhard is as great as ever, and the woman playing the creepy housekeeper is perfect for that role. The rest of the cast is either terrible or aggressively generic. And as generic as the whole movie is, it does pick up steam halfway through, albeit with shallow jumpscares with no substance. It's so generic, in fact, that at one point the little hand from The Addams Family shows up for a pointless jumpscare... Nothing makes sense. The house is haunted - go wild, I guess. Eh...\n\nAnd the ending was kinda cool. In fact, the most original thing about this movie. So, for having the balls to at least change that up - 5/10."

I'm almost forced to assume there was more and it just got cut to pieces because the director, looking at her IMDB, is more known for music videos, which not necessarily story based. I'd never seen anything from this director, so I have to place the blame there.\n\nShe's given us a jumbled mess that makes no sense. As the title says, we have a bunch of bricks, but we have no house. I do enjoy ambiguous film, if done well (ie, Inception, The Haunting (1963), The Shining). This story, the way it's presented to us here, does not leave very much to the imagination, explains things very badly, and then gives us an extremely ambiguous ending.\n\nThis is a head-scratcher, but not in the good way where you want to watch the film again and again.

In a way it took me by surprise because at quite a few points I thought it may plummet into a CGI demon or zombie creature chasing around a mansion with a huge blood drenched chainsaw as is a lot of the drivel dumped on us. That is not a spoiler, maybe a warning to potential viewers that isn't what you are going to get.

In its many adaptations, it has been atmospheric, and scary, with overtones of inappropriate activities.\n\nNot so this adaptation, which, for some reason, the producers decided to call The Turning. And they transported this quintessential English story to Maine, which already is a no-no for me, even though it is actually filmed in Ireland. Go figure.\n\nOther adaptations have suggested more sexual elements with suggestions of incestuous intentions to make it more creepy. There have certainly been more elements of the children being possessed by the ghosts of Jessel and Quint so they can be together, physically, which is believable and creepy when Flora is a twelve-year-old. When the girl is only seven (played by a nine-year-old) this is obviously off the table, thus removing a crucial aspect of Quint's depravity.\n\nAnd what about that less-than-satisfactory ending? I have no words.\n\nThe saving grace is Brooklyn Prince who, for a nine-year-old, plays a blinder. Totally believable and an absolute delight to watch, in a not-creepy way. We'll see a lot more of her in the future.\n\nFinn Wolfhard was suitably sinister as Miles and also a face we'll see again, I'm sure.\n\nBut for the acting from those kids, this would have merited one star only."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ok, so the fabulous manor house is the only clear winner in this film - beautiful, eery, odd corridors and you can never go wrong with a dark room full of mannequins. The four main actors are actually all very good but sadly the script they have to work with is awful and the direction not much better. The film is peppered full of set pieces that often seem crow-barred into the story and usually fail to impress despite starting well.\n\nI think the key problem of the script is that the main character, the live-in teacher for the youngest of two orphaned children living, never really behaves like a teacher, or even a adult - often coming across more like a disgruntled babysitter - and there is never a set up of any normal relationship with the youngest child. Everything starts odd and only gets a little bit odder. In fact I think that's it. It's a film where none of the relationships - even with supernatural characters - seem real or complete. So many story threads and nothing really ties very well. By the end you wonder how many more dream sequences are to come and is any of this really going to be explained.\n\nSo does it even work an a pure jump scare horror movie? Well the house and the darkness set up some high expectation but you never really get the feeling there is any real threat. One sequence has all the terror of an Adam's family reunion (you'll know the bit when you see it) and the final piece has the sort of effects you expect to see in an afternoon TV movie. So nope, sorry.\n\nWhich brings us to the end of the movie. Ok no spoilers, but it's safe to say that it feels as though they never really had an idea how to end this film. So the \"Oh, for f*** sake\" ending, which looks like it was made up of left over footage, leaves you feeling like you came back into the the wrong theatre after your toilet break.\n\nIn short, this is not a great movie. Even a good cast couldn't save a poor script and the inability of the director to make the most, or anything, out of those potentially scary moments. I did quite like the songs used in the original soundtrack though."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Turning (2020) is based on the book The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. As of the time of this review, I have not read the novella, but it is on my to-do list. This review focuses solely on the film experience.\n\nIn The Turning, the plot involves Kate and the brothers Miles and Flora Fairchild, orphans who live in a secluded mansion far from society. Kate accepted the position of housekeeper as the former housekeeper tragically died. The Fairchild brothers' parents also tragically died. Hum...\n\nThe plot is monotonous for a while. The presentation involves a series of expositions that should lead to the main complication, but it doesn't. Kate grew up without her parents, but we soon discover that she has a mother who is admitted to the strangest psychiatric hospital of all, after all, what mental hospital would leave its patients inside an empty swimming pool? Flora also doesn't have parents and that's the connection between Kate and her. However, the connection is weak. The movie wants to make it clear that this connection is natural and obvious, but it doesn't work so well.\n\nFlora has psychological problems because of her personal experiences. Her first interaction with Kate feels fake and forced, which leads us to believe that perhaps Flora is questionable. The film doesn't make that clear.\n\nThe film introduces us to the horror element when Flora shows the house to Kate. \"I don't walk around that part of the house,\" Flora says to Kate, referring to the east side of the mansion. The plot does not use this element to develop the story.\n\nMiles quickly steals the show. The plot that seemed to focus so much on Flora and Kate disappears and makes room for Miles and Kate's relationship. Flora, despite being in a poster version of the movie and appearing in several key scenes in the trailers, becomes secondary. This twist causes Kate's interaction with Flora to not gain the strength it should have to justify Kate's subsequent acts.\n\nMiles is the typical troubled son of a tycoon. Spoiled, arrogant, but clearly with internal problems. Kate and Miles' relationship starts off bad and develops into something with little meaning. Miles seems sexually attracted to Kate, but the plot doesn't explore this theme; the plot only focuses on how the children seem to want to disturb Kate with childish but dark games.\n\nAs the plot moves towards the maximum event, I felt that the plot was not plausible for themes we see throughout the movie:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe climax is a sequence of unexplained jumpscares. I understand that scares are cinematic techniques, but it got to the point where there were so many that I was anesthetized.\n\nThe ending made no sense. I know that the intention is precisely to open up for interpretation, but the questions are so many that the interpretation is that this film got convoluted. The existence of an alternate ending makes it clear that the writers didn't know how to connect all the conflicts they generated. The alternate ending is more straightforward, but doesn't do the plot justice.\n\nWhen the movie ended, I felt there were too many holes to ignore. Unnecessary scares, scenes that contradict the outcome, open questions. I wouldn't recommend it, either for the horror factor, which is just a collection of jumpscares, or for the story factor, which ends without much sense."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Mackenzie Davis, and Finn Wolfhard has demonstrated strong capability. I'm less familiar with Brooklynn Prince, but I know she earned praise fro 'The Florida project.' I liked Floria Sigismondi's work on 'The Runaways,' and while I'm unfamiliar with Chad or Carey W. Hayes, I recognize that they have notable experience as writers. I've also watched other adaptation of 'The turn of the screw' and enjoyed them. All these are fine points in the favor of 'The turning' - set against what I recognize as poor reception, and moreover, I recognize there's a dicey record of trying to update period pieces. I'll watch anything, however, and I was ready to give this an earnest try.\n\nIf nothing else is true, this is well made from a technical standpoint. I think Sigismondi's direction is great in terms of building shots and scenes, and the cinematography and editing are quite sharp. The on-site filming location is fantastic, and the work of costume design, and the hair and makeup artists, is rather suitable. The visual effects are also swell, I think, blending seamlessly into the footage. All this is well and good. However, are these the most important aspects of a film? In other regards, I can understand why 'The turning' is regarded so poorly.\n\nMaybe I'm just no longer used to watching horror movies that trifle with cheap jump scares, but there's a massive overabundance here, and they become tiresome quickly. Employed sparingly and fastidiously they can be useful; not like this. The same goes for general \"creepy\" imagery - there are good ideas here, but too many are just thrown at the wall, and as a result 'The turning' feels regrettably common and unexceptional. I either know that the cast is skilled, or at least trust that they are, but in this it seems like they're forced into small corners as the parts are written rather blandly. Mrs. Grose is hopelessly severe, Miles is merely a monster, Floria is a senselessly happy little girl, and lead character Kate is a very standard horror protagonist. I suppose the acting is fine, such as it is, but the ensemble doesn't have much to work with.\n\nWe all know 'The turn of the screw' as a terrific ghost story, and it's been rendered into fine versions in film and TV. At the same time that characters are empty stock material, some of the dialogue and scene writing in this take is plainly contrived. There are robust airs present of supernatural horror, psychological horror, and mystery, but the narrative struggles with all the other elements of the screenplay. And even more to the point, the more that the story ramps up toward major atmosphere, fright, and climactic conflict and character drama, the more it seems terribly overfull, and overly busy - a veritable cacophony of noise both audio and visual, yet without significant substance.\n\nI was prepared to say, up until the last five minutes or so, that I don't think 'The turning' is entirely as bad as popular opinion would hold. Yet those last five or so minutes \"turn\" another corner, and make one realize how ruefully disordered the writing is. When all is said and done it's almost as though this movie lacks major rhyme or reason; it's sad and incredible how the same novel that produced, for example, 1961's 'The innocents,' and outstanding miniseries 'The haunting of Bly Manor,' also resulted in this. Despite everything 'The turning' had going for it, unfortunately it turned out to be a jumbled mess, and falls short in too many ways to earn favor. There are certainly worse movies out there, but when it comes to adaptations of Henry James' classic, maybe not."

The plot twist is where I felt this movie had its biggest flaw. The movie was not perfect prior to it. It used the same tropes a lot of mainstream horror movies have such as setups for jump scares and objects moving even when they don't really contribute to the story. Its 90s references were unnecessary and I barely even noticed them. However, I was actually enjoying the movie. The cast is solid, the little girl was a standout, and the plot became more intriguing as it went along. The movie held my attention and I was never really bored.\n\nAnd then came the plot twist. Its reveal was oddly abrupt and felt rushed. If the movie had rewrites, the twist probably could have been integrated into the plot much better. However, I think the movie would have been just fine without a plot twist because the climax that preceded the plot twist was actually pretty solid and entertaining. It felt as if there was an ending they filmed but they decided to cut it and insert a plot twist before said ending was shown. The plot twist made a lot of the setup and backstory feel pointless.\n\nI did not hate this movie anywhere near as much as a lot of people did but it would have been better if it weren't for its plot twist. The movie had a lot of interesting ideas but they were all let down by the end."

Unfortunately, this is has to be the worst so far. Although I do not object to the present day setting, the story does tend to lose something when it is moved away from its Victorian origins.\n\nOther versions manage to convey something 'other' about the children. In this version, Miles is older and just a bog standard stroppy teenager while Flora is a sweet little homebody. So far, so not terrifying in the slightest!\n\nThe character of Mrs Gross is different, the Uncle does not feature at all and Quint and Jessel look like they missed their audition for a Grunge band and ended up in this movie instead.\n\nThen we have Kate ... and her mother ... and a totally different ending. Why?!\n\nI suggest skipping this misfire and watching The Innocents instead. The BBC version with Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey's Lady Mary) is pretty good too."

Carey W Hayes and Chad Hayes has so much potential to make this as scary as any of the better horror movies, but punted when they should have driven it home. Brooklynn Prince? Does CREEPY LITTLE GIRL like a pro. Mackenzie Davis? Red-eyed and frazzled, she was convincingly going down the \"Am I crazy or am I haunted?\" road, but when the plot crashed and burned, I didn't even get the chance to rubberneck and find out what really happened!

This movie started quite strong and kept losing coherence at a faster pace to the point of self-destruction. The characters came to be totally unlikeable. Finally, the ending is a true disaster. I can see a universe in which this ending works, unfortunately is executed in the weirdest, most twisted and shock-seeking way possible. Having seen this movie in January 2020, this will be for sure the most disappointing movie experience of the year at least in term of ending... hands down!"

The Turning is a colossal waste of time, collecting some star power in a film that doesn't justify their usage, serving only to add to the production expenses while offering nothing to the plot. The script is weak, the tension slim, the acting off-kilter (and not in a good way). It's got a paper thin plot that thinks it's a lot deeper than it is. It's an absolute bore, an uninspired mess of a film with an ending that leaves more questions than answers. And, in an effort to boost home video sales, they offer alternate endings, none of which offer any kind of sufficient closure for the viewer. 2001: A Space Odyssey is justified in its complexity and confusion, even after multiple viewings. But this is nothing more than a low-grade horror movie that desperately wants to be a Kubrickian masterpiece but doesn't have the balls to rise to the challenge. And so, it flounders around for an hour and a half while you watch it, scratching your head and wondering why you don't abandon ship for something actually worthy of your time. After all, you only get so much time on this earth to experience good movies. Even in the midst of a pandemic and being stuck at home with absolutely nothing to do, this movie is STILL a flop. Pass."

I'm going to be honest and say that this has got to be one of the worst that I have ever seen. The movie was just going nowhere and it seemed like instead of developing the characters, the writers just threw scenes together and called it a movie. Finn Wolfhard is definitely a little strange in this movie and acts his part well although some things he was doing as part of the storyline made no sense. I could really go on and on noting all the bad things about this movie. If you still feel inclined to watch this, don't waste your money in theaters.

It seems like someone director directed 80% of the beginning, then the last 20% someone came.in and finished the film. But, I have seen way worse and I was at least entertained."

The film seems to overstuff itself with irrelevant nostalgia and a soundtrack that's never 90s enough (hint: Nirvana is never played). The characters are cheaply written, to the point where they become more of an eye sore than actually intriguing (Come on Davis and Wolfhard, you're better than this!). The pacing here seems to almost find a wave, however just as it's about to arrive to a proper conclusion, the derailment suddenly hits the viewer, leaving you frustrated; you can never really tell if this is a ghost story or a goddamn psychological horror, but by the film's end, I swear it was a comedy. .\n\nVerdict: The Turning is as bad as they come, and not in the \"so bad it's good\" way, but in the actual bad way that'll make you beg for your time AND money back."

This movie was suggested to me on Hulu and I thought based on the actors that I'd give it a shot. My first feeling was that it was familiar and then I saw that it was based on The Turn of the Screw, just like The Haunting of Bly Manor. The familiarity ended there. Since I had some idea of what to expect, I was still interested in watching the movie, as I had so enjoyed the other adaptation. At one point I got up to get a drink and paused the movie and saw that there was only 33 minutes left, at which point I said to myself \"My god, when is this going to get interesting???\". The answer, it turns out, was never. It was only mildly spooky and hardly a psychological thriller, despite its obvious, desperate desire to be one. The ending is one of the worst I've seen. I literally said \"That's it?! THAT'S the end?!!\". The Haunting of Bly Manor is a far superior adaptation, although the actors portraying the three main characters in this film are very good. Too bad they didn't have a better script to work with."

It offers nothing new to the genre, everything it does has been done before and has been done better.\n\nBut I can't say everything was bad, I liked the costumes design (even though I was supper confused what time period we were in), the performances were okay and there was even some interesting and well-done camera work from time to time.

This movie takes place in the 80s, 90s or modern day, I am not sure. Discarding it's period setting should've and could've worked if they had just specified a time period. I was so damn confused and it's not like It Follows where not knowing just helps us.\n\nAnother part I disliked was the scares. Again, did this movie want to be this atmospheric horror or just a jumpscare pop corn flick? Even the movie couldn't decide it. There's one solid scare and one moment of genuine creepiness but that's about it. Again, the gothic atmosphere is thoroughly underused.\n\nOne thing I did like was the performance from Mackenzie Davis, going from annoyed to scared, she really does a good job. Finn Wolfhard is just there and he really tries to be this creepy kid but it doesn't work, he should go back to his 80s era wisecracking roles. No offense to the actor. The scene stealer here is definitely the little girl Brooklyn Prince who really shines through.\n\nThe story is slow, and then fast and the slow. Let me elaborate. In the beginning, the story takes it time to settle which I was all for it. It was building up to something. But then by the middle we are just shown a couple of scene so fast, one after another, I thought I'd need a breather. And then the end happens... the ending was just unsatisfying and just plain confusing or even lazy.\n\nI caught this movie as a premiere and I heard the director say that she made it in such a way that she wanted the ending to be open to interpretation but I say give us something solid story wise for us to make our own interpretation. All this while we're seeing this story develop as a ghost story and then in the end you make it seem all intellectual or mental or whatever, it just won't work. I just didn't care enough to make my own interpretation.\n\nI think everyone should go and watch it and form their own opinion. Don't expect something grand or you'll be disappointed like me. I had such high hopes for this adaptation of one of my favorite book but I guess I'll have to wait for another adaptation to come into fruition.\n\nI will give this movie a four out of ten. 4/10. That 4 simply because of the little girl and that one scene involving a mannequin."

In this case i got to say that at first the film feelt fresh to me. different from the other adaptations but not that different from the novel (wich I enjoy). Olso we got here very a good acting and scenario I would say. But, you know , in horror films is all about the build up, and at this part, when it was almost the end, it certantly did not delivered as I wished to. It is not a bad movie at all, and it was a sort of a new side of the many adaptations of the book, but the scence that left you at the end, like you miss something important, or that everything was just a crazy dream , it isnt making it for me."

I'm making my comparison for entertainment value to the 1961 version of this movie \"The Innocents\" which I'm now going to buy the DVD next chance I get just to clear my palette and disappointment from \"The Turning\".\n\nI'm not really motivated to write negative reviews of a movie most of the time but this has weighed on me for several days on how bad it is that I had to check if my opinion was shared in IMDB reviews. It was! 3.7 average rating out of 150 reviewers. YIKES! That's the lowest I've seen on any IMDB reviewed movie.\n\nI won't belabor the point about the wonky ending that has clearly been expressed much clearly in other reviews. I'll just say I'm in total agreement with other's opinions.\n\n\"The Turning\" had so much potential as ghost stories go. I loved the cinematography, but the flow, pacing and confusing relationships of the characters was tiresome to watch.\n\nNow on to watching the 1961 \"The Innocents\". More convincing depiction of ghosts with a less is more approach."

Definitely something I could play in the background or get lost in this gothic fantasy world of large mansions, horseback riding and maze grounds.\n\nBecause I will give credit, that this is a beautifully shot movie with very gorgeous gothic imagery despite the forced jump scares. Floria Sigismondi and her team did create a beautiful \"world\" with the set production + cinematography.\n\nAll the actors were excellent and did their best to elevate the material they were given. Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince all played off each other very well. Barbara Marten was also fantastic. They carried this movie and deserved better.\n\nIt's a shame the script wasn't written by someone more skilled and nuanced, because there was so much that could have been explored of the ghosts and the children's suggested trauma. Miles' relationship with Quint and Quint's influence/corruption on Miles. Flora's trauma of not wanting to leave the grounds. So much was set up and teased, but never fully explored.\n\nThen there's Kate's trauma of neglect and abandonment issues, possible mental abuse from her mother that's all there in the subtext.\n\nThe ending though. THAT ENDING. I definitely see why people hate it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It makes me think there was an alternate cut and they went with this route, which may have been the \"safe\" route in the studios' mind, but instead, it effectively threw everything out. The original novella hints at a lot of the dark stuff the kids may or may not have witnessed and this movie seemed like it was going in that direction until the last 10 minutes."

Based on a Henry James novel, The Turn of the Screw, & previously filmed as 1961's The Innocents starring Deborah Kerr, this is modern update (but whose story screams corsets & horse drawn carriages) which offers nothing that the Insidious/Conjuring crowd will find unpleasantly non-diverting. The actors are at the mercy of the non-story (the plot-line is hijacked by a myriad of scares & boos) & coming from director Floria Sigismondi (she made the interesting The Runaways based on the all girl band from the 70's & directed some Marilyn Manson music videos) the visuals were a given but this smacks of studio interference which left all the story elements stripped away w/nothing but fright moments left behind which is all well in good if this was a movie trailer & not a movie."

We are left with a slow burner that in the end does not even come close to being a horroro movie. I thought mckenzie davis in her role of kate was good and played her role well. The children finn wolfhard and brooklyn prince were also good. Overall the cast were good, its just the film its self that was really a let down."

It was actually building pretty nicely up until that point. The opening scene of a horror movie is incredibly important in setting the course for what's to come, so I wish they'd stretched it out a bit and made more impact.\n\nIf you have free time, you can watch.\n\nSome places are boring, some places are nice subjects, as i said i don't like it very much if you have a lot of free time."

Every unsettling, ambiguous plot point of \"The Turn of the Screw\" was exchanged for some cheap jump-scare or unnecessary display of mediocre CGI. Characters were completely changed simply for the sake of being superfluously creepy and thereby discarding any of their original substance. However, none of the frightening scenes from the book (for example, Quint on the stairs or looking in through the window) were used in the film. The only reference to the novella's ambiguity came from an unclear ending, which only confused the audience instead of encouraging them to discuss Kate's sanity and whether the house was actually haunted. In conclusion, this movie missed the point and Henry James deserved better."

And I was hoping for something better, but that's not what occurred in this film. Now I'm not just gonna trash talk the movie that bad, because there were some parts that were good, and that's why I rated it a five. There were just a few parts that were just boring and didn't make sense to me.\n\nBottom line I was really just looking for a plot to a story, and for some reason I couldn't find one. And When I watch a movie I try my hardest to find the best parts of the movie, and I look for the realistic emotion in the characters. And if I don't see that, then I won't really feel like finishing the film. And that's kind of what I did. I didn't really want to finish the film, but I did anyway.

The real issue I had with this movie is with the modernization. I mean it's the mid 1990's not 1890 so what is going on. The family clearly is rich beyond all reason, I mean \"could buy a small country\" rich. So what is going on with them? One set of worn out clothes, no tvs, no computers, no cars. I think the real mystery in this movie is what are the children doing with their time, they just sit and stare at a wall 24/7? How are they not more insane?\n\nAll in all it's a decent movie that doesn't really do justice for the book, but the book was really bad so..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Inspired by turn of the screw by Henry James this highly engaging but muddled adaptation offers an intriguing treatment of the material, intentional or not. The film centers on Mackenzie Grace (so bad ass in Terminator Dark Fate) is hired as a live in governess for a young girl. Upon arriving at the lush mansion she soon begins to experience strange happenings. And after Miles arrives from boarding school played by a very creepy Finn Wolfhard of Stranger things things only get creepier. From foggy apparitions to unexplainable noises and more. As the film moves along dark secrets are unearthed. Heres the matter of fact with this film it's either your thing or you're gonna hate it. It's a sloppy film filled with an abundance of cheap scares and odd dream sequences but it's also very engaging and has a very creeptastic atmosphere. Kate (Davis) is a hard character to root for. It becomes increasingly obvious that something is going on but she never leaves. And yes I get that her staying is tied to her experience and the way she was raised but it's just a little too hard to believe. Most people will have a big problem with the ending and I totally get it. It ends very bluntly and to me it feels intentional and open ended but at the same time its unsatisfactory. It left me wanting to see it again to see if I missed stuff that led up to it or it just wasn't successful in communicating what the film was trying to say. Like I said most people are gonna hate it and I totally get that. It felt like most of the film was pretty straight forward until it wasn't. But I dont know I found myself engaged, intrigued and entertained but that's just me and I like weird stuff."

The son wasn't my favorite, the teacher was good and I thought the little girl did an excellent job.\n\nThen we hit the third act and things really went off the rails. It just got manic and crazy. Very much that kind of situation where you're like, hey girl, just leave...\n\nThe ending... was kind of trash. I understood what their message was... well I think, they gave you bare bones to go off of. The snippet of exposition before it was plainly stupid and spoon fed. It was just wildly ambiguous, abrupt and lazy.\n\nIf it wasn't for the ending, I probably would've just given this a mediocre 5 but overall it's feeling much more like a 3.5 rounding up to 4. Not necessarily a complete waste of time, but probably would not recommend."

At the very least, the two were engaged in a horrific process of grooming with the children, and the text dances around it a lot but it makes it a really horrifying story.\n\nFilming this would be difficult. The actors for the most part are giving their all to this script, and there are some commendably coherent performances. The cinematography is decent and the Victorian mansion motif is very consistent with the story. I think it's a good looking film.\n\nThere are also some huge problems with the mood and pacing, and some awkward and stilted scenes that are actually kind of bad. I would still recommend watching this. Go and expecting to laugh once in a while, and be prepared to hate some of the parts of the film, but I command the actors with some exceptions for their work here."

On the other hand, and not surprisingly, the sexual elements of the story seem to have been completely ignored, which is a great shame as these are what makes everything far more disturbing. This adaptation is fairly entertaining but too hollywood (jumpscares galore), the \"modern\" setting did not serve any purpose either. I'd recommend watching Jack Clayton's masterful \"The Innocents\" and the film version of Benjamin Britten's opera from 1982 available on youtube; hell, even the 2009 BBC version is a descent take of this iconic \"ghost\" tale. Also all of the aforementioned adaptations keep the sexual implications intact, particularly Britten's opera."

Horror does not seem to be her forte based on this, but she is still ok. I kind of get why Finn Wolfhard was attracted to this movie, as he gets a chance to get away from nice Mike in Stranger Things and be a horrible douche, For me, Brooklynn Prince (the little girl) gives the best performance.\n\nAll in all, skip this and watch In A Dark Place instead"

        "review_detailed_main": "This joins The Haunting and Haunting of Hill House along with this as being interpretations of Henry James' The Turn of the Screw and isn't shy of sharing the influences.\n\nThe gate to the grounds of the old Manor House looks remarkably familiar as does the house itself. Unfortunately this is where this film falls incredibly short. It goes in hard and fast with the big haunted house cliches and lays the uncanny on really thick.\n\nOne of the devices writers like to use in contemporary horror is removing the potential for use of mobile phones either by placing the action with in an area where they can't get a signal or in a time before cell phones existed. We know it's 1994 because Kurt Cobain is dead. Throughout the film there are occasional references to Nirvana and bits of Grunge to remind us. It all feels a bit unnecessary.\n\nThe shadowy figures in mirrors is repeated too often, as is the bad dream sequence so after a couple of times it loses its impact.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me is how it's blatantly obvious that this was filmed in England yet its set in the USA.\n\nBut these are minor issues in a story that is frustratingly unfulfilled. Finn Wolfhard seems to have cornered the market in weird edgy teens which he does executes with aplomb but like the rest of the film it's unremarkable."

        "review_detailed_main": "As a remake of The Turn Of The Screw/Les Innocents, this was distinctly heavyhanded and overwrought. The power in that original story is how much is left up to interpretation; is it a haunting or a descent into madness? Is it a supernatural horror or a psychological thriller? Just exactly *how* close were the dearly departed to the children in their care? And the harrowing darkness of that original ending lends the film entire much of its impact. The Turn belabours too much to do an adaptation of that story tonal justice, while explaining too little to be a fair introduction of any new viewer to the tale.\n\nHOWEVER, that said; this is a reasonably high-quality distinctly post-2000s -style horror when taken on its own merit. The production values were fantastic throughout, performances nuanced and convincing, and the tension built deftly. The now-ubiquitous jump scare tool was used in good balance with genuinely effecting suspense, and after the initial introductory slow-burn, the pace, once it picks up, escalates frenetically by the minute - to point where the hectic whirl of events has the viewer completely along for the ride with our heroine in no longer knowing what's real or not. It's certainly better-acted and more emotionally compelling than the bulk of its contemporary fare.\n\nSo, the TL version is; if you're looking for a delicately-woven and slowly-played gothic horror with an ending of guttingly horrific tragedy, then look elsewhere. If you're in the market for ghosts and gasps with some solid performances and a breakneck pace post-orientation, as well as a close-up portrait of a likeable protagonist rapidly degenerating under trying conditions, then you could do a lot worse. It's well worth a bucket of popcorn on a weekday night."

The only thing I wasn't liking was the constant jump scares and the mediocre CGI. And then the ending happened which completely destroys this film and transforms what was a harmless forgettable horror story into a thing that I actively didn't like leaving me somewhat angry. I feel a bit sorry for Mackenzie Davis who showed real promise in Terminator and followed that with this turkey."

In the adaptation, Kate (portrayed by Mackenzie Davis) is hired to take care of Miles (portrayed by Finn Wolfhard) and Flora (portrayed by Brooklyn Prince) at the Fairchild Estates. Once there, Kate becomes aware of the dark history of Fairchild Estates and the haunted spirits within.\n\nThe Turning started off decently. It didn't add anything new to the horror genre but it wasn't bad. I also thought Brooklyn did a pretty good job at portraying Flora. Surprisingly, I thought Finn's performance of Miles was pretty bad.\n\nHowever, the last 15 minutes of the film are mildblowing bad. The story tries to do a turn at the end where it's all a vision that Kate was seeing and it ruins the movie and just doesn't make sense. And then it does another turn where she's imagining herself as her mother (who is mentally deranged) but when the woman turns around it seems to infer that Kate is looking at herself. If this didn't happen I would probably have the film rates higher. But Finn's terrible portrayal and the horrendous ending really brought the film down for me. I may be generous at a 4/10 but I think the first 3/4 of the film is actually decent."

A film like the Turning is sure to turn a few thoughts towards having more food for thought, and depending on what type of horror fan you are, will determine if you like it. Points for this reviewer are a fantastic setting established for creepiness and realistic flow. A good acting cast further brings the horror factor out and a more unique approach gets points in my book given how tough it is in this day and age. However, this new approach is also potentially a downfall for some as the movie gets really busy, with so much though and direction that you have to figure out if you like keeping track of everything. Scares took a hit for me in this film, and the slow pace itself leads to potentially a film that will not be the modern preference. Still, if you are looking for a thought-provoking movie, this piece should give you something to talk about and the theater can help elevate the ambience for sound, though I think the true terror will come from watching it at home.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nDrama/Horror/Mystery: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0"

There are literary analysis that allow for the idea that the 'ghosts' in the story are figments of the governess' imagination and that she is indeed insane, the novel is a bit ambiguous. However you cannot present a ghost story, as is initially done here, and suddenly in the last scene decide that it is a psychological thriller. There is no preparation in the plot for the teacher being mentally unstable, her mother not withstanding. That interpretation is also not the common one and is a definite outlier. The director has to make me believe it and she did not.\n\nAt the close of this film I sat with my mouth agape wondering what it was that I just saw. The acting was adequate but the direction confused, many too many jump thrills. The cinematography was too atmospheric and moody, the entire film had an air of discontinuity. Also, personal aside, if these kids are not possessed, then they need a colossal whipping. The pranks they pull and their sense of entitlement, encouraged by the cook, is not to be believed. This is not part of the the teacher's psychosis as you see the scenes in the film and interpretation always starts at what the director shows you."

The acting in this movie is quite good, the costumes, set and cinematography are all top notch. But the pacing gets a bit botched as the film progresses and the ending is far too abrupt. I get the feeling that the director chose from one of two possible endings and chose the wrong one. Unfortunately, this ruined an otherwise interesting movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "A modern take on Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw,\" Floria Sigismondi's \"The Turning\" has a grunge music, a historical backdrop, and female connotations. But the movie isn't quite a masterpiece because it doesn't have a thrilling, nerve-jangling plot or an intriguing conclusion.\n\nTeacher Kate, full of personality, is made governess of Bly Manor, a spooky house with Gothic architecture and twisting vines. The loss of her parents has traumatized 7-year-old Flora. Mrs. Grose is a spectral figure at the mansion. When Miles, Flora's 15-year-old brother, returns home with a demonic presence and threatens Kate's mental stability, her determination is put to the test.\n\nA contemporary perspective on the topics of women's tendency toward lunacy and denial is The Innocents. Kate and Mrs. Grose play opposing female characters in the movie, and their connection serves to highlight the topics. The use of light and shadow in the film's lighting and clothing designs highlights their artistic value. The way the movie depicts Kate's insanity and the different outfits give the story more nuance. Prince, Davis, and Wolfhard's performances enhance the content.\n\nIn an attempt to modernize the narrative, the producers crammed it with of superfluous details, such as a vague finale, a #MeToo storyline, and a mid-1990s Gen X dream. Additionally faulty are the unreliable narrator and the foreshadowing, which undermine much of the preceding aspects and fail to add elements for an exciting ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "Good book and I loved the 60's movie adaptation (The Innocents) so I gave this a cautious try. I actually really liked the ambiguity and the atmosphere and tone of the film. Many 'ghost' / 'am I turning crazy' type movies have exposition that immediately over explains itself and takes away the realism and true ambiguity leaving a tedious exposition of flashbacks and footnotes. This film doesn't make those cliche mistakes of such abundantly tedious flashbacks and such. Instead it only shows the paranoid confusion of what one experiencing this would really feel. This film as a result is luckily much better than it could have been. It stands up next to the other adaptations, and other than the 60s version this is one is one I enjoyed much more than the others. After reading the scathing reviews I realize this film is not for the Avengers and Spiderman crowd who need everything explained to them with heavily wound exposition and action. Instead, similarly to the book as I've learned, much is left to the imagination and that is what makes it far more unsettling and creepy than exposition and motive vomit being thrown at the viewer in order for them to \"get\" it. This is one of the better 'ghost' stories I've watched because as a natural skeptic I believe it is important to understand the role a human psyche plays in a predicament like this. Many ghost films fall to the shallow 'Boo!' moment and not much more. This one was far more sophisticated like I was expecting and satisfying for me not ignoring skepticism, paranoia, suspicion, etc. The premise was simple but executed well. I prefer this kind of realistic ghost stories rather than the \"Boo!\" Let me exorcise you cause the exposition told me so, drivel that often plagues the more cliche ghost horror like the Conjuring and such. I really think this effort was a step in the right direction to modernize adult horror without the need of excessive gore, peddling religion or entirely over-exposed exposition /flashbacks etc. This film keeps the mystery real, raw, confusing, and creepy without overdoing it. I really hope other viewers can give this a chance for what it is, a well acted mystery thriller from the lineage of great gothic fiction. I was prepared to hate this film but I couldn't as I've found it's a nice companion piece to The Innocents, and is a cut above being far better than the cliche stuff it could have been. Finally a ghost film that walks that fine line. And I am so picky about this stuff. Really felt true to the 60s-70s but with some modernity."

Director Floria Sigismondi gives the impression of having seen James Watkins' The Woman in Black and James Wan's The Conjuring, without actually understanding what makes them work. A director can have all the CGI, all the dimly lit corridors, all the barely glimpsed figures in the world - but if they don't have 'an eye for the creepy' it doesn't work. Chilling ghost stories that get under your skin are hard to do. Every flesh-creep has to be earned; they won't come automatically just because you've turned the lights down and put an out of focus figure in the background. As for the cast, young leads Finn Wolfhard and (especially) Brooklynn Prince are very good, and Barbara Merten (as the house keeper) is excellent. Mackenzie Davis' governess on the other hand is annoying and remarkably ineffectual. Killruddery House in County Wicklow, Ireland, is a suitably spooky location - but it's wasted here. I recommend watching Jack Clayton's classic The Innocents, or Mike Flanagan's The Haunting of Bly Manor mini-series instead. 4/10."

What I CAN tell you is that I tried to read the explanation of the ending after I watched this movie and although I am very open to movie twists and psychological endings, this one just doesn't work for me at all, and my best guess that it will not work for you either.\n\nThis is very disappointing as all the pieces are there to make a really good thriller but at the end it just looks like they ran out of money and stitched a few deleted-scenes together to wrap it all up quickly with no consideration to sense making. Exact score: 45 / 100"

        "review_detailed_main": "Initial Thoughts: \"The Turning\" was one of the movies that I had wanted to see in theatres, and due to timing, I wasn't able too. Nonetheless a year later I've gotten around to watching it and I must say that it was a little different than I was expecting. However, if the opportunity arose to see it in theatres, I'd take it.\n\nNow that I've watched the movie. I can say that the main selling point for me, surprisingly, were the jump scares. I found them to be on opposite moments from when I was expecting them. What made the jump scares a little bit more spooky, was the music and timing of each scare. Everything was long and drawn out so by the time a jump scare would happen instead of being over it. I got spooked. Overall, I think it the movie was well done with the score, cinematography, and length of the film.\n\nOne downside, and I don't feel like this is really a spoiler, was the ending. And what do I mean by that? Well, there wasn't one per se. I'm speaking for myself on this one. With the lack of an ending I had to look up what the possible meaning was behind the entire film. Once I did that, everything became more clear and the answers I found made me a little more satisfied with the end result, however, I can't say I'm completely satisfied with the whole concept, but it'll do.\n\nOverall: My review is nearly opposite of the reviews I've looked at. I'll leave you with this. If you like puzzles, and perhaps being left a little empty at the end of your movies, you may enjoy this. Jump scares were offset with long, drawn out scenes with an equaling score that made the film fun. Lastly, I didn't feel I wasted my time with this one and therefore if you asked me if you should see it. My answer would be 'yes'.\n\nEnjoy the show!"

In the house, located in Essex, London, she lives Flora (Brooklynn Prince) and Miles (Finn Wolfhard), orphaned brothers who lost both parents in an accident near the house. However, she soon realizes that there are other residents in the place, not necessarily alive.\n\nThe housekeeper is kind of clueless at times, and the children aren't even that devilish, she just isn't good with the pets, and apart from the mishaps along the path of the haunting, everything adorably dark and macabre, delicious... unfinished, as I like it, however, I asked for help by googling additional explanations about the last events, nothing very enlightening, based on a poorly defined book, but I love these controversial endings..."

The movie started out great, with a clear story and good plot. But I can't say it ended that way. Some people may like the ending, whereas some people may not. The ending was slightly confusing, so I decided to rewind the movie and research it, which helped me understand it a lot. I have come to the conclusion that it is not as much a horror movie, as it is a thriller or psychological thriller. It was very enjoyable and had quit a few jump scares which I highly enjoyed. This movie, in my opinion, is worth watching."

The ending will confuse you until someone explains it to you though. After fully understanding the ending of the movie, the movie becomes less scary but helps the story line even more."

        "review_detailed_main": "A modern take on the classic tale, \"The Turn of the Screw.\" But not quite modern because it takes place in the 90s. I wasn't sure what to expect and in the end the movie turned out okay. Certainly a lot better than a lot of other reviewers make it out to be. Personally I thought the movie was rather creepy and suspenseful. I constantly felt uncomfortable throughout the majority of Kate's stay at the house.\n\nI am sure a lot of people would think she was crazy to have not leave or crazy to keep walking towards the creepy voices. It certainly did not make any sense of you heard strange voices on the middle of the night you would not call the police or at least grab a weapon or something.\n\nThe ending was disappointing because it did not end like the book, which has such a good ending I don't see why it didn't. They even foreshadow the book's ending a few times. Ignoring the book, however, the ending is a nice twist. In essence the twists do pay homage to the title of the book, because it is like the turning of a screw where the story twists deeper and deeper, playing on the idea of unreliable narration. Is Kate crazy? Or is Miles purposefully trying to terrorize her? I wish the movie was more ambiguous because the ending leads us in one direction more. Personally I prefer films like Pan's Labyrinth where the film is left more ambiguous."

The only thing I don't like about this movie is that there isn't more of it, there are some things that were brought up that weren't fully expanded on some things I would love to see but i understand why weren't included.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Turning is not your average horror movie. While it can't exactly be called a masterpiece, it's well-shot, well-acted, and for the most part, well-paced. Though at times it can fall into cliche territory, it mostly remains an ambiguous and bizarre film.\n\nIts strengths lie in the performances of the main actors, especially the performance from McKenzie Davis. She captures very well the sense of paranoia and slow mental decay that the movie tries to portray. Some great cinematography also adds to the film's dark, psychological vibe.\n\nThe problems really show themselves in the plot and underlying structure (or lack thereof), specifically towards the last quarter of the movie. While I believe it was the intention of the director and writer to be strange and difficult to follow, I can't help but feel like this film could have been much better with a few changes and resolutions to the ending of the film. Couple this with a few easy-to-predict jump scares, and the movie just doesn't quite reach its potential.\n\nAt the end of the day, this film is a unique and intriguing horror movie. It's definitely not for everyone, but those seeking a dark, psychological detour will probably view this one multiple times. It leaves much up to the imagination and leaves the viewer with many questions. If not an instant or cult classic, The Turning is at the very least a fun and intellectually challenging thriller."
