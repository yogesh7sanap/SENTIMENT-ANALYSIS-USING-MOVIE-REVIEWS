If anything A Quiet Place and Birdbox ripped off the premise from the 2015 book The Silence by Tim Lebbon. Do some research people, there have been numerous articles that state as much.\n\nAs far as the movie... a middle of the road decent time killer, it held my interest. It could have been much more in the right hands. I thought the acting was on par with the material the actors had to work with. CGI was lax and the situations the family found themselves in could have been orchestrated to be much more complex and dramatized. This is why A Quiet Place excelled.\n\nPeople try entirely too hard to figure out what's wrong with a movie rather than just enjoy it. Don't go into every movie expecting it to be the best movie ever and perhaps you won't be so disappointed. Few movies deserve a 1 or 2 rating, just as few as deserve a 9 or 10."

Not much thought was put into them other than \"we need a monster\". While they might be decent as a \"Pitch Black\" style swarm monster on a small scale, they do not work for what the movie intended. There's just so many things wrong with them.\n\nAdd to that the incredibly bad ending, that was clearly a rush job and honestly added nothing to the movie. It was clearly a case of the writers trying to sound wise and simply failing horribly.\n\nThis is a movie you can waste a bored afternoon watching, but there's far better ones out there."

Hugh Andrews (Stanley Tucci) must protect his family, including his daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) who suffers from acute deafness, and needs to communicate in sign language, which comes in handy since the terrifying flying beasts react most forcefully to sound.\n\nHorror has become a genre as largely manufactured as pop music these days, an original idea an occasional bonus, secondary to cheap CGI and jump scares. And so, the recent theatrically released A Quiet Place, divided opinion, a creative premise at least, in spite of its outlandishness. Its certainly that film that first springs to mind when presented with The Silence, despite also being a hodgepodge of other such films in the cultural consciousness, including The Mist and Cloverfield.\n\nDespite arriving in its shadow, I'd still consider The Silence the better film between it and AQP. It at least establishes something in the way of human connection with the main characters, and takes the time to develop them in an effective way, meaning we care about them more. Its also easier to digest some flying, killer bats than it is giant, spider like things. Performances wise, Tucci is sturdy and reliable in the lead, strongly supported by Shipka in the crucial role as his deaf daughter.\n\nIt's impressive and effective, for a film that manages to cram it all into ninety minutes. While not a perfect film, its certainly a huge step up from a guy whose directorial debut was Mortal Kombat: Annihilation! ***"

I can however say this is a different movie altogether, though not really in good way.\n\nEarly on I was gripped, fantastically made and looking film where Tucci is on the best form I've seen him since The Lovely Bones (2009). This I thought was going to be something really special, but alas the quality dipped pretty hardcore in the last act.\n\nIt tells the story of small winged creatures that begin to besiege the world in a near apocalyptic event. They respond only to sound so the trick is silence (See where the Quiet Place comparison comes in?). The film follows a family surviving in this world, led by father Tucci and daughter played by Kiernan \"Sabrina\" Shipka.\n\nThe cast deliver, the sfx are passable and the whole thing is well constructed but religion takes the stage and ruins the film. Despite being a near theocratic nation I'm still amazed how critical Hollywood usually is over religion and The Silence is no different. It takes a hyper realistic angle here with the religious's interpretation of the incident and it's positively chilling because it's so very believable.\n\nI wish they hadn't gone down that route, though realistic it made for uncomfortable viewing and led the movie to a satisfying yet sudden and rather incomplete finale.\n\nThe Silence should/could have been an outstanding film but instead came out as a real disappointment.\n\nThe Good:\n\nTucci is on top form\n\nSome solid ideas\n\nThe Bad:\n\nCertain flaws in logic and consistency\n\nGoes in an uncomfortable direction"

I'm not sure what the underground herbivores feed on, but presumably there's a whole underground flora that gets by without photosynthesis. These herbivores must be pretty ferocious themselves, since they have forced the egg-laying bats to evolve such deadly teeth and talons. Though slower than the bat-things, eventually they too will figure out how to crawl through the same hole to the surface.\n\nSo I'm thinking sequel: \"The Bleat,\" in which a race of killer sheep invade the eastern U.S., and every action scene begins with a terrifying \"Baaaaa!\" At first the desperate humans just try to kill them, for instance by tying cowbells around their necks to attract the killer bats, but eventually our heroes learn to shear them and use the wool to make bat-resistant winter garments."

However it ended up being better than I expected how it could've been so much better. Also I highly recommend the book as it is awesome.\n\nA few good points are 1) the acting was pretty good especially from Stanley Tucci and Kiernan Shipka, 2) there were some really good and creepy scenes that do the book justice, 3) the creature designs were pretty good and come relatively close to what I pictured them to look like, 4) the priest was genuinely creepy (apologies I don't remember the name of the actor but he was really good)\n\nUnfortunately on the negative side, it's way too short, at an hour and thirty minutes long it rushes through very pivotal and important scenes and moments. Making the film seem anticlimactic as well as incomplete. The ending was also a little disappointing, especially when compared to the ending of the book.\n\nAll in all it's not a bad film, it's just not great. I have a feeling that this movie will undoubtedly be compared to A Quiet Place, which is understandable, kinda like how pretty much all shark movies are going to be compared to Jaws. So here's what I say, The Silence is to A Quiet Place what Jaws 2, Deep Blue Sea, and The Meg are to Jaws."

I believe those commentators with 1/10 or 3/10 shouldn't compare different films and say ohh it was worse than this. So what? You're making this film review not comparing entire film universe.

Leonetti, and the acting fairly decent, but this B-grade film failed miserably with its screenplay. The Van Dyke's left many plot issues, and threw in scenes that needed more backstory. The pacing and length were decent, but this film needed more... such as Closed Captions for the Sign scenes that clearly no one could understand unless they knew sign language. I had to rewind, enable CC, then have to put up with every sound, song and dialogue plastered on my screen in text. The score was also too evident and out of place in most scenes, but unlike some of the other reviewers complaining about the creatures, I found them (CGI and V/SFX) well created and convincing, especially for a B-grade film. Still, this film could have been much better, but sadly missed the mark. It's certainly does not deserve all these 1 & 2's, but not even close to any 9 & 10's. It's a fair 6/10 from me."

Partner that with a mix of monster mayhem of Bats .A semi-impressive cast. Who doesn't love Stanley Tucci ?\n\nStanley Tucci & Kiernan Shipka are fabulous and offer tender performances sprinkled throughout the film.\n\nThe Silence is so focused on delivering a bat s.h.i.t. insane plot at the hands of lizard/bug/bats called Vesps . That are wonderfully creepy.\n\nIt then takes a very perplexing turn in the third act by introducing some kind of religious cult that sort of shows up to create havoc because that seemed like fun....? Thankfully this plot deviation was relatively short-lived and the film gets back on track !\n\nThe Silence works just for the strangeness of its concept, Because The Silence sticks to the creature-feature plot structure established by The X-Files, the strangeness of its concept, I enjoyed it well enough."

It had some good moments but were too few and far between. One problem I had with both A Quiet Place and The Silence is the premise that humans are too inept and powerless to keep from becoming prey/food for the creatures. They're attracted to sound so why not set up some humongous speakers and amps in an empty stadium or city, crank it up and get all those suckers to gather there, then have an an F-22 drop a tactical nuke on them and blow them all to kingdom come. Hell, they did that to the aliens in Alien vs Predator:Requiem. They can do that in these movies too."

        "review_detailed_main": "Do you hear that? That's the sound of another B-grade horror film being quietly offloaded to Netflix, seemingly as part of the company's ongoing aim to provide a cure for insomnia sufferers.\n\nIn fact, to call the story of The Silence half-baked would be an insult to half-decent bakers everywhere. Not only is the film an inert pastiche of countless post-apocalyptic dramas, most notably last year's A Quiet Place, but even Netflix's own Bird Box feels like a master class in tension building and nuanced storytelling in comparison. Perhaps the biggest similarity the film shares with Bird Box is the desire to close your eyes, but for two very different reasons.\n\nAs part of the film's commitment to unoriginality, The Silence follows a group of killer bat-like creatures that have escaped from the bowels of hell (or a vast underground cave system, take your pick) to reap havoc above Earth. Hunting only by sound (despite the fact that the bats don't shut the hell up), within hours America has been reduced into a post-apocalyptic landscape, with the army and military conspicuously absent from every scene.\n\nAmongst the carnage, a family, led by Stanley Tucci who plays a father to a deaf daughter (played by Kiernan Shipka), must do want they can to survive, which mostly means moving around a lot and never thinking of bordering up the doors or windows of their house. In one scene, the daughter literally leaves the door wide open as she enters a store looking for supplies. Oh and there's a crazed cult randomly inserted into the film's climactic moments in case the story wasn't rushed enough already.\n\nIt's a bargain bin version of Hitchcock's The Birds, if the bargain bin were made from reused materials sourced from a smouldering car wreck. However, if you're still keen on watching The Silence, prepare yourself for a challenging mystery as trying to figure out what attracted Stanley Tucci to this mess in the first place is a real head scratcher."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Silence is a film about a family of city dwellers that has little to no survival skills in a SHTF scenario. Even though they manage to muddle their way through various dangers, their foolishness, lack of experience and preparedness is aggravating. We've been told this kind of story (to this extreme) many times before. In addition, there are many scenarios in this film that don't make sense, even in the context mentioned before. Without revealing any spoilers, we see them not closing doors behind them, discarding tools, failing to retrieve weapons, not setting a night watch, using a noisy main gate instead of crawling back through a drainage pipe after the danger had been removed, and falling for a *painfully* obvious ruse that literally anyone should have been able to see through. Personally I feel like this film was rushed through the production process and would have been better off as a series or mini-series. There was SO much potential in the idea behind this film and 90% of it was omitted or completely wasted. Given how the story was told the family's personal perspective, there's still room for a spin-off series that would better explain how this whole thing began (we know how it began, but it could be vastly expanded on), how officials handled the events overall, how the rest of the world fared and to expand on a virtual gold-mine of other creative ideas that could be explored."

Perhaps creatures were felt necessary to lessen the characters over the feature length. Suffice to say that it is a movie that never reached its intended destination or worst reached it indeed.\n\nCreatures are interesting and competently modelled. The creature effects are par. The photography is good and acting is passable. The direction and the script leave much to be desired.\n\nWatch it once and move on. There's nothing here to return.

The creatures themselves make next to no sense in their survival and how at least 100 thousand of them were inside a cave (look towards the first shot of the city being attacked and remember that this is happening across other states) and how they were able to sustain themselves so easily. The being vulnerable to cold and using their wings to better locate the origin of a sound was a nice tough until you remember that wood chippers exist and even just small objects can completely throw them off, the second losing its weight when you realize that you can move to northern Canada and be completely safe. From this the threat in the movie seems to only be a threat to countries on the equator and separated by vast oceans. Though while i do spout a lot of anger towards the film, i do think that it is redeemable by showing whats even going on in the world other than 3 minutes of CNN, plus it does have a good cast. This movie was very difficult to keep watching but i pushed to the end because i though it would redeem itself (this is only my opinion as others my find the movie great, i can see some spots where this can be considered a good film)."

We even have crying babies in its mothers arms walking down a train tunnel with those creatures listening? I'm surprise she didn't step on a long upright nail. The father has a deaf and dumb daughter who communicates through sign language with the rest of the family? Holly crap, they copied so much from the Quiet Place that is downright plagiarism.\n\nNetflix deciding to make a film like this is much too soon. Do the studios know no bounds to how much they can copy or how often they can remake a film? especially less than one year of the Quiet Place theatrical release? This looks really bad for Netflix.

This creates unrealistic standards for deaf people to know how to speak. There's no reason why she would be talking and people signing in response, that doesn't make any sense. If this were accurate she and the family would be signing the whole time.\n\nAnd Really? Why couldn't they hire a dead actress? There is so much wasted talent in the deaf community because \"producers\" at Netflix don't care enough for deaf representation. A quiet place did a far better job. I don't even care about the storyline cause this horrible representation of a deaf girl was too much to give it anything other than one star. HIRE MORE DEAF ACTORS!!!"

The pace hurts the progress of the movie by dragging in in multiple directions but giving no foundation to the overall story. Also the movie is like watching 3 different stories that could have been fleshed out with more depth. The antagonist in the story had an element of creepy but failed be believable and stole it's look from other creatures. With all that said, it is not A Quiet Place contender but it does keep your interest well enough to pull off a few scares."

'The Silence' is the film of a book, with the same name, written by British writer, Tim Lebbon, and published in April 2015. It therefore predates 'A Quiet Place', and is not a copy of it. The screenplay for the latter film was written by Bryan Woods in 2018, who came up with the story in the same year. One could reasonable argue that Woods stole the idea for 'A Quiet Place' from 'The Silence' That said, 'The Silence' is an enjoyable film of survival in a hostile world created by the appearance of creatures which hunt by sound and which were long entombed in cave. The actors performed well and the direction was good. It's failing was to give too much viewing time to the creatures, a factor which 'A Quiet Place' did not and which, in my opinion, added to the horror of the situation. That said, 'The Silence' is definitely worth a watch."

Leaving the audience with many questions and a lack of depth toward story.\n\nThe introduction of interaction between a group of radicalistic humans and the main family contributes to an interesting dynamic for the very brief time the take the screen. Additionally, the films characters seem to lack rational thought in tense situations in trade for attempts to evoke sympathy in the audience for characters that have been significantly underdeveloped due perhaps to the short running time.\n\nWith a overall lack of tense or generally scary moments and an extremely pathetic and lazy ending, 'The Silence' is certainly not a film that will create much noise amongst film audiences."

Just think on the 'Saw' series or the bodysnatcher-franchise. With every movie it became worse. On the other hand I really believe in the original and appreciate the sequel of 'A Quiet Place' which might continue the story in a (maybe) interesting and (hopefully) developing way. 'The Silence' is ok. I would not specially recommend it, but if you want to see it, watch it before 'A Quiet Place', the other way round, I would guess that you could get slightly dissapointed about it."

Secondly, the pterodactyl-like creatures here seem more believable than Quiet's spider-aliens. This is why we shouldn't go poking around in caves.\n\nFinally, the characters are marginally smarter than Krasinski and Blunt. They catch on quick, keep loud toys away from their children, and have the good sense to keep their shoes on!\n\nSo, \"The Silence\" is a pretty good thriller, and you just might like it more than \"Quiet Place.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "6.6/10 As far as netflix \"original\" content goes of late, this definitely has its mediocre cliche moments, but at least strives to be a solid creature feature thriller for the most part. The story starts out interesting enough in the vein of rapture/apocalypse phenomena, and developed the main characters rather well. As we get further in it does drag at some points, and has some contrived emotional aspects spread around its plot, but the well executed creatures come around enough to make things exciting again. The conclusion comes rather abruptly with an ambitious yet scattered forced subplot that doesn't really fit. Overall a very basic story that kept me watching. While it does borrow from a Quiet Place (a much better film), it still delivers decently for the subject matter. I also thought the cgi for the bat creatures was really quite impressive for netflix as far as the close ups went, and it was refreshing to actually SEE them pose a threat to the protagonists unlike in drivel films like bird box. I would like to see netflix continue improving their cgi in the future with their bigger budgets because clearly they can afford it. I also thought the main 2 performances were good enough to where they keep you invested. If you enjoy anything creature related or apocalyptic, you can definitely give this a try."

The government finds that the creatures attack through the human sound and requests people to stay quiet at home. However, the constructor Hugh Andrews (Stanley Tucci) decides to move to the countryside with his wife Kelly (Miranda Otto); their teenage daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka), who lost her hearing a couple of years ago in a car accident; their son Jude (Kyle Breitkopf); Kelly's mother Lynn (Kate Trotter), who has lung cancer; and their dog Otis in the family car. Their friend Glenn (John Corbett) joins them in his own car. Glenn has a car accident and attracts the vesps. Later Hugh and his family leave the car and walk communicating only in sign language seeking shelter in the countryside. Will they find a safe place?\n\nThe film \"The Silence\" (2019) is a rip-off of \"A Quiet Place\" (2018), trying to explore the success if the 2018 movie. The novel of Tim Lebbon \"The Silence\" may have been published in 2015, but the story of a world without sound was developed by Brian Woods and Scott Beck when they were at college. The veteran cast with Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto have good performances but are quite old to have a sixteen-year-old daughter and a younger son. However, the film is not as bad as written in many reviews. If the viewer watches with lesser expectations he or she may be surprised by a reasonable adventure. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Sil\u00eancio\" (\"The Silence\")"

The movie very clearly attempted to follow a horror story format that served no purpose other than to fit stereotypes about horror movies: stupid characters, awful pacing, and awful climax. At least a third of the movie is needless dialogue that isn't used or referenced later in the film, probably as an attempt to pad for the short runtime.\n\nI don't know if I could have produced anything worse. When the movie ended I wanted a refund for the time spent watching it. It's not even enjoyable to make fun of because I just get angry thinking about it. Truly a shame for Netflix to put out alongside masterpieces such as The Haunting of Hill House and Narcos. I almost didn't want to post this review because I'm forced to give one star when it deserves zero."

But it have some quality to. I personally liked the acting, it wasn't extreme or dramatic, just low key, as regularly people would be, in that situation. And i find the way they solve things, and the main characters way of thinking and acting, super realistic. For once, I didn't get annoyed because the characters were acting stupid, selfish, ignorant or were just dumb or didn't pay attention. They were thinking fast, logical and learning and adapting with the knowledge, and it was awesome, to see for once!\n\nIt is not the best movie in the world, and it wasn't trying to be. It's a movie made for shocking and entertaining, and it delivers. Nothing more, nothing less. I liked it. Would probably also watch it again. I'm just sad that people have been bashing it so much, cause it made me not watch it sooner...\n\nAnd for people bashing it because it has the same premise as, A quiet place or Bird box. 1) Why are you shocked, it is literally in the description if the movie and in the trailer. It's not a surprise it resembles the plot of those movies? 2) why are you mad that it resembles them? What about the unending movies about virus spreading, zombies, werewolf, demons and so forth? Its pretty hard making a scary movie, and not reusing a premise for the plot, used before. 3) I really liked bird box and A quite place because of the premise of loosing/minimizing one of our senses, and adapting to that to survive. So I just enjoy that there is being more movies made with that premise, cause I think it is really interesting. 4) and last... The movie is based on a book that have been written before those movies. So its not a rip of.\n\n\n\nTo sum it up. If you like the premise of Birdbox and A quite place, I think you will like this movie as well. Don't expect to be blown away by it, but expect to be entertained."

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening scene is immediately captivating, and believable as a starting point for the narrative. The opening credits, with a montage of nature and civilization, is pointedly jarring, along with Thomas Hajdu and Andy Milburn's score. 'The silence' works hard to get our attention right away, and to its credit, it keeps it.\n\nIt's hardly possible to watch 'The silence' without immediately thinking of 'A quiet place,' as both share the premise of creatures that hunt by sound. Yet any concern I had about their similarity - especially for as closely to each other that they were released - is quickly dispelled, as the narrative here follows a different slant: The introduction of the creatures to the world, and the onset of the noiseless apocalypse.\n\nPutting aside the nature of the antagonistic force, the narrative in 'The silence' is relatively conventional: carefree exposition, sudden alarm, attempt to escape and survive, all following a single family. Nonetheless, it keeps us readily engaged - and this is certainly in thanks as well to the excellence of the film otherwise.\n\nThe creatures look great and plausibly realistic in design, behavior, and apparent life cycle. The adapted screenplay by Carey and Shane Van Dyke does a great job of imparting the mounting horror in a world gone to hell, while director John R. Leonetti has a keen eye for some fine shots, and an attention to detail that captures every subtlety. The cast also contributes masterfully to the film's success. Steady, reliable Stanley Tucci is most visible, but it's a joy as well to see Miranda Otto in her prominent supporting role. I especially like Kiernan Shipka in her portrayal of Ally - the teenage daughter, who also serves initially as narrator - giving the girl a resolve, even in her fearfulness, that's impressive to watch.\n\nThe employment of pathetic fallacy at the climax is maybe a bit much, but the scene still looks great all the same, and is duly riveting. I'm likewise not especially fond of the narration over the final scene; as is the case with almost any movie that uses such a voiceover, it's simply unnecessary, and in my mind detracts from the ending.\n\nYet those are the only points of criticism that immediately come to mind. This isn't to say that 'The silence' is perfect, but it's entertaining, engrossing, and suitably thrilling. Viewers who are looking for an especially bloody, visceral fright fest may be better served elsewhere, but for a more general audience this fills a niche that only horror purists are likely to sidestep. Even with a story that's a little predictable and not unfamiliar, 'The silence' is worth checking out."

Though i dont think every movie nowadays needs to have some silly teenage love story attached to it.\n\nOne downside i will say is that the movie had a few stupid plot holes and the family are imbeciles if anything. No disrespect, if this was the apocalypse i wouldnt want any of those idiots tagging along with me they are a liability."

The film kept losing pace and that tension because some moments were too poorly executed. For the very fact they made the effort and delivered a fairly tense film actually to me I'll hand this a fair rating it was better than the rating suggest, mostly scored unfairly due to the films competition such as a quiet place - which I liked but I will point out didn't even score that well on this site. People are too judgemental. This film was more than it got credit for albeit cheesy and cheap. Nevertheless this already beat in my view most of Netflix silly releases."

Nobody can make a killer shark movie ever again because Spielberg made Jaws? Please....get over your jaded selves. This movie is fine for what it is...a popcorn thriller/monster movie. You have to learn to turn your brain off a bit and have some fun sheeple! There are usually going to be plot holes and imperfections that are largely inherent with this genre. This isn't trying to be Schindler's List. People that consistently rate movies a 1 or a 10 should be banned from this site for the betterment of serious, adult-minded movie enthusiasts that know how to switch gears in relation to the content their consuming. I rate this a 6 within the context of it's genre (monster movie), which means it ain't that bad and is worth a watch if you know how to suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy yourself. I gave A Quiet Place a 7...a bit more effective driving up the tension and I preferred the cast. Oh and The Descent...is far more effective then both of these as pure monster horror and a solid 8.

For even the most minuscule of noises will send a swarm of 'Pitch Black' 'Doctor Who'-esque bat demons that will scratch, bite and gnaw at your flesh. Based on a novel apparently, however any and all originality was tossed out of the family car window when both the superior 'A Quiet Place' and hugely popular 'Bird Box' were capitalising on the whole \"sense prevention\" horror schtick. Basically, it's both those films put together. Ancient bat creatures are released from an uncharted cave system and are terrorising the continent of North America, where we follow a family trying to survive and reach a refuge.\n\nProblem is, this family is so chilled and relaxed during this heightened state of emergency, that any and all threat is relinquished from the nonchalant acting and careless attitudes. Urgh, honestly! Leonetti is doing his absolute best in unimaginatively mimicking other similar films, where veteran and all-round talent Tucci is waltzing around the countryside showing a face of \"I can't be bothered, release me from this torturous nightmare\".\n\nPlagued by infuriatingly stupid plot conveniences and character choices, the severe lack of tension halts the momentum entirely. Heck, it's not even in neutral anymore. It's reversing! Examples include (brace yourself...): handing a handgun to the uncle who is then left to die, ginger son conveniently switching cars before one of them veers over a verge, iPhones instantly muting themselves when submerged in water for a total of three seconds and bringing an obviously loud dog with you. That last example, accompanied with an unnecessary scene involving members of the public banishing a mother and her baby due to generating far too much noise, are simply utilised to showcase the destructive nature of humanity. Yup. Humans suck, and this film wants you to know that. You shan't be scared by the horrifically visualised bat demons that look smoother than Tucci's bald head. It's the characters that'll get under your skin and infuriate you.\n\nNeed more proof? The entire third act. Father and daughter wander off to the nearest pharmacy, surprisingly making zero noise whatsoever on the way there, and encounter a mentally unstable reverend who yearns to fertilise young girls to maintain the population and chop their tongues off (after the foreplay, obviously...). What. The. Hell? That was so left field that even the flying angels didn't see that coming. The narrative focus shifts constantly, making an already boring premise even more tediously mundane.\n\nAside from one sacrifice towards the conclusion that had some emotional gravitas, The Silence offers nothing more than another forced extraction of this now dull horror concept. Actors weren't trying, direction was unstable and the insufficient amount of scares were, well, insufficient. Oh wait, I forgot! It literally ends on the daughter becoming survivalist-styled Lara Croft and hunting these winged menaces down. Oh no no! I'm done! Just watch 'A Quiet Place' instead..."

It's not a rip off. It is totally possible for movies and/or books to have similar plots. People, writers especially, have similar ideas. That doesn't mean anyone stole anything from anyone else. Get over it.\n\nNow let's talk about this movie. I agree that the acting was awful. Stanley Tucci and John Corbett are both good actors, but in this movie... It didn't work. It felt like they were acting, not living this apocalypse. It just didn't feel believable.\n\nI also didn't care about the characters. It all started too fast with no real development of this group of people. I'd say the movie needed to be longer to develop them properly, but it was soooo boring I don't think I could handle watching another 10 minutes let alone the time it would need to build this plot and make me actually care.\n\nThe creatures were fine. It could have been believable if there had some more buildup of the story, but more importantly, I think a good portion of the plot from the book was lost in translation when they wrote the script. I could see how things were supposed to come together in the end, but with the movie it felt forced and unreal.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie. I love apocalyptic fiction and I'm so sick of seeing the same movies regurgitated, so it's nice that this genre is getting some action suddenly. But this was not good. I was bored out of my mind.\n\nIt's really unfortunate."

        "review_detailed_main": "Last week, I watched The Silence (2019) on Netflix, a film that combines elements reminiscent of A Quiet Place, Bird Box, and Pitch Black, though it doesn't quite reach the same level of quality as any of them. The narrative centers on a world overrun by creatures that hunt by sound, devouring anything they hear. The story follows a family with a deaf daughter who relies on sign language for communication. As resources dwindle, society's desperation grows, leading the family to face unprecedented challenges and hardships.\n\nThis picture is directed by John R. Leonetti (Annabelle) and stars Stanley Tucci (The Lovely Bones), Kiernan Shipka (Mad Men), Miranda Otto (The Lord of the Rings) and Kate Trotter (Beyond Border).\n\nThe special effects in The Silence are impressive, effectively bringing the creatures and their menace to life. The family's struggles are engaging, and the film's conclusion is satisfying. However, it's hard to overlook the film's lack of originality, as it closely mirrors the premises of the aforementioned movies. Despite this, The Silence offers enough redeeming qualities to warrant a single viewing. While it may not achieve classic status, it's worth watching once. I would rate it a 6/10."

But if you don't take it too seriously, it's still some chill entertainment if you just want something simple to put on while treating a hangover, playing Candy Crush or whatever.\n\nWhat really annoys me though is that they clearly didn't bother to do any research into what it's like being deaf. For example, the supposedly deaf girl literally carries out a conversation with her father in a dark room with no sign language being used. And sometimes she replies to questions and comments although she's not standing face to face with that person. Yes, some deaf people can read lips but it's very difficult (and in the story, she's only been deaf for three years). She also appears to react to noises.\n\nCongrats on the Sabrina success, Kiernan. But how about putting an actual effort into a role instead of some less than halfhearted attempt at appearing deaf?"

I assume they were worried that not having any dialogue would be a problem for some audience or that they might lose some viewers if a lot of subtitle reading was needed, but they just ditched the call for silence and everyone talks. It has some interesting set pieces and your obligatory post apocalypse insane preacher type, so its got enough to pass an evenings entertainment, but its definitely behind Birdbox and Quiet Place in story and execution."

(Both follow a family surviving an apocalyptic invasion by monsters who hunt by sound.) And I suppose it is, with a bit saccharine teen drama and a neglected cult subplot shoehorned into it.\n\nBut I'd be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy it at all. I'd rate it a 7 out of 10 for being a fairly entertaining creature feature.\n\nStanley Tucci and Miranda Otto are always great to watch, and the Kiernan Shipka is a cute kid with a lot of charisma. (Am I the only guy in the world who thinks that Tucci is extremely talented? To appreciate his range, compare his milquetoast suburban dad here with his growling, menacing super-zombie in last year's \"Patient Zero.\")\n\nThe monsters were suitably revolting and well rendered, and the action sequences were mostly engaging. (The scene involving a well was well executed - no pun intended.) Maybe I'm just a kid at heart and want more creepy crawlies in my horror films, as opposed to endless demons and shrieking wraiths.\n\nHere's the key to enjoying it - think of it as a throwback to cheesy 70's monster movies like \"Kingdom of the Spiders\" or \"Damnation Alley\" (1977). We had fun with those when we were kids, didn't we?"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Silence: In a cave system deep under the Appalachians explorers break into a sealed cavern and let loose horrors. No, not inbred cannibal hillbillies, this time it's a type of Pterosaur which become known as Vespas. The creatures swiftly descend on New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Mayhem ensues as the Vespas attack and eat people. It soon becomes clear that that they hunt by sound and are blind. One family is better equipped than most to deal with the catastrophe as 16 year old Ally (Kiernan Shipka) is deaf and her family all use sign language . The father (Stanley Tucci) wants to stay put but his friend Glenn convinces the family to flee to the countryside.\n\nThere are the usual apocalyptic massive traffic jams, civilisation starts to break down and robbers try to ambush the family. In a moment of dark humour a farmer runs out shouting : Get Off My Land and discharging a shotgun, he is eaten alive by the Vespas. A mad cult arises as society further disintegrates. The Vespas are well imagined, the size of a Pterosaur you'd use for falconry. This has all the ingredients for a very good Post-Apocalypse film but the script is wanting at times and doesn't complement the effective action scenes. Good performances by Tucci and Shipka with Billy MacLellan eerily and evilly silent in a character part as the Cult leader.\n\nDirector John R. Leonetti delivers an effective Horror Thriller but it's no Classic. 6.5/10. On Netflix."

Almost feeling like their version of A Quiet Place, this film takes on the same themes & plot beats from that earlier film but this one deals w/strange creatures (released from a long undiscovered cavern) which attack the world at large w/the survivors only means of protection is you guessed it, silence (the bat monsters attack when they hear loud noises). The usual tropes assert themselves quickly (the abandoned city centers, a member of the family getting hurt needing medicine or else & a nomadic band of humans using the current apocalypse as a means to control & subjugate the remaining populace). Not bad w/some unintended scenes skirting this side of comedy but at least competently done enough to forgive the familiarity of some of the cliches."

His films start of well, then about midway through seem to lose all believability and cohesion and just become a stupid mess. This film is very much that it has a beginning, but that is about it. I'm suprised they had electric as power plant aren't the quietest even more suprised they had internet as those are run off servers as you lose power the internet will go too. I'm curious they were stuck in a underground what did they eat and why would a creature like that leave there habitat and venture out?of it's enviroment? Why did they fly out the deep cave/ mine there was two people at the entrance? What drew them out they are attracted to noise. Why were they blowing a hole in the cave/mine in the first place. So many questions and none of it is explained. It seems more like a pilot for a series that never got made. It probably would a been a good first episode but as a stand alone film. No character arch nothing. The deaf girl has a line \"i have a better chance because i live in silence\" so stupid who wrote that. She is going to have a harder time than most because she can't 1) hear the creatures and 2) she won't know how noisy she is being because she can't hear her own footsteps or if she knocks something over. She missing a sense that is vital for survival the ability to hear your predators coming and where they are coming from. Other than that the actors/ actresses are great here all great performances considering the script they were working with. Very far from this directors worse film that one falls to mortal kombat annihilation (1998)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Granted, you may have heard of two, possibly even three of the cast of this one, but the recipe is exactly the same: take some has-been and never-were actors, cobble together a by-the-numbers screenplay, and leave in a warm place to rise before filming in Film School 101 mid range shots either at night or in a forest to hide the lack of budget. Sprinkle some dreadful CGI and serve tepid.\n\nExcept this falls flatter even than most SyFy efforts. Tucci is a decent enough actor, but he's pushing 60 and looks more ready to play Thrift Store Hermione's grandfather. Miranda Otto, well, she's of a quality on par with the rest of the production. Kate Trotter is only 14 years older than Otto: that's a mother/daughter age difference that you'd normally only see in porn.\n\nTo be fair, they all make an attempt to take their roles seriously, but needn't bother because the creatures are just dire. It makes no sense why there are so many of them, and they're about as threatening as blind featherless ducks. The directing is shoddy too, as emotions of fear and grief aren't carried over from scene to scene - there's no sense of loss or building terror.\n\nThe gimmick of having a deaf character plays out poorly. Thrift Store Hermione delivers her first couple of lines as though she were retarded rather than deaf, then just doesn't bother after that. The signing between the characters is quite literally virtue signalling, ironic given that they cast a hearing actor in a deaf role.\n\nWithout subtitles (or probably even with them, to be honest) those sections are so dull to watch that I just skipped over them. Then over most of the rest of the movie.\n\nI didn't feel as though I'd missed much, and you won't either."

They do not need to look weird.\n\nCast was great. Kierman Shipka is always fun to watch. She is always cast in interesting creepy roles. I am sure the older she gets, the cooler roles she will get. Stanley Tucci plays her father and is also great. Some of the side cast die in stupid ways though.\n\nI almost feel like this would of made a better show.

Watching the trailer for The Silence even made me think this film was a prequel to A Quiet Place.\n\nHowever, the poor acting is attributed, of course, by a poorly written script that made me think the film was meant to be released in the 80s or 90s, when creature-feature situational horrors were popular and fresh.\n\nThe stale script, awkward camera angles, cheap set ups and poor characterisation made this film uninteresting. I tried my hardest to get invested in this film, feeling that perhaps Miranda Otto's character was the only one I could almost like... almost but not quite.\n\nThere seemed to be a disconnection between the family members that ruined the film's (few) immediate thrills, which seemed to diminish its value as a horror film. Likely, the faults to this film had something to do with its low budget and poor production.\n\nI wouldn't recommend watching this film unless you watched A Quiet Place first, because I gained more respect for John Krasinski's film after pushing through The Silence.\n\nAlthough, one would have to pity the author Tim Lebbon, who published the novel (The Silence) in 2015 to acclaim. Lebbon then had to endure Krasinski stealing his idea, adapting it to film, gaining higher (and well-deserved) critical acclaim for it with A Quiet Place which was released in 2018."

I really enjoyed seeing this movie. You will never get bored seeing this movie, it will keep you on the toes at all times. There is something thrilling happening in every scene. I was surprised by how good this movie was. The only thing that I thought should have been made better, was the ending. The ending was alright but could have been made better.

I think this would better suit a episodic format and would allow it explore the cult and journey to the refuge in more detail and bring up more points. The first half on the other hand, was good as it explored the societal impacts in the subway scene. The car in forest scene was one of the only moments of suspense and contained many good shots and helped the audience explore the monsters and establish there abilities. I think it was another of Netflixs attempts to recreate \"birdbox\" and it's success. There where many plot holes as many other reviews state and felt rushed overall. It was a good time killer and certainly prefer it to another superhero movie or cheap thriller and appreciate Netflix trying something rather original. I advise this for a nice rather suspenseful watch."

I felt all along that there was no element of panic in the characters. This terrible scenario was being played out but rarely did we see any reactions that I could relate to, also there was a lack any others trying to survive, the main characters just seemed to accept that they had to now flee their house and head for who knows what -- yeah right --- A scene where a family member is in dire peril under the car....kind of sums up the lack of empathy conveyed. Also the time it took for this to happen and them to adjust themselves to ok we are now fighting for our lives off we go was all too fast for my liking. The soundtrack and overall scenes and settings were great but there was a lack of realism about this that should have been conveyed."

It was fantastic.\n\nI am shocked to see that it's current ratings sit at just 5.3 here, but to be fair there are only 119 reviews so far and it's only been a day since it was released.\n\nIt's actually a brilliant, well thought into and put together movie. Definitely worth a watch for sure!!\n\nAs somebody who is a movie nut and (I'd say) a good judge of movies, trust me, it's fantastic!!\n\nThe reason so many negative reviews are up is because most people don't just review movies if it's okay or good, or even fantastic. Most people write reviews if they really didn't like it.\n\nSO what I'm saying is you be the judge- my opinion is that it was fricken brilliant, yours may be different. I personally wish I could have seen it on the big screen, but Netflix was free so eh :)"

We picked the 2019 SciFi/Horror movie \"The Silence\". A family struggles to survive when subterranean bat-like creatures (several nonillion) escape from their underground lair to wreak havoc upon all noisy surface dwellers. ( why doesn't anything ever wreak happiness?) I have not seen \"A Quiet Place\" but judging from the release dates I have an idea the \"The Silence\" may be a crappy knock off. About the movie ( no spoilers) the CGI critters weren't bad. The pacing and dialogue were good as was the music. Tucci and Shipka played their parts very well. An outstanding performance by Billy MacLellan (The Reverend) .The story had holes and in my opinion the ending was abrupt and unfortunately subpar. The Mrs. and I agree we wouldn't bother watching it again. We agree this film only deserves 1.5 Skulls out of 4. What are you watching? And as always keep it scary my friends. \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc48"

        "review_title": "\"Sense Deprivation\" Horror strikes again. Unimpressive, but definitely enjoyable with lowered expectations.",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you're anything like many others - you've already learnt to always lower your expectations before watching a Netflix original film (their shows tend to be quite impressive, or so I hear, but their films are usually mediocre at best). This attitude has honestly served me well while watching The Silence, as I've actually found myself quite entertained. While not more than average - it isn't bad and definitely didn't feel like a waste of time. Mostly unimpressive, still fun.\n\nFirst of all, I'm quite impressed with the latest movement of \"sense deprivation\" Horror films. Hush put us through the experience of a deaf victim trapped by a stalker; Bird Box (another Netflix original) has told the story of evil entities who can only afflict their victim if seen by them (therefore putting us through the experience of people forced into voluntary blindness of sorts); and now The Silence presents a scenario in which speaking above a whisper might bring upon a terrible fate, through the eyes of a family fluent in sign language (pretty \"convenient\", but serves the plot). While all these films haven't yet fulfilled the full potential of this genuine idea - all are, in my opinion, equally entertaining and rewarding in their own way.\n\nThe Silence begins with another clich\u00e9 end-of-the-world event, this time in the shape of CreepyPasta-looking deadly creatures who hunt by sound. It's actually less silly than it sounds, but not by far. The plot is very roughly and bluntly divided into three parts, each receiving pretty much the same amount of screen time: exposition (what happened, how and to whom); initial coping and survival (what do we do now?); and the encounter with the actual enemy. It pretty much felt like watching three episodes of a mini-series with at least four, as the ending is pretty disappointing and leaves too many loose ends untied (not just enough to be an intriguing and debatable open ending, just not really an ending in my opinion).\n\nNothing about The Silence is extraordinary, for better or worse. The story is okay, the acting is okay (aside from K. Shipka who was very impressive as recently-deafened Ally, managing to design her speech to be just a little off, very authentic and convincing!), the cinematography and soundtrack is okay, everything is just okay and just enough to have a good time if you don't expect to have your mind blown or your feet swept."

The cinematography is decent, although the cgi beasties look a little like they were pulled from the discard pile of a Jurassic movie and their backstory leaves something to be desired.\n\nJust as a side note to film writers out there: if you take an aggressive, carnivorous species and entomb it for a million years underground, they won't become a super apex predator, they'll become moles or snakes or something. Or more likely, they'll just die. I mean, what were they feeding on down there that they were able to breed a population millions strong? Rocks?\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure that somewhere in this movies America there is a Home Depot staff that will rise to power when they realize they can defeat the Vespa menace with a couple of wood chippers and a bunch of glue traps.\n\nThe movie ends with many questions unanswered, chief among them how the daughter was able to get Internet in a rural, back-woods cabin fast enough to have a seamless video conferencing chat with her boyfriend. Because crazy religious nut jobs with bags of weaponized cell phones I can buy, but high speed Internet in the middle of the woods after the apocalypse requires a leap of faith that I just don't know if I have in me."

I don't know if that it's possible or not, but It's the first time I've seen that interpretation of a deaf character. Why not actually casting a deaf person on the role? It's not like this is Shakespeare.\n\nAnyways, the production is much bigger and we get some well done scenes that use the tension of the concept (similar to AQP), but still not enough to justifiy other sideplots. Also the ending is so clich\u00e9. Another Netflix movie missing the opportunity of not being mainstream Hollywood.\n\nIn the end, I'm just not on board with this concept, but at least A Quiet Place committed to the \"you can't make a sound\" idea, producing a really especial kind of movie. I gave it 1 point for originality and commitment. Also freaking Emily Blunt was great.\n\nThis one has no redeeming qualities."

The acting in this movie was great in my opinion, it was enjoyable, and the plot copied a little off the recent movie\"A Quiet Place.\" However it was still pretty good-until the end. A random new character pops up, there's some new weird mysterious aspect to the movie that just felt forced. If this were a TV show and not a movie, then this new character wouldn't have been a problem; he would've added a lot to the plot line and made it more interesting, giving the show room to grow. However, being that this was a movie and only an hour and a half long at that, this new character's exit had to be rushed in a way that honestly was not very well blended with the movie. Then after the exit of this one character, there was one more bit of plot shoved into the last 3 minutes or so of the movie. The romance (not a spoiler, it's obvious from the first 10 mins of the movie) between the girl main character and this guy, Rob, was a sweet innocent addition to the plot, but the way this ending was shoved into the movie, it just didn't tie up the loose ends nicely and made everything seem squashed. If they had managed their movie time better, made this into a show, or at least left room for a sequel, then it would've been great."

Leonettis work, \"Wish Upon\" was extremely disappointing & \"Annabelle\" is my least favourite movie in the whole Conjuring-verse. \"The Silence\" is not a masterpiece either, but this time it's not only the director that can be blamed.\n\nFirst of all, We've seen all of this before - on a better level. The plot is weak, confused, choppy and too straight-forward. As a matter of fact, my favorite story detail was the inclusion of the religious fanatics, which had so much more potential. However, maybe that inclusion wasn't even needed, the story is so unfocused, jumping from thing to another, not being sure of what it wants to say. And You know what? I guess that's what happens when the script is written by the guy who wrote \"Titanic II\". It's probably a good idea for Netflix not to get involved with Asylum filmmakers - we all know what abominations go on there.\n\nThe script & the story, in my opinion, is the single biggest flaw here, for it can mess up a lot of other aspects. I can't complain much about acting - everybody did their best, even Stanley Tucci tried - but how much can actor bring out of a weak script & a vague character? One thing that wasn't below average was the cinematography - decent camera work, nice color grading etc. Regarding the visuals, the cgi is quite noticeable in more than two scenes. Oh, the soundtrack was pretty fine, I was impressed by the title sequence - but that was all I was impressed by.\n\nIt's not much about anything, not really about bats, maybe about the good, old family values. Not the brightest example. Don't get me wrong though - \"The Silence\" offers entertainment, but for me this was the 919th horror movie & it will join the forgettable ones. My rating: 4/10.An Unoriginal Effort, A One Time Entertainment"

Main gripe is Stanley Tuchi's character did more sign than the deaf girl who was talking while everyone else was being quiet. There was also the problem of the vesps (or whatever they're called) reacting to some sounds but not others and they seemed to see ok. Yep, a few holes here and there but acting was great, their actions more believable than most movies like this and a little too similar to 'A Quiet Place' and 'Bird Box' but still a good watch.\n\nIt's a 6 cos I love watching Stan the man doing what he does best...."

I know that there are those who will argue that it's just acting, but this takes the role away from authentically deaf actresses who already have enough trouble finding roles. An OK way to pass time, but no comparison to \"A Quiet Place\".\n\nThat one scene did come across as a neat homage to \"Fargo\", though."

The monsters( Vesps) were quite boring and simple. I was sad to see that Kiernan Shipka was given the role of a deaf girl seeing that there's still a huge lack of deaf people being offered big roles on tv, this gives an impression the casting directors didn't really care about whether the opportunity was given to a deaf person. There is a lot of talking and noise going on when the monsters are known to be around which doesn't make the watcher nervous about if they will be heard or not, contrary to in A Quiet Place where every move that seemed a little loud had the audience at he edge of their seat. The challenges the characters have to face in silence are mostly not that exciting. It seems nothing can top Emily Blunt giving birth in the bath tub after all. The movie does have some interesting and tense interaction between people in and outside of the protagonist family but it would've been better if there was more of it. Overall the movie was mediocre and the ending was boringly predictable."

Characters are added in the eleventh hour to enforce plot points and as such are underdeveloped and two dimensional. In addition; characters which are well established often have their key plot points abandoned at random, to be replaced with secondary plot points of other characters with which they are able to engage in. This script should never have left a board room. And the editor should have set fire to his computer rather than present this stilted dumpster fire a completed project."

All departments did an underwhelming job here from writing to direction to visual effects to sound design. The cult angle in the final act was quite simply the nail in the coffin. One could spend the entirety of 90 minutes questioning logic and decision-making in every scene but I'd advise against it. This is Netflix's definition of a cash grab."

There is too much random happenstance focusing on not just insignificant but completely irrelevant characters. The story isn't particularly interesting and the premise never really takes hold. I never began caring about any of the characters. The monster doesn't ever even seem like a real threat.

She acts and talks as if she could hear everything fine, in fact, she sometimes forgets to use sign language. When her boyfriend was barely using sign language over facetime, she had no problem communicating with him. When she was explaining her dad about Vesps weakness etc., she talks fast and doesn't even bother using sign language (of course, it's because this actress can't memorize all the lines with sign language, I know, but still). I don't really see the point of this setting though in this movie. In A Quiet Place, they used the back story very effectively and made the film so original.\n\nP.S. Total waste of Stanley Tucci.

The timing is a little vague but how is it possible for a group of people obsessed with breeding come together so quickly? It's not even an apocalypse yet ! Okay, sorry, done.\n\nSo I watched this right after seeing World War Z and it's always evident when something is based on a book. They just try to cover too much ground in too short a period. They bounce from one location to another, one set up to another, and add these characters they are ridiculously underwritten. The 'Uncle Glenn' guy...the boyfriend....grandmother...cabin lady...Creepy Apocalyptic Cult phone girl and priest? All unnecessary and underdeveloped. Hell, even the younger son was a waste of script. I had the same issue with World War Z. Because it's a 2 hr or less movie, they fly past these characters before we barely know their names.

The dad then tells everyone to silence their phones. Yup, nevermind the TV or the barking dog, rogue cell phones are real threat. The daughter deduces that major cities would naturally be the most dangerous due to all the activity, so despite living what appears to be in a suburb, they decide that staying indoors isn't safe and the best thing to do is hop in a car and drive to who-knows-where. Of course, in the very next scene they PASS BY A MAJOR CITY on the highway!\n\nAfter that, things progress as you would expect, with more braindead decisions (like never closing doors, video calling with the sound on) causing trouble along the way.\n\nI might be in the minority but I liked the bats, especially since they do provide good shots of them and the CGI isn't too bad."

A Quiet Place was a slightly overrated solid thriller. The Silence is garbage.\n\nI'm sorry, I usually try not to judge films like this, but damn this film is something. It's just such a weird mix of stupid premise (although, apparently based on a book or something), bad story, horrible directing (and as a result inappropriate and confused acting), inconsistent pacing (the first 30 minutes are just insane rush, then we get an hour of slow burn), satisfactory CGI, interesting cinematography and ok music.\n\nIt's interesting how good garbage b-movies can look today with relatively low budgets. I'm sorry for the crew and the actors since it really feels like they did their job the best they could. The direction just isn't there. Leonetti can produce great shots and interesting color correction and vignette, but he can't direct Stanley Tucci to deliver a line appropriately for a scene that is supposed to be in the film for a reason besides just looking good. Why is the film 90 minutes long? Make it 2 hours, establish, dwell on scenes, make it immersive, add more human element (just copy the films that did this well, like the Mist), you have to try. Well-shot rushed scenes of nonsense are neither interesting or entertaining. And please, the amount of stupid decisions made by this family is enough only for 10 or 15 minutes of their survival in such a situation.\n\nI did not enjoy this film and I cannot recommend it to anyone."

        "review_title": "Too many similarities with other recent movies.",
        "review_detailed_main": "What the hell does that mean? \"Don't make noise.\"\n\nThere are still certainties in this world. First of all, you can expect that if a type of movie has enormous success, something similar will appear in no time. A matter of surfing on the wave of success, I guess. \"The Silence\" resembles, for instance, the successful film \"A Quiet Place\". It's not exactly the same thing, but there are a huge number of similarities with the latter (And yes I know both films were made almost simultaneously and it's based on a novel from 2015. But still!). And then it appears once again that humans are the cause of problems. So this time no space monsters with a sophisticated hearing organ, like in \"A Quiet Place\". Now there are some over-enthusiastic speleologists who can't resist sticking their noses into something out of curiosity. In particular, a cave that they have discovered. Cries of joy are quickly replaced by cries of fear and hysterical whining, the moment they break through the cave wall. What these human moles didn't realize was that they were about to release some prehistoric bat-like creatures into the world. Beings who, after years of living in the dark, only rely on their hearing so they can find another victim. Best advice? Be silent.\n\nThe biggest difference with \"A Quiet Place\" is the unveiling of the bloodthirsty, ruthless flying monsters. In \"A Quiet Place\" it took a while. In \"The Silence\" you don't have to wait that long before you see the little monsters at work. Yet there are several similarities to be discovered. So the word plagiarism is very quickly dangling off the tip of your tongue. Again it's about a family with two children with daughter Ally (Kiernan Shipka) also having a hearing problem. Although not congenital but because of a terrible accident in which her grandparents also perish. Here too there are certain confounding factors among the family members that could put others life at risk. In \"A Quiet Place\" it was a newborn baby whose crying was a lure for the terrible creatures. Here it's grandmother Lynn (Kate Trotter) with an annoying cough and the dog Otis who barks all the time. And just like in \"Bird Box\" there is a safe haven where everyone is heading for.\n\n\"The silence\" clearly has similarities with a whole bunch of other movies. The disadvantage is that you have an early feeling of haven't-we-seen-this-already-before. Even though it is all a bit more action-packed and at certain moments more exciting. On the other hand, it's true that not showing the imminent danger immediately (such as in \"A Quiet Place\") ensures that you'll be waiting with bated breath for that revelation. The biggest difference lies in the religious aspect that's incorporated in the story. The Apocalypse breaks out and before you know it there's some ingenious person who immediately starts a cult.\n\nAs with any religion, this self-proclaimed religious leader also introduces a dogma that makes it impossible to jeopardize the cult through unexpected, loud noises. The dogma involves a radical intervention on the followers. It is hoped that none of them will get stomach flu, with noisy flatulence as a result. Or that one of the short-sighted followers is a bit too obese, which makes that moving around is quite noisy. Away tactical advantage, I would say. In short, another proof that religion cannot be associated with logical reasoning. On the other hand, they were interested in the fertility of the young girl. Well, that says a lot.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the film is full of such pathetic ridiculous things. Actually, it was already stupid of them to ride off in a noisy car. And of course, they flee, even though the authorities advised to stay indoors. And wasn't there anyone smart enough to simply keep the wood chipper running constantly? Maybe an annoying, maddening noise. But anything's better than being eaten by naked, bat-like flying dinosaurs. With united forces, they could easily have destroyed the colony of animals in one fell swoop. Or were there really so many of these creatures? And nobody here who thinks to throw an object to mislead these creatures? Nope. They do things the hard way and start waving around with a mop.\n\nFortunately, the acting performances weren't of a lousy low level. It's always a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci at work. Although I thought his personage was more interesting in \"Patient Zero\". Unfortunately, that movie wasn't very good. Apparently, there's also a lot of criticism from the deaf community about the non-deaf Kiernan Shipka playing the role of Ally. According to them, it's impossible for her to understand what it feels like to be deaf and also that her sign language wasn't flawless. Could be. But I don't agree with regard to empathizing with her character. Couldn't a talented actress or actor empathize to such an extent that it comes across as convincing? I assume that Denzel Washington and Nicolas Cage don't have a drinking problem. And yet their interpretations as an alcoholic in \"Flight\" and \"Leaving Las Vegas\" were damn realistic enough for me. And I am able to objectively assess that, believe me. And finally admiration for Kyle Breitkopf as the younger brother Jude.\n\nAll in all, this film is the weakest one from the \"Netflix Originals\" stable. As a horror, it's a total failure. It's never really scary or exciting. The tension is removed by portraying the scary animals very early in the film. This type of film involves more than just portraying a lot of hysterically screaming people (which in turn has bad consequences for them). No, there are certainly better alternatives to view. And if you don't know which one I mean, I recommend a reread."

        "review_detailed_main": "To give you an idea of what level of filmmaking The Silence is, the first goof listed on IMDb is the premise itself, and what absolute nonsense it is. One gets the feeling that this movie was slapped together just so we could cap the unofficial \"Speak No Evil, See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" trilogy, which also includes last year's A Quiet Place and Bird Box. At least, so I thought at first.\n\nA Quiet Place was about creatures that find and kill you if you make noise, ergo being mute is an advantage; \"speak no evil\". Bird Box featured bizarre entities that drive you mad if you look at them, ergo being blind is an advantage; \"see no evil\". It seemed we finally had one for deafness and \"hear no evil\": a film about monsters whose sound kills their prey. Missed opportunity, sez I, because it turns out The Silence is a different, stupider take on A Quiet Place, yet they still use deafness as a plot point - not that it is much of a defense against prehistoric birdies who hunt YOU by YOUR sound.\n\nThe hearing loss of Ally Andrews (Kiernan Shipka) isn't even that useful to the story. It just serves to explain why she and her family can communicate silently and thus not attract the attention of the Vesps quite as easily as other people. Fat load of good that does when Vesps start swarming the vehicle of Ally's father Hugh (Stanley Tucci) and the grandmother starts coughing up a storm due to cancer (an equally dignified scare involves a ringtone). Shove a character with asthma in there and you should have all the Ailment Clich\u00e9s down. There's a cute dog too but, well, at least they don't go the clich\u00e9d \"disaster movie\" route with it.\n\nThe rest of the Andrews family consists of Miranda Otto as mommy Kelly and a small boy who was only selected because \"pah, he's just a kid so nobody's gonna care if he can't act very well\". John Corbett plays the best friend of Tucci's character. None of these names are enough of a saving grace in such a tediously, exhaustingly unoriginal movie.\n\nOne last person worth mentioning is The Reverend, a man who lost his tongue and now leads a \"silent cult\". He's one of those people who appear in films like this because some directors deem monster/disaster movies in need of human bad guys.\n\nI am not fluent in American Sign Language, but as I mentioned the act of \"not giving a crap\" with regards to the casting, I'll be extra harsh by paraphrasing deaf actor Nyle Dimarco, who claims that Shipka's ALS grammar is rather flawed and doesn't justify the casting of her over someone who genuinely experiences deafness. ASL is another thing that A Quiet Place did better, I guess, along with its more clever and apt use of sound editing. I don't want to keep bringing it up, but The Silence forces me to.\n\nQuartz Magazine even went so far as lumping this film in with \"mockbusters\", i.e. hastily made knock-offs of famous films made exclusively to confuse buyers in the video store (or users of the streaming service in this case), often produced by companies like The Asylum and Video Brinquedo. Not fair? Well, apparently one of the writers of The Silence has worked on several Asylum projects, such as Paranormal Entity and The Day the Earth Stopped.\n\nI don't know what the budget was compared to a garden-variety Asylum picture, but the Vesps aren't much to look at, even if they're technically superior to the Sharknado sharks. It's always strange when films like this opt out of the \"less is more\" principle of leaving the monsters to our imagination, which can be very effective. These beasts are not ready for their close-up.\n\nTucci has his moments, there are one or two tense sequences, and something terrible happens to a baby one time - those are my positives. Within the tsunami of interesting Netflix content we've had this year, The Silence will just be sitting there until they delete it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this movie with more than a little bias. After all, didn't Emily Blunt just star in a movie with the very SAME premise?? Hello? Ever hear of \"A Quiet Place\"? So forgive me if I'm totally unimpressed.\n\nThis is quite literally the same movie with different beasts, down to the deaf girl. \"Bird Box\" was close enough IMO but I guess Netflix wanted to go for the full rip off and came out with this.\n\nInstantly I had to give it a zero for originality--on multiple levels. There are a slew of post-apocalypse movies and shows that \"The Silence\" liberally borrowed from. And you would think with all of the apocalyptic data out there ready for consumption that just once there'd be a person/family/group smart enough to know when they're confronting a dangerous person that needs to be neutralized immediately. Yet, time and time again the hearts bleed and the doors open or the weapons lower to let the cunning lunatic live only to cause considerable harm later.\n\nTruly, I'm surprised they greenlighted this movie. \"A Quiet Place\", along with being first, was much better. At least in \"A Quiet Place\" they had the courtesy to give us subtitles for the broken sign language they were doing. In this movie they left people to guess what was being said. But I'll go one farther: \"Descent,\" which they kind of borrowed from as well--and was probably the original \"be quiet\" scary movie--was better than this. Maybe in 2017 this would've been good, but in 2019, after a really good movie with the same plot: not so good."

Shocker, the weird pterodactyls hunt by sound!\n\nI don't know, I felt that A Quiet Place was a unique, artistic piece of work that broke the barriers of scary movies. It's a shame to see this attempt to emulate the movie so horribly, with horribly acting (how does the deaf girl speak perfectly? Why is her ASL so horrible? At least ATTEMPT to be inclusive.), and a copied storyline. I did watch it all the way through and it was not worth it. It was only entertaining because my boyfriend and I picked out the VERY obvious flaws.\n\nTL;DR: Watch it if you want to laugh at the flaws of a movie trying to be A Quiet Place."
