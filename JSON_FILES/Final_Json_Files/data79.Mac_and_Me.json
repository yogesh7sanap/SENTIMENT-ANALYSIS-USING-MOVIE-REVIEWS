        "review_detailed_main": "\"Mac and Me\" was one of the more infamous box office duds of its time. While this would dissuade normal folks from watching it, bad movie buffs like me naturally gravitate to it because it is such a legendary flop. The biggest reason it failed--the public quickly saw it for what it really was--a blatant rip-off of \"E.T.\". And, this time even MORE corporate references are thrown in the viewer's face...with McDonald's and Coke references galore!! Instead of Reese's Pieces, they feed this god-awful corporate shill Skittles! And, to revive Mac's family who are on the edge of death, they feed them Coke!!!\n\nThe film begins with an incredibly ugly family of aliens mysteriously getting sucked into a US space probe. They are then deposited on Earth and their baby, Mac, is lost and must find its way home. In the process it meets a nice disabled kid and makes his life complete. But, when it's no longer safe, he and Elliot, I mean Eric, go on a cross- country race to find his parents and get him home--and evade capture. And to do this, they dress him up in a Halloween-type costume! Need I continue?!\n\nSo is the film any good? Well, if \"ET\" had never been made, sure it would have been reasonably entertaining to very young kids who didn't notice that the film was a giant commercial and who wouldn't notice the bad dialog and abounding clich\u00e9s. But \"ET\" HAD BEEN ALREADY MADE several years earlier...so the film has zip when it comes to originality. You wonder how the folks associated with the film felt--they must have been really embarrassed at how blatant this was. And, at just about every turn it seems to do it worse than \"ET\"...and often MUCH worse. It's a vacuous, soul-sucking corporate mess of a film in so many ways.\n\nWhen I saw this film tonight, it was decades after its original release and I was startled how ugly and expressionless Mac was. However, I had to remind myself that ET also looks pretty crappy when you see him today because we are used to much better special effects in 2015--though Mac is definitely crappier. The worst is when the dead, expressionless doll is riding on Eric's lap during the big chase! As for the outer space scene, however, I watched it on a very big screen TV and I was surprised because it looked so nice. This space scene along with actually hiring a disabled kid to play a disabled kid are about the only things that impressed me about the film. Otherwise, a pointless rip-off from start to finish---and not even bad enough to make bad movie buffs laugh. But enough overt corporate references to make this a GREAT film to use as a drinking game--taking a shot every time you saw these blatant ads! Believe me, you would get stinking drunk if you tried this!!\n\nBy the way, the kid calls the hideous little alien 'Mac'--an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature. In no way was this meant to be like 'ET' for the Extra-Terrestrial....yeah, right! Also, perhaps it's just me, but this might just be the most whitebread, corporate and uncool film ever made--especially during the god-awful McDonald's dance scene."

        "review_detailed_main": "I know it's a little silly to write a review of a film 15 years after its release. But this poorly done film made its way onto one of my cable movie channels last night, and I feel the need to have a violent, outward reaction outside of the projectile vomiting I experienced.\n\nPeople, this film is bad. Really bad. Bad like \"Showgirls\" bad, where it's so bad, it's both insulting and laughable simultaneously. And forgive me, but anybody who finds this 95-minute commercial for McDonalds and Coca-Cola to be warm-hearted or well done in any way knows not a thing about what makes a movie good, and needs a great deal of emotional counseling.\n\nFirst, let's reiterate that point about this being an extended commercial. Folks, it is. The product placement in this film is shameless.\n\nNext, there are basic things that make a film \"good,\" like strong acting, a well-written script, superior camerawork or quality special effects. \"Mac and Me\" has none of these. Wooden posts would have made for better actors. The script clunks and thuds with every ridiculous, uninspired line. And the alien creatures of the film, with their bug-eyes and protruding bellies, look about a life-like as melted candles.\n\nI also have to make a point of just how much of a rip-off of \"E.T.\" this film was. Not only is the plot just a poor carbon copy, but even the title of this attrocity becomes an act of thievery when it's revealed that \"Mac\" stands for \"Mysterious Alien Creature.\" I'm not even the biggest fan of uber-cutesy \"E.T.\" either, but at least there the attempts at manipulation are somewhat subtle. Here, the filmmakers fell just short of subtitles at the bottom of the screen that said \"LAUGH HERE\" and/or \"CRY NOW.\"\n\nAnd the cherry atop Stewart Rafill's bile sundae? The scene inside a McDonald's (Our aforementioned sponsor) when normal, everyday patrons suddenly and spontaneously spring to life into a choreographed dance sequence. Yeh, that happens at the Greasy Mac's on Route 1 near my house every freakin' day.\n\nSaps only will buy into laughable hunk of junk... for the rest of you out there, I recommend this movie only if you're looking for new additions to your Ten Worst List."

Also perplexing were the jogging scene with musical score (even Phil Collins at his worst would have been an improvement) and the cameo by that annoying red-headed kid from 'Different Strokes'. Perhaps someone who has watched the movie repeatedly and considers it a cult favorite could enlighten us....?\n\nI do like the fact that the producers cast a kid in a wheelchair as the star, but the writing was awful and the plot was laughably bad. It was an ET knock-off right up to the end, where you will find a shocking conclusion rivaled only by \"The Usual Suspects\"!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I love kids movies. I have two children and have always enjoyed watching their movies along with them. I worked in an elementary school for several years and have seen a plethora of fantastic children movies.\n\nBut this movie was terrible. In fact, I rate it as the worst movie I have ever seen. Why? Several reasons...\n\n1. It is a blatant attempt to ride the coattails of ET and similar alien-friend movies from this era. Unfortunately, I think it sat on the wrong coat.\n\n2. The film used pity tactics to attempt to draw in your emotions rather than effective writing or visuals, and those tactics failed miserably.\n\n3. The special effects were horrible even for the time. I can relate to chronological limitations in relation to special effects and can respect a film that meets or exceeds the effects available for it's time. But there were plenty of good sfx films out by the time this film was released and this one simply didn't bother with any sfx budget.\n\n4. The dialog was awful. This is an example where no amount of good acting could compensate for the dialog.\n\n5. In relation to reason #4, there was no good acting to attempt to overcome the bad dialog. That might not even be the blame of the actors themselves, as there are simply times when you can't rise above your surroundings.\n\n6. The cheesy marketing and glaring promotions within the film take an already terrible movie and turn it into a true mockery.\n\n7. I have seen B-Movies that were more enjoyable to watch. However, out of morbid curiosity, I watched this film from opening to closing credits.\n\nFrom start to finish, from effects to acting, from dialog to directing - Mac and Me is a very bad movie. Just because a film is made for children does not mean it's OK to be terrible. Children's films, just like any genre, have a majority of moderately enjoyable films, a number of gems, and their share of stinkers. This is a true stinker.\n\nAnd yes - my children thought this movie was horrible, too."

Anyone who can't see the exploitation for what it is must be obtuse to the point of imbecility.\n\nThe little alien is badly designed. It's incredibly ugly, and the only time when the aliens stand-out favorably is when they do their haunting whistling. Otherwise, forget it.\n\nThe lead in this, Jade Calegory, deserves some praise. He never let his own real-life disability slow him down and he's actually a pretty accomplished actor. It's a shame that he had to be in this. If he ever had hopes of an acting career, it was effectively MURDERED by his appearance here. It had to be embarrassing for him, unless he's got thicker skin than I give him credit for.\n\nI do, however, have one wish: if anyone who is reading this can make it happen, PLEASE put this out on Region 1 DVD, at least!

        "review_detailed_main": "As is to be expected, in the wake of the very successful E.T., some massively derivative imitators were released. In '86 Flight of the Navigator used Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman voice as that of an alien ship which befriends a boy who just wants to get home. To be sure that was a smarmy, 2nd-hand effort. But by far, the other much worse product came with 1988's \"Mac and Me.\" This was so much more appalling, that \"Navigator\" was instantly blown out of everyone's collective memory. Mac and Me is so heinous that it could melt the brains of the unborn.\n\nRemarkably, the movie is so burdened by wall-to-wall garbazh, that stealing the entire plot of another movie could be the least of it's problems.\n\nAn unrelated movie, called \"East Side Story,\" came out in 1997. It's a sort of \"That's Entertainment!\" of Soviet era propagandistic musical numbers on topics as naff as productivity objectives, living in a workers paradise, ideological purity, etc.. Mmmm... delicious! That's what you get when the machinery of state has no natural competitors. But \"Mac and Me\" is what capitalism would be bringing you morning, noon and night if powerful fans of ca$h never had their avarice checked by people who know better; critics and people with taste. As one cynical remark goes: If Thomas Edison had an MBA he would have just kept making larger candles.\n\nThis speed-course in half-assed, capitalist film-making includes, as noted, a plot lifted intact from a more successful movie (Why reinvent the wheel?), takes the form of a 90 minute McDonalds commercial (You want to lose 90 minutes of selling time?), interrupted by Coke commercials, has an alien that looks like a 4 dollar rubber fetus (because it is a 4 dollar rubber fetus), a (sym)pathetic hero in a wheelchair, and a script produced after sniffing the finest glue one could buy at the 99 cent store. Did $omebody $ay MAC-Donald$?\n\nSomehow the execs didn't imagine we'd notice the endless shilling, maybe 200 percent more than in a typical movie, while taking their express-elevator ride to profit hell. So let's acknowledge these brave geniuses, who strived to make capitalism safe for uh... more capitalism, by name so they make it into the history books; Producers Mark Damon, William B. Kerr, and R.J. Louis; AND so this review is inescapably linked to their names in internet search results.\n\nOf course there are questions that capitalism does't answer. Why do the aliens heads look like human scrotums? Why do they walk like babies with a load in their diapers? Why do they like whistling the first few notes of \"Happy Trails (to you)?\"\n\nThis is the lowest point in movie history, in any country, ever. Whoever would try to displace this as the \"Worst Movie Ever Made\" must first use it as a checklist to make sure their movie fails as spectacularly in as many places."

The dialog is terrible, the direction is messy and unfocused and the pacing is too sluggish for itself. The acting is not only over-the-top, but completely wooden with the exception of Jade Calegory for his emotional performance as the main lead. Even the script is lifeless with moments that are completely unfunny and lacks some wit, charm, and heart to it. The second saving grace, much like Jade Calegory's performance, goes to the music from Alan Silvestri. Not exactly his best score, but still pretty good.\n\nOverall, Mac and Me isn't exactly the worst movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible film that needs to be avoided. A sequel was planned, but given the horrible reception in this piece of crap and it's failure at the box office, it never got made."

So, I went to YouTube (no way was I going to plunk down one red cent to rent this piece 'o crap) and proved myself right.\n\nBad acting, shameless product placement,the most stupid looking aliens in cinematic history and totally unoriginal storyline (E.T. anyone?), not to mention an 80's break dance scene included for no apparent reason only makes one wonder how this could have made it to \"straight-to-video\" let alone theatrical release. And don't get me started on the ending!\n\nIn other words, I Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, HATE this movie-uh,I mean this McDonalds commercial.\n\nRating: a redundant 0 out of *****"

        "review_detailed_main": "If there was ever a movie that most likely funded entirely on product placement, \"Mac and Me\" is that movie. I stumbled across it on cable and had to rent the film to get the full effect. It involves the predictable \"E.T.\" theme with an alien stranded on Earth and he must rely on children to get him back to his family. These \"Mysterious Alien Creature\"s , or \"MAC\"s, are an amazing bunch that can be literally sucked into a vacuum tube, conduct electricity with their hands and still be able to swim and take showers, and can be rescued from death by drinking Coca Cola.\n\nThe main character in the movie is Eric, a wheelchair-bound boy who moves with his family from Illinois to California so his mom can work at Sears and somehow afford a 3 bedroom house. The family is so oblivious to what goes on around them that they fail to see the Mac wandering around the house, standing behind them and reading the newspaper in front of their house. Not even driving a mini car down the street being chased by a pack of dogs is enough to divert their attention. After being lured down a steep hill by the ever-whistling Mac and surviving a 500 foot drop into the water, Eric vows to catch the creature. After a scene involving a dummy attached to a vacuum cleaner being spun around and pulled on a track, the Eric and Mac meet face to face. They become fast friends and eventually they attend the infamous party at McDonalds. This party includes a dance contest that seems to take place both inside and outside of McDonalds and a rare appearance by Ronald McDonald himself. Carefully trying to avoid detection by advancing federal agents, Mac does a solo dance routine on the McDonalds sales counter wearing a teddy bear outfit. The agents do eventually catch on and chase Eric down a hill and for ,what it seemed like, 10 miles on foot to Sears.\n\nAt this point, I had to check if this movie was made in Canada but it wasn't. It just made no sense whatsoever and begged the question \"why?\" about nearly everything. The acting was horrible, the effects were miserable and it actually seemed as though they tried to make a good movie. That is why it has found a place in my heart along with the old MST3K movies I remember seeing. I liken it to a car wreck.....they are never good to see, but you just have to look."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1982, Steven Spielberg's film E.T. was released, and it was a lovely movie that gained critical attention, and did very well at the box office. Mac and Me seems to have the opinion \"Why not cash in on someone else's success?\" This is a bad rip-off if I've ever seen one. It probably would've been better if Mac and Me copied E.T. scene by scene, because though it would've been an even bigger rip-off, it would have at least retained some of the magic E.T. had. As it stands this is a weird flick, and in no way can it be qualified as magical.\n\nSome aliens are on their planet when a NASA spacecraft lands and vacuums them up. They end up on Earth, and all four of them escape. Three escape into the desert, and the youngest one, Mac, ends up in a suburban area, where he meets paraplegic Eric and his family. It's hard to come up with any more plot synopsis, as this film has no plot. The F.B.I. is after Mac, and they search high and low for him, from the busy streets, to the crazy dance hall known as McDonalds. Chaos ensues as Mac tries to find his family and the idiot F.B.I. agents try to find him.\n\nThis movie has been criticized galore for it's constant references to products. Basically, this is a 90 minute long commercial. Coca Cola is constantly shown on screen, and some scenes play off as actual Coke TV spots. McDonalds is often mentioned, and this film is mother to the infamous synchronized McDonalds dance scene, which is as lame and corny as any other dance scene ever. Skittles also appear frequently and Mac loves them, so should you. Buy Skittles, buy McDonalds, buy Coca Cola and buy any other product we jam in your face. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth that Skittles, McDonalds and Coke would only worsen.\n\nThe acting is OK. It's about standard for an average kid's flick, despite that this was well below average all together. The puppet of Mac was about as real looking as Kermit the Frog, if not less so. Mac, and his family, always had their mouth in the same circular position, and instead of walking, Mac seemed to roll along as though being wheeled around by a talentless puppeteer. Mac is an ugly puppet, as his family are downright scary looking.\n\nDozens of mistakes can be seen throughout the movie, but this is a small thing compared to the incompetence of the rest of the movie. Start a drinking game where you take a shot every time you spot a Mac and Me mistake. I guarantee you won't make it to the end of the movie.\n\nHorrible writing...one awful line after the next! As Mac rides on a remote control car towards a girl and her mother, the mother asks, \"Is that guy crazy or something?\" Does a remote control car look like a guy? That doesn't even make sense. The little girl should have replied, \"No idiot! Are you blind?\" The little handicapped boy is blamed for messing up a room, yet he obviously cannot get out of his wheelchair, but still his mother punishes him. Nice woman, very practical thinker. Eric rides his wheelchair through the street with Mac on his lap as the F.B.I. chases him. Cars are crashing to avoid hitting him, and he just mindlessly rolls away. He should've been locked up for that. What a careless little creep.\n\nI like the musical score here. It's like a good rip-off of John William's score for E.T., but not as good. Still, it's the best part of the movie.\n\nOverall, this movie is just awful. The special effects are bad, the writing is horrendous and the commercials are plentiful. This is recommended only for enthusiasts of cinema that equals a long painful enema.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins. PG for brief mild language and violence."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is ONE those movies, that as a kid the trailer tricked me into thinking it was going to be good. I'm sorry to say, that after I finally saw it in my fifth grade class, I was truly appalled and disappointed in it after seeing it.Please bare with me, because I had not seen it since 1989.\n\nI think the teachers did it to get back at many of us for misbehaving in class. Here is my somewhat short summary about it. It all starts on a distant planet, where the aliens use reeds as straws to sip a drink in the ground. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be a race of stretchy, elongated cows or goats, but thats what they kind of looked like to me.\n\nA satellite sent to space, lands and starts collecting dirt and rock samples, but when the aliens get too close, it decides to collect them too. It arrives back home at the (NASA I think ) space station, and when the scientists open it, they escape. While trying to escape to the desert, the baby, alien calf gets lost. Now, all that I've told you so far may make the story seem great, but it starts to take a nose dive once they start the overkill; with product placement.\n\nIf this is what they were going to do, why didn't they simply make fun of product placement in movies, in this movie? It could've been a true cult classic right there, and possibly a landmark movie. I'm not sure how they would've worked those aliens in there, but someone with creative talent could've pulled it off. Maybe in order for Mac and Me to truly be saved, someone like Frank Oz needs to rewrite the script.\n\nJust like he did with Little Shop Of Horrors. Now that movie was turned into gold. Really, it needs a better script without it being bogged down with the said product placement, a better middle without the dorky dance scene, and a much better ending. As long as they don't pollute it with gross out toilet humor, like most so called crappy kiddie films out there.\n\nThat is the only good thing I can say about this turkey, it don't have flatulent jokes in it. Or evil bratty kids for that matter. Also the look of the aliens needs a lot of work. They not only look like they are half asleep, but the adults look absolutely creepy, like something you might see in a carnival fun house. They could use better colors too, not look like dried out leather. Maybe make them look like green martians or something. Really, it is so bad it makes Pod People almost look good! Unless you plan to do a truly excellent remake, don't bothering watching.\n\nLet your kids watch Flight Of The Navigator, Batteries Not Included and E.T. instead."

This terrible film wasn't only a horrible rip-off of \"ET\", but it had a dance sequence in a McDonald's. Isn't that enough information to understand how bad this film was? Even the little alien was butt ugly. I'm not sure what the makers of this film were thinking. Why they'd even try to make a cheesy rip-off doesn't make a lot of sense. It was more blatant in 1988, but even now it looks pretty crass. A Horrible film! Miss this Disaster!"

The box alone was more than adequate warning of how horrible this film truly is. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of glimpsing it one day on television and mistakenly figured I'd watch at little to see how bad it was.\n\nI can think of nothing good about this film. The horrid creature, \"Mac\", is so poorly made that it is truly disturbing. This was the primary impetus for me turning it off because I simply couldn't stand to see that thing one second more. In addition, the acting is utterly abysmal and what I saw of the story appeared to be a moronic rip off of already tired elements from E.T., itself not exactly a great cinematic achievement.\n\nApparently, there is much more about this film that is awful, such as alleged Coke and McDonald's plugs and dance routines, etc., but I couldn't stand the film long enough for those elements to lodge themselves in my brain and I cannot personally comment on them. Suffice it to say, that this film is an absolute monstrosity even without those added negatives.\n\nNormally I do not write opinions of films unless I have seen basically the whole thing, but I felt that in this instance, I had adequate exposure, and my opinion was strong enough, that a comment was appropriate."

An E.T. rip off about 5 years too late. And not only that, it rips off a major moment from STARMAN, right down to the aliens walking through fire. The level of product placement is astounding. I haven't seen this much Coke on screen since BLOW (ah, boo yourself!). I counted 15 moments where characters offer up a Coke (Skittles and McDonalds get off light compared to that). Seriously, one could start a Coca-Cola drinking game with this but I fear people participating might have their teeth rot out by the end of the 90 minutes. I will say that I like the alien designs better than the horrifically ugly E.T., even if these aliens do look like Imogene Coca in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION. I will also give the production credit for casting a real boy in a wheelchair in the lead. I will give them a hug and kiss for throwing said boy off a cliff. Again, what in the world were they thinking? I give this a 10 for being so amazingly blatant."

None come to mind so I tend to view it in a different light than most. I do remember the McDonalds scene, and Jade going down a hillside in his wheelchair. It definitely isn't an Oscar contender but if your between the ages of 4-11 you may get some entertainment out of it, a fun companion movie to E. T or flight of the navigator. Another fun nostalgia film if you grew up in the 80's is the 1974 Jack and the beanstalk cartoon."

Same alien being chased by NASA. Same older brother, with the sister now being a neighbor.\n\nThe movie is notorious for its McDonalds product placement. I had heard that the movie was one big McDonalds commercial, and that is not really a fair statement. However, there is about a five-minute scene featuring Ronald McDonald, many choreographed dancers, and McDonalds food galore. It really serves no purpose other than to make McDonalds look like a fun place to be (which it generally is not)."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, so what's the worst thing about \"Mac and Me\"? Is it that the movie is a blatant \"E.T.\" ripoff? Or is it that the movie is essentially a 90-minute commercial (complete with a dance sequence in a McDonald's)? Whatever the answer is, the point is that this movie is the celluloid equivalent of a human rights abuse. It has NO good qualities, not a single one (it was incidental that this was Jennifer Aniston's debut). I have seen a number of crummy movies that turned out to have sort of an enjoyable side. Hell, I even took \"Myra Breckinridge\" and \"Mommie Dearest\" seriously (no, really, I did). But \"Mac and Me\" is probably the movie that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank could've shown Mike, Servo and Crow to make them go insane on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". For the life of me I cannot figure out why Steven Spielberg didn't sue the makers of \"Mac and Me\" for copying \"E.T.\" (then again, maybe it's better that he didn't, since it would've given the ripoff undeserved publicity).\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this litany of awfulness regularly shows up on lists of the worst movies ever made. It makes any Ed Wood movie look like a cross between \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\". Thankfully, audiences recognized it for what it was and it bombed, and so there was no sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "I only knew about Mac and Me (1988), from the Paul Rudd comedy-bit, that he has done on every appearance, he ever made on the Conan O'Brien show, over the last 20 years. The infamous scene of the wheelchair going over the cliff is a huge part of that bit. Finally, over 35 years after the release of the film, I saw Mac and Me (1988), after reading, that it's one of the worst movies ever made. So, I went into this movie with a very open mind and what I have concluded is, it's a very weird movie. I really wanted to give this film an E for Effort (which on my ratings scale is considered fair/good/average 5/10), because it was winning me over in the first quarter of the film. I did find it interesting, that after I saw the Paul Rudd bit so many times over the years, might bias my opinion of Mac and Me (1988), so I made sure to look at the film as objectively as possible. It is clearly capitalizing off of the success of E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), six years later.\n\nThings begin to crumble for the remaining 75% of this movie. The overall plot of Mac and Me (1988), starts to go down hill quickly and the product-placement you see all over the screen, actually doesn't bother me, as much as the unexplainable dance number that breaks out in the McDonald's, in order to sell the product. It totally derails the pace of the film, among a few other really goofy moments with the aliens. Also, these E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), rip-off character designs, are really creepy looking compared to the lovable Steven Spielberg space-Bambi. The special effects aren't too bad for a low-budget, 1980s film, but that means, other areas of the film will suffer, because all the money went into the effects, such as acting, editing, soundtrack, no notable stars, audio mistakes, creature designs, you name it. The cheapness of Mac and Me (1988), flattens the good special effects. I can't say it's one of the worst movies ever made, but even influence from Paul Rudd can't save Mac and Me (1988), from still being labeled as a failure, but one that deserves to be watched, because you have to see this movie to believe it. Still a joy of wackiness.\n\nPMTM Grade: 3.9 (F+) = 4 IMDB."

I mean, in the first place, it's a kids movie. Filmmakers are entitled to some corniness and take advantage of some branding (where they or the studio executives lack the drive for creativity). If nothing else, this is a horribly embarrassing time capsule artillery of 80s cheesiness. And I have to wonder why filmmakers assumed the easiest way to relate to kids' interest was with some dorky \"streety\" dance scenes?\n\nThis one is the story of a family of newcomers to California where there just happens to be a stranded Alien baby (or whatever you want to call it) who strays from his Alien family which are transported to Earth after being sucked up by a NASA satellite. The baby befriends the youngest son. As it was in E.T., the boy tries to convince only those he trusts most (his brother and the neighboring siblings) of the Alien's existence and help return the thing to its family. Look for John Ward as the older brother (hubba! hubba!) and a super-cheesy slice of sentimental in the finale. Kids might like it. Apparently not too many others do."

        "review_detailed_main": "I guess there comes a point in your life where you realise that maybe you just have no taste. 'Mac and Me' is terrible. It was terrible when it was first released. It was so terrible it gained infamy throughout the years as to how a movie so terrible could have been greenlit in the first place. And it remains as terrible today. I did see it back in the eighties. I didn't like it. I didn't hate it, but there was so much better around and 'E. T.' was only a few years old by then and 'Mac and Me' was just nowhere near as good as it.\n\nI don't know why I watched it nearly thirty-five years later (free on YouTube!), but I actually liked it. Yes, I know there are loads of films which you can enjoy because they're 'so bad they're good.' And this could definitely be described that way. I could leave it there if it wasn't for the fact that, even though I could tell it was awful, I actually found myself enjoying it UNironically (I need help, clearly).\n\nEven if you haven't seen 'E. T.' you probably know the story - cute alien left stranded on Earth, befriends a young boy (government in hot pursuit). Well, someone must have copied and pasted that in terms of 'Mac and Me,' but without the decent script, special effects (and possibly been high on some sort of illegal substance at the time).\n\nI think maybe the major 'flaw' with the film (in 1988 and today) is its weird tie-in with McDonalds restaurant - get the title - (Big) 'Mac and Me?' Yet, for a movie which literally uses a product as its title, there's actually not that many references to the fast food chain, besides the truly surreal song and dance routine roughly halfway through. In fact, if I didn't know better, I'd say the film should really be sponsored by Coke a Cola.\n\nI can't possibly recommend this film to anyone. Objectively, it's that bad. Obviously, if you're into those sorts of 'so-bad-they're-good' films then you may enjoy it on an ironic level. But I think there will be few out there who - like me - actually claim it's an enjoyable romp, no matter how bad it really is. I'm now off to seek some sort of professional help for my clear lack of taste."

In my opinion, the sole bright spot is Jade Calegory, who gives a courageous and touching performance, plus she is the only actress who looks natural within the film. The rest of the acting is not good at all, even from Christine Ebersole. Coming off worst is Jonathan Ward who is incredibly obnoxious and annoying here.\n\nAs for Mac himself, he isn't in the least bit endearing, he is ugly, artificial and annoyed me rather than touched me. The story is predictable, and further suffers from clich\u00e9d characters, uneven pacing and a flat ending. The production values look as though the film was on the cheap, the music is execrable and enough to rip out your ear-drums and the direction is uninspired. The script is absolutely awful too, being both unfunny and cloying.\n\nOverall, an awful movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

My first exposure is Conan O'Brien showing the same ridiculous clip over and over again. It has all the elements of a truly bad movie. It is sincere. It has an overt tie in to a commercial endeavor, in this case McDonald's. Ronald McDonald is actually talking. It has the undeniable copying of a real iconic movie, but it does it in a truly bad way. The alien design is ugly, amateurish, and silly all at the same time. They are pot-bellied, sleepy-eyed, butt-head, o-faced rubber suits. Ebersole is a solid actress as the mom but the kids are all lower level actors. They don't have enough charisma to be bad. If not for laughing at it, there isn't much here.

The whacky completely inexplicable \"racoon scene\" where, as filler between scenes, we get to watch a racoon knock over a trash can. (why?? who cares).\n\nMac \"swimming\" to the rescue warranted a chuckle - very Prince of Tides with the view from below as he swims past.\n\nThen the \"Wacky D's\" dance routine is worth the cost of the video rental itself.\n\nIt's been year's since I watched but I'm ready to see it again."

ON A WHEELCHAIR; or the infamous group dance at McDonald's as a sort of excuse to promote the fast food company. And the ending... oh my God, so stupid and nonsense too. After this film, E.T. would have probably changed his mind about the human kind and would have been part of the aliens' team on the board of the tripods in War of the Worlds, destroying everything and everybody.\n\nBad bad bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "First off I'd like to state that haven't seen this film since 1990 on HBO. But even the trailers warned of doom. When the trailer isn't narrated by Don LaFontaine but by Ronald McDonald (not kidding) you know this film isn't even trying to be taken seriously! 'Mac and Me' was obviously trying to exploit the phenomenal success of 'E.T.' which remained playing in theaters for over 3 years into 1984! But it was only available on VHS in bootleg format until 1989. Hence, in 1988 there was a void that needed to be filled. America was E.T.less until 'Mac and Me.' Well first off this film isn't nearly as bad as everyone says. It's just rightfully one of the most hated films of all time because it's such an obvious rip off of 'E.T.'!!! Right down to scene by scene! Not kidding, some scenes are identical to 'E.T.' like the G men chasing the school kids.\n\nIt's pointless to describe the plot because it's exactly like 'E.T.'!!! I can't stress this enough! From how the boy meets the alien to how the single mom finds out her sons have been hiding it, it's exactly like 'E.T.' Except not good. But not really that bad.\n\nImagine if the Lifetime network was given the screenplay for 'E.T.' rather than Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe cartoonish action violence is also WAY over done. Sure E.T. himself took some Tom & Jerry style blows but here poor Mac gets the full Ren & Stimpy treatment. Getting sucked through vacuum cleaners more than once and getting bounced off car windshields.\n\nIf all this is supposed to be comical, it's NOT. Poor Mac is like the Wiley Coyote of cute aliens.\n\nThe only other difference is that this time Elliot is in a wheelchair. This way McDonald's which produced the film can boast about how the Ronald McDonald House helps the families of crippled kids.\n\nIn conclusion I can think of no reason to watch this film other than the fact that 'E.T.'s Blue Ray release has been totally bastardized by new shoddy CGI FX and reedited to be more friendly. Such as removing the G men's hand guns and changing some dialogue. WHY? 'E.T.' was perfect! Just leave it the fxxx alone! Once again the clear solution to this problem is to simply watch a bootleg VHS of 'E.T.'"

        "review_detailed_main": "Whenever there's a popular movie you tend to get rip offs and ET was one such movie. We got things like \"Nukie\", \"Badi\" and of course \"Mac & Me\". A movie so self aware that they named the alien after one of their biggest sponsors McDonalds. Technically it was financed by Gordon Food Services, the company that supplies McDonald's with their products, but it does star Ronald McDonald in one scene and McDonald's is mentioned many times in it so make of that what you will. You will also notice that other products make their way into this. Coke plays a huge role as being the only thing that people in this movie drink. Sears is the best store in the universe, so much so that the mother moves her family across the country to work at one. Skittles are shown prominently and has nothing at all to do with Reeses Pieces that were in that other alien movie. And for some reason Valvoline. Dunno why that one is there but maybe they needed a couple of oil changes.\n\nThe movie starts when a bunch of creepy looking aliens discover a probe sent to Mars and are literally sucked up by it before they're returned to Earth. They're separated and little Mac, as he's known, winds up stowing away in a mini van to wind up with the people who's Mother works at Sears. Through a series of events little Mac tries to communicate with them, the boy in a wheelchair falls off a clip, there's a dance off at McDonalds and the power of Coke brings dying aliens back to life. Yes, this is as silly as it sounds.\n\nThere is no redeeming feature for this. Although if you want a laugh, check out the dance contest going on at McDonald's it's hilarious. And supposedly there's a young Jennifer Aniston as one of the dancers there."

As you probably know, the movie is a blatant rip-off of \"E.T.\", so much so that it's a shock that Steven Spielberg and Universal Pictures did not sue. But the plagiarism wouldn't be all that bad had the movie been executed with enough skill and heart. However, the movie fails in every way you can think of, from the stiff-faced and unexpressive aliens to the human characters coming across as unbelievably stupid. And yes, the many blatant product plugs are pretty shameful. With the original \"E.T.\" movie being freely available, there is no reason to see this shoddy rip-off in its original version. The \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" version, however, is pretty amusing, though it suffers from cutting about 20 minutes from the movie's running time, resulting in a few severe plot gaps."

If you want to watch this as a serious film and think that it is a good alternative to \"E. T.\" then keep moving. If you want to suspend your disbelief without getting angry and wanting to throw something at the TV, then this isn't a good idea. This film doesn't have many redeeming features and there is a reason that various film forums rank this in the top 10 worst films not just of the 1980's, but of all time. I didn't enjoy watching this in the 1980's when I was a child - I haven't enjoyed re-watching it 30+ years later. If I live out the rest of my life and don't watch this film again, it's been a good life - sorry, that's harsh, but I really didn't/don't like this."

But I don't think it's as bad as I had hoped it was.\n\nIn my opinion, the main problem is the PUPPETS. The puppets are just awful looking.

        "review_detailed_main": "This was nothing but a shameless and unsuccessful attempt to cash in on ET's past success along with advertising McDonalds.\n\nA family of aliens living on a barren desert planet stowaway on a human satellite and wind up on Earth, particularly California. Upon arriving on Earth, they escape from a NASA sight with ridiculous ease. While the parents and younger sibling flee into the desert, Mac, the older sibling, hitches a ride aboard a station wagon driven by a family moving in from Chicago. Soon, Mac befriends a wheelchair bound boy named Eric, who helps the former find his family and eventually integrate into human society.\n\nThe acting is completely dull. All the human characters sound bored and their performances are unconvincing. The aliens are borderline criminals, as the father steals a security guards' gun and waves it around dangerously inside a grocery store late in the film. Plus, unlike ET, they're also reckless idiots who make no attempt to hide themselves despite the government being on their tail. Mac himself isn't any better or sympathetic, being an annoying troublemaker. Early into the film, he gets Eric into trouble and even nearly gets him killed by mistake.\n\nThe alien designs and animatronics here are poorly made and hideous, also unlike ET, who is cute and ugly mixed together and was played convincingly. Mac and his relatives have gaunt builds, pale skin, bulging eyes, swollen cheeks, and mouths in a constant o-shape. Mac himself sometimes cuts between a kid in a suit and a very unconvincing animatronic. The rest of the effects are equally cheesy and low-grade, like the space shuttle landing and the stop motion effects in the very first scene which set the stage for the rest of a very lame and unfunny sci-fi flick.\n\nThe only real bright side is that the soundtrack was composed by Alan Silveresti, who was far too good to be involved in a third-rate film like this. The pop songs \"You're Not a Stranger Anymore\" and \"Take Me I'll Follow You\" are especially notable but even that isn't enough to save this movie by a long shot."

If it wasn't for them I could not have made it to the end of this muddled and extremely cheesy story.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to make aliens believable in a movie like this. Opening the movie with the aliens was not subtle. The production team seemed to LOVE overexposing the audience with their alien creations, which I believe were actual people in body suits?\n\nI heard about and was interested in seeing the scene at McDonald's, 55 minutes into the movie. It was even more bizarre than I expected. I also did not realize this would be the cheesiest product placement film ever! I believe E. T. was the first to advertise a product in a movie in 1982 with Reese's Pieces. They went ALL OUT in this movie and COKE was used in a similar manner to Reeses Pieces, even to the point of saying \"This must be like what they drink on their planet\".\n\nOverall, it was not that enjoyable of a movie for me.

Mac And Me doesn't care at all what you think of it. Where ET had moments of a beautiful friendship, Mac And Me had insensitive stereotypes. Where ET pulled at heart-strings and left viewers in tears, Mac And Me has a 8 minute dance sequence in a McDonald's restaurant. (by the way, the main character is in a wheelchair and forced to just watch as all his friends and Mac in a bear costume are dancing and having a good time. How rude!)\n\nThis movie is bad, yes, there's no denying that.

The best thing about it probably are the performances of its young cast who are all doing actually a really good job, you like them each as characters and the roadtrip aspect worked probably the best. The ending of the movie is utterly ludicrous but it doesn't take itself all that seriously on the whole. It certainly feels like a product of the 1980s. Unlike something like The Garbage Pail Kids it at least didn't feel insultingly kidish or weirdly gross and meanspirited."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mac and Me is one of those films that try to capitalize on the success on another big name movie of the time. With this one, it tries to match the success of Steven Spielberg's classic film, E. T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, which, since its first release back in 1982, has become successful to the point of becoming pop culture (as Elliot and E. T. on the flying bike was used as the logo for Amblin Pictures). However, where E. T. succeeds, Mac and Me falls flat.\n\nIn this movie, an alien family from a desert plant is sucked into a NASA probe and escape a goverment base. However, the child is seperated from the parents by sneaking into a minivan driven by single mother Janet Cruise, who is moving to Los Angeles with her two sons Eric and Michael. Eric, who uses a wheelchair, befriends the alien after he saves him from drowning, and naming him Mac (short for Mysterious Alien Creature) it leads him on a magical journey where he, Michael, and new friends Debbie and Courtney try to reunite the alien with his parents.\n\nYeah, this is a bad movie with its own cult following (as Paul Rudd would use a scene as a way to troll Conan O'Brien on The Tonight Show), as the movie is a alien abomination from start to finish. Mac and his parents have to be one of the ugliest alien designs I have ever seen, and the movie has an overload of product placement (one of them being a dance number at a McDonalds, complete with Ronald McDonald himself). Also, the writing is terrible and the acting is bad."

It is CERTAINLY the best film of the year, and possibly one of the best films of the 80's.\n\nIt tells a beguiling story of friendship, compassion, and undeniable warmth. What makes \"Mac & Me\" such a masterpiece is that it is able to (let's face it) rob a previous concept and make a bigger, bolder film out of it. This puts ET to shame.\n\nOne of the film's best sequences is also its most heartbreaking one. MAC (mysterious alien creature)is found in tears is he mourns his missing family. Moments like this are what makes movies as strong as they are today.\n\nThe first time I saw \"Mac & Me\", I expected a sappy over-sentimental film (ala The Right Stuff), but instead, I saw a blazing masterpiece of American cinema. I believe \"Mac and Me\" is charged with such velocity, that in a decade, or even two, people will look back on it as a prime example of the medium of film.

All our kids loved it and our eldest daughter who is now 20 still remembers it with affection. It is definitely good entertainment and a joy to watch. There is some advertising especially in relation to coca cola which rather annoyingly the aliens seem to never be able to get enough of. But advertising, as everyone is aware, is now commonplace in movies and to a much greater extent than this one. The music score matches the emotional content of the movie and the ending scene where the aliens (now fully clothed with suits, dresses and hats) become US citizens is hilarious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Personally I love the excellent ' MAC And Me ' and regard it as one of the most enjoyable family flicks of the 80's. Despite the obvious comparisons to Steven Spielberg's ' E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial ' and the much derided product placement of McDonald's and Coke, there is still much to recommend of this quirky and at times quite touching sci-fi adventure.\n\nThe plot has an alien family sucked aboard a NASA space probe on Mars and accidentally brought back to Earth. MAC ( Mysterious Alien Creature ), the mischievous alien child, is seperated from his family during the confusion of their arrival and stows away in the camper van of the Cruise family. The Cruise family are on their way to a new home in California, one which MAC singlehandedly proceeds to terrorize, his antics blamed on ten-year-old Eric. Eric conspires to prove his innocence and capture MAC. He befriends the lonely visitor and enlists the help of his teenage brother Michael ( Jonathan Ward ) and their friends Debbie ( Lauren Stanley ) and Courtney ( Tina Caspary ) to reunite him with his family whilst evading the authorities.\n\nReal life spina bifida sufferer Jade Calegory gives a wonderful performance as Eric and his friendship with MAC is rather sweet - MAC himself a wonderfully realised special effects creation, a fully mechanized robot. Director Stewart Rafill manages to inject an even balance of humour and dramatic content into the movie and the top score by Alan Silvestri underlines this.\n\nThere was a sequel intended for a summer 1989 release but negative reviews resulted in it being pulled. A pity really as it would have been nice to see MAC and his family settle into life on Earth, and as there is no ' E.T. II ' for it to have been compared with, it would have given the filmmakers a chance to prove that MAC is pretty much his own character."

As a kid I always remember how much I wanted to find one of those little aliens under my bed. It is one of those films you can put on and let the kids watch while you go about your daily chores without them bothering you though. I bought it for my three-year-old nephew and he absolutely loved it as well! (So much so that he watches it on a daily basis.) I say go out and buy it for the kids!!"

Yes, it was probably made to capitalize on E.T., which is totally cynical.\n\nHowever...\n\nThere is a part of me that wants to defend this movie because unlike most movies about disabled kids, this one refuses to push an ableist narrative about his disability. The hero of this film is a kid in a wheelchair, but the plot doesn't really revolve around this aspect of him, nor does it end with the sickening idea that the only reason to feature a disabled character is so he can get up and walk again and be \"like normal people\" eventually. In this regard, Mac and Me was 30 years ahead of its time.\n\nThis is all of course to say nothing of the message this movie sends to non-disabled kids-which is simply that disability changes nothing about your character. And that's *such* a good, important message to send.\n\nAlso, I could see myself as a kid enjoying this movie in spite of its flaws (even though I first saw it as a teenager, and then only because I was a bad movie buff and had heard how awful it was). It's nowhere near the level of E.T., but it manages to be kind of fun and silly in its own way. And who says a movie has to be a deep, meaningful experience? What's wrong with escapism for its own sake? And if an escapist movie can send a good message about disability along the way, all the better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I avoided this for decades, but finally watched it to see if it had the curious cult status it warrants.\n\nOh man, I wish I had watched this earlier! It is, as other reviewers have said, utter tripe on the one hand - an utterly shameless, ET envying, bargain basement monstrosity, that only young children will look at with any wonder.\n\nI also genuinely feel sorry, for any and all the established actors whose careers were probably finished by it, when just in need of a paycheck. The child disabled actor in particular deserved far better for his career. You can see he puts his heart and soul into trying to make this pile of singing excrement have some feeling.\n\nNow, onto why on earth then it gets 9/10 from me...? Well, on the other hand: it also weirdly succeeds as the most surrealist, dark and bizarre comedy I've seen in many, many years. Although you may want to watch ET before you ever watch this: it'll make it 50 times as funny if you do.\n\nI had huge belly laughs as a 40 something man watching this: more than I have had in a long time. I'll just say vaguely to avoid spoilers: a particular wheelchair journey in nature; the vacuum cleaner; and an end courthouse scene to state a few - had me in absolute stitches. Stand up comics could not do this better, people.\n\nYou have to see this at least once, as an adult. Preferably id recommend as part of an adult frat and sorority party, with just enough drinkable and smokeables alongside (legal, of course :). It would make for an unforgettable college bonding, trust me. Kind of like watching Teletubbies did in the same manner at one point back in the 90s, in the same way - only far better.\n\nTo sum up: this was, in a way, the last of the film times in the 80s, before CGI and huge scale tent pole filmmaking from the 90s onward made even most knockoffs look ok. It's part of surrealist, unintentional campy comedy gold.\n\nDo not deprive yourself, anybody reading, and just see it. But do this as a social with buddies. If you have a funny bone in you, you'll laugh till you wet yourselves!"
