The jokes are extremely childish yet I wouldn't recommend it for children as some bits are somewhat offencive..they have really missed the mark on this one which I was really hoping would be good as I usually love this style of film. Most of the gags in the film have been seen time and time again and by the end the audience was really switching off and the younger members of the audience just started throwing popcorn around as it was so bad. In short if you have to go to the cinema this weekend see something else."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was looking forward to seeing Meet the Spartans, from the first few theatrical trailers, it looked like a lot of fun and not like a horrible parody. But I have to admit that when it had it's TV spots, it was starting to look bad, but my boyfriend and I still saw it last night, just to see maybe if it still had some laughs. Now, while I'm still disappointed in most of the movie, there were a few good laughs I think. It was made pretty badly, but I think most spoof movies are made that way since they don't have a sense of reality, so I'll be kind on that subject. Plus, the movie in general was weird, they took on the movie 300, fully, like re-shot the entire film, and just added their own jokes on TV, movies, pop culture, and random things.\n\nLeonidas has just been made king of Sparta, and his world is rocking with his bombshell wife, Queen Margo, and life couldn't be better. But when he is challenged by the Persians, he must protect Sparta with, well, only 8 guys. But hoping that \"they will survive\", they go into a battle of stomping the yard, talking smack, and even having to deal with some transformers. Leonidas is getting more and more steamed though as he realizes that the blue screen Persians may be too much for he and his team can handle.\n\nMeet the Spartans had some really funny moments, like I loved and nearly died laughing when the Spartans were leaving their country and they left hand in hand singing \"I will Survive\", it was so stupid, I know, but if you let go and have fun, I'm sure you'll laugh too. But there were things I was disappointed in, like the constant potty humor, it would be nice if the writers grew past the second grade level humor. There was some jokes that were predictable and used too many times in other spoofs. But over all this was definitely better than Epic Movie or Date Movie. If you go to see this, there are a few laughs, but don't expect the best comedy of the year.\n\n4/10"

But compared to \"Meet the Spartans\" (or Epic Movie or Date Movie) they are a BILLION times better. And they have one thing in common... Zucker / Abrahams / Zucker (also must give props to writer Pat Proft). These guys INVENTED this genre.

There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, \"This might be funny if...\" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle. This movie was truly atrocious. You would think after having their last two films be on the bottom 100 of this site, the makers would say, \"Lets try something different,\" but no, it is the exact same as Date Movie and Epic Movie; Bad."

I am pretty sure a lot of people voted without watching and they voted very low since this is making fun of 300. I personally liked 300, it was a great movie but that doesn't mean you can't make fun of it. Humor is a very difficult subject and I strongly suggest not to get influenced by the comments for comedy movies. Just watch it and see it for yourself.

There was nothing you could say that could make of this movie, it does it all by itself and it doesn't even allow you to laugh while you watch it going down in flames. I considered its predecessor, Epic Movie, to be among one of the worst movies ever made. I didn't think it could possibly get worse, but it did. It's like watching 300 all over again expect with ridiculous pop culture references that aren't even funny. The guys who made this movie obviously don't understand comedy in the slightest bit. I hope that this is the last one of these ridiculous comedies that gets to occupy a theater over another film that might actually be worth something. This film is a waste of money for starters, but even if you don't have to pay, it's just a waste of time."

I was told before-hand that it was only about 90 minutes, and was a little upset id be paying for that.

The sexy Carmen Electra is funny as always and it's awesome that a woman so talented and beautiful can do such low brow jokes. (See Scary Movie 3-she takes a 30 second dook in front of an entire room full of people and still walks away sexy as ever) Deidrich Bader is a riot; the scene where he says, \"I must warn you, I suffer from premature EJAC-\" and makes the oh face had me rolling. Sean Maguire is an amazing actor as always.\n\nLook, this movie is stupid. Very stupid. But that's OK. Not every movie can be a Zucker brothers movie. You can tell that a bunch of talented people had a really great time making a really fun movie. It wasn't made to win Oscars.

I was even more delighted when I saw the trailer. All too often comedy movie trailers contain all the best jokes, leaving nothing funny for the actual movie. I knew this movie was going to be great when I saw the trailer and there wasn't ONE FUNNY BIT IN IT!!!!! Clearly these were film makers who did not need to advertise their greatness, as they could rely on their genius to advertise itself. I knew we were going to experience a comedy masterpiece on par with \"Diff'rent Strokes\", \"Australia's Funniest Home Videos\" or Michael Jackson's cosmetic surgery.\n\nI set up camp outside the box office 2 days before tickets went on sale to be sure we got the first tickets accompanied, after a sound thrashing, by my wife and my little boy. For two days and nights we struggled on that lonely sidewalk against hunger and thirst and heat and exposure, and towards the end we had to resort to drinking our own urine. But it was worth it, because when \"Meet the Spartans\" finally opened we were the only people in the cinema.\n\nAnd what a movie it was! My own memories are a little hazy given the addled state I was in after two days in the street. For my own part, I was laughing and hollering too much at the little purple animals floating around in the cinema to notice much of the movie. I do remember bits of the trailer getting repeated over and over again, but that must have been the hallucinations as well. However I do remember my wife and my little boy found it so funny they were too astonished to laugh. After a while the exertions of the previous 2 days took their toll and they fell asleep with their precious heads lolling into my unwashed groin. But shoot, I wasn't complaining :-) All in all it was probably the greatest day of my life, and perhaps anyone's life.\n\nI was delighted to learn that there was a \"Meet the Spartans 2\". If there was one film crying out for a sequel, it must surely be this one. As with \"Weekend at Bernie's\", you just got the feeling that one movie was not enough to fully explore the vast richness of ideas on display. One can only hope it will produce more sequels than the Star Wars and the Police Academy series combined."

The \"jokes\" were delivered like bullets from a Gatling gun and every one missed their target, because we could all see them coming from 50 miles away.\n\nBut the real cause of death was old age and neglect. Everyone associated with this movie is equally guilty of flogging this old horse to death and they knew it. The movie started out reasonably creatively, with a spoof of Casino Royale, but then it gave up and just played out the 300 storyline. The scriptwriters knew it was all over and just gave up. The running time of 60 minutes is proof of their guilt.\n\nAlmost to their credit the actors (if indeed that's what they were) seemed embarrassed by their role in this crime, but to their shame, they will not be able to avoid charges of aiding and abetting.\n\nThe budget for this movie must have been around $30 plus change. All shot in one studio stage, \"actors\" playing dual roles, no location shots, pitiful CGI, stupendously awful make up, props and sets, seemingly borrowed from Plan 9 from Outer Space.\n\nWhen they viewed the rushes, the Producers could see that their fingerprints were all over the body and decided not to show it to the critics, but rather release it directly to the paying public under a veil of hype, which they hoped would be their alibi. But, if you look at the comments in this forum, we were not fooled and they are guilty as charged.\n\nTake 'em down!"

Sure, in Epic Movie there were one or two genuinely funny moments, but those were in the first ten minutes. Somebody should ban these guys from making movies cos they just don't seem to understand how bad they are.\n\nThe \"jokes\" are painfully obvious and executed with such agonizingly poor acting you might as well be watching 10 year olds act it out. No, I'm sorry, that's insulting the kids! This movie is another nail in the coffin for this pair of \"Comedy Directors\", and I use the term comedy loosely. The question is, just how many nails can one coffin hold? There are so many at this stage.\n\nI know I've only addressed the acting and the writing, you may be asking \"what about the plot?\". Well, you already saw the plot. This movie is a cheap rip off of 300 and I don't think anybody would hold it against the makers of 300 for suing the makers of this movie. In fact, I would welcome it with open arms!\n\nDon't waste your money, don't even bother to let this movie waste your time. I would give this movie a worse rating but this site only lets you go down as far as 1."

What followed was a lot of tedium, punctuated with the obligatory Carmen Electra slow-mo dancing. Unfortunately, the PG-13 keeps them from showing any of Carmen's fine body in the nude. That MIGHT have made me feel like I got some of my money's worth.\n\nWhat drug the movie down also was the tendency to flog any joke to death,especially the Britney spears bit. Basically, you could watch the commercials about 10 times in a row, and that is it. They also had a couple of gags that centered around a blue screen, they beat that one at least three times. They tried in vain to find something funny about the movie three hundred, but let's face it. 300 was almost too serious and action oriented to be spoofed in a sophomoric PG-13 flick.\n\nYeah, they attempted weakly to skewer popular culture, which only means that this movie will have lost all relevancy in about 5 years when the next generation forgets or loses caring over ripping Britney Spears and her pop-culture female counterparts. The bits where they rip Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton were not so much mean spirited as they were weak and desperate attempts at capitalizing on media frenzy. I am pretty much ambivalent about the suffering caused celebrities by parody. I would bet however that Lohan, Spears and Hilton felt not so much skewered by the rapier wit of a comedic genius, as hammered with the blunt tool of a script that appeared to be pounded out by middle schoolers.\n\nI don't think that celebs really mind being parodied when there is some real thought and humor behind it, but this clumsy fair was no more than an awful, embarrassing and ham-fisted bit of half-assed character assassination. All the meanness and none of the cleverness.\n\nIt's been a long time since I have considered asking for my money back, but I would not have wasted another minute on this movie even getting a refund. The time I spent in the theater was a chunk of my life that can never be recovered. This is one of those flicks where if you have seen the commercial, you have seen the highlights already.\n\nIF you really want the best of this bore, wait for it to show up on cable (give it 6 months at best) and watch only the first 20 minutes.\n\nSave the rest of the time for re-sorting your sock drawer. You'll thank me later, trust me."

Suffice to say, when asked for, the actors deliver a fulfilling act. The problem is not with the actors. It is with the script. Every other scene, I would go \"I could have made this soo much funnier\". So yeah, there we have it. But overall, I would say I liked this better than Epic Movie and Date Movie. Nowhere near the scary movies though.\n\nSo, bottom line, do not waste your time and money watching this in the theaters. Wait for it on DVD or Star Movies.

Mel Brooks gave us Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles, big-budget parodies of horror and western flicks, played as if serious. Think of the synchronized swim nuns in History of the World or the crazy 40's dance number at the end of Blazing Saddles.\n\nThe Meet spoof of Stomp the Yard gave me a big smile just because the excellent talent in Meet perfectly matched Yard in an absurd as Spartans vs Persians context. Spoof as parody instead of farce is not new, it may just be a unfamiliar to some of the reviewers.\n\nThe 300 movie was so beautifully art directed and shot, the story a genuine epic, and the film heroic and moving. Meet the Spartans plays on this with big chunks of entertainment that I can appreciate.\n\nYou won't get a production like Tvatzy singing \"I'm Tired of Men\" from the excellent Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker spoofs.

Within the first 15 minutes, I watched 5 people walk out and then another 20 minutes later 2 more people walked out! Seriously, this is most likely among the worst comedies I have ever seen. If you string together a bunch of internet fads and weak pop culture references and put it on tape, you would create Meet the Spartans. Comedy is wit, not a constant bombardment of poorly thought out jokes. I mean, everyone was guaranteed to crack a smile, not because all the jokes were good, but because the makers of this film replaced any plot with mindless jokes.\n\nAnother thing, if you have seen the preview for this movie, you have seen the movie. There are a couple offensive jokes thrown in there and a couple of other movie references, but thats it. Please, don't see this movie if you have ever processed a thought in your brain, because if you have you will not like this film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Four of the adults in our family attended this movie tonight. Three males and one female, aged 29 to 55, all agreed that this show only deserves a rating of \"1\". The general consensus was that it may very well be the worst movie any of us have ever seen. There are actually a couple of sincerely humorous bits in the movie, but not enough to make it worth the admission. When other family members were asked who might like the movie, comments were \"maybe the blind and deaf\" (because they would be spared) or maybe someone between 6th and 9th grade. However, the subject matter is not appropriate for young people. The MPAA rating is \"PG-13\", but I think parents should think twice before showing this to younger family members. The jokes are often of a sexual nature and violence is portrayed, although in ridiculous ways. Of course, a spoof of \"The 300\" is expected to have violence of some sort. Viewers will understand more of the \"jokes\" if they have already seen \"The 300\", but it's not entirely necessary if you know a little about its plot. Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra are the best known actors in the film; what a comedown. We'd much rather see Sorbo in Andromeda or Hercules. If you're determined to see what it's like, I suggest waiting for the DVD. Better yet, wait until someone else rents it and watch with him! Once you decide to watch it to the end, stay through the credits. Like many of the newer shows, the credits have some extra things to watch. This one actually highlights some items more entertaining than the film itself."

Mostly the entire movie it was all funny at one scene or another, just some tried to hard to be funny. I thought that the way they made this movie just like 300 was pretty sweet. They mixed up all the other scenes with other movies and not just 300 such as Rocky Balboa, Ghost Rider, Transformers, and Stomp The Yard. So what im saying is that if you don't like movies where they make fun of other movies then you will probably not like this movie, and i don't recommend it to you. I wrote such a short review because this movie doesn't have much to write about. Just see it for yourself and find out. It was very funny but it was just way to boring and stupid. It took place all in one area. Overall average with a little bit of good."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are several kinds of stupidity in comedy. We can have the classic effortless yet very funny stupid movies (Happy Gilmore). We also have frat-house stupid movies, that sometimes fall into the gross-out genre, but overall have something memorable (Animal House, American Pie). There is also a kind of stupidity that is beyond definition that still makes you laugh (Jackass, One and Two). And, of course, there is the incompetent stupidity from such filmmakers like Ed Wood or Coleman Francis that makes those beloved \"so bad, it's good movies\".\n\nHowever, we have never seen stupidity in its primal form. Pure, 100 %, basic and right into the core of everything stupid. Even with all the above mentioned movies, a shred of intelligence was put into them. Still, we haven't seen a complete work of mindless, thoughtless and just pure stupidity. Not until \"Meet the Spartans\".\n\nOK. I exaggerated. There was some thought put into the concept of this moving images (I dare not to call it movie). Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg did use their brains for such questions like \"What is a spoof?\" \"what is a movie?\", \"what movies can we spoof?\", \"how we can make movies as visually identical to the original, yet keep our film school project budget\".\n\nThen, it all just went downhill. It's horrific to just think about it. Acting? Script? Directing? Production values? Creativity? Something? Anything? Now, apparently, as I remember, a spoof consists of imitating a movie and make fun of some of their aspects. So, where is it? Oh, sorry. there were only lame pop-culture references and a lot of remarks saying \"this is funny\" or \"we are parodying recent epic movies, didn't you notice?\", literally, in plain English.\n\nHey, I got news for you. This spoofing _____ Movie thing is now officially old. \"Date Movie\" was the sign. \"Epic Movie\" was the ultimatum. \"Meet the Spartans\" is the fulfillment. No more spoof movies by Seltzer and Friedberg, whose careers have been defined by \"writing\" \"scripts\" for such \"movies\" as \"Spy Hard\" and \"Scary Movie\" (their only real success which I thought was also trash).\n\nNow, the reason why these spoofs are not actually that clever to make is because they're limited to the referenced movies' impact and popularity. Most of the films parodied are forgettable, as so is this one. While you can have some timeless comedy classics, all of Charlie Chaplin's or Laurel and Hardy's films, when you have a spoof, it's just funny for a limited time. No one will remember spoofs from several years on (most especially this one).\n\nI was almost having a heart attack when I read Christopher Lennertz's name in the credits. After composing some of the most outstanding and beautiful scores for a video game series (Medal of Honor), you decide to sign up for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It looks like Giacchino taking over Airborne really must have hit you bad.\n\nNow, a recommendation to all of you readers and moviegoers. When you have the choice of watching \"Meet the Spartans\" or being thrown off a pit, it's more than obvious that you will choose the pit. But there is also another choice. A light at the end of the tunnel. It's called \"watching something else\". Don't give those jackasses that call themselves writers to keep, first, butchering every single one of your favorite movies, second, wasting your time, money and attention and, third, making you fell emotionally sick, mentally raped and intellectually insulted with this piece of CRAP! Oh, and it might help if you see some real spoof comedies, like \"Airplane\" or \"The Naked Gun\"."

If you have to pay, don't. See something else. Maybe Plan 9 From Outer Space. That was better than this piece o' crap.\n\nPlease, heed my warning.

For example, in the commercial they show the \"pit of death\" when they push in Britney Spears, they did that in the movie approximately 8 times. It was getting really old, really fast. It was all in slow motion too, so the scene was much longer than it needed to be. I would not suggest that you waste money on this movie, if you want to see what its like then wait for it to come out on stars because it really is not worth $8."

The film in and of itself was perfect fodder for a spoof. Unfortunately, Spartans doesn't do enough with it. Some of the ideas in this movie were good, but they weren't brought out. Instead there is nothing but a mess. One quality of a good spoof is it's references to pop culture, and Spartans even manages to screw that up. The references are few and far between, and to make up for this lack, what few there are are drawn out so as to be ludicrous. I actually fell asleep for the last 10 minutes of the movie, which I cannot ever remember doing. The best part of this movie is that it not even 90 minutes long.\n\nPLEASE do yourself a favor, stay away. Stay far away.

Bad acting, terrible casting, worse special effects and a literally non-existent laugh-to-joke ratio, this film was torture to sit through. The directors couldn't even get the so-called celebrity \"look-a-likes\" right. Seriously, if they hadn't have said \"Hey that's Paris Hilton\" or \"Ugly Betty\" or \"Lindsay Lohan\" you would not have recognized the \"celebrity.\" There is not one laugh in the entire 84 minutes.

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a bad sign when a spoof comes out less than a year after the movie it's spoofing. That's the case with \"Meet the Spartans\", a lame spoof of 300, which was written, shot and edited in no more than 10 months (300 only came out last March). Furthermore, it's by the same talent-less losers who unleashed \"Date Movie\" and \"Epic Movie\" upon the world. Although all signs point towards this movie being a steaming pile of crud, I tried to watch it with an open mind and without any biases.\n\nWhat comes as no surprise is that \"Meet the Spartans\" is indeed bad. Not only is it not funny, but this time it doesn't even seem like they tried. With \"Date Movie\" and \"Epic Movie\", you could see that the directors did make an attempt at making a good spoof and just failed miserably. Here they didn't even try. The numerous technical errors and goofs throughout the movie are way too many in number for a Hollywood production. On three separate occasions I noticed different characters voices being heard, even though their mouths weren't moving! As well, several of the costumes look like they have been picked up at Wal Mart (the penguin is literally just a guy in a Halloween costume). The biggest insult was when a dwarf was used as a body double for a small child and it was not intended as a joke. How dumb do these guys think we are? The movie's already not funny, the least they could do is make sure there aren't so many blatant screw-ups.\n\nThis movie does manage to be slightly funnier than the directors' previous attempts, meaning there are about three laughs in total throughout the film. Most of the jokes consist of references to different pop culture icons and celebrities, as if having people do impersonations of famous people is supposed to be funny. The filmmakers even have the gall to ridicule Dane Cook and suggest his comedy routines aren't funny. I'm no fan of Dane Cook, but \"Meet the Spartans\" makes his stuff look like \"Monty Python\".\n\nThe rest of the jokes either consist of gross-out gags (a bird pooping in a man's face, a man getting kitty litter stuck on his face) or random humor that fails to be funny, even in a random/stupid sort of way (Rocky Balboa wearing a diaper, Paris Hilton fighting the Spartans). The few funny scenes in the movie are the ones directly parodying \"300\". The movie manages to get a couple of laughs by mocking 300's homo-erotic tone, but the gag gets repeated far too many times by the end of the movie.\n\nI think I laughed once or twice during the movie, and definitely no more than four times. This is very bad for a movie that has an average of at least one joke every 20 seconds. I advise highly that nobody see this movie or support it (I saw it for free; I would never pay money). It's simply not funny and it would be a waste of money and time for anyone to see it. While I don't think it's as bad as \"Epic Movie\", it's still worse than \"Date Movie\", and that's pretty damn bad!"

Lots of jokes in here, and many of them, but not all hit. The fourth wall breaks are very entertaining and so are the slapstick jokes. The film lampoons 300 very well and looks the part with great outfits, set design and choreography. It does'nt look cheap.\n\nVery fun to watch, some humour in it may not have flyed today but back then it was very funny."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't get me wrong, I am not a fan of Jason Friedburg or Aaron Seltzer, in fact I go out of my way to avoid their films. I was only marginally entertained by \"Scary Movie\"(I'm sure most of which all had to do with the Wayans brothers), and abhorred the sequel. I saw \"Scary Movie 4\"(but not the third movie) just to pass the time with a friend, and despite maybe one joke that worked(Sort of. It's the one where a ray gun disintegrates everyones clothes), I was utterly bored. \"Date Movie\" was another film I saw almost out of some obligation to watch whatever DVD my pop collects, and the film was horrible and monotonous, and worst of all, boring. There is nothing worse than a bad comedy. I didn't follow up on \"Epic Movie\", \"Superhero Movie\", \"Disaster Movie\", and I will probably never watch anything else by these hacks again.\n\nIn between all this garbage however, is \"Meet the Spartans\", which isn't as shallow or tedious as their other films. Actually, some of the jokes work, and that is because this film has the good sense to wield sex as its arbitrator of humor. Not all, mind you, but a surprising amount of the humor works, which is a lot of gay jokes, as Greeks are famous for their comfort with homosexuality inmany instances. There are also jokes intended for the red blooded male in mind. I was surprised at how the actors actually put conviction into these jokes, as if they actually are trying to entertain the audience. If it is on a base level, at least it is a pleasurable one.\n\nAlso, there are a few dance numbers in here which entertained me, and the reason I liked them is because they were silly, out of left field, and not as mean spirited as Friedburg/Seltzer skits usually are. Also, I think that they inadvertently raised the level of craftsmanship by placing the story in a historical context. Even if you know nothing about the Greeks outside of \"300\", at least that makes you aware that there is life outside of vapid popular culture. Oh sure, there are plenty of cringe worthy references to celebrities and American Idol, but than again, what were you expecting from this movie?"

The writers of these god-awful parodies are losing ideas. Sure, the Scary Movie series was okay, but after the third one, the writers began filling the void of good acting and funny slapstick comedy with obvious references to celebrities and TV shows. This all only leads me to believe that Meet the Spartans was not meant to be any good. The idiots who wrote it probably figured that an audience of immature kids would love it. Hey, every film writer screws up occasionally. What about George Lucas and Howard the Duck? The main problem is that these parody movies are vile, 90-minute crap-o-ramas that resort to language and dirty jokes to deliver a strained laugh. I didn't laugh. I left halfway through the movie."

Lines like \"hey, it's the penguin from Happy Feet\" or \"hey, it's the fat guy from Borat\" aren't jokes. They are statements, not clever or ironic in any way.\n\nThis movie is also listed as being 82 minutes long, but it is thankfully only about 60 minutes long (the last 22 minutes are credits, bloopers, and deleted scenes). But even the 60 minutes seemed like it dragged on for days. This is mostly because the \"jokes\" dragged on and on - take, for example, the 10 minute scene where Leonidas pushes fake-celebrity after fake-celebrity into a pit; it wasn't even close to funny the first time, yet you have to watch the same bit done over and over again.\n\nI don't even want to get into the overwhelming and shameless product placement.\n\nIf you watch this movie, expect to yawn, groan, and check your watch every 30 seconds, but DO NOT expect to laugh - not even once."

I am prepared to bet that a theatre full of your average moviegoers (is that how you spell it?

Sadly, whoever wrote this screenplay decided to opt for the carpet-bomb approach and included as many poorly conceived pop culture references as possible without first having them proof read by comedy writers. Some bright spark in the production team actually thought that having numerous female cast members' legs fall open to reveal a blurred \"Britney shot\" would be utterly hilarious. How wrong they were. What we have as a result is the worst type of infantile garbage that even infants wouldn't find funny, nor for that matter will most teenagers.\n\nIf I had wanted to spend 90 minutes growing increasingly more depressed I would have visited the grave of my beloved gerbil, Alan.

This movie is one of the greats. Don't be swayed by the \"Uptight's\" who lack a sense of humor. They need laying... either in the bedroom or in a coffin."

It is very possible to reference/spoof current films or popular culture well I'm sure, but as far as the \"... movie\" type series goes, they should honestly stop now.\n\nNot only was this film awful in itself, but it managed to spectacularly and ruthlessly ruin one of the really good film moments of recent years. I refer to the \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" scene in 300. They plugged the joke to death and further. Just when you thought that was the last unamusing pop culture reference he was going to kick down that hole NO! another one appears to drag on the hopelessly pathetic gag for another minute or two.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back though, was the dance off scene against the \"immortals\". I simply could not stand another minute of the mind numbing drivel that I had already tolerated for what must have been about 45 interminably monotonous minutes.\n\nAvoid this movie like the plague, it really isn't worth it."

Jesus how many lines do they want me to put down here. I suppose i can continue to bad mouth this steaming pile of garbage.

Now...imagine sitting at a concert where the singer screams ugly sounds instead of singing, the supporting band plays nothing but noise the stage setting is a used toilet paper (which I think the script of this movie was written on) etc....\n\nAwful MOVIE! AWFUL!!! Should I repeat that 5 times, like the filmmakers did with every dumb joke in the movie? AWFUL, AWFUL, awful, Awful!!! AwFuL!! 1) The sophistication of the humor in this movie levels someone around 1st and 2nd grades. However, it most likely would make them cry rather than laugh.\n\n2) Do you really have to explain any obvious idiotic joke in the movie? What? Is it too complicated for us dumb viewers? There is nothing to explain! It is not funny! - explain that! 3) OK. Among all the crap they assembled in this movie. One joke had a vague potential of being slightly amusing. SO LETS REPEAT IT trizillion times!!!! and then once more! 4) The most outrages scenes from Jackass are done with much more taste than this vulgar and obscene...I can't even call it a movie...visual pollution To summarize I really think that certain movies should be banned from the theatres and possibly altogether. This is an insult! The directors should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nWhat's happening to Hollywood? Sad...just sad."

That's brilliant! Tell you what, we'll combine our ideas together to make a masterpiece. Yeah! This will be big! I'm having an epiphany right know! Wait a minute... Epipihany, what does that mean anyway? Never mind, so here it is: We set this in the same time as 300. That was like, before the first World War, right? So these 300 dudes are like gay right? So we'll just remake the whole story of 300 only make it funny. Yeah, and we'll put in those pop culture references of yours and that will just be a gas! I mean, that Leonidas guy pushes Britney, the judges of Idol, Ryan Seacrest down the Pit of Doom! And then there would be, like, a hip-hop showdown between Spartans and Persians. Yeah, people will laugh so wild that this might just be a classic like AIRPLANE! Yeah, this is gonna be big!\"\n\nSeltzer: \"Nice one man! I mean your like f#&@ing Spielberg man! Only Spielberg never thought of having that guy from Borat playing Xerxes or have Rocky, Ghost Rider, that dancing penguin from Happy Feet, and Carmen Electra in one movie! By the way, Spielberg did this movie with this guy Bay about Transformers. I was thinking, why not put in a giant robot? People will laugh like crazy, man! I mean, we don't have the budget, but hey, we made that classic EPIC MOVIE without having to spend lots of cash. And while were at it, there's got to be like product placements here so people will know we threw in everything on this movie. Nothing is safe from our riffing. Man I love working with you!\n\nFriedberg: \"Yeah man! Me too man! I mean, we're like that guy Hitchcock and that guy Jim Stewart. Or that guy Spielberg and Lucas. We make one hell of a team. I mean, who needs the critics? I don't even read their reviews! I don't even read! Now, let's make this baby a reality!\"\n\nSetlzer: \"Way ahead of you man! Nicole Parker's already on board and some guy Sean Maguire too. Wait, 'some guy Sean Macguire'? Hey that rhymes! So anyway, lets do this! People are, like, waiting for our next movie! This is like freakin' STAR WARS EPISODE I all over again! Maybe this time, we'll have guys camping in front of the theaters just to be first in line to get tickets!

Here are badly brought to life the heroics deeds about battle of Thermopylae, the only trail to arrive Athens . The events(480 B.C) are ridiculously developed, these are the following : King Leonidas (Sean MacGuire in the role of Gerard Butler) seeks advise to oracle(Christina Flanagan become into Ugly Betty)and establishes an alliance with Greeks polis facing the invading Persian army. Leonidas leaves his wife Queen (Carmen Electra in similar role of Lena Headey) and son , leading a small army formed by a captain(Kevin Sorbo in the character of Vincent Regan), accompanied by his son (Travis Van Winkle : Tom Wisdom look-a-like), and several others. The army called Falange is constituted by various Spartans named Hoplitas wielding the shield Heplon and long lances . The almost 300 hold off an immense Persian army commanded by king Xerxes(Ken Davitian in the role of Rodrigo Santoro). Meantime in Sparta are happening intrigues surrounding the Greek council whose protagonists are the Queen Margo, and Traitor( Diedrich Bader in similar role to Dominic West) . A hunchbacked wanna-be warrior woman (Nicole Parker, a Paris Hilton look-a-like, in similar character to Andrew Tiernan), informed Persians of a hidden way that could utilize to besiege the Spartans.\n\nFrom the start to the ending the coarse humor and the laughters are innumerable. Lots of gags and sketch, some of them funny but the movie lacks freshness. This is a hilarious parody,surrealist,extreme spoof and gross-out . As always the cinematographic references are numerous and provide silly laughs from start to finish,the amusement is guess what films result to be as Skull Rider, Rocky ,Borat, and TV contests . The picture contains loads of silly fun here and there and a passel of cameo appearances . Stay tuned through final credits with the cast singing and dancing . The film produced by Arnon Milchan is awfully directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The motion picture will appeal to vulgar humor enthusiasts and stupid comedy buffs.

Plus if they have enough knowledge of the references that has been brought in the mix with ancient Greece.\n\nIt's 2018 and I have watched it again! It certainly stood out to be one of the best parodies of all times, IMO (besides scary movie series).\n\nP.S: Carmen Electra is drop dead hot!"

Now, while I thought EM went all over the place in taking every pop culture item without any consistency in characterization and therefore made no sense whatsoever, I actually thought MTS stayed close to its source (300) and only went slightly overboard in going on other tangents (this time on reality programs like \"American Idol\", \"America's Next Top Model\", \"Dancing with the Stars\", and \"Deal or No Deal\"). Besides, I actually thought much of the material here was funnier than EM. Maybe I'm in a better mood than I was last year when I saw EM with a friend and his then 13-year-old nephew and his best friend with some worry about certain scenes being seen by them. Here, at least I know what to expect and its only with the friend. So in summary, I laughed at most of the pop culture references and many of the scandals that happened in the previous year (Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan). And many of the bad taste homosexual jokes were funny both to me and my gay friend. So if you feel like wasting a couple of hours just for fun, Meet the Spartans should do the trick if you don't feel like seeing the latest Oscar-nominated film."

Friedberg and co really believe that their \"material\" based on pop culture references is funny. It's not. You can get the same experience just by drinking alcohol or getting high. THAT is an understatement. With people's tastes in movies nowadays, its supply and demand. The more you watch, the more crap like this studios will churn out over and over again.

There is no need to describe the plot. The plot is basically the same as 300 with American culture things thrown it. I think that the creators of this movie went overboard with the gay jokes. The creators have to know that gay jokes are funny at a minimum, not like in this movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 because the joke regarding Britney Spears is a bit funny and Carmen Electra is pretty. Other than this, I found out the hard way that I should not watch this tripe. My warning to others: Do not waste your money renting or buying the DVD unless you want an hour and twenty minutes of torture. I rate this movie 3/10."

But as the film progressed, I found myself actually amazed at how this movie didn't go straight to DVD. Sure, I'll give the makers one or two moments that had a slight bit of humor, but all the jokes were extremely dragged on, to the point that I nearly fell asleep in the middle of a \"joke\". It left me thinking that the film-makers tried way too hard to make people laugh, that they ended up making an unfunny product.\n\nI left the cinema feeling ripped off (the first time I had ever felt this about a film). Trying to think of funny parts of the film was hard, as there were not a lot of them. The only reason I would want to see this movie again is for the scenes with Carmen Electra."

I didn't even pay to see this, and I'm still embarrassed to admit that I saw it.\n\nAll this does is take pop culture references and some of last years so called hit films and somehow mishmashes them together. When you have Rocky Balboa, the fat guy from Borat and lots of dancing based on Dancing with The Stars and other dance films, all mixed together, the result is destined to be the IMDb's worst ranked films in the top 250 futile films. I laughed when Britney got thrown into the pit of despair, and that's about it. But the rest of the jokes are so one dimensional, and so void of any intellect, that they have to repeat the same ones three of four times. There weren't even enough jokes to fill a 75 minute film. I guess there is a market for this type of entertainment or it wouldn't gross 18 mill on it's first weekend, but the humour is sad, the film making is terrible and the writing is a travesty.\n\nWhat a sad state Hollywood is in when crap like this gets made.\n\n0/10"

As far as I am concerned, no parody will ever make fun ENOUGH of the belligerent, war-mongering, fascistic, racist, sadistic and homophobic aspects of \"300\". No film will humiliate ENOUGH the downgrading of Western civilization that are Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and the US obsession with celebrity, however undeserved. People go to this film because they crave its subject matter: bad movies passing as art, insane celebrities passing as human beings. They come away from it complaining that it is too vulgar, but apparently never take time to reflect that is exactly what their so-called culture has become: a quagmire of artlessness, violent acts, crude humour and body fluids. Everyone should thank the writers for telling it like it is."

It's sad to see Kevin Sorbo and even Method Man sinking this low.

        "review_detailed_main": "Last year I saw a movie that left me speechless, literally speechless. Atonement, Stardust, Pirates of the Caribbean, hell they all had me talking happily afterwards, but Epic Movie, that just left me stone cold. I absolutely despised it, an unfunny, lousy excuse for a movie that made me horrified that people actually laughed in the cinema. I vowed never to watch that movie again and thankfully to this day I have not seen it again. However today, out of pure interest I ventured into Meet the Spartans. I didn't expect a good movie, in fact I only saw it to see if it was possible that a worse movie than Epic Movie could be made. And the movie did not disappoint. Meet the Spartans is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I smiled once, mainly due to the randomness of the sequence, and the rest of it I spent in loathing. So many films are spoofed in this movie, and yet none of the spoofs are funny. 300, Shrek the Third, Transformers, Happy Feet, Ugly Betty, American Idol and unfortunately so many more movies and TV shows make a random and annoying appearance here. They mention Heroes and Star Wars as well, two of my most beloved things on the planet, just for them to be mentioned is rubbing salt in the already deep and painful wound this movie caused. The movie is also never funny, it tries to be funny, and admittedly unlike Epic Movie this did seem to be making an effort. But it just never pulls it off, the \"I will survive\" sketch involving the Spartans was admittedly funny, but it was overdone and then they repeated the scene again to no effect whatsoever! The performances are pathetic, the spoofing just annoying, in fact there are next to no positives about this movie whatsoever. The majority of the audience did not laugh once in my screen, which was a good thing as it might finally mean that we will see an end to this ridiculous spoofs. But alas, Superhero Movie was advertised just before this, and that looks quite poor as well.\n\nSo let me go onto the performances. In spoof movies nowadays I never expect a decent performance, in fact the only actor I ever rely on in a spoof movie is Leslie Nielson, who thankfully did not sign on for this wretched movie. Instead we get Sean Maguire, whose CV includes EastEnders, unfortunately that pretty much explains the extent of his talent right there. Maguire ranges from stupidly annoying (the earlier scenes where he plays a teenage Leonidas practically being unbearable to watch), to just about bearable (I did see a hint of charisma in the Deal or No Deal sketch, just a hint mind you). Maguire just really isn't that talented an actor, or at least he can't show off any talent here because the writers seem to be making the thing up as they go along. Carmen Elektra turns up in her unfortunately extended role. Elektra isn't the best actress ever, and she has made a habit of showing up in these damned movies. Here she is tolerable at times, but generally she is there to look sexy and that's it. Ken Davitian turns up if only to pay for the bills as Xerxes. Okay he's reasonably amusing at times, but her shows up barely at all, and by the time he ends up as a Transformer (seriously don't ask) I just felt sorry for the poor actor. The rest of the cast, oh who cares to be honest. They're all as bad as one another for signing onto this piece of garbage.\n\nAnd here we get to the rest of the bad stuff in Meet the Spartans, brace yourselves as there is a lot. Firstly the humour is way off target. All we get are a series of fart jokes, break dances, pop culture references, and that's it. Britney Spears shows up to be laughed at twice in the movie, a fact I found closer to bullying than funny. The Pit of Death sequence is stupid and not even remotely funny, once you've seen three people kicked in you want to cry, then we get at least another two loads of people kicked in! American Idol shows up way too often, it wasn't funny first time and it certainly isn't the third time! The Simon Cowell being nasty routine is very much out of date, sure he criticises but he just paid of a family's mortgage the other day, so we don't really care about the Americans saying how nasty he is all the time any more. 300 is pretty much recreated scene for scene and also poked fun at scene for scene. Trust me if you liked 300 you will just be furious at this movie. I mean whoever would have guessed 300 was slightly homo-erotic? The sketches on Youtube that appeared at the time 300 was released were funnier than this, so all the stuff we see here has been done before and better! I admit to laughing once, the Happy Feet sketch is kind of funny, that's about it to be honest. The break dancing made me contemplate suicide, and the rest of the stuff left me bored and angry.\n\nSo here I am, one year later with a new spoof movie to hate for eternity. If you liked Epic Movie, yes there are some of you out there I know, then you may find this a tiny bit amusing. For the sane mortals amongst us however I recommend gouging your eyeballs out with a spoon rather than see this movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "With my workload getting increasingly heavy, and working on super secret projects that hope to see the light of day by end of the year, you should come to expect my reviews here returning to their titular roots, presented as far as possible in capsule style. And I kind of expected it to be so with the first movie I've seen after consciously making that resolution.\n\nMeet the Spartans is a waste of time. It has zero naturally funny moments, and lacked that creative, funny spark that would turn scenes into instant livewires. The gist of it is to poke fun at last year's 300, but what resulted was a whole host of lifeless jokes that do not tickle you at all. Again, it preys rather lazily at the wealth of material offered by pop culture, with references to recent movies galore, and taking the mickey out of celebrities from Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton to Sylvester Stallone and many more which only can be seen midway through the end credits roll (which made you wonder, when the credits were rolling, why you see many more cast who don't make it to the story proper).\n\nAgain, Carmen Electra vamps it up as a trashy, slutty character, this time Queen Margo, wife of Leonidas (Sean Maguire), with Kevin Sorbo (television's Hercules) as Captain of the Spartan warriors who defend their lands from the invasion of Xerxes (Ken Davitian, Azamat from Borat) and his digital effect Persian army. While there are no big stunt action sequences, what came across was perfectly cheap, from landscapes right down to costumes. And the jokes don't let down from ribbing homosexuality, especially amongst the Spartans, and too much of something makes one sick.\n\nMoreover, there seemed to be a fixation from writers-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer on spoofing one too many television series. From American Idol, to Deal or No Deal, every game show had to be featured, made fun of, and then discarded, and what really irked were the lacklustre lookalikes who, unfortunately, don't look alike at all. Far from it. Expect the usual crass jokes, except this time, the jokes seem to be constipated. It's not funny, and not trying to be funny. I guess there's an art to being funny and making comedies, but Jason and Aaron just don't cut it. While Scary Movie had enough to spawn sequels (which number 4 was quite a let down), Meet the Spartans will join the fates of wannabes like Date Movie and Epic Movie - forgettable. And one wonders why anyone in the right mind will fund projects like these, and also, the various companies with blatant product placements to be associated with junk too.\n\nYou might say given that I know what's coming, why bother to watch this in the first place. Guess I'll still have to venture to hell to warn others to keep clear of this turkey. This wholeheartedly deserves to go to the trash bin, and automatically a contender for worst picture of the year. It's a comedy that doesn't even try to be an iota of funny."

I have never seen something so disgusting in my entire life. The acting is like a 3rd grade play. The jokes, well; there are no jokes. Just random references to pop culture that are supposed to be funny. It's not like Family Guy either. Family Guy has plenty of funny moments and they make plenty of pop culture references. However, Meet The Spartans is just...well...I did not like it.\n\nI seriously hope that the idiots responsible for this, Epic Movie, and Date Movie die a slow and painful death."

No spoof movie deserves paying out decent money for and none of them need a big screen to get a laugh. So I ordered the DVD from an online rental company and the cost worked out at about 5p each. I made sure I got enough beer in for myself and mates to enjoy before watching it. I think it fair to say we all had a great laugh (what we managed to see and hear that is) and this film certainly gets the thumbs up from me and my friends. You could say there was a lot wrong with it but then again who really cares!? RECOMMENDED IF WATCHING WHILE VERY DRUNK ONLY!"

If nothing else, it entertained and took my mind off of my illness for a brief while. That's what a movie should do."

The jokes where lame and repeated over and over, it was fake and the acting was pathetic. IT WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. It's as though someone off the street with no imagination whatsoever said to themselves \"Hey! what the heck I'll make a crappy rip off of 300!\" My movie ticket said it went for at least an hour and half, but it went for about half of that. I sat in the cinema waiting for the bloody thing to get to the point, but it never did. It had no story whatsoever and the jokes where, well, non-existent.\n\nI want to walk out of the cinema with a good feeling and \"money well spent\" attitude, but this movie made me go up to the counter and ask for my money back. I felt like crying...I wasted 11 dollars and and an hour of my life on this...\"movie.\"\n\nI didn't even want to rate this....it doesn't deserve even the thought of a rating.\n\nDo not see this movie even if you liked scary movie and epic movie.

Mine however will be handing over \u00a35.50 of my money to the incompetent duo who made this film and sitting through the 70 most deeply boring/embarrassing minutes of my life in a cinema when I could be doing something more fun. What? Almost anything.\n\nThis film has no redeeming features. From the soundtrack, which consists solely of cheap hip-hop and inept remixes of dance songs, to the effects, most of which wouldn't look out of place in an amateur Be Kind Rewindesque fan parody (if you want to parody Transformers, then at LEAST make your vehicles, you know, TRANSFORM), to the acting (clearly they think they can get away with the shoddiest, hammiest high-school play acting, so long as they punctuate it with fanservicey images of Carmen Elektra), is so poorly executed you wonder whether the makers of this film are deliberately doing everything they were told not in film school.\n\nSpecial mention of course goes to the humour. Whether it's a \"hilarious\" bodily fluid splatter joke, a very 'political' jab against some Hollywood celebrity (oh, Britney shaving her head! Clever), \"postmodern\" product-placement (ie, adverts so blatant you just stare on aghast) or a reference to some obscure minutiae of American popular culture (half the reality shows references will be forgotten within a year), there's not an intentional laugh in the film. The only points that even raised a chuckle were: a) the terrible lookalikes (apparently, the only criteria for being a Paris Hilton lookalike is that you are blond), b) the shoddy effects, c) the nonsensical casting of \"the fat guy from Borat\" as Xerxes and the moronic narrator telling us \"Xerxes looked like the fat guy from Borat\". See, the thing is, he really didn't.\n\nMy only wish is that cinemas gave out refunds. If they did, this film would most definitely be worth your money back."

Im freaking' Leonidas...\". Just horrible. This movie is officially not funny. The plot is riddled with holes, the script is terrible, special effects and backdrops suck, cast is crap and the directing is worse than anthing I've ever seen. This movie should be avoided at all costs. The only reason i actually saw this movie(i saw it online for free) is because of Nicole Parker.

I only found myself seeing it because I attended a movie marathon and this happened to be included in this discounted ticket price. And it was still a rip-off.\n\nThis film is a shame to the already severely failing genre of spoof. It is not clever in any way, and the only decent writing in any part of the film are lines directly taken from 300. I hypothesise that these films- Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie- follow the world's most mind-numbing formula;\n\n1. Take movies that have been relatively decent or popular, that people have thought about spoofing and have done so correctly on some occasions, and therefore YOU should not touch, because YOU will fail epically.\n\n2. Strip the plot/s down to the barest, often irrelevant aspects, leaving plenty of room (hopefully at least, in the case of Meet the Spartans, 55 minutes for inane references to everything unfunny ever)for material that is not related to the plot in any way.\n\n3. Make a list of every film that has been relatively popular for the last few years, and make a list of everything that is irrelevant to the plot of the spoof, but is popular to the film, and find ways to pop it in the spoof with the subtlety and skill of a 3 year old painting with a cat. You MUST mention EXACTLY where the parody is coming from. An obviously offhand comment \"You've got HAPPY FEET\" or a casual complete zoom in to Rocky's iconic boxing shorts, reading \"ROCKY\" should do the trick nicely.\n\n4. Make a list of obviously very funny things such as people repeatedly getting hurt (Yeah, repeated child abuse in Meet The Spartans is ever-so-funny) and be sure to drag it out AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Use this philosophy with every unfunny gag in the film. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I'm talking at least 10 minutes of the same thing here.\n\n5. Release as a film. It doesn't have to be funny in any way for it to make money.\n\nSurely the world has gone downhill and died, its rotting remains appearing to be the very stuff this film is made of. Almost everything in the whole film that is parodied (and I use that term with as little discretion as possible) can be seen in the trailers, and even with the limited time in a trailer, it still sucks.\n\nI think I need a drink."

It's a personal responsibility issue, there is no excuse.\" Perhaps some will say \"No one's forcing you to see it, it's just a bit of fun.\" Well that's bull.

Think of the dozen or so beautiful indie movies that could have been made with the budget used for this.\n\nThis kind of dross is cynical, depressing, bandwagon jumping studio zombie fodder.

I scored the movie 10 which it deserves to get. Sean Maguire was awesome and he humiliated the 300 crap. You have to watch it guys it shows that stupid Spartans with their freaky outfit which suits the fagots! try to fight the great Persian army and all they got is 13 stupid fagot dancers!!!! try to fight (dance)!!!! The DEAD PIT was a great scene in which Leonidas which stands for lions like that I'd rather say loser's like kicks the whole famous Hollywood stars in.

How they continue to make movies is beyond me. They have just completed a hat trick with Meet The Spartans, that is, created 3 of the worst movies ever seen in a row. It's an incredible feat. Despite having a free ticket and being begged to attend with a friend (i have closed and terminated that friendship as a result), i still felt ripped off. Actually scrap that, i felt physically abused after viewing this. Stripped of any dignity.\n\nAnd despite this, we still see users on IMDb that actually give this rating more than 1 star (I'd happily hack the website and change the code to allow a zero rating if i could). I'm not sure as to what the mindset is of a person that could find this utter drivel humorous. Perhaps they find the idea of referencing a movie without actually making it any funnier, or on occasions, actually changing the script as a comedic tool. If that fails, let's use gay jokes. If that fails, lets reference again and this time tell the audience what it is we are referencing just in case they didn't laugh the first time. I mean the lack of humour is quite staggering, it actually made me cringe. I think heard more laughs in the cinema whilst watching Requiem For A Dream.\n\nI mean to call this movie a spoof is a complete and utter insult to the likes of Airplane! and Spaceballs. In fact, its an insult to the country of America that such a movie could be released. The fact that it made something like $18 million in its opening week perhaps give us an insight as to why America is the focus of terrorism. Perhaps these sources of terror were exposed to the films of Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer."

Seeing as this had made it to the infamous Bottom 100, I sadly consider this movie to actually be a useful tool for calibrating one's rating scale. But *only* for that purpose, not for entertainment. Truly, they don't come any worse than this.\n\nEven at 84 minutes, this movie struggles to fill its runtime. When the \"parody\" of 300 is over and the end credits start running, this is still barely over 70 minutes, so they add all the alternate and abandoned scenes to the end! These clunkers are so bad I cannot even imagine what horrors they have included as DVD/Blu-ray extras...\n\nOne always hears the words \"I did not laugh a single time during that load of crap\", but most often even a terrible movie elicits at least one laugh from the viewer. Now I have seen a movie during which I truly did not laugh even a single time. I did not even smile. At best, my mouth may have twitched once, but it might have been a muscle spasm.\n\nThe makers of these movies should learn one simple lesson since they obviously cannot be *prevented* from making them in the first place: do NOT attempt to make parodies of money shot scenes that in the original movies cost millions of dollars. Your \"parody\" will only become even more embarrassing than it already is. I feel pity for the technical crew, whose talent was wasted on this - obviously this was done so fast and cheap that the producers couldn't afford to pay them do spend the required time to do their work properly. Even the few talented actors who appear here seem to have been \"directed\" to act their scenes only once - which is kinda ironic, considering the \"writing\" is so bad, an infinite amount of takes would not have improved the end result.\n\nBottom line: *Believe* IMDb. This 1/10 movie should be buried into the crust of the Earth. Anyone who likes this is out of their mind. Yes, I really mean that. Argument on the \"merits\" of this movie if you like, it will only make you a bigger fool than you already are."

We've seen some very good movies from different genres recently (\"Charlie Wilson's War, \"P.S. I Love You\", and \"Atonement\"), but this movie left us gasping for air. Sometimes it's nice to let your hair down, put aside intelligent thought for an hour and a half, and enjoy some stupid humor. I'd say that we didn't go more than two minutes without laughing at something. There's a lot of pop culture references, and as long as you don't take it too seriously they're quite funny. If you're easily offended do not go see this movie! However, if you're capable of loosening up and laughing unabashedly at idiotic humor you'll have fun. P.S. If you stay until the very end of the credits there's one last little spoof that's pretty well-placed (considering that it features a character from a movie currently in theatres)."

Vomit is talked about in this movie, and I specially recommend to people older than 13 who've already seen the movie \"300\". I would not recommend anyone to buy this movie.

I previously thought that it was not possible to make a spoof movie worse than Date Movie but I was proved wrong. Those two should be banned from making movies! The first ten minutes were actually pretty funny so i guess it wasn't all bad but after those ten minutes it was absolutely awful! I remember when spoof movies actually tied all the movies that they were making fun of together in a smart way. They just took movies and threw them in as stupidly as they possible could. It brings shame to the movie 300. It was the only movie that I've ever seen in theaters when I seriously thought about leaving. This movie was probably written in a day. If you have more than an I.Q. of .1 then do not see this film! If I could physically kill this movie I would. I think i got my point across."

It was just the typical spoof movie to me and I fail to see why this would be so much worse than, for example, Scary Movie 1-4.\n\nThe TV-show spoofs were too much for me, but seeing Britney (and George Bush in the extra scenes) getting kicked into the Pit of Death... I liked it! :-) I might have weird humour, though. Never thought my opinion would differ so much from 98% of the reviews here.\n\nI gave it a 5 out of 10 and I was considering a 6."

Although instead of REAL battles, they have a break dance and stomp competition and mom jokes, Through out the movie you will see judges just like American idol, only when the Spartans has competitions/battles, It has good quality I don't want to spoil too much, so ill just say 1 thing, the ending would of been better cause they over done it with the result of the Spartans death oh and 1 more thing, its only ONE HOUR LONG! just 60 minutes i still recommend you guys to watch it"

Now I must agree that the creators decided to explain every premise of every punchline leading me to believe they wrote this thing with morons in mind but a couple of the bits (the different greetings for men and women Spartans) will hold up through the years. Many segments will not hold up as they used a lot of modern culture shock news for parody- like the little freak crying about Brittney (does anyone find him funny?? now let alone 10 years from now) In fact too often the film takes a bad joke and beats it into the ground as in the Stomp the yard/ You've been Served parody.\n\nMany actors were from Mad T.V. rehashing their impersonations of celebrities and did a wonderful job in almost every scene. The problem really was the script needed a Babaloo Mandel to tighten it up. I can't say it is worth full admission but it was not the total waste of time I thought it was going to be."

One can tell a joke once or twice and it still can be funny but after the 7th time it gets annoying. Maybe the reason why this movie dwells so much on one gag (albeit not a funny one, e.g. the dance-off, the deathly kick to the pits - all 53 of them, the game show references etc...) is because the set was so elaborately and painstakingly built, (and the dancers were so highly paid) they were trying so hard to milk every single lame gag they could think of and make full use (or abuse) of it. This movie has no particular direction, other than the one from the original movie, and definitely requires no talent whatsoever to make and I won't be surprised Friedberg and Seltzer would re-spoof this movie again given the chance.

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, amazingly enough I have to conclude that this was the best Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen in my entire life. It doesn't mean that this movie is exactly brilliant though. It's incredibly lame, features embarrassingly bad and unfunny moments and is basically a movie purely made to cash in.\n\nSimple fact is that as long as these movies are making money, more like them will likely get made and released. And this movies are making big money. Every time a Friedberg/Selzer parody gets released I see it somewhere in the top of the box office lists. I really don't understand this. Don't people by now know who Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are and what type of movies they make? I'm never telling people to boycott movies or film-making but now I'm simply begging everyone to stop and pay money to see these type of movies, it's the only way we can stop them from being produced. Power to the people! Yes, I know I'm also still watching these movies, so I probably look guilty as well but at least I'm not paying any money for it to do so.\n\nThe movie is titled \"Meet the Spartans\", so yes it indeed is mostly a spoof of the movie \"300\" and it follows basically the same plot line and type of characters but as you could expect from a Friedberg/Selzer the movie is spoofing tons of other recent successful movies as well, as well as some famous movie and TV celebrities. Like always the movie is bombarding us with this. Joke after joke is being put in the movie, as if they were thinking lets put in as many comical moments as possible and some of them are just bound to hit. I must admit, some jokes do hit and is the reason why I regard this movie as the best one from Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer but unfortunately it's only about 5% of the jokes and comical moments that do hit and made me laugh. 95% of the rest of the movie is just an utter waste of time and insulting to anyone's intelligence. No, there is nothing wrong with some silly comedy from time to time but not when it is as embarrassingly bad as is the case with \"Meet The Spartans\" and every other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie for that matter.\n\nBut I always have to give this movie credit for one thing; it's always good and professionally looking. There is still obviously some money and effort put into this movie and it has a good visual look over it. What it also does well is re-playing some of the well known sequences from \"300\". I'll guess you'll probably hate this movie less if you've seen \"300\" and most of the other movies that are being spoofed within this movie.\n\nAlso most of the actors do a decent job impersonating the actors from \"300\". Of course most characters are just totally bad and lame though but I don't think you can blame the actors for this. I think it was also a good choice to give Carmen Electra a much bigger role this time because lets face it, her appearances basically always had been part of the highlights of any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie. Also quite fun that Kevin Sorbo has a big part in the movie. He is of course best known for playing Hercules in the hit-series and TV movies. So he's perfectly in place in this movie, despite the fact that he already was 50 at the time of this movie.\n\nFor what it's worth; it's better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie I've seen before in my life. It doesn't mean this movie is watchable or recommendable though. Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made lame and bad comedy spoofs in the past and they will also just never become good at it. Please simply boycott their next movies when it will hit the cinema and you'll help to prevent these types of movies from being made and you'll stop unfunny and untalented people such as Friedberg and Seltzer from ever making a movie again. Thank you very much!\n\n3/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

For one, anyone who is going to see this movie should know from the previews, and simply from the name of the film, that this is a parody movie. If you strenuously hate the Date movies, Scary movies or the Epic Movie then what are you doing watching this film? 'Meet The Spartans' is a film that is obviously marketed towards teenagers, and it delivers well to this said group. I actually watched this movie twice, both times the cinema was packed with teens, and everyone was laughing throughout the movie. Memorable scenes, ranging from clever 'Yo Mama' jokes to Britney Spears (She is a joke, yes?) do make this movie worthwhile. There is no great cinematography in the film, but that's hardly expected. All in all, I believe this is a good movie to see if you're looking for a laugh-- it's something you would see with friends for a good time out."

Sean has the principal role as Leonidas (immortalized by Gerard Butler in \"300\"), and all three of them show a grasp of comic delivery with a silly line along with their impressive physiques.\n\nBut the script is a total mess, inserting pop culture jokes and celebrities into many a moment in a grab for laughs, with only a few of them hitting the mark. The sets aren't that bad and the costuming is what you'd expect in this kind of spoof.\n\nCarmen Electra walks through her role in such a stiff manner, she makes Maria Montez (of the '40s Sabu films) look like a thespian. The jokes are flat, the dialog is sophomoric and the whole mess is punishment to sit through after the first fifteen minutes."

The only thing this movie left me wondering was what the hell Kevin Sorbo was thinking when he signed the contract.\n\nThe only reason I watched this movie was because of passing references made by various friends. And it's not that I don't get the pop culture references or how shockingly easy it must have been to achieve the same effects as The 300, but I just don't get how the producers keep coming up with these over-budgeted pieces of crap. And worse yet, why people buy them. Even all the sex appeal of this movie was purely targeted at gay men. Not even Carmen Electra could spice things up enough.

The only surprise to come out of this film was to see how buff that guy from Eastenders had become.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Frank Miller-penned disaster 300 provided the backdrop to many ignorant comments about a thoroughly inaccurate and outright insulting portrayal of the Spartans; as a folklorist and lifelong enthusiast of classical mythology and legend, as well as having an interest in the actual history of the event (or as much as can be determined from what remains), I was appalled not only by the flagrant disregard for even the spirit of the events. But I wasn't surprised. After all, it was Frank Miller. It shouldn't surprise me that 300 was a horrific, homophobic, historically-inaccurate abomination.\n\nThen came Meet the Spartans, which admittedly is limited by its source material -- the film 300, along with numerous references to popular culture -- but is amusing enough to pass the time. While it is also brought down by a rather short running time, and a few jokes that hit or miss, the ones that hit are amusing enough to carry through the ones that don't. It's also, ironically, closer to the spirit of the story, despite its silly jokes, than 300 could ever hope to be, with its testosterone-laden homophobia and self-important pretension evident at each and every turn. Meet the Spartans takes all the best instances of that and turns them into wicked comedy, which works as well as it does because of the generally talented cast and amusing setup.\n\nThat's not to say that everything works equally well. 300 doesn't really give much to work with, and they do manage to parody everything that they can. But some of the things used to fill the time between moments is too dependent on pop culture references, and these aren't always as funny as they could be. Additionally they may not age well, and at some point down the line people may watch this and wonder why certain stretches are actually supposed to be funny, or what they refer to in their many celebrity imitations and so forth.\n\nThe downbeat ending, unfortunately too-closely mirroring 300's own, also started to wind down the film and wasn't able to pick it up until a hilariously outrageous sequence during the credits, which do pick up the mood considerably and had me laughing again before I knew it.\n\nOverall, however, this blows 300 and other equally pretentious and overblown films out of the water. It's certainly fun for a casual viewing, and the extras on the DVD really make it worth picking up, because there's a lot of them, and they're enjoyable. This isn't really some kind of deeply intellectual fare, naturally, but it's a lot of fun if one approaches it with the mindset that it's just simple, mindless fun -- something 300 should've been, but wasn't even close to being, and instead it tried to be some kind of historical put-on. Meet the Spartans wisely eschews the pretension and just unabashedly brings on relentless silliness, and in my opinion it's certainly enjoyable enough for a rental, if nothing else."

        "review_detailed_main": "showing Xerxes like this its nothing except dishonor to Persian culture. Xerxes was son of Darius the Great of Persia and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. After his accession in October 485 BC, he suppressed the revolts in Egypt and Babylon that had broken out the year before and appointed his brother Achaemenes as governor or satrap over Egypt (Old Persian: khshathrapavan). In 484 BC, he took away from Babylon the golden statue of Bel (Marduk, Merodach), the hands of which the legitimate king of Babylon had to seize on the first day of each year, and killed the priest who tried to hinder him. Therefore Xerxes does not bear the title of King in the Babylonian documents dated from his reign, but King of Persia and Media or simply King of countries (i.e. of the world). This proceeding led to two rebellions, probably in 484 BC and 479 BC. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I_of_Persia"

No meet the Spartans manages to be significantly worse than both of those films combined. Parodying epic films 300, Transformers and err Happy Feet? This is only for those who are deeply dedicated to this long dead series and car crash cinema enthusiasts.\n\nI don't know how my brain allowed me to see this picture. I thought it would be like trying to suffocate yourself; your body would just shut down before you could do it. Apparently I was wrong. I sat through this movie and laughed once, and that was during the preview for another movie. There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, \"This might be funny if...\" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humor, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle.\n\nFrom the creators of Scary Movie and Date Movie comes this tongue-in-cheek parody of the sword-and-sandal epics, dubbed Meet the Spartans. The 20th Century Fox production was written and directed by the film-making team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.\n\nSure, Leonidas may have nothing more than a cape and some leather underwear to protect him from the razor-sharp swords of his Persian enemies, but that won't stop the brave leader and his team of 13 warriors from defending their beloved homeland against a powerful invading force that includes the likes of a mutant Paris Hilton, the Transformers, the Ghost Rider, and Rocky Balboa.\n\nThe much-discussed homo eroticism of Snyder's epic predictably is played for laughs here. (The Spartans are a campy group of guys who march -- or, more precisely, skip -- to a disco beat.) But after the 10th or 20th repetition of a gag about Leonidas' leather underpants and the other scantily-clad Spartans -- a gag that isn't terribly funny the first time -- even the more virulent homophobes in the audience likely will respond with groans, not giggles.\n\nThe unmistakable air of desperation hangs heavily over the entire production, as the filmmakers repeatedly resort to introducing celebrity lookalikes -- doubles for Britney Spears, Tom Cruise, George Bush, the cast of \"American Idol\" -- as nothing more than walking-and-talking punch lines.\n\nIt's reflective of the pic's insubstantially and slapdash construction that, shortly after the closing credits begin to roll at the 65-minute mark, the filmmakers introduce deleted scenes -- not outtakes but snippets obviously trimmed in the editing room -- without any regard for continuity or coherence. It's as though they figured that, what the hell, they went to the trouble and expense of shooting this stuff, and, by God, they were going to use it.\n\nMy final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. Meet the Spartans is probably the worst film ever made."

Or are they 5 years old and therefore perhaps not mature enough to form a valid opinion? Because they will grow up and regret their decision. Anyway i didn't really see a plot to the film, mainly stabs at celebrities, stabs that are constant, unfunny and unsurprisingly predictable. This is all performed (i use that word loosely) under the guise of Spartans, who most people believe to be half naked bodybuilders who shout a lot. AS much as i hated the attempts at humour and the fact that this is classed as a comedy, what i hate the most is that the stupid people who enjoyed this probably believe that the spartans were really like the way they're portrayed in this \"film\" or in 300 for that matter. After the film i was confused, how can films like \"there will be blood\" and \"american gangster\" be made in the same country and year as this piece of sickening humourless rubbish."

I've seen offensive movies before and there is usually a point to be made, here the only point is \"I've got you ticket money and what will you do about it.\" I am ashamed for those actors who with this on their credits may never get another acting role again in their lives, why risk something like this?

It's the sight gags and corny humor we all tuned in for! McGuire is added by Kevin Sorbo of Hercules fame as his captain. Sorbo is so good here, why doesn't this guy get more good roles? Carmen Electra, naturally, is on hand to lend some sex appeal. Nicole PAker of MAd TV plays no less than five roles and if you don't laugh and her dead-on Paula Abdul imitation there's something wrong with you.\n\nI laughed out loud at most of this blissfully short spoof, but my favorite sequence was the rank session with the hi-hop Persians. Funny! Lines like, \"Your Momma is such a sloppy drunk, I thought she was David Hasslehoff!\" are just righteously funny. Deidrich Bader is a hoot as Traitorus, Get it? and the rather obvious jokes about the Spartans latent homosexuality are so dead-on that you have to laugh, love the Budweiser parody!!\n\nMeet the Spartans ain't Shakespeare folks, its not supposed to be. Sure it could have been better, but its right up there with Epic Movie and Not Antoher Teen Movie as very funny. Plus guys there is one outrageous shot of Queen Margo (Carmen) that you have to see to believe! I mean my jaw hit to floor!\n\nThis is just a funny spoof start to finish and stay tuned through the credits, some of the funniest stuff is there!

There were funny parts and there were so-insulting-it's-not-funny parts. Here is my review for Meet The Spartans:\n\nPlot: All you need to know is that this is a parody of 300 (the main plot) with movies like Spider-Man 3, Ghost Rider and Transformers (for which I've written a review already). Show parodies of American Idol and other parodies like You Tube are in here too. There are funny parts to it, but not a lot of them-7/10\n\nCast: There are a few familiar faces in this movie- Carmen Electra (Epic Movie, Cheaper by the dozen 2, etc.) and Ken Davitian (Borat no less). Other then that, the cast is pretty much new to movies, but do a good job nonetheless- 6/10\n\nJokes: Because there's not enough SFX in this movie, I'm replacing it with jokes. You see, there were good jokes (the Bond scene, the blue screen gag, the GTA Parody, I will survive and a couple more) Jokes that didn't make too much sense, but were good nevertheless (the opening scene, The yo mama fight, Xerxestron and a few others) and some, just plain bad altogether (the deleted scenes, the Mumble/Leonidas fight, the ending *excluding the song that is* and the trailers before the movie *well duh* among others)- 8/10\n\nOverall: I liked this movie, the cast did their best. the jokes kept coming (although some didn't make sense or were pretty bad). But overall, It ended up as mediocre- 6/10\n\nAnother review by Phil MacRae- This...Is...IMDb!"

I had thought about not taking her, but she pestered me for 2 weeks to go on opening night. Plus she had a friend with her. This is a PG-13 rated movie that should have been rated R. I sat in anothe row with my girlfriend and was really squirming in my seat the entire time. It is full of homosexual jokes from beginning to end and they weighed the movie down beyond description. Carmen Electra was abysmal and I pray to God that I never have to see that fat guy from \"Borat\" scantily clad ever again. It's just overkill. There was also enough product placement that the producers probably were able to raise the entire budget from corporate sponsorship. I am convinced that we are in full decline as a civilization if this is the idea of humor in the minds of our youth. Don't waste your time with this stink bomb."

I can start off by saying, it is really not worth seeing again; not only is it bad in it's own right, but my God has it aged badly. Many of the references that might have worked back then were just old and tired this time around - and that was only two years ago.\n\nLike I said, this film doesn't just suffers from being dated, it just suffers, period. It has been so crammed full of unfunny, vulgar jokes that repeat in absurdum, that I often found myself wishing they would just stop being \"funny\" and continue with what little plot there was. Naturally, being a spoof that more or less just rips off the original, it has no plot of it's own, it just relies on those jokes, and that's where it FAILS. That's a good way to sum this up, Meet the Spartans is a huge failure of spoof movie."

The film starts with the only part of the film you might be able smile at, with a few jokes. From there the film is riddled with unclever sex jokes and pop culture references that already aren't funny, and will make absolutely no since a few years down the road. I've seen Friedberg and Seltzer's other big film, Epic Movie, and didn't really like it.

You have a lot of stars of the moment and things that made sense back then (like a viral video of someone crying over Brittney Spears - if you know, you know). And yes you can say that the movie 300 (based on the comic, which was based on something historical) is not believable either. But it did not have cars or GTA references or dance battles for that matter.\n\nThe main actor here (playing Leonidas), does a really good job. The movie itself however seems to be mean to a lot of things. You have to be in tune with the comedy this promotes ... there is also a lot of things that can be called offensive and something \"...phobic\" (you can pick and choose yourself).

OK-it was free and the price was right. It's a spoof of the movie 300. saying it had no plot is nonsense. It actually follows the movie from beginning to end. I've watched 300 3 x now and MTS 3+ x. On the whole,MTS was the better movie. I could have done without the defecating penguin and the general use of body fluids for laughs from the first shot of the the baby Leonides(who did look a lot like a baby Shrek) to the Pit of Doom to Xerxes (who's body jewelry I thought was over the top-till I saw 300!)and the training of the small boys( which again struck me as too harsh-till I saw 300.) All in all,this reminded me of SNL spoofing S. Palin. The lines were already there. So was the plot. If you didn't like the spoof,maybe you should take a more critical look at the original.\n\nSo here I am -it's July 18,2009. I have watched the movie 5 times-at least. As soon as I get around to it ,I will buy a copy.It's fandamdtastic. I read ALL the comments. SHAME one your closed little minds. I don't usually waste much time on spoofs but this was a worthy one. I watched it in isolation. I watched after having seen its model. Best of all,I watched the 2 movies back to back. Wow! The 300 was pretentious crap. Really. But Meet The Spartans made it forever,memorable pretentious crap.I especially love the spray-on six packs and the dancing and skipping.But then I have a superb sense of humour and just love the snark. As for the child abuse? It's actually a pretty broad depiction of what happens in 300. So maybe you should watch closer."

An abomination that believes itself to be so self-aware, that it has transcended comedy as an entire genre. No, seriously. Friedberg and Seltzer fully acknowledge how low they have stooped, just for one measly laugh from a societal degenerate watching this in the hope they are experiencing a future masterpiece.\n\nWithin the first whole minute of runtime, baby Shrek vomits on a peasant and is subsequently kicked down a cliff, abandoned to die for its deformity. A Vietnamese child is then gently put on display for \"Brangelina\" to waltz on over and adopt the youngling, seemingly mocking their generous intents as doting parents. And then Leonidas, with a fully grown beard at the age of one, is accepted as a Spartan. But to become king, he must endure brutal training in order to hunt down (wait for it...) \"gangsta penguin\". Essentially 'Happy Feet' with a black man's attitude. Years later Carmen Electra erotically dances, objecting herself and women in general for all those white nerdy virgins who want to bash one out in front of the screen, and a messenger from Xerxes wanders across. He is taught the gender greetings within Sparta. High fives for the ladies, and open mouthed kissing with tongues for the gents. Aren't gay jokes absolutely frickin' hilarious? Blah blah blah, Leonidas shouts the famous line and kicks the messenger down a badly visualised pit. Along with Britney Spears during her mid-life crisis shaving moment, the panel from 'American Idol' and some other singer who doesn't ring any bells with me whatsoever.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that's all you need to know about Meet The Spartans. Just a montage of celebrity re-enactments, American game/talent shows, a plethora of \"spoofs\" from unrelated films released in '07 and a bunch of actors destroying the flimsy remains that they call \"careers\". Sexual exploitation, homophobic slurs and borderline racism round off the \"humour\" that opts to gross viewers out instead of injecting some stimulating hilarity. So yeah, no thanks. The irony in all this, is that this isn't the worst parody feature from these directors! Mind-boggling to say the least. Oh, and Lindsay Lohan predictably gets mocked once again..."

With every one of these abominations that gets released on what seems to be a yearly basis, one must wonder what aspects of these films could possibly entice producers into letting this trash appear on the big screen over and over again.\n\nTo briefly state the flimsiest of plots, we follow the Spartan King Leonidas ('we won't get sued, you say? Okay then, we'll stick with Leonidas') as he leads a group of misfit soldiers defending their homeland against the invading Persians. Obviously plagiarising the visually epic 300, this film cares less about constructing a cohesive (or even logical) plot than it does about inserting an avalanche of pop culture references into every situation possible.\n\nWhenever the term 'gratuitous' is used to describe a film, it is usually in order to criticise the excessive action, which has inevitably let down the overall appeal of a film. In this case, the excess is in relation to the directors' efforts to take a jab at every aspect of popular culture, from Michael Bay to Britney Spears, from Ugly Betty to Shrek.\n\nUniquely, the poor form shown in this area does not detract from the rest of the film, solely because the references are the only point of the film. There are no progressive plot points, no efforts to invoke character development, and certainly no originality in the screenplay. The allusions are about as relevant as they are funny. In fact, they frequently flirt dangerously with the line of insulting the viewer's intelligence, regardless of how seriously you take your films.\n\nAnybody familiar with my reviewing style will know that, while I never hesitate to throw down my opinion on any film, I ultimately leave the decision up to the reader; simply offering a guide on how to critically approach the movie in question, and always accepting of other people's opinions, even if we can't agree. This is especially the case when critiquing a comedy: the most subjective of all movie genres.\n\nI cannot offer any of my fellow film connoisseurs that sort of leeway with Meet The Spartans. Nothing about this film came even close to forcing a mere chuckle out of me, let alone matching its advertising campaign as a light-hearted laugh riot. The best example of my rage towards this film is the running time. At just over sixty minutes long, it appears that even the writer/director combination of Friedberg and Seltzer gave up after realising they had squeezed the entire pop culture landscape dry, and decided to end the film when they couldn't think of anything screen-worthy to occupy the next half-hour.\n\nSeriously, the outstanding benefit of the American Writer's Strike was the fact that these two did not go near a keyboard for a precious few months. Just to clarify for those of you still in two minds, I despise this film with a passion; to this day, I still consider it the single worst film in history. The only thing keeping it from scoring a big, fat, satisfying zero? The IMDb won't let me.\n\n*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

Meet the Spartans is not as abysmal as Disaster Movie, which is by far and away the worst of their spoof movies and quite possibly the worst spoof movie ever. However, that is not saying much, for it is a very poor movie, junk-food cinema at its worst some people have described it. The film is very poorly made, with very slapdash camera work and fake looking sets. I personally thought some of the costumes were nice and the soundtrack was tolerable. Asides from the scenery and the in general cheap look of the film, other failures are in the jokes and in the acting. The acting to say the least was atrocious with Kevin Sorbo and Sean Maguire playing themselves and Carmen Electra simply dreadful as Queen Margo. The jokes, what happened to them? Constant homophobic jokes about men in codpieces and scatter shot send ups of contemporary pop culture, they were close to offensive rather than funny and you really do get the sense you've seen it all before. Plus the plot line was almost non-existent. Overall, I didn't hate Meet the Spartans as much as Disaster Movie(or Epic Dud...excuse me, Epic Movie for that matter) but it is for me a poor film. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I love funny movies. The Scary Movie series was really good. Epic Movie also had a high rating on my part. Tonight Me and my friends (we are 14) went to see Meet The Spartans. All I can say is, we had more fun laughing at each other than the movie. There was no story line to it at all. It was filled with advertisements from companies like Coke and Gatorade. There were a couple funny parts but not enough to keep you focused. Not enough parodies. We read tons of reviews online and all of them had low ratings but we didn't believe them. We thought they just didn't have a sense of humor. We were wrong, this movie didn't have a sense of humor. Lots of scenes in the trailer are not in the movie. When the movie started there was only about 20 other people in the theater. When the credits started at the end. At the most 10 were left.\n\nSo no, PLEASE believe me. Take this from a 14 year old guy who laughs at everything, don't waste your money on this. Go see something better like Cloverfield."

There is also a running gag of famous celebrities' vaginas. How could that in any way be funny? (Friedberg/Seltzer film conversation) \"Hey what random unfunny thing now should we insert in to mindf*ck the audience.\" \"How about we show the audience Britny Spears' vagina censored\" \"Hey that is an awesome idea.

Most of the so called \"Humorous scenes\" were really not funny at all, the start was okay but when the movie really gets into the story you realize it was a waste of money. Some of the scenes were disturbing and made me feel sick. One scene was especially annoying was the Pit of Death, I completely over the whole Pit of Death scene, the first time someone got thrown in I thought it was sort of funny then it seemed like everyone was getting thrown in and it became very annoying. I would not recommend watching this movie at the cinemas, it is a complete waste of time and money! For those who would like to see it, maybe borrow it from Videoezy or something when it is released because it's not worth buying on DVD. In this movie there is a lot of sexual scenes, and probably wouldn't be suitable for under 13's to see this movie."

Perhaps if you are in the age range 12-17 (or maybe beyond) you may find this movie funny. Personally, I found parts of this movie funny, but as a whole, I felt like I had been ripped off when I left the theater. It was short, but maybe in this case this is actually a positive thing, because after much longer, I'm not sure if I would have been able to remain in my seat.\n\nAge: 19 Gender: male Tastes: usually will enjoy the occasional fart/sex/etc joke, but in this case, maybe this movie crossed the line a little.\n\nIn conclusion, if Epic Movie is in your top ten, you will probably love this movie."

To sum it up everything is just dragged out way too much and many of the same jokes are repeated way to often, Don't get me wrong it also contains some extremely funny spoofs, but just wait to rent it so you don't waste your money on the other 75% garbage. If you really want to enjoy yourselves just go see Cloverfield or some other comedy thats on your list and pass this one up until you can rent it for around 3$"

        "review_detailed_main": "As this film begins, you see an ancient Greek guy inspecting babies. One is a baby Shrek and the puppet looked 100% plastic and stupid--and then began spewing green slime. And so begins this pile of manure. Soon, eating canned dog food, killer penguins (which crap on the leading man), laughing at the death of Anna Nicole Smith and the like follow in this dreadful film. It's obvious that this is going to be a very, very long movie.\n\nLike \"Disaster Movie\", \"Superhero Movie\" and 1001 other iterations, this movie was simply dreadful. While not quite as horrible as \"Disaster Movie\", this is like saying that Ebola isn't quite as bad as and the Pneumonic Plague--neither one is particularly nice! Why anyone would pay for such a dreadful experience is beyond me.\n\nSo why is this movie so bad? Well, it's obvious that the movie was made cheaply and the film makers didn't care if most people would never go see this film. All you needed, in their opinion, was an ample supply of stupid teenagers with money! And, apparently, there are LOTS of stupid and gullible teens out there! So, with such love expectations, why bother with decent writing or acting?! And, again because you are appealing to the lowest common denominator, why not fill it with cursing, spitting, fart and wiener jokes?! It's not like it takes a lot of talent or imagination to employ this sort of humor. Only a few times did I laugh...but this was awfully rare.\n\nMost of the suggestions I made for \"Disaster Movie\" would also apply to this film and I don't want to repeat them again. Still, I'll try to recap the important points. Try to parody less films and put quality into the ones you do parody. Get writers who are not idiots or squirrels. Avoid wiener, spit or poop humor. And finally, maybe just stop making these type of films. \"Airplane\" and \"Hot Shots\" were good films as were their sequels. Otherwise, it probably would have been best to quit making goofy parody movies then instead of bleeding a totally dead franchise for yet another dreadful so-called comedy.\n\nBy the way, I just noticed that star of this film Carmen Electra and Hitler share the same birthday. Coincidence? I think not!"

It's certainly rubbish but is it really a contender for worst film ever made ? What is suffers from is that it's a sketch show premise stretched out to feature length premise and since there's only two targets , the movie 300 and the cult of celebrity , the premise is stretched way beyond breaking point , especially since the writers and directors Friedberg and Seltzer only see 300 as a foundation to hang gay jokes upon . The Spartans were gay so we get gag after unsubtle gag involving both blatant and latent homosexuality . In fact the jokes are so inoffensive no matter how crude they are that you'd think they were written by Hilary Clinton\n\nThe other failing is that we're shown umpteen parodies of celebrities but you're totally puzzled as to who they're supposed to be . I thought one of the celebs was Chris Hansen but apparently it was a presenter from American Idol , one celebrity mentions Scientology and it was only then I realised it was meant to be Tom Cruise ( or was it John Travolta ? ) and we see \" Simon Cowell \" who'd have a hard time convincing Stevie Wonder it's Simon Cowell > Maybe MST would have worked better on radio than the silver screen ?\n\nYes MST is absolute rubbish but I hasten to add that it's maybe not the worst comedy Friedberg and Seltzer never mind the worst comedy or worst film ever made . At least the cast manage a dead pan manner throughout , though laughing and smiling isn't something you'd associate with this film be it working on it or watching . You do get the feeling that perhaps the cast deserved better"

Yes, it's a blatant rip-off of \"300\"-and it proudly owns that fact, turning the epic drama into a playground of absurd comedy. The directors went out of their way to deliver humor that's outrageous, self-aware, and intentionally ridiculous.\n\nThis isn't a movie for serious critique; it's one to sit back, relax, and enjoy. It's not trying to be groundbreaking-it's trying to be fun, and it succeeds. If you love slapstick humor, pop culture references, and some good old-fashioned silliness, \"Meet the Spartans\" is definitely worth the watch. Just remember, it's comedy-not history!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is probably the nicest review for this movie ever. Kinda sad.\n\nI love parody movies. I will admit, I am of the very very very few that liked Epic Movie. And even when people were saying how terrible Meet The Spartans looked I still wanted to see it. Well, just kinda disappointed in what I saw.\n\nFirst off, the running time. An hour? And that is not counting the \"deleted\" scenes in the ending credits! They allowed an hour long movie? The running time not only makes you feel cheated, but it also shows at one point, the writers and directors said \"Oh crap. We've run out of movies to spoof and celebrities to make fun of. Better call it a movie.\"\n\nAnd what is with the recent trend of these parody movies? C'mon, we had enough jokes about Paris, Britney and American Idol in Date Movie and Epic Movie! Look for some new material! Sadly, this should have been called \"Pop Culture Movie.\" And it will be forgotten in 10 years while the things they make fun of fade away. That's why true spoof movies spoof timeless classics (Spaceballs, for the win).\n\nAnd we are aware of what movies you are spoofing too. What the heck? \"...just like Tobey Maguire did in Spiderman 3.\" Who's narrating this film? John Madden?\n\nStill I gotta admit, some scenes did get a laugh from me. But unfortunately most of those were shown in the commercials/previews, such as the Rambo scene (which was shown at the end of the movie, just slapped in there randomly). And of course, Carmen Electra is always easy on the eyes for sure. One scene with her made me hungry for pizza (those who've seen this will know what I mean). Oh and the actress who plays both Britney and Paris? Way hotter than the both of them will ever be!\n\nSo overall I cannot declare this a spoof movie, rather a quickly rushed mix of 300 and everything that is big in pop culture. Want a better one? The Scary Movies are pretty good, and the recently released Superhero Movie knows what to do. Or if you want classic spoofs, rent Spaceballs and the Naked Gun movies."

Surprising what load of wanton, brazen, offensive comedies come out of Hollywood! not even 5 minutes in the movie, it became so boring and the comic lines and reliefs were abysmal. It was my biggest mistake in spending money for buying the DVD. But now I know. Additionally, I think its not worth the effort trying to make parodies out of movies which themselves do not come up to the standards of making any considerable mark in the annals of movie history and fame. Saying any more about the movie would be spilling the beans, and I would not like to do so. My advise to anybody who is forced to watch this is to avoid under all circumstances and rather watch a dubbed Chinese movie or any other language film with subtitles. The pain would certainly be less."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first thing I have to say about this film is that it is easily one of the most appalling films I have ever watched. It frankly disgusts me that these people were given millions of dollars to produce such utter shite. I laughed once throughout the entire film at a line delivered in approximately the first 2 minutes, the rest was embarrassing and insulting to watch. I can justify watching an awful film if I can laugh at it, such as 'House of the Dead', which despite being a train wreck of a film was actually unintentionally quite funny. However, Meet the Spartans despite aiming to be funny was frankly excruciating to watch. All I could think of throughout was that I was slowly losing an hour of my life and \u00a35.50 that I would never see again.\n\nThe jokes are immature and at times homophobic. The humour is basically trash that I'm almost certain could and would have only appealed to a group of 15 year old boys. Upon leaving the cinema I have never seen such a depressed group of people. The movie is from the same writers as 'Date Movie', 'Epic Movie' and the Scary Movie films. I personally am quite a fan of the Scary Movie films and thought I would give this the benefit of the doubt despite being very disappointed with 'Date Movie'. I have however learnt my lesson now and shall be investing no more money into watching any of Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzers films.\n\nThe cast is not particularly promising but neither did I expect it to be a death sentence. Sean Maguire and Carmen Electra both star in the main roles, but I personally don't think the casting had anything to do with the fall down of this film, nothing could have saved this. The script is frankly appalling, the story is messy and the humour is just offensive; sadly not in a tongue in cheek way. I think that Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Seltzer need to learn the use of subtly. Sometimes less really is more. It seemed with this film everything including the jokes had to be taken to the extreme. Their exhausting efforts to be funny are actually the only funny thing about this film."

Even if you're into the kind of sad humor this movie features, 'Meet the Spartans' will fail to surprise you a single time, and thus, fall flat.\n\nA major ingredient of 'Meet the Spartan'-humor is the idea that anything can be funny if you add a famous name, however, just trying to be funny by randomly insulting celebrities is a very cheap way to produce laughter. People will laugh when they recognize the celebrity-look-alike on screen without thinking.\n\nI'm not trying to insult the people who made 'Meet the Spartans'. It is my belief that they just didn't care about quality when they made this movie.\n\nAs a side note, after seeing 'Meet the Spartans', a friend of mine just raised the score of every Uwe Boll move he's ever seen."

I usually make fun of bad movies, but this was so bad that I am actually angry and insulted that it was ever made.\n\nThere is not one redeeming quality about this entire movie. They drag every joke premise out for about 10 minutes. It was torturous to watch!!! I implore everyone who reads this to return your DVD to the store and demand your money back!!! Why should you be doped into paying for what amount to a $19.00 drink coaster.\n\nMy sister purchased a copy of Date Movie from a bargain-bin at Block Buster. It was so bad, she went back to the store the next day and INSISTTED on a refund. They gave her a hard time, but finally agreed to a store credit. If we all take her lead and insist that the store manager refund out money, then maybe, just maybe Hollywood will take notice and start requiring some standard from their film makers.\n\nAnd don't be afraid or intimidated, we pay a lot of money to be entertained, what right do they have to keep our money if they can't deliver on the goods! Sometime it's not that hard to get your money back. I walked out of Mary Rielly in 1996 and asked to see the theater manager, before I could finish explaining why i was walking out, he just offered up two theater vouchers for another movie.\n\nStick to your guns and DEMAND your refund!!!"

The acting, writing and directing is pretty much what I expect from this kind of parody, not great, but does the job. The jokes were easy to spot, so you probably wont miss a thing even if you take a bathroom break and leave the movie running. A lot of the jokes were on the media, commercials and off-course modern movies, mainly 300.

At the end of the mercifully just-over-an-hour film, he turned to me and apologized for making me sit through that with him, then told me that the movie must have shortened the time he had left.\n\nIn the next two years that followed, I had pretty much forgotten all about Meet the Spartans and its litany of terrible jokes and stupid sight gags. My friend passed away. I started to go to university. I got a job. And many, many better movies came out. Then, two weeks ago, the unthinkable happened. This abomination of a motion picture was unceremoniously tossed back into my life in the form of a DVD. My roommate had found it in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart and wished to watch it. I hesitantly agreed, hoping that maybe on the second viewing it would be better. Unsurprisingly, it wasn't. The jokes were still unfunny, gross-out humor that would only amuse middle school boys was still abundant, and the theme of \"hurr durr, look at the ghey guyz\" was still the main takeaway from this film.\n\nI had the misfortune of sitting through this atrocity twice. Save yourself the pain and misery and don't even see it once."

But I did, and I still reject the day that I did that... I also hated that they did BAD impressions of the famous people of America, favorite games, TV shows that are watched by a lot of people and other movies or characters of that movie. And then the thing with the pit of death! I guess they thought their movie was too short so they stretched out a joke so far that it is not funny anymore. And the sexuality of Carmen Electra was way over the top. I gave it a 2, not a 1, because I thought there are movies worse then this one. I haven't found them yet, but I know that they're out there. Don't get me wrong and I said it before: I like parodies and I like the kind of humor Leslie Nielsen, kind of, introduced. But this was nothing like it. They tried, but didn't succeed. If your curious about this movie, watch it. But if you're not, don't do this to yourself. It's just not worth it. Life's too short."

One good thing is Carmen Electra - she does add a little glamour to the movie, but it's just so full of very very poor 'funny bits' that it's just not funny."

Having seen 300, I was pretty sure that it would help me understand the pop culture references and appreciate the \"wacky\" humor more.\n\nAnd it certainly would.

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't know what I was thinking, I really don't. I should have known that spending an evening watching Meet The Spartans would have been a waste of time and I can only put the decision to do so down to some inherent sadomasochism and a Freudian desire to bring myself pain, but good lord Meet the Spartans is terrible. In fact it's more than terrible. This movie is so unquestionably bad that it's staggering, it must take an unprecedented lack of talent to produce something so bad. So without further ado people I have to beg you, in the wake of this latest fiasco, PLEASE stop going to see movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. You know the sort - Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Date Movie yadda yadda yadda, each one of them a tedious marathon of pop-culture jokes blessed with the ability to miss anything that even resembles a funny joke yet still have idiots flocking to see them as they roll off the assembly line. This plea might seem hypocritical given that I've seen it, but hey, I played with the pirates and downloaded it for free. Get out of that one fatty.\n\nAnd if the abominable back-catalogue that these people have smeared across the face of the world isn't enough to convince you that this movie is painful to watch, let me put it this way: You remember all the classic spoof movies? Airplane, Hot Shots, Spaceballs, Top Secret and the immortal Naked Gun series? What made those movies hilarious examples of just how funny spoof films could be was down to two things; they told their own stories and took themselves seriously. No matter how recycled their plots might have been they were still fresh spins on the material and no matter how ludicrous the jokes got the actors still treated it with a deadpan sensibility.\n\nMeet the Spartans on the other hand doesn't do either of these things. It's just 300 with loads of gay jokes thrown in and actors who pull ludicrous faces throughout, each one of them missing the obvious point that for things to be funny, they shouldn't be behaving as if they are. Admittedly, the bit involving Leonidas beating the living daylights out of his son raises a chuckle but everything else falls dismally flat. In fact, it's hard to consider them to be jokes at all - most of the so called comic set pieces simply involve the Spartans doing something that the writers have seen on TV. They dance like the street gangs in Stomp The Yard, discuss terms with Xerxes by appearing on Deal Or No Deal and Rocky Balboa turns up as a member of the Persian army, all while tumbleweeds spin past at an alarming rate, the writers seemingly expecting their audience to laugh out of simple familiarity.\n\nSo there we have it. I did not think I would ever see the day where I'd see a spoof movie so dismally free of comedy that not even watching it drunk off my face with six of my mates could make me laugh but it has happened. Hands down one of the worst films of the year thus far and likely to appeal only to two groups of people: morons and the rich, white-bred thirty year olds that made it. When there are funnier 300 parodies to be found on youtube that last mere minutes, you have to wonder why they bother."

I gave the movie a 3 because I laughed at times."

The cinematic atmosphere provided an elegant, yet intentionally brusque plot that frankly served as a nice complement to the pop culture genre. The inner child that is inherent within all Spartans was a clear example of this, not to mention the lovable Father-Son relationship as exemplified at the beginning of the sequence.\n\nI would highly recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible.

And most of them, save for Scary Movie, are filled with pointless slapstick/dick/fart jokes save for a few actually funny, clever jokes few and far between, but this is ridiculous. It's the same old slapstick and body excrement jokes that get old faster than a speeding bullet. I saw absolutely no point to this whatsoever, and I was only interested in seeing it because of the Britney jokes they showed on the ads, and I will say I used to be a Britney fan and love making fun of her. Shame I forgot Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's idea of \"parody\" is redoing a scene from a movie verbatim with actors who look like the actors in the film they are parodying and putting WAY BELOW sub-par dick/fart/crap/boob/sex jokes in and they call it a parody. A parody is something that makes fun of something for a REASON and with A POINT. The Scary Movie movie sorta had this, saying how silly scary movies were, but the sequels, though guilty pleasures of mine, are pointless, though less pointless, than this. And Date Movie and Epic Movie (I preferred the latter over the former) are dick and fart joke movies but I enjoyed them and they are very silly and stupid, but now that I've sorta really grasped what makes a quality movie...I'm saying that this is the most POINTLESS waste of celluloid ever, and I'm really lenient when it comes to films.\n\nBut this is just stupid beyond belief. What's the next one? \"We're Gonna Make Another Movie\" and \"parody\" everything in the last year? Date Movie is about two years old and most of the pop culture jokes no one would get now because those events are behind us, the same going for Epic Movie, but to a grander scale - only a year old, but the pop culture jokes have completely died.\n\nOn the DVD commentary for Date Movie it seemed the writers understood that these movies are pointless...well...STOP MAKING THEM THEN!!!\n\nMake a good, ORIGINAL movie for a change.\n\nIs that too much to ask?\n\nWait - it probably is."

It is a great time killer, but do not expect anything spectacular. The previews, I thought, were so much funnier than the movie itself, which is understandable because after all, it's very difficult to have a movie that generates laughter every second.\n\nBottomline, if you are looking for good quality humor go watch Juno, Knocked Up, or Superbad. This movie will get you a few laughs, if that."

Nothing thats gonna make you remember it longer than 4 seconds but there are a few, funny moments. Very few. To add tot he so so, Kevin Sorbo, an actor I actually enjoyed during the Hercules / Andromeda years, but seems lately he has become a low budget film actor. The worst part is hes probably the closest to a high roller actor on this flick, and the whole time seems like he really doesn't want to be there really never fulling the role quite as much as his partner 'Leonidas' (Sean Mauguire)who really does seem to fulfill his part, despite how horribly written it was. But all is shadowed by the Carmen ELectra, who seems to be fastly becoming the queen of spoof. Nopt much really can ever be said but she does however play a part in 1 of the worst SPOOF RIPOFFs in HISTORY. (THe scene copy'ing the \"locked\" Chastity belt, which was LONG TIME AGO depicted in a MUCH funnier spoof Robin Hood Men in tights....SHAME ON YOU Meet the Spartans).\n\nOkay in ending, the movie can be easily summed up as the biggest, longest, weakest, barely funny gay joke you have ever heard. EVERY SCENE depicts in some form or another, and often distasteful gay related joke. I also must add the whole pit of death scene is early funny but horribly ruined in the same fashion a comedian gets a small laugh fromt he audience and over runs with a skit. (I DId however like seeing Britney Spears go for a dive).\n\nSO, basically, wait till public television has it on some, spoof marathon which they do OFTEN enough to see this one within the next year....you'll be glad you waited on that penny saved."

It does connect on a few jokes and I found it mildly amusing for the the first half, I then started to get a little bored with it and I wandered a little. It's a good thing that it is so short. In fact, it may be too long at 84 minutes!\n\nNo, it is not Airplane or Naked Gun, but it works a little and you cannot judge these films too seriously. Don't go out of your way, but if it's on, you're likely to get a coupla yucks out of it. I consider a 5 a \"take it or leave it film\", so it just misses that mark. In it's genre, it is a 4 of 10."

This is the first time I've ever written a review of a movie I haven't seen, and I do it only because I've thrown away so many hours watching the ridiculous tripe that these idiots continue to defecate into theaters.\n\nIn this case, thankfully, the trailer alone was enough to show me that it was going to be more of the idiotic, nonsensical garbage we have come to expect from Friedberg and Seltzer. I'm willing to bet that their parents tell people that they haven't heard from their kids in years and don't know what they are up to because they don't know how to get a hold of them.

There was some things in there that could have fitted into the rest of the film but got placed there instead and they did well. I love films that make fun of violence, even when it's used against children. It's bad humor, but that is what it is. Humour. Nothing I'd ever approve of in real life, but on the screen it's something else.\n\nAnyway, this one is not worth remember, not worth the tape it is filmed on and I hope the next parody tries some harder and does not take a lot of US only references because it just doesn't work.\n\n4 out of 10 legendary Kings queen-ed."

I mean something called \"Disaster Movie\" is coming out soon, and oh dear, I can tell its going to be a stinker. But \"Meet The Spartans\" has terrible jokes, terrible acting, and terrible use of editing and shots and stuff, in other words its like, oh you over there! Go stand there and say some stuff that doesn't make sense! Man its bad. 300 was a good movie, but when its parodied in a way like this, it gives 300 a bad name to have this hybrid parody film on its shoulders.

This movie will definitely be very dated later on but for right now its funny. However if you haven't seen 300 and don't watch much TV its really not going to be much fun at all. Most of the humor assumes that you have seen these popular shows like American Idol, Deal or No Deal, & etc. My friend hadn't seen 300 so they didn't appreciate much of the humor. Make sure you at least see 300 first and if you didn't like it you may enjoy this."

Aaron and Jason will continue to make these films in the hopes that people will see them and unfortunately for the intelligent people ... these movies still make enough money for them to be continuously made over and over.\n\n95% of this film is based on 300 spoof. So basically you are watching approximately 300 gay jokes crammed into 60 minutes. The other five minutes is a joke aimed at pop culture reference to an issue earlier in the year (ie. Lindsay Lohan's rehab), product placement, a joke aimed at Carmen Electra or an out-of-place parody for another film.\n\nThe majority of the jokes are dragged on for far too long. For instance the Stomp The Yard parody lasts upward 3 minutes. This is the point where people start to think of hitting the close button on Windows Media Player. It's not even a Stomp The Yard parody since after its over the leading man says \"You got served\", which is of course the title for the movie You Got Served.\n\nTake a bunch of nobody actors, add in Carmen Electra, product placement, add in stupid gay jokes, terrible visual and special effects, and then have Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer write the screenplay...you end up with a movie like Date Movie, Epic Movie and this. This movie gives Farce Of the Penguins a run for its money. Hell even the \"dreaded\" Blair Witch Project is not as bad as this.\n\nIf you guys want to keep your sense of humor and some brain cells, on top of your money...avoid this film at all costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "If there's anything that Date Movie and Epic Movie taught us, it's that spoof movies that are slapped together with low production values aren't exactly going to yield a positive response from viewers. It seems that after Scary Movie 4, people really don't want to see another dumb spoof comedy from anyone associated with those movies. Well, for those that were utterly disgusted by Date Movie and Epic Movie, there's nothing in Meet the Spartans that's going to make you feel any different. This movie has all the lousy production, cheap acting and stupid spoofs that you could possibly come up with for any movie or TV show released last year. So if you want to see a movie that'll poke some sort of fun at recently released movies, TV shows and famous celebrities, regardless of how embarrassing it is, then this movie might be worth a shot. As for me, I thought Date Movie and Epic movie honestly weren't that horrible. Yeah, they were about as dumb as someone with an IQ of negative 1000, but I still thought the retarded comedy had its moments, which is why I'd at least give those movies some points. And Meet the Spartans is no different; it gets points for stupid moments that made me laugh but loses points for its sheer stupidity. You're best waiting for this one to come out on DVD and renting it; I don't see this movie lasting much more than maybe a month in theaters."

        "review_title": "Seltzer And Friedberg Can Do So Much Worse",
        "review_detailed_main": "After sitting through \"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Vampires Suck\", it has become beyond obvious that the duo of Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg deserve every criticism they have received. Their films are unfunny, unintelligent and unbelievably painful. There's nothing I can say about them that would make their work any more entertaining or any less stupid. So what do I think of their \"300\" spoof \"Meet the Spartans?\" Well...\"Meet the Spartans\" is Seltzer and Friedberg's best movie by FAR. Guess what? It still sucks.\n\nWhat saves \"Meet the Spartans\"...Okay, um...Maybe \"saves\" is the wrong word. Uh...Anyways, what makes \"Meet the Spartans\" better and funnier than any other Seltzer and Friedberg film is that it has an EXCELLENT comedic cast. All of the actors chosen in this film seem to be chosen because they actually fit the roles and have tons of comedic presence instead of merely being chosen for star power. Kevin Sorbo has some very funny moments, Ken Davitian of \"Borat\" has good comedic presence and I actually found the whole concept of Diedrich Bader's character \"Traitero\" (A clever and actually really funny jab at action movies which make it incredibly obvious who the villain is the moment he or she steps on screen) quite humorous. That said, Sean Maguire gives by far the best comedic performance in the movie. This guy is given a script that gives him almost NO comedic possibilities and can truly turn out some hilarious moments. There are multiple scenes in this movie that would have completely and utterly failed in any actor's hands but his own. Seeing all these actors trying so hard to make this movie work despite such an atrocious script not only makes me like all of them more, it makes me hate Seltzer and Friedberg more for not utilizing their obvious talents better.\n\nThe biggest problem with Seltzer and Friedberg is that they don't view their movies as actual \"films\" per say as much as giant feature length comedic skits. Like all of their movies, \"Meet the Spartans\" suffers from this problem. Because of this, the film literally doesn't go 20 seconds without a joke. Joke after joke after joke is launched at the audience, and many of them feel rushed and without effort. It was like Seltzer and Friedberg just wrote down the first jokes that came into their minds without reading them over, fleshing them out or even double checking if they fit into context. And the toilet humor...Dear God, the toilet humor. The toilet humor here is so stunningly unfunny it could sink even an otherwise excellent comedy.\n\nAnd if the toilet humor doesn't hurt your intelligence, then the constant pop culture references out of left field most certainly will. Apparently, Seltzer and Friedberg are people who think that a Spartan elder inspecting a baby Shrek is funny. No context by the way, the elder just inspects a baby and it happens to be Shrek, complete with a Scottish accent. If the film is extra cruel, it will combine its toilet humor and reference humor into some of the most unfunny scenes in the movie (I cringed HARD when a cat took a crap on Traitero's face after he randomly turned into Sandman)\n\nLike I implied earlier, there ARE funny scenes in this movie, saved by strong comedic performances rather than an even remotely intelligent script. The \"Deal or No Deal\" parody, Leonidas speaking to the Prophets about his unintentionally homo-erotic battle strategy and Xerces revealing his blue screen as a secret weapon to create more soldiers are all legitimately funny scenes. Easily the funniest scenes I've ever watched in a Seltzer and Friedberg movie, but that's really not saying anything at all.\n\nSo yeah, \"Meet the Spartans\" is a terrible comedy. For most directors, this would easily be the worst thing they ever created. But for Seltzer and Friedberg, this is pretty much their magnum opus, and almost certainly the best you're ever gonna get from these two morons. At the very least it only made me cringe a few times, whereas I cringed pretty much every 30 seconds at \"Date Movie\" or \"Disaster Movie.\""

When Leonidas learns that Persia's King Xerxes plans to make Sparta his own, he has his captain recruit Sparta's finest and prepare them for battle against invading Persian forces.\n\nMeet the Spartans is from, yeah you guessed it, two of the six writers of Scary Movie and yet again fails to get one giggle. The story is yet again stupid, the acting is horrible, the characters are yet again made to be stupid for cheap laughs, the writing is awful\u0085I can't honestly say a good thing about it. This makes any rubbish movie out there look like the best movie.\n\nI watched this with an open mind since the last two movies they made by themselves were awful, I was hoping and praying that this would be at least watchable. Alas, it wasn't and the two writers still can't write any good or new material and they still disappoint. I wonder if they sat down with a pad and pen and said \"What movie could we make that hasn't been done before?\" and the other said \"How about we make stupid characters, make them have a dance-off, get Carmen Electra again playing a slutty character and we could make pop references in random places that have nothing to do with the movie. I'm sure we didn't do that in the last two movies.\", \"\u0085it's genius!\"\u0085hmm, that's probably how the conversation went.\n\nRead more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

This film (if you can call it that) is basically a massive patched-up blanket covering a burning stack of money. The blanket is sewn together with idiocracy and each patch is a probe at pop culture. Did I mention that there are about a million patches? The writers seem to think they are comic geniuses, slapping audiences in the face with a joke in every line or/and shot. 'Attractive' females are used to make male audiences slobber into their popcorn, but they're probably already doing that due to their brains being turned inside out by the mind-numbingly awful sequences on-screen. Just take my advice and don't see this film."

These movies definitely include scenes that are very humorous and also include jokes that have not been used before and are not too excessive. However, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer get the award for crossing the line. They started out great with Scary Movie, but from there it seems like it just went down.\n\nI've seen Disaster Movie, and surprisingly I liked it more than I liked this movie. Don't get me wrong, Disaster Movie still is a disaster. Meet the Spartans probably just seemed worse to me, because I have seen pretty much the same jokes that are used in Disaster Movie. Everything is filmed in a same way, the same jokes are used. Not to mention the bad special effects and all the scenes that we get to see.\n\nTo explain my vote of three stars - all of the jokes were not that bad and some can be quite a good laugh if you are in the mood for watching such a movie. I'm the type of person that likes things to be excessively stupid, but as I've mentioned before, the line is crossed in quite many of these films.\n\nI still intend to see Epic Movie or Date Movie, though. I just want to make sure that all of these movies are equally bad and if they really use the same type of jokes all the time. If that turns out to be true, Aaron and Jason have to think about what they are doing before releasing any more movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Meet the Spartans was just over 60 minutes long and full of excessive product placements. I wouldn't even call them product placement but just commercials. The following is a brief example; three minutes in to the movie the main character is starving and finds a Subway foot long sub sandwich. There was no joke made about it other than Subway foot longs are not very tasty. Coke was proud sponsor of the Pit of Death joke. Apple Computers was the sponsor of the \"Wifely Advice\" scene which failed to get a laugh. Maybe it was supposed to be funny that primitive men had advanced technology like laptops and cell phones? Maybe once but not over and over and over. Other proud sponsors was UPS, Red Bull, Dentyne, Gator-aid, Budweiser, T-Mobile, Gray Goose Vodka and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Yes all those in just 60 minutes not much room for humor.\n\nThe jokes are in extremely poor taste, from child abuse, racism, homophobic slurs, overtly large male testicles, blurred shots of women's gentiles, and over done celebrity gags. The length of any given joke could last a long time. For example the \"Pit of Death\" joke ran a full 5 minutes long or 8% of this entire movie. There is a Paris Hilton joke about mid point in the 60 minute commercial that lasted too long and was later revisited again later for more pumping of an already dry well. Another gag that lasted 6 minutes or more, 10% of this film, was the break dance and yo momma routine and was an insult to the African American race. Promptly followed by a beer commercial.\n\nThe actors like Carmen Electra is really getting too old at 36 to play as a sex symbol to us teens anymore. Unless you're into dating your mother. To me she looks like an average soccer mom. If you want to see Carmen Electra nude look at an old Playboy magazine she is not nude in this movie and I rented the unrated DVD. Sean Maguire seemed to be in pain more than anything else. His acting ability suffers greatly and his ability to deliver the bad homophobic jokes even more so. I was actually sad to see TV star Kevin Sorbo from \"Andromeda\" and \"Hercules\" having to suffer through this movie. Not that he had much of a career but he has lost any hope in acting since this disaster.\n\nAs I mentioned I rented this movie for $2 at the local video store and when I took it back and told them how awful the movie was they refunded me my money. I hadn't spoken but about two sentences when the manager told me they couldn't in all honesty say it was a good movie to rent. They hope to rid themselves of the few copies they have in the store but since they are a franchise chain they must carry what they are told. I know just where this movie belongs at the very bottom. It should be #1 on the \"IMDB Bottom 100 Movies\". So vote and let's put this were it surely belongs!"

Although, I do respect the former for originating 'Scary Movie' in the year 2000 which I believe still to be a rather good parody spoof.\n\nTo conclude - it's simple - watch at your peril!"

The part where the lead spartan goes into Grand theft auto, then starts playing, Barbie girl, but other than that, it isn't that funny. It might be because I never saw many movies paradied in this film, but still. Well, at least the directors learned their mistake and fixed it with disaster movie, which brought back the funny. My recamendation, skip over this one, and go for the other great movie movies, unless you don't like parody."

Then we have a vietnamese baby and a spartan baby. And then the movie unfolds as the spoof of 2006's 300. Lots of gross-out gags like the ones parodying CASINO ROYALE, GTA SAN ANDREAS and BORAT; such wonderful scenes as a baby knocking out a old lady and she spits her false teeth, a penguin jumping on the leading man with the stuff on his face, the fat villain that puts earrings in his nipples and much more.\n\nJust like for the other parody movies by the genius team of Friedberg-Seltzer, the problems with this movie are: parodying everything and trying to cram everything in the movie; unfunny and juvenile humour, gross out gags that would make even a 12 year old bored to death and bad acting all around. The only two that looks like they are desperately trying are Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra, but the rest of the cast is bad.\n\nThere was one part that made me laugh: the one of the pit of death when Leonidas kicks everybody (including the AMERICAN IDOL jury, a Britney Spears look alike and her then-husband Kevin Federline, a crested rapper and many others) in the pit of death, and in one scene he kicks just like Jean Claude Van Damme. Just for this scene alone I give the movie a 3. Otherwise, it's pretty bad and forgettable."

Such as Britney Spears shaving off all her hair, Ghost Rider, and those latest dance-off movies that have been released recently. And don't forget the references to American Idol. You can't go a modern movie without that.\n\nBut one of the most obvious things is the the indirect reference and allusion towards homosexuality (or at least bisexuality). The '13', since they could not find 300 men to fit the physical standards, keep up the gayness with men greeting men with kisses and the wearing of tight leather underwear. Obviously I could say a lot of things, but that would ruin the movie.\n\nOverall, this isn't bad. I actually enjoyed myself. \"B\""

We needed more pit-of- death scenes. And why didn't they do more with Britney and sangiha? While not every scene was super funny, over all it was good for a laugh.

Now that being said, I got 100% what I expected: An occasional chuckle, but mostly lame jokes that are beaten to death, bad acting, bad direction, cheap looking sets and Carmen Electra looking more and more haggard with each passing movie. Even the product placement bits weren't that funny. These guys need to go back and watch Airplane, Naked Gun, Scary Movie 1, or even Spaceballs to see how a spoof movie should be made. The cutaway jokes on Family Guy rip pop culture far more effectively and much funnier than what this movie tries to do. Though I must admit, the idea of kicking annoying celebrities into a bottomless pit is a great idea, someone should've thrown the makers of this movie in there with them."

I guess if you are really bored and have plenty of money to spend, but no nearby charity to donate $9 to, and the only movie that is playing is this one, then sure, go see it.

For example, the spoof of the \"dance-off\" movies goes on forever, and there's only one joke. They couldn't even fill an hour and a half.\n\nMy recommendation, if you haven't seen it, wait until it is on HBO or something where you don't have to pay extra."

Maybe the writers didn't get that memo. This has as much humor as... An ER? Possibly. The only attempts at \"humor\" (and yes, it deserves to be quoted) in this movie are references.\n\nI can't imagine the \"brainstorming\" session the writers must've had: -\"Okay, now they just talked to an enemy, what should we include to make this funny?\" -\"Let's put the American Idol judges in! They are from real life, so its funny!\" (Though, judging from the script, they probably used smaller words)\n\nNow, I have no problem with advertising in movies, or in video games for that matter. It seems to make it more realistic. (I'd rather a character eat at a TGI Friday's instead of a Wednesday's). But it's just plain blatant advertising here. After a character is stranded in the Arctic (or, going back to poor set design, a floor with cotton and white confetti on it), he only survives by seeing a Subway sub on the ground. Humorous? No. Advertisement? Yes.\n\nWell, if you want about 80 wasted minutes of your life wasted, pick this up.

Great film, though.) \"Meet The Spartans\" has bestrode (bestridden?) the U.S. film charts and is currently sitting triumphant at the top of the U.K. film charts.\n\nFrankly, this is not bad for a film that has been, more or less, universally lambasted and criticised as one of the worst films of the year. I think it just goes to prove the truth of what William Goldman wrote in his fine book \"Adventures In The Screen Trade\". Nobody knows anything.\n\nAnyway, what do I think?\n\nThe best bits: Nicole Parker's takeoff of Britney Spears, which was brilliant and made me laugh a lot, and Carmen Electra's body.\n\nThe worst bits: Er... Actually just about everything else.\n\n\"Meet The Spartans\" really is a magnificently bad movie. Dog howlingly bad. Car crash bad. End of the world bad. Black plague, infestation of locusts, drought crisis, zombie holocaust, Sharon Osborne on \"The X-Factor\" bad. Bad.

And there is the gorgeous Carmen Electra playing a horny queen ... nice.\n\nIf you want to watch a movie with no cerebral pretensions but just some nice jokes for LOL, give this one a try."

        "review_detailed_main": "To begin, let's get something straight: this movie was atrocious. However, when calling it such, you must remember that this is the entire intent of the film, as well as most other true spoof films. Did this one have the potential to be better? Certainly.\n\nClocking in at just under an hour and a half, shorter if you exclude credits, Meet the Spartans is dry, oft-boring, and random to an extent that makes it difficult to tell when they're actually trying to tell a joke. Though well-conceived, the painfully short running time coupled with what was obviously a microscopic budget meant that this film came across as being far too much funny crammed into too small a space. The result? A new joke was on the screen before the previous one had yet to develop into a punch line, and the audience is left with nothing but a bunch of half-finished humor.\n\nNow, about that 4 / 10 rating I delivered this dreadful film; don't get me wrong, the movie is garbage. However, there was the occasional moment in which an imaginative mind was able to have a slight deal of fun with the material presented, including one such humorous take on the excessive use of green/blue-screening in almost all modern films (that, and I reserve lower ratings for far worse films). The only real reason this had any laughable effect was because it was a joke re-used at what could almost be called the right times. Every other portion of humor present in the film was long gone nearly three seconds after it was generated and had absolutely no relevant bearing to the remainder of the film. It was much akin to telling of a murder mystery by introducing over eighty characters in the first half and then having them all leave while one man comes into the center of the frame and commits the crime in front of everyone. No joke was ever given time to develop, and no characters were given even the slightest amount of depth. Now, I know that's asking a lot from a modern comedy, but in all seriousness, I've had gas that had more character.\n\nIn all honesty though, it was still worth a laugh here and there.\n\nThis film will be particularly enjoyed by goldfish, who have a short enough attention span to enjoy all the jokes in sequence."

Am sorry to say this but this is one of the gayest flicks you'll ever see. I seriously had to look at its makers.This movie is not even worth watching for free. Just stick to scary movie and the likes and don't dare watch this. And don't be fooled by the calibre of actors, they really do not pull it off. For the sake of your appetite for comedy.

Seltzer and Friedberg still can't manage to make a spoof movie that is funnier than the Scary Movie series. I still hate your movies Seltzer and Friedberg but this was a step forward. This is a list from best to worst:\n\n1. Scary Movie series.\n\n2. Meet the Spartans.\n\n3. Date Movie.\n\n4. Epic Movie.\n\nEpic Movie is probably the worst movie ever and i haven't seen Superhero Movie and Disaster Movie but i will be seeing them soon.\n\nI don't recommend it but if you liked Date Movie and Epic Movie then you will want to see this.

It's a fairly innocuous bit of fluff. Mildly amusing, inoffensive, nothing special. It passed an hour.\n\nI thought the core actors tried their best despite a less than stellar script. Sean Maguire certainly didn't lack conviction and turned in an admirable performance in the circumstances. I didn't like the celebrity impersonators. They weren't very good and if you're going to go down that road then you need people at the top of their game. The female impressionist was particularly dire -- didn't look or sound convincing in any of her roles.\n\nHowever, the one thing that has most annoyed me about this movie are the parade of one star critiques on here. Not so much reviews as rants. The film isn't THAT bad. But even if it was, when someone says they hated first Date Movie, then Epic Movie, then Disaster Movie, why were they watching Meet The Spartans? Just so they could have something to complain about???"

I predict that this 4th instalment, from these two wannabe's, will meet the same fitting end as the first 3 and end up at around the 70's mark in the worst 100 chart. If you're wondering why I even watched this attempt at comedy, well, the law of averages says that if you do something enough you're bound to get it right eventually.

I actually laughed a lot in that. Now here comes \"Meet the Spartans.\" Let me say this now: This is by far the most disappointing and most irritating thing I've ever seen!\n\nWhat happened?! I know people didn't like neither the other two films (even though I did) but I think I get what they're saying! Unlike their last two films (yes, they're different), this film is like a marketing campaign, for random items! I see it now: The films they make continuously have more pop culture reference than any other film. \"Date Movie\" wasn't all that much, really. Still have no reason why people didn't like that. \"Epic Movie\" had even more, but at least they were funny.\n\nThis is by far the lamest attempt to make something funny. There is a point (actually, an early point) in the film where I found it offensive on a recently dead celebrity. They try so hard to make this film funny! Okay, at first, I found some jokes funny. Then it all went downhill. I also find it sad more of the MadTV ensemble is in here.\n\nThis is like a MadTV skit. Each skit could be funny or fall flat. I liked the previous two films because each most of the skits were funny. Now, I did laugh at some parts for this film. I liked the Brangelina joke and possibly the jokes on homophobia until it really got very sad.\n\nOther than that, the jokes are crude, sexual, disgusting, or predictable. If you're looking for action, don't bother. If you're looking for hot babes and hunky guys, you're in luck, because this film has so many to stare at. Other than that, there is no reason to see this film. I also think that the directors think audiences are getting stupider. The jokes to the reference of pop culture are said out loud, like nobody in the audience knew, like \"It's HAPPY FEET!\", \"Thhe guy from BORAT!\", \"MaGuire from SPIDER-MAN 3!\", \"The TRANSFORMER cube!\", etc.\n\nSure, the previous movies may ace but lame attempts to get laughs from the audience but they were funny. I found this one just stupid and idiotic and an insult to intelligence. Watch this movie for the great-looking stars. Don't see it for anything else."

The only interesting part that perk me up is the war scenes.\n\nStory: It is simple, the same story line for 300. Following the plot, there are spoofs of other movies being chunk into it. They spoof Spider-man, Deal or no deal and transformers etc. Sometimes, it is good to see people coming up with creative ideas for movies. Not that bad but they should think of better ideas.\n\nOverall: If you enjoyed Date movie and Epic movie and other spoof movies like Scary movies, you would probably like this. Nothing else to say. Hopefully, in future, they will do spoof movies seriously and not make them like dumb movies. More spoof movies are going to be made. For example, in March, there will be Superhero movie. I hope they don't make it like trash. I like superheroes. Other than that, there is really nothing to say."

It has no self contained plot, and after five minutes of euphoric high caused by an almost its so bad its good, my brain adjusted to the randomness of the film I just watched it and attempted to guess the jokes before they happened for the remaining 55 minutes. My opinion on it is that it was a complete and utter waste of time, and the only reason it gets one star instead of three is that I PAID FIVE DANG DOLLARS FOR IT. I could go onto Youtube watch a summary of 300, the movie this is ripping off, then a video of a grown man crapping his pants in public, and finish it off by starring at a wall for an hour and get the same experience. They didn't even let me rent it on amazon, they made me buy it so that when I am watching a movie with friends I will have to explain why MEET THE SPARTANS is in my movie library. As a side note I watched this with two other people who both claim it was the worst movie they have ever seen and was so painful to watch one of them dropped out of the marathon. My theory is that this movie did not hurt me because I am a cynical nihilist who is not surprised that such horrors could be put to celluloid. So in conclusion I would not suggest this movie to anyone and if it doesn't cause you unimaginable pain it will leave a nauseous feeling because you will have to live the wrest of your life knowing you gave money to these soulless hacks."

Unfortunately, they seem to think that every single portion of the film should be some sort of gag. There are about 3 funny bits in this film. They are mixed with about 300 very unfunny bits. Pop culture parodies that don't work combined with sight gags that are predictable. I really cannot say enough bad things about this film. The makers of it should be barred from ever making another movie. It's not even the kind of bad that can be funny in it's own unintentional way, like a Steven Segal movie.

Why is it then that when I read reviews on this film, these reviews also seemed to spoof the very first review that commented on this film? Lemmings go over the edge into the Pit of Death, anyone?. The film was accused of recycling its material ad nauseam, yet those reviews recycled ad nauseam as well for instance the names of \"good\" spoof movies, such as Top Secret (Val Kilmer, you might remember). Oh, give me a break. Give me a royal Spring Break '08.\n\nThere is no such thing as a good spoof movie. The whole of this genre is designed to be disposable: it uses other people's leftovers and warms up once again thereof a passable meal, feeding the endless gluttony of moviegoers the world over. Therefore, it's pointless to flog makers of this fare, a bit like puritan Christians going after the makers of horror films. Even if the film was gross, it has managed to gross more than its budget back even now.\n\nSean Maguire was a convincing berserk of the Spartan kind. MadTV actress Nicole Parker did a few great impersonations. Xerxes was so fat and disgusting that he was almost hilarious. Carmen Electra brought some feminine relief to this otherwise masculine navel-gazing while the slice of salami pizza over her v***na was in particular seductive. The end song, \"I will survive\" tied up the loose ends and was the happy ending we wanted. Stop complaining. Don't watch movies of this sort with an empty stomach, on medication or whatever else was your problem (damp film student's socks?)."

They're not the best and probably miss much more than land in terms of comedy, but I guess I just like the incongruity of seeing out of place celebrities/modern product placement intruding in on the film, especially with films like this which are set thousands of years in the past. While I appreciated the incongruity of what was being referenced in this film, when it came to the actual quality of the comedy of those references, they ranged from mean-spirited (Paris Hilton and Britney Spears) to overlong (the entire \"This is Sparta\" sequence) to forced (which is technically everything) and the parodies of those celebrities weren't remotely clever. As a whole, I don't think the film got any laughs from me in that department. Now, when it came to poking fun at the eccentricities of Snyder's film or exaggerating certain scenes/characters in it, I was somewhat able to get on board with the film since that's the idea to parodying something, correct? The training scenes of Leonidas beating his son up, poking fun at the nudity/sex scenes in 300, exaggerating Xerxes' piercings, or painting abs onto the Spartans worked well enough for me. While it's not hilarious per se, that's what I want from parody films. There was more potential with parodying the excessive slow motion which they didn't capitalize on though, aside from recreating some of the slow motion effects at a couple points. As a whole though, I mostly found this really boring to sit through and frequently dry of clever jokes to keep me on board with it. I'd still give it some points for the comedy which landed, but everything else dragged it down like a rock."

It's all the same humour, just that you were younger when you watched Mel Brooks and it was funnier then.

It's supposed to be corny. You're supposed to be used to that.\n\nSecond of all, it's a parody. A good ol' 80's style parody. Which means that some of the spoofs will just be an exaggeration of actual scenes from the original. No punchline. No meta-joke. Just a funny guy who speaks in an 'epic' accent who gets in a battle of wits (yo momma jokes) with Xerxes' RUN-DMC shirted crew. Stuff like that.\n\nAnyway, the acting is bad, the montage is frantic, storyline vague.. But that was never the point. It's gag after gag after gag.

Or it intends to be anyways, other than the set design and costumes it is nothing like 300.\n\nThe story is very shallow but it has one more than Epic Movie and Disaster Movie, although that may not be saying that much.\n\nA few of the jokes are good but they get drowned out by the many bad ones so it's a lot more miss than hit.\n\nIt's crude, stupid and iritatingly unfunny at times but it's not one of the worst films I've seen. Epic Movie on the other hand..."

Travis Van Winkle is OK in his role, he's hot, bulging with muscles, and well that's all his character is supposed to be about, so I guess it works. Carmen Electra was funny at certain times, but honestly not many. Sean Maguire is hot, handsome, manly and overly macho, and that's also all his character is supposed to be about, so I suppose he was alright, his butt is nice lol, you do get to see that in 1 scene. Kevin sorbo, wtf Is he doing in this film?!!! He went from meet the Spartans to gods not dead?! Lol, doesn't make much sense to me, but whatever floats his boat I guess. But really he seemed Sooo uncomfortable in this movie, Like he was randomly dropped on the set and didn't know what the heck was going on, maybe he's just too conservative to be in a movie like this. But anyways, there are scenes in the film that are just too gross and tasteless, and it's not funny, it's just strange and uncomfortable to sit and watch. Although the love scene between Maguire and Electra was a little comical, it wasn't hilarious or anything, but slightly comical. Really there are not many laughs to be had in this film, male eye candy is really the only upside lol."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would guess fans of The 300 are a little angry with this movie and are trying to bury it on IMDb in the hopes no one will go to the box office. Apparently they've missed the fact that the movie has been sitting at number one since it debuted. I recall checking the ratings here a few days ago and wondering to myself, how the hell can a movie thats been sitting at number one for weeks be so bad? So I went and saw it and what do you know, it's absolutely hilarious from start to finish. I mean this movie is so funny my face hurt after seeing it. Yes it's brain dead, no there's not really a plot and yes it's offensive as hell to anyone who can be offended. Of course, thats why it's so funny and thats exactly what the film makers intended. Movies like Airplane, Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Walk Hard and Meet The Spartans are intended to poke, prod, repulse and make you laugh. If they weren't made in the fashion they are then they wouldn't be funny. I literally did not stop smiling or laughing once during this entire film, except when I had to turn my head and cover my mouth because of some particularly disgusting scene. I might point out though that I pretty much had to close my eyes during the \"bush\" trimming scene in Scary Movie...but thats another story.\n\nIf you enjoy parody films, you can deal with being offended and repulsed or you are the type thats not offended by anything then go see this movie and get ready to laugh yourself into the hospital. If your easily offended, you should probably skip this and check out Cloverfield or 27 Dresses, you'll be happier and you won't have to look back on this film in disgust."

The same creators of all those other stupid movies, Aaron and Jason, bring us another one from their dumb repertoire. Meet the Spartans is truly awful, it's despicable beyond belief and is utterly senseless. It's like a garbage can filled with rip-offs, pop culture references and random appearances by people that aren't even supposed to be in the film. After watching it for about 20 minutes I just hoped the credits would roll quick enough, but they didn't for an hour and half, a sat down watching a senseless piece of garbage that wasted an hour and a half of my life."

The setups and punchlines are predictable and the gags just aren't funny.\n\nMore so repetitive where it wasn't funny the first time, yet they continue with the same gags (ex: the blurred out private parts).\n\nThe film doesn't really have a plot, it's just one unfunny pop culture reference after another. The Britney Spears \"head shaving\" gag gave somewhat of a chuckle. The Spider-Man 3 spoof with Carmen Electra and the Sandman wasn't too bad either.\n\nCarmen Electra was possibly the highlight, as was the big producer guy from Borat.\n\nAlso the film ends quite early (about the 1 hour 10 minute mark) then there is about an 8 minute post end credit scene featuring deleted scenes and bloopers (a Dane Cook spoof was mildly funny).\n\nBut in the end, Meet The Spartans is just an unfunny spoof film with far more unfunny jokes than hits."

It does not, in the slightest, attempt to be anything besides vulgar, stupid, and horrible. I honestly don't think they're trying to be funny, because nothing is a joke, it's just a reference extravaganza. You have movie references, youtube references, celebrity references, random butts in your face, etc. It's short, but it feels like an eternity. No scene makes sense and doesn't try to be funny.\n\nThis is if you let a 12 year old direct. Nothing clever, funny, or even humanely normal. It's just a 86 minutes of random out of nowhere stupidity. I can't think of anything else to say. It's simply unwatchable. I will kill myself if I ever have to watch this again. Complete waste of time, a damnation of mankind."

        "review_detailed_main": "What can I say? How can a film be so unbelievably bad as this one is?\n\nLike other films in this franchise, \"Meet the Spartans\" was supposed to be a spoof on a particular film, with references to other movies or cultural references thrown in. In this case, the spoof object was \"300\", a cult film for some, a tedious pop video for others. I thought, just maybe \"Meet the Spartans\" may be more palatable than the pretentious \"300\", with some humorous spoofing added to the formula. I could not have been more wrong! \"300\" made its antecedent \"300 Spartans\" look like multi Academy Award material. And \"Meet the Spartans\" made \"300\" look like high art - a feat in itself!\n\nI didn't laugh a single time. I think laughing was supposed to be the point of it, but who knows? Indeed the thought processes, maturity, film-making skill and sense of direction of whoever was ultimately responsible for this dog's breakfast of a movie are not something I would like to investigate closely.\n\nIn a film in which nothing could be said to be a high point, the really lowest point was an extended rap dancing sequence. (Don't bother asking what rap dancing was doing in this film!) This was an exercise in endurance - it just kept going on - and on - and on. And this sequence probably took up a tenth of the whole hour or so of storyline running time. Or it seemed like it did. But, I hear you say, the movie goes for 86 minutes! Well, after the end of the actual film storyline, the viewer gets to see (apparently all) the out-takes for another interminable period. Were these deemed too funny to be put in the film, or too unfunny, or too irrelevant? Your guess is as good as mine. The editor must have been barkingly high or dead drunk to have got through putting this film together.\n\nAll I can say in conclusion is thank God I saw this film after taping it from free-to air television so I could watch it later. It allowed me to fast-forward past bits that got just too painful, and it meant that I never had to waste actual money on it. (Although I feel like sending the distributors a bill for my time spent and electricity expended, with an extra loading for having to work with noxious materials!)\n\nNot recommended! An outstanding candidate for the worst film I have ever seen. While the earlier movies in this franchise were often quite entertaining, the franchise is now clearly dead, and should be quietly buried for public health reasons."
