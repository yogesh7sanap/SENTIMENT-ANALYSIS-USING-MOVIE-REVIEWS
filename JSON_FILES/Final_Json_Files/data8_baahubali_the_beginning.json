        "review_detailed_main": "I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.\n\nBaahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places).\n\nI didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it.\n\nAll the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.\n\nThe background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR)\n\nI would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.\n\nThe quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.\n\nBut the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voil\u00e0 we will have a SPECTACULAR film.\n\nBaahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian \"Baahubali\".\n\nSo in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it. P.S: I want to see Rajamouli doing \"Mahabharata\" next."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Rajamouli, but this is not a biased review. The rating I gave is not just for Rajamouli but the entire unit of Baahubali. Right from the story which reminded me of all the beautiful Indian stories that were part of my childhood,(I'm getting back to reading Amar Chitra Katha now!!!) to every guy who says \"Baahubali\" in the movie. There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, not scary ones but like those that put you in awe.\n\nIt should just get better from here for Indian Cinema. This should be the benchmark for story telling, direction, script, visuals, sets, screenplay etc.(but not for acting!!!)\n\nThe story keeps you hooked to the movie. I wouldn't say too many good things about the movie as they may contain spoilers. But I could compare the movie to a good mythological comic that you would like to read again and again.(So I'm watching the movie again tomorrow!!!)\n\nBut I would like to mention why I reduced the two stars 1. The make up was not at all good. Especially Anushka's\n\n2. The costumes could be better, probably more realistic(if you compare costumes in Troy or even Hercules, they were more relevant)\n\n3. At times people in the background were not true to the scene, my concentration was distracted due to some idiots who didn't match the scene. A few villagers, few priests, few classical dancers, few tribal guys. The Kalakeya warriors were amazing though.\n\n4. WHO THE HELL CHOSE TO PUT AN ITEM SONG. There were many uufffs in the theatre at that time. How the hell did probably an eastern European end up in that.\n\n5. There were a few glitches in the VFX, like whenever the hero is jumping around... it made it look unnatural. That's poor graphics. I'm not an expert on this but few of those jumping sequences could be avoided. You don't see them in Hollywood mythological except for superhero movies which are more convincing.\n\nBut not too many complaints about that as I understand there are certain budget constraints for VFX but Makeup, there is no excuse for that.\n\nAll said and done, it was a fantastic movie and worth the wait and ends with a nice climax which keeps you guessing the 2nd half story.\n\nMy favourite characters were Sivagami and Kattappa. I am in love with Ramya Krishna again. I'm watching it again tomorrow."

        "review_detailed_main": "3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have worked their hearts out for this Visual Wonder has paid off well? Not exactly though, since the answer is simple and straight, you just have to wait for the 'Conclusion' till 2016 and that would decide the fate of this franchise on a whole. The story is paced slowly in the first half giving way and screen space to our Mother Nature's beauty and CGI's magic and one might find it a little too draggy if one considers 'Baahubali' to solely be a hero and since that's not possible, Shivudu has a love life and heroic nature and scenes of his own.Abrupt cuts and unconvincing CGI at certain places in first half are the only flaws with the whole film. Coming to the second half, one is told what he'd expect to be told, as the trailer tells the same. War sequences are really well shot and makes it hard to believe that they were actually made by Indians! One has to just bow down to Srinivas Mohan and his team for excellent CGI and Senthil Kumar for superb visuals. Our captain gives us a bang, as his trademark style known as 'Interval Bang' only at the end this time because technically this movies' end is the interval for the 2 parts taken as a whole. Art work in this Epic is just out of the world, kudos to Sabu Cyril sir and thousands of technicians who worked on this aspect.BGM is soothing for the first half which is apt for what we get on screen and the second half war episodes get the best of the lot BGMs to elevate the scenes. Songs are places really well except for 'Manohari' song.Dolby Atmos effect is an added attraction and I highly recommend people to watch this flick in theatres with this specific sound system, it will surely remain as a great experience for you. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj Sir does 100% justice to it. Though Prabhas and Rana Daggubati did well only their attitude in their respective roles stands out as the best because more of them is yet to come in the sequel. All you need to do is to watch the movie as it comes because expectations lead to disappointment. If you miss this movie, you've just lost a once in life-time 'Indian' movie experience on a big screen."

Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S.S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.\n\nI was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie.\n\nEach and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2.\n\nOverall It's a superb visual treat."

Don't keep high expectations about the movie, unless you have seen previous Rajamouli films ;) (like Magadheera, Eega). I would definitely say watch on bigger screens like imax or xd. Background score is simply awesome and as usual rajamouli makes best use of the music for his sets.\n\nVisuals are good. All characters did their part. Cannot name anyone particularly. I liked the main character most. I will be watching the movie at least two more times :). Hope y'all njoy it."

It is already released overseas on 9th of July and is even praised by the public. Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty and Tamanna Bhatia the shining stars of Tamil & Telgu movies are the lead casts of this release. Ace director SS Rajamouli is getting appraisals for his mesmerizing envision & the execution which he has tried to bring to his audience! MM keervani's music, KK Senthil's camera handling, editing innovation by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. Rama Rajamouli's costumes added the VFX by V Srinivas Mohan has dragged every inch of attention of the viewers. It is surely going to be jaw- dropping for the ones who haven't caught the sight of the so called Baahubali yet.\n\nThe story is based on Prabhas as Shivudu raised on tribal standards who fell by fate for Tamanna as Avanthika in the movie. Shivudu (Prabhas) is born with some skeptical & amaze worthy skills since his birth & joins hand with Avanthika's (Tamanna) tribe to deliver help to Anushka Shetty as Devasena in the movie in order to remove shelter from a crisis. It is when Shivudu enters the grand Mahishmati kingdom he realises about his past & the tale takes many surprising twists & turns. The movie is said to be a M-A-S-T-E-R-P- I-E-C-E filled with the epic- marvellous graphics. First half is mainly loved for #tamannaspeaks & the enigmetic beauty she has displayed over screen.\n\nThe war scenes just leave you stunned & will make you wonder that you're witnessing Hollywood theatre in your own language! This shows that Indian cinematography has come out of its leap and it setting benchmark worldwide! Some called it rave but most of them who have watched it are calling it awe-inspiring & fancier than their imaginative thought. Those who haven't watched it yet must go and encounter this top notch & avail the ENTERTAINMENT from this applaudable flick."

I heard someone saying about item song, but it seemed to me like part of plan by the hero and it is apt .\n\nAnushka makeup should have been better, Prabhas and Rana have done justice with their body and action.Not to be forget Ramya Krishna is terrific in her role as Satya Raj in his.The background score is terrific.Resemble 300 and Lord of the rings series, i would say this type of story line will definitely have similarity and which ever comes first will be praised. there are many goose-bumping moments. i enjoyed it through out the time."

Made a few years earlier, this film looks much cheaper -- some of the CGI is so bad that the movie almost looks like a video game cut scene at times. And the actors just don't hold the screen the way the two leads in \"RRR\" did. It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over. If I'd known going in that what starts as a flashback wouldn't so much be a flashback as the actual real story of the movie, I would have been prepared. But as it is, the transition into a whole different story at the mid-way point really threw me and killed what momentum the film had been building.\n\nNot completely satisfying as a stand-alone experience, but it does improve a bit when taken with the second part.\n\nGrade: B."

This is an ego-trip, following the need to present a spectacle to a spectacle-hungry audience which has never needed anything philosophical or intellectual. For such an audience, a simplistic plot and beautiful visuals are needed, which this film caters to. But beyond that, we cannot be persuaded to find any relevance of such an endeavor. The ideas and people get lost behind the purported veil of glamor and show. This leads to a disconnect from the characters themselves and we are left with a pot boiler which fizzles out before it even heats up.

The CGI is so over the top that it felt like a badly edited video game at times. For instance, the scene in which Baahubali is running away from the guards in the fort.\n\nLoud and showy landscapes can not be termed as spectacular CGI. It should merge seamlessly with the movie and CGI stands out like a sore thumb in this one.\n\n2)Acting: Its loud and crass to say the least. The reactions of all characters after every dialogue reminds a bit of the daily soaps.\n\n3)StoryLine: Its old and repetitive from a 1000 other movies of the same genre. A messiah who comes to save the day. Yes, that's never been done before in Indian cinema.\n\nHowever, despite all the above points Baahubali puts in a valiant effort. But to compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit with the sheer depth of Tolkien's work is sacrilege. No where near that league.\n\nOnly recommended for the faithful.\n\nRating: 2/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "Many experts are terming it as India's answer to Hollywood's 300. I believe it would be unfair to say that, both for Baahubali as well as 300. No doubt Baahubali has scaled up the expectations for upcoming flicks, but Indian Cinema is yet to reach Hollywood's level in action genre. By no way am I undermining the action sequences portrayed in the movie. That is great when compared to Indian movies but slightly behind Top notch Hollywood movies\n\nHowever what was best in the movie was Cinematography combined with the script. Even though fictional, the movie depicts a powerful picture of Ancient India and some of the scenes are nothing less than heavenly and some of the scenes (which are already revealed in the official trailers and posters, like Baahubali aka Prabhas mounting a 100 kg Shivling on his shoulders, a hand protecting a baby from the ferocious river and many more like these) give you nothing less than goosebumps.\n\nThe romantic angle might have been slightly overplayed. Also typically South Indian movies project the heroes as nothing less than a superman which seems quite unrealistic. However in this movie, it seems more realistic given the genre. Many ancient Indian kings have been known to take on herd of bull elephants, lions bare handed. So the Extreme macho persona represented by both the protagonist and the antagonist is completely justified.\n\nIn short, if you crib about Indian movies not being up to the mark, do watch this as the movie has raised the bar and if you love Indian movies, every reason to see this one.\n\nAwaiting the Concluding part which is due in 2016"

Rajamouli should have tried newer Composers.\n\nI felt Magadheera was a way better movie for a strong story line and screenplay.\n\nThe best I can say is it is a Good attempt and strictly a one time watch (that too if you really want to watch due to peer pressure of the hype) especially if you've watched Lord of Rings or Hobbit Series. It is clear the idea of enemy talking a different language was similar to the Orcs in Hobbit.\n\nI am quite disappointed with some scenes where you can make out it is graphics. Example, soldiers running on the wall -- seriously, it looked like a video game's graphics. When so much money was spent, why couldn't they have gotten some decent graphics??? I was waiting for when the movie was going to end."

        "review_detailed_main": "250 crore budget.500 days of production.2000 junior artists for the war sequence,800 technicians. Bahubali-The beginning considered to be India's biggest motion picture till date, helmed by the maverick director S. S. Rajamouli clearly has colossal stakes riding on it. Will prove to be India's best or just turn out to be another big-budget dud?.Lets find out.\n\nStory. Penned by KV Vijayendra Prasad,the plot has refreshing novelty that is not inspired by any mythological tale. The pace by which the story progresses is fantastic,neither it is too stretched nor it just races ahead. There is an interesting build-up to the climax. The sequence of unfolding of events leaves you at the edge of your seats and kudos should be given to the writer for a screenplay that keeps you hooked all the time. The only flaw in the otherwise brilliant script is that the romantic angle between Sivudu and Avantika seems half-baked.\n\nDirection and Production. S. S. Rajamouli is at his best,the way he has handled the film is commendable. The effort put in by him and his team shows clearly in every frame of the film. The detailing of each aspect of the film,be it the costumes,weaponry,sets especially the grandeur of Mahamishti Kingdom make this film a visual spectacle. The VFX is outstanding,never seen before in Indian Cinema and it wont be wrong to say that they match up to Hollywood standards. Two scenes that that will simply take your breath away are;the waterfall climbing and the war sequences. I can vouch that these are the most well crafted scenes in Indian Cinema.\n\nActing. Prabhas plays the double role of Sivudu/Baahubali. He has pulled off both the roles with great ease. This is the best performance of his career till date. Rana Daggubatti is menacing as the villain Bhallala Dev. Ramya is brilliant. Sudeep has a small role but he plays his part with perfection. The rest of the cast overacts which is a big letdown.\n\nMusic The background is the best one which I have ever heard. M. M. Kreem's soundtrack is a brilliant. All the songs compliment the story and are well written.\n\nVerdict. I go 9/10 for this marvel. The film is way ahead from the ones made in bollywood and will surely bring Indian Cinema into the big league."

I'm continuously listening to its music, the background score doesn't seem to get out of my head, and even for the third time in the cinema hall, a few of the scenes give me goosebumps.\n\nYeah, yeah, you all would say I'm jumping quite high.

And that hair!\n\nAs westerners, we initially experienced a film culture shock, but we soon found ourselves captivated by the escapades of the charming protagonist.

Though the starting was slow and a poor love story, the story picks up heat as it reaches its intermission. By the end of the movie u would be on a burning hot seat and the movie ends...

This is intrigue, action and adventure from beginning to end. The final act is nothing short of spectacular, with a sensational 40-minute long battle sequence! The camerawork and visual effects during this particular scene is mind-boggling. This is probably as much of a spectacle today as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Cleopatra' was back in the day."

The acting of all the cast is excellent. This is a big screen movie and you have to experience it.\n\nThe story is simple but the presentation, cast, the acting, etc makes this a movie that is several notches above any other movie in the history of Indian cinema. If you compare this with Holloywood it is nothing less. Again people have to be realistic about comparing with Holloywood - Hollywood can AFFORD to spend BECAUSE they HAVE HUGE WORLD market.... Humongous compared to Telugu film market or any Indian cinema market . So Hollywood can spend and make spectacular movies. Baahubali is spectacular."

Now film has been released in theaters and people are just gone mad to watch it in theatre. Same story of mine too. Had very high expectations from it but sadly film did not matched up to my expectations. Everything was big in the film but don't know why film didn't left me with its impact. Story of very Kind and brave king baahubali that how he became king and then someone from his loved ones killed him by betrayal. And now his son just know what happened to his father years ago. Son who lives in different society goes to that kingdom to escape his mother from his relatives who seems to be cruel ones. Nothing new or special in story but the execution is very large. Film has been shot on very large scale which is treat to watch. From the start to end it never gives you feel of watching an ordinary movie. Locations and cinematography is excellent. Acting is good but not great. Because there are no such scenes where actors could show their acting talent. Music is not that good. But Background music is awesome which makes those scenes much better. Production is outstanding. I have to praise production team for their daring to make such a huge film with this much huge budget.in last 30 mins you can see their efforts that how large they made it. Those war scenes will blow you. People will remember this film for its budget and the daring of the production team. Direction was strictly okay. When you have everything from producers then you should make a masterpiece but director failed to impress. He made some scenes completely for masses only. That money making stuff as if we were watching an action masala entertainer. Cant blame him only because he didn't had so much in story but still i think he could have made it better. Some songs were completely waste,were avoidable actually. Final words, neither film disappointed me nor impressed me. Its a good film to watch once but not strongly recommended. Watch it, only because you want watch its next part and don't want yourself to get confuse with its plot. If you will watch this one then only you will understand whats going on when you will watch its 2nd part. Go for this, for their entire team's hard work. Obviously they have made the biggest movie ever in the history of Indian cinema. All the best to the entire team. 7 * stars by me :)"

So it's obvious, one is good and the other is bad. Basically, a good v/s evil revenge saga but it has a lot more, much more to offer.\n\nPrabhas and Rana Daggubati feature as warring cousins and their hard work shows through their performance.\n\nTamannah Bhatia is a goddess in every aspect. She perfectly plays the role of a warrior whose feminine side is unearthed by our hero. She literally seduces the audience with her flawless skin, her curves and her hourglass figure.\n\nRamya Krishna and Sathyaraj play a good role in supporting the film with their powerful performance.\n\nThe performance and the makeup of Anushka Shetty was a huge surprise for me as an old woman. The makeup team and the VFX team have done a great job here.\n\nIt's not the end!! I Just cant stop talking about the GREATNESS of this film. tongue emoticon Until then, I eagerly wait for BAAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION, scheduled for release in 2016."

Quite insane stunts - interesting graphics and over the top action and characters to boost. Now that is either in your ball park (or zoo, considering all the animals involved and used once again here - I reckon without being hurt - CGI and all that) or it isn't. That will be up to you to decide.\n\nThe movie is quite crazy and that is still putting it mildly. There is a lot of cliches to go around. I for one am thankful there aren't really song and dance numbers in this - others may be dissapointed. But the movie would not warrant it - on the other hand, they managed to put some in RRR ... so there is that.\n\nCurious to see how this will be concluded in the sequel that was made two years later ... going to watch that tomorrow ..."

Frankly speaking I am the die hard fan of Rajmouli and he is a legendary director. Coming to casting every character's dramatic performance is marvelous. And Rana's performance reached to the apex. indeed he is very suited to protagonist's role. Prabhas's style of action is wonderful no one can suite from Telugu industry to replace him. Kattappa's dramatic performance is dramatically reached to the apex. To be fair I Baahubali is a going to keep many more India's records.

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to this movie with lot of expectations.. and the director didn't let things out! Kudos to Rajamouli and his team! A fantastic Indian movie that has set a High standards.\n\nThe director's way of storytelling keeps the viewers stick to the seats except few places where the songs sequence let loose the viewers, noticed few people leaving the Hall during the song sequence. The Graphics part are pretty good, the Visual effects team have done a clean job! except one place where I felt 'the hero escapes from the palace before rescuing his mother' could have been done better.\n\nAll the main actors in this movie have done justice to their roles. We can see that Prabas and Rana have put in a lot of hard work on their physic. Their presence in action sequence are energetic! (probably more of their action to come in part2). Ramyakrishnan and SathyaRaj's part in this movie is superb! A must watch movie on big screen!"

S.S Rajamouli Sir - Undoubtedly is the best director in India. Movie has got a very good story supported by awesome VFX. The movie received critical as well as public appreciation. Coming to the performances, Remya Krishna, Satyaraj, Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anuskha Shetty did a great job. The movie has got a different type of climax, ending the story all of a sudden. It helps to maintain the thirst to watch Bahubali: The Conclusion. The second part of the movie will release next year (2016). Its a must watch movie and a highly recommended one. Don't Miss It. Run to the nearby theaters."

I was literally amazed watching Troy and from that day I always felt when will an Indian Movie reach such standards in Epic/History Movie making.\n\nAfter watching Baahubali one can surely say the movie is near match to Hollywood standards. The Gigantic sets, VFX Feast, Emotions,Avalanche scene, War episode, etc etc you name it this movie had it. Credit goes to each and every person worked for this film either on screen/off screen.\n\nThis movie gave hope to upcoming innovative film makers that a correct storyline with international standards in film making will make a huge box office success.\n\nWhat next! I am eagerly waiting for Baahubali: The Conclusion that is going to release in 2016.\n\nThanks, Sra1"

He opened the gates for Indian Comics to get into main stream movies just like Warner bros comic stories in the west.\n\nFilm has visuals resembling Vikram Bethal in Chandamama Novels which are famous in India.\n\nLooks like lots of effort has gone into Visual Effects,Characterization and Innovative Ideas for War sequels. Much more effort was needed in the areas like dialogue writing, as I watched it in Telugu, the dialogue writer should have been more careful when the film is related to a period film. Some of the dialogues had words which have originated in the modern times, where such words are used by general public and certainly not expected in this film.\n\nThe Story lacks the grip as it does not have much suspense. Audience can expect the next scene and it should not have been the case that they sit only to see the Visual Effects. A Strong plot would have taken this film to a whole new level.\n\nFinally, since it is a naive attempt after a long time in Indian Cinema, it is a must watch.\n\nCongratulations to Baahubali Team."

What kind of complications is this likely to create not only in her own life but that of her son, her husband and everyone that surrounds them? This is really the crux of the movie.\n\nHave no doubt that the story is the first king followed by the visuals and the dramatic moments that unfurl almost every 15 minutes in the movie. The movie is billed as India's biggest blockbuster and it is so by miles. It requires a minimum of 2 viewings to truly grasp the essence of Baahubali."

Story line was way beyond the expectations, twists made all goosebumps, emotions carried by every character made audience very connected. movie made up to the mark of Hollywood in Vfx and Ark work. Coming to the War sequences Peter hein gave a high standards, every frame has a real war feel, long shots and close shots made plus point to war scenes, the palace and rest of sets are imaginable to creativity of team baahubali.

The opening scenes were so just ridiculous, I almost kept watching for amusement more than anything else. I didn't make it more than 5 minutes into the action before I evacuated. Sometimes, it's kind of like The Room meets 300.\n\nEdit: even though I turned it off after 5 mins during my first screening, my kids and I began watching it on the following weekend just for the fun of it. It earnestly tries to be epic and serious but a lot of times the grossly obvious and gratuitous CGI kept us laughing.\n\nAnd what is with the slow-mo shampoo commercial headshaking of Bahubali every time he gets wet. Lol.\n\nAlso, my daughters and I didn't like the fact that while the women in the movie are strong-willed and talented it's made clear that they are ultimately wild, over-emotional creatures who need taming and can only progress so far in their quest; ultimately men are their masters. Very outdated and disappointing!\n\nNonetheless the film is so endearingly sincere in its intentions it's hard not to watch out of sympathy for giggles.\n\nSome of its scenes are imaginative and poetic enough to warrant wasting a lazy afternoon watching the progression of Indian cinema.\n\nThe movie-within-a-movie backstory caught us off guard. Totally different feel and tone. Fragmented experience overall. Sometimes we were quite confused. The movie was disjointed in so many ways... but the experience overall was interesting and different and kept us watching."

One and only thing from negative perspective is effects. I can't get how people say it was on Lord of the ring level... 60-75% of visual effect in film was great and was in competition with holywood, but those 40-25% was terrible... It was like student level... I'am not sure how film with this kind of budget and with battle scenes like this (hell! it was really epic) have some trashy green screen, unrealistic cgi moments... It's like film run over budget and finnish some scenes with budget. But totally worth to watch!"

        "review_detailed_main": "B\u00e3hubali: The Beginning is the first half of a two part epic and is itself split into two distinct halves.\n\nThe first part of the film sees Shivudu (Prabhas) attempting to climb the mountain that rises over his village. Despite many failed attempts, he finally succeeds after discovering a mask of a beautiful woman at the foot of one of the mountains many waterfalls: just the incentive he needed. Once at the top, he meets the owner of the mask, Avanthika (Tamannaah Bhatia), a warrior who is on a mission to free her queen, Devasena (Anushka Shetty), from the clutches of evil tyrant Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati). Falling for the young woman, Shivudu promises to help, and in doing so learns of his royal heritage.\n\nThe second half of the film is a flashback to fifty years earlier, and details how Shividu's father Baahubali came to be king, proving himself worthy in battle. Most of the second act is dedicated to large scale scenes of warfare, that are reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, except that the CGI isn't as good. Director S. S. Rajamouli (who would go on to make the excellent RRR) maintains a decent pace and delivers plenty of violent spectacle and the whole thing is such over-the-top fun that it's fairly easy to forgive the rather ropey special effects.\n\nThe film ends abruptly, leaving the viewer waiting until 2016 for the concluding part. Luckily for me, it's now almost 2024, so I don't have to wait at all.\n\n6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the insane reincarnated housefly revenge magnum opus, Eega (2012), I made a vow that I would watch anything directed by S.S. Rajamouli. Three years later comes Baahubali and he has completely pushed the cinematic envelope way off the charts with this one. This is total gonzo filmmaking. It feels like Rajamouli is holding the director's rulebook in his hand and he shouts \"fuggit!\" Then he went ahead and shot whatever his mind dreams up. This is a film made with total abandonment without adhering to steadfast rules. It re-invents its own rules and reality, and it is massively monster-entertaining.\n\nAfter watching thousands of films and writing hundreds of reviews, I sometimes feel I have become jaded. Almost every film can be reduced to a platitudinal paragraph or two. But sitting in a full house screening of this Tamil film (that is currently breaking numerous box office records in India), I was busy lifting my jaw so many times off the floor. I can't believe I was watching a film of such an epic scale, with such incredible story ideas and super duper inventive action spectacles. It felt like I was seeing cinematic stuff for the first time. It was a feast for the senses.\n\nMy wife only had one complaint - some of the scenes were grossly exaggerated. I would like to correct that - the whole film is crazily exaggerated. The grand set design is a huge page taken out from Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, the physical actions that are humanly impossible, all of it I gladly took in hook line and sinker because of Rajamouli's great sense of effervescent adventure and his superb touch on CGI and great spectacles always serving the story. The characters depicted here are larger than than life and the storytelling has the chops to match it. The Indian cinema clich\u00e9s are all here - the extended flashback, mother and son sad story, sibling rivalry, the indispensable love story. But the superb execution make them so refreshing. I can't believe nearly 3 hours passed by. This is an awe-inspiring film and I had goosebumps rising up so many times. Any movie that can make me believe a dude can stay underwater long enough so that he can tattoo a girl's hand with waterproof paints has gotten it right. This one broke all the rules and set new ones.\n\nThis is fricking CINEMA!!!!"

Ramyakrishna and Sathyaraj action is unbelievable. Anushka did best for the role she has. Prabhas and Rana did good but were dominated by Ramyakrishna.

I somehow suspended logic and got lost in the imaginary world that unveiled in front of me. Audience around me seemed equally spell bound. The cliffhanger finish was a terrible pause, until I realized it was the end and I really had to wait another full year to see what happens next. You can claim the movie was inspired or copied from various sources but it really isn't. Its a director's life time experience rolled into a fantasy that might borrow all kind of ideas that he would have experienced through his life but definitely not created as a deliberate copy. So suspend judgment and have a blast with Baahubali!\n\nPS: So many have written about the story and characters, so I decided the readers could be spared of my summary."

I love the acting portrayed by the characters that are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less \"popular\" elevation of characters who also deserve a big \"bravo\". Among them I have to mention epic kingdom queen who is mostly used as the serious relief of the movie. In BAAHUBALI we can also see the beautiful and popular Star and actress Anushka, who although has a poor costume designer, she is totally appears like a slave with no powerful dialog where she was a queen for the kingdom.\n\nActually I got to IMDb while after i saw movie, in fact on IMDb Movie has no stunning photos. I was lucky to watch this movie in bigscreen. Some time i felt a beautiful body without soul and not only a gorgeous and talented actress but Ramyakrishna is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future..."

Lots of discussions, whether to pay for drop, finally we decided to pay and found seats in one of the front rows.

Definitely not worth a 9.4 rating. Come on! its IMDb and people just can't rate an average movie a 9. Some people were even comparing it with the Batman Series!!.\n\nI understand we've not exposed to this kind of cinema but wake up, you've just reached a place where people have already been appreciating such movies since a long time from now."

Rajamouli's vision is awesome and his world of Baahubali is mind blowing!! Loved the visuals!!!! He has changed the shape of Indian Cinema and I must say I am really proud to be a Telugu cinema viewer!\n\nI was eagerly waiting for Baahubali since I heard about it(about two years back). I watched almost all the promotion videos, interviews, audio launch videos and was very very excited to see this epic movie by the great director S.S. Rajamouli.\n\nI totally enjoyed each and every bit of the movie. The visuals are amazing!!!! Prabhas and Rana's screen presence is too good.. Ramya Krishna's character Shivagami is very strong and she was fantastic!! Costumes and background score are very good!!\n\nPrabhas-- he looks really like a King!!! I couldn't take my eyes off him!!\n\nTamannah was good as a warrior and acted well as usual!! Waiting for next part to see Anushka as queen of Mahishmati.. The war scenes were amazing and reminded me of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit..!!\n\nTake a bow - S.S.Rajamouli- one of the finest and great directors of Indian Cinema. Truly proud moment for Telugu cinema and Telugu movie lovers!"

The way all the story line was going was left in a sudden end. I believe it could have been possible to split the story in some way better than they did.\n\nThough i was a bit disappointed but still the movie had left a stunning image.

        "review_detailed_main": "Opinion, Baahubali: The Beginning.\n\nHype, excitement, \"brace yourselves\", we've had it all. Phrases iterated time and again, South Indian Cinema, rather a great deal of it has always resided in the disappointing side of the curve. That particular curve, over time, has become so steep that a good telugu movie was referred to with a superficial conjecture. Baahubali stands out to make a new graph, the only difference being it does not stay true to its ancestry.\n\nBeginning of the movie, as I sat in the overpriced INOX seats with some overpriced Nachos and Coffee, I expected the hype to fail and some cheesefest for display so I can go home and whine about how much of torment I have been through. But what I rather caught the eye of, was absolutely fantastic. As I sat myself through with keen eyes, there was some brilliant music playing in the background sending a shiver through my nerves at every engaging moment. Every character who came to display brought more immersion with him than the prior. My favourite of them all has been, Kattappa, Kattappa was outstanding. And the visuals (insert puking rainbows meme here) were stunning.\n\nNow, now, the movie isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There are some unnecessary scenes as well, What I didn't like about Baahubali is that it still holds some of the telugu cinema clich\u00e9s, the unnecessary dance songs, the romance arc. But wait, that's about it. That is what i had to complain about.\n\nAs the interval set a grand stage for the second half, I was still getting over the marvelous pre interval scene. And what followed the interval -the warfare, the story, the powerful screenplay, the effort put into visuals, the grand stage, performance by the cast, was pure cinematic excellence. And when the movie ended, I could not argue but rule out that Baahubali is amazing. Making a movie like Baahubali requires a great deal of effort and S S Rajamouli has put every bit into it. If not for the stifling unnecessary scenes, Baahubali is fantastic and one amongst the best Telugu movies.\n\nHighly Recommended. Make an effort to watch it on the big screen."

Hero Shivudu's hunky look, Villain's mannerism, Kattappa and Sivagami characters are impressive. Low level graphics at most crucial scenes(shivudu entering scene into mahishmathi kingdom, Ballala dev's fight with graphical bull, water fall). Background score was below par. Even unbearable at times in first half(Dolby atmos) . Devasena's make up and Avanthika's body language are hilarious things of this movie. First of all we need a good story and a better way to narrate and present on the big screen. Bhajrangi Bhaijan is one example for that.\n\nWar sequences are quiet good though. For 40 mins in second half we can definitely watch it once. Slow and weak first half and good 40 mins war scenes in second half makes it an average telugu film.\n\nVerdict: If you ever watched a good English war movie then you might find it hilarious. If you are only a telugu movie type , you will sure like it.\n\nWait for the Bahubali conclusion."

Watch it for the story line which is going take complete shape with the second part of it.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been looking forward to Bahubali ever since I heard about it. I have seen Rajamouli's Magadheera and Eega, and I was impressed and I thought to myself, \"Give Rajamouli 200 crores, and lets see what he can do\" I also want to see Indian filmmakers reach Hollywood standards, as any proud Indian would want as well. Now the reviews are raving that Bahubali reaches parity with those standards. I will be as unbiased as I can in my review. It doesn't on the whole, and it is not budget that lets it down, but poor scripting, lack of vision and some bad aesthetic choices.\n\nFirst, I will begin with what is good, before I start deconstructing it. The cinematography and colour grading is stunning, I love the location shots, the waterfall and the sweeping epic vistas. The use of CG mattes mixed with live footage is the best I have seen in an Indian film, they are somewhat LOTR-esque. The hugely talked about battle scene in the end are amazing. The nods to 300 and LOTR are clear, but it does not copy them, and comes up with some creative shots, especially a sequence where huge stone boulder carry a massive silk cloth that falls over the enemies and then it is set on fire. I think here Bahubali has set the standard not just for India, but Asia in general. It compares favourably to Hollywood.\n\nNow what I did not like. The entire first half of the movie is a total waste, badly scripted and hurried. The VFX sequences here are all completely unnecessary and a waste of time, energy and money: this includes a vertical limitesque avalanche sequence, which could have looked good, with better shot design, but the director allows for some really bad and fake shots which stick out. Another sequence has a king fight a CG bison, which adds nothing to the story(what a waste of resources). Another sequence has a CG snake which wraps around an arrow of heroine(warrior princess) while our hero draws on her(an absurd love scene) - again a waste. The waterfall scenes are luscious, but totally wasted. They are nothing more than exotic backgrounds for our hero to jump around like a Tarzan in a dream sequence.\n\nIn general the entire first half is a waste. This is not the fault of budget, but of a bad screenplay and a lack of vision. The second half is told as a flashback, recounting the politics of the ancient kingdom and the conspiracy to overthrow the kingdom, and this is where the battle scene takes place with a savage Ork like army planning to siege the kingdom. But despite being the most visually impressive portion in the movie, it is let down by poor scripting, as there is no build up to the battle scene. It is abrupt. Unlike in LOTR, where the whole movie builds up to the final climatic battle.\n\nBahubali ultimately come across to me as an excuse for the director Rajamoili to try his hand at VFX and LOTR esque battle sequence. Very little attention has been given to scripting, acting, music or plot development. That's the biggest shame, because none of these things are the fault of budget. He could have done a lot more with his 200 crores."

The main character can do anything like fighting 1000s of soldiers with a sword, hold a 1000 kg idol with just a rope, jump from mountains and catch a falling guy. Too many unrealistic scenes. Story line is very weak. Vfx looks OK nothing great. All characters having fake and funny beards. Just an overrated movie."

Movie has high dose of Visual effects e.g. water fall and battle scene which will give you feel of world class cinema. Turning warrior Tamannah to Angel by natural make up was brilliant sequence. Prabhas and Rana have given outstanding performance. Tamannaah will surprise you with her action sequences. Ramya and Anushka were brilliant in small role. Music was not up to the mark.This cinema will be bench mark of Indian epic cinema.In terms of budget, Baahubali is like ISRO's MOM compare to NASA like high budget Hollywood movies."

I believe any one who are disappointed with the movie should check it out another time to connect to the move. Not denying of some gravity defying moments but overall it is a treat to watch this movie. Yes the movie ends suddenly and many felt that and gave poor ratings because of that as they were left unsatisfied with out know whole story. This happened to me when I first watch LOTR first and seconds parts.\n\nI give 10/10.\n\nGo watch the movie with less expectations."

Prabhakar was seriously awesome. His acting skills were extraordinary. Loved his character. Does this movie really deserve so much high rating? Or is it just because of fan boys who are giving it a perfect 10 score? How this film got this much of rating in IMDb , I think people might not seen other 300, gladiator , Hercules and so on. I mean what was so special about this movie? Yes, it had better CGI than maybe any other Indian film. But other than that, everything about this movie is worst. Bad direction, a bad screenplay and an over the top acting. I don't know how anyone who has seen even just mediocre movies in their lives can say that this movie is a masterpiece? Instead of blindly following the fan-craze, I wanna know objectively what was so great about this movie that it is called a masterpiece."

Lets wait for Part 2 and then conclude on the movie. This movie is the best cinematography in Tollywood industry. Entire world is praising on this movie and our own Telugu people are criticizing it.

        "review_detailed_main": "https://mixingsound.wordpress.com/2015/07/11/baahubali-mix-review/\n\nBaahubali has been such an inspiring movie for me. In fact it was the only movie that I saw twice on the same day after Inception. So, this is the Mix guy's point of view. I have to admit I haven't watched it in Atmos and I am sure its experience will be multi fold. What I write is based on the Dolby 7.1 mix.\n\nThe opening sequence is a beautifully mixed scene. From the beautiful lullaby to the way the song grows along with the amazing sequences on title. That was worth listening to. Handling water and waterfalls along with dialogs is a very difficult scene for any mix engineer. Its just because Water in so much width is exactly like white noise and has broadband spectrum leading to clashes. Juztin's take on it I would think is that once established, leave it to the visuals. Thats why when the score comes in and envelopes you, the water paves way to it. Once you leave that to reach Mahishmati, the ambiance slowly gives way to winds and drier sounds. The way the songs were handled were also something that should be talked about. The Shivuni song had the vocals all around so as to give the presence of the Omnipresent one Shiva as a praise. As I felt, this was the key to the underlying score of Baahubali in terms of chords and also what should be expected in the film. The song rises and leaves you in that state of power. Following that the Dheervara song was another gem. Although personally I would have loved the Guitars a bit more on the chorus when I heard it first, I realized that by the end of the song, when it grows on you, this is exactly what was done! Add to that the rhythms in surrounds, where the usual notion of not having percussions in surrounds was broken. We did it before in Bombay Velvet when Justin did the songs and he did it again! No fear, just good sound.\n\nOn reaching Mahishmati, the way dialogs were handled were to be talked about. Very well balanced dialogue. But unfortunately, I wouldn't say the Telugu dub quality was up to the mark as it was distorted in many places. But here is how you distinguish a good mix. There still is the sense of the space, power and levels in it. That draws the line. The score placements were brilliantly done in the space. The surrounds were used mostly when the fronts were filled I felt. This gave a feel of wholeness to the mix.\n\nThe Foley tones were really well done and a big mention to P.M. Satheesh for this. Him and Manoj M Goswami who were the designers on the film, assisted by Prathibha did a great job. The way the edits were done were also something that needs to be mentioned. Gokul Kr working on this for around 8 months or so simultaneously with Bombay Velvet, keeping in mind and focusing on the film is not a simple job and is no joke at all. Very impressed by the way the sounds were layered. Although as it went ahead towards the war, there could have been more space given. That may not be a singular fault as the lows may not have translated well in the theaters I saw. What ever is said, the rise and fall of the sound spectrum was beautiful.\n\nMy only objection to having a song was the song Pachha Botesi between Shivudu and Avantika as it kind of broke the flow and I saw a lot of people suddenly looking into their phones or going off to the loo or simply shuffling in their seats. But that being said, the song that preceded it was a wonderful one in terms of visualizing and the composition. Although a bit more perfection in terms of the physics of the composition would have been good.\n\nTalking more about the sound, the effects that were done during the first sword fight between Kattappa and the Persian trader was something that was really cool. Moving away from the clich\u00e9d sword rings when ever there was an extended hold or a clash between the swords, it concentrated more on the weight of the sounds. The movements were also not with the ringy sounds that have been used so often after Hero was released. The scene that came later with Shivudu and Kattappa it was not gory as it could have been, but became a mark of a stance taken by the character where he has no mercy to the unjust. Here the rise of the score and the way it was played with was what made the impact. I have personally felt that nothing can move us the way music can. No amount of ambiance design, effects, dialog Foley can do what a string section can achieve. Kudos to the team in showing that.\n\nHonestly, it is not without its VFX rendering flaws, script flaws etc. Yet, its grandeur is big enough to cover all that. I bow to you Rajamouli Sir. I don't even want to imagine what comes in part 2 as I know I wont reach even 1/10th of your scale of thoughts!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.\n\nBaahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places).\n\nI didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it.\n\nAll the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.\n\nThe background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR)\n\nI would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.\n\nThe quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.\n\nBut the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voil\u00e0 we will have a SPECTACULAR film.\n\nBaahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian \"Baahubali\".\n\nSo in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it. P.S: I want to see Rajamouli doing \"Mahabharata\" next."

        "review_title": "An Indian Mythological Classic!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie brings back rich memories of some of the great Indian mythological movies made several decades ago. Indian film industry since then has become hugely commercial with little risk taking; and has largely stayed away from such subjects for a long time, until now. SS Rajamouli's Baahubali is an Indian mythological story of epic proportions with larger than life characters, told on a massive scale. It may go down as a classic in years from now.\n\nThis film is made with such high technical values, it just doesn't seem like a regular Telugu or Indian movie. It screams of international appeal in visual quality, narration and content and seemingly narrows the language barrier with great visual storytelling.\n\nThe visuals are stunning and memorable and never before seen in an Indian film. For this reason alone it's worth a watch. And the fact that they've been created in a film whose total budget is $40 million is an incredible achievement. It speaks volumes of the local technical capabilities and the film maker's understanding of VFX value and wisdom to where and how to use it to complement his storytelling.\n\nThe casting is perfect; acting is top notch and the actors deliver their lines with so much intensity. Prabhas plays the protagonist role perfectly and combined with his physique and charm, it's hard to imagine any other actor who'd have better suited the title role.\n\nAnother highlight of this film is it's music and background soundtrack by veteran music composer MM Keeravani. The songs are wonderfully composed and very well rendered. The rich and poetic lyrics in the telugu version at least is such a great pleasure to listen to considering the filth that is put out in other films. The Sanskrit phrases sung in a few scenes simply elevates them to a whole different level giving them so much significance in context. Keeravani's background sounds for war action sequences are haunting and deliver serious emotional punch while completely engrossing the viewers in on screen action and making it memorable. It honestly feels better than the work of Hans Zimmers in The Last Samurai or Gladiator.\n\nBaahubali's every scene reveals the intense passion with which Rajamouli makes his films. His fearless imagination and courage to make something this herculean on a massive scale and execute it magnificently on the screen, is hugely admirable and makes one wonder what he'd create if he'd the budget of a Hollywood movie at his disposal. His growth as a filmmaker has been exponential. Every successive movie of his has been a vast improvement over its predecessor. His movies are top notch in production values, regardless of the nature, he consistently extracts excellent performances from his actors. His movies are high on emotional quotient and he has this unique ability to give the viewer an emotional high every 20 mins of the movie someway or the other. His gripping storytelling abilities are unparalleled currently in the Indian film industry. His screenplays are deeply engaging and his abilityto handle complex projects and execute them perfectly to deliver all round entertainment is rare. He excels in all the departments. Simply put, he has no competition in the industry today.\n\nBaahubali sets a new benchmark of filmmaking in India, which in recent decades hasn't been too high to go past. Indian films have generally lacked novelty and revolve largely around an actor or two rather than containing solid story lines and writing. Baahubali is a standout in that regard, where an epic story brilliantly told rises above its actors. It deserves all the applause and success it can gather and much more. It is a treat for true cinema goers. Buoyed by the huge success that this film has already achieved and will, only Rajamouli can imagine what new benchmarks he'll set with the next one."

You can see the efforts of it on the screen in each and every department of the movie. What a heroic narration.I am still in the awe of some scenes that I never saw in cinema.I am eagerly waiting for the Baahubali: the conclusion. And yes the director he is truly worth a stamp.It is sure shot and deserving Blockbuster. I am a big fan of Game of Thrones and I must say the shooting is even looks bigger than that.Indian values , heroic character , the villain , the whole epic fantasy.JUST WOW. I watched in Hindi and its super awesome in dubbed version too. Each and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2. Its a new benchmark for Indian cinema.

        "review_detailed_main": "Baahubali l The Beginning is almost a heroic, attractive, and wholly entertaining visual exhibition!\n\nReview by: http://fb.com/iAlekhyaDas\n\nThe story revolves around a powerful young man named Shiva, who unwittingly converts into a protector for a Kingdom he never knew was his. His return to his nation is the commencement of a bout against the sins.\n\nBasically, the story is a revenge story filled with some melodrama, but Baahubali is something else. This film is praised to be the most extravagant creation in the history of Indian cinema.\n\nThe cons of Baahubali- 1. Typical melodrama. 2. Unnecessary lovemaking 3. Some action scenes are really too much. The hero does some Mission Impossible n Furious 7 mixed actions! 4. The story in some places.\n\nThe pros of Baahubali Almost everything else 1. VFX VFX VFX 2. Theacting is quite good 3. Great BGM 4. Cinematography 5. Stunts except some haphazard ones 6. Direction 7. The courage to make such a movie\n\nOverall, I would say, this is a magnificent effort to have an Indian movie like the '300'. I never enjoyed a dubbed South Indian movie like this. Go watch it for its war sequences, i.e. The second half to be fair and square. Kudos to the notion of making movies like this. Don't watch it on your computer by downloading it. Go watch it on the big screen to enjoy it in a big way."

Its a film which takes one on journey of perfect screenplay, camera work, visual effects, acting played by every actor and best in class direction. Every scene is captured so beautifully it makes you go WOW. The intensity of expression weather it be love, hatred, greed, ambition to reach to the top of the waterfall is depicted so well. The war scene at end is far away from stereotypical containing a few scenes which itself is like a story in movie story. Overall if a movie freak or camera man wishes to learn to capture their audience this movie is path to that road."

Although side role characters are OK , the acting from main main characters is simply horrible, actually i do not even want to elaborate.\n\nStory has no depth and full of gaps and inconsistencies, but is kind of a cheap remake of the story of prophet Moses, the difference finding family is good but the real family is bad . You cannot understand why many of the occurrences happen. Also war scene is almost stolen from troy , same shield wall, two brothers....\n\nOur muscular hero is something above Hercules and any demigod or god you can name from mythologies , cannot be harmed and gets stronger when he is angry like Hulk . He is so romantic and speaks like the lowest quality poems.\n\nEven in the most unbelievable fantasy movie you can make some explanations over the world they have created , but here you can expect catapults to shoot burning fabric and kill 100 thousand people .... Why would you add so many stunt man and walking-on players and not even make a proper war scene.\n\nIf you cannot find anything to watch and so bored , even than don't watch this one , go watch brave heart or troy 11 th time ."

Forgive me, I want to jump from a professional to a fan boy for a little while to give this review. Talking about baahubali, I appreciate director SS Rajamouli & his team for carving out the visual effects for making it a sheer watching experience.The battle scenes also were very impressively done. They looked and sounded real. The movie integrated with good sceneries and visual treats made appealing to the eye of audience. The music rendered by MM Keeravani was good enough and camera work was outstanding. Even though the VFX effects are little bit poor in the later parts i.e in mahishmati kingdom, the scenes appeared to be somewhat realistic. Firstly, I feel proud for making such a visual treat to our Indians which can be comparitively competitive to 1500 crores of movie AVATAR. I'm glad to say that, our director gave his 200%/100% best beyond the budget financed for this movie.\n\nComing to the roles played by various artist. I'm quite impressed by the acting of RamyaKrishna garu. She literally gave us goosebumps. Nazar garu action was stunning who disguised himself so cunningly that I failed to expect him in such a way. Rana was outstanding, I personally believe the heroic image behind the image baahubali was not well outshined. Perhaps, that is how the fantasy movie shows and works for the second part.\n\nTo encapsulate, the movie is extremely good and it is lived upto the mark. It's gonna be prodigious in Indian film industry for certain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Baahubali made me 'feel' the meaning of the words \"Being speechless\". Any great amounts praise to the film would not be enough. Such a fine masterpiece. Hatsoff to every technician involved in the making of movie. They have put every drop of their life in sculpturing the movie. The epic art work of the movie just made me emotional and roll down into tears at many scenes. Every scene is 100%. This more of an art than a movie and proved movie is also an art when perceived well. Such movies are like energy to our souls. Relations,romance,love,hatred,war,jealous, hunger for revenge,bravery, determination and so on, every depiction is excellent. The dynamism of Ramyakrishna gaaru as kings mother, Loyality of Satyaraj gaaru as King's brave slave warrior, Cunningness in Nasar gaaru's role, Hunger for revenge in Anushka's role, Fierceness in tamannah's role Love and emotions of shivudu's role and Super brave,super tactical,most powerful and patriotic Prabhas role as Baahubali And equivalent equivalent personality role of Rana gaaru to Baahubali in a negative role- everything is highly balanced and highly convincing. The use of Sanskrit slokas in the background music is awesome. The depiction of war strategies can make the Hollywood feel jealous and equally admiring and loving. Never seen such an awesome war strategy with such a clarity. It brought a new level to world cinema. SS Rajmouli gaaru is one of the biggest gift of world cinema to us. He made us proud. :-) Not only the director every crew member of the movie is to be equally praised in large amounts. Keeravani gaaru,Cyril gaaru,kotagiri Venkataeshwar rao gaaru,vijayendra Prasad gaaru,ramaa gaaru, peter Haynes and the awesome producers etc., The movie is a must watch in lifetime movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have recently watched Bahubali. It is a great film in Indian History. But there is some issue. 1. In the War, soldiers are flying in the air too much. 2. By the rotating front blade of Chariot Men are threw in the air instead of Slicing down. 3. I have seen two subsidiary teeth in the mouth of teen Bahubali which I can't find in young Bahubali. 4. VFX is too good in the scene of Bull Fighting. 5. I don't understand why two princes were act as spy for some time and they were dancing in a item song. A prince never work as a spy. 9. Costumes may be more good. Even the costumes of Star Plus Mahabharata TV series is more good. I think these will be corrected in next Bahubali"

        "review_detailed_main": "For a long time, I don't remember struggling for tickets. Multiplexes and apps had just made things too easy. But then, India's most expensive film to date, Baahubali seems to have changed the whole demand game. Instead of media hype that is typical of Bollywood, it was actually word of mouth publicity that got many people to watch the film. Consequently, movie screens were almost full and finding tickets was tough.\n\nThe story of Baahubali has everything that a political tale from the era of kings would have. There are cousins battling for the throne, played by Prabhas, as the protagonist with superhuman strength playing Baahubali and Sivudu and Rana Daggubati as the formidable antagonist, Bhallaladeva. Tamannaah (forget the ever changing spelling) Bhatia plays a masked tribal warrior girl Avanthika and Sivudu's love interest.\n\nTalk about wars and kingdoms, comparisons with '300', 'Game of Thrones' or 'Troy' and their likes are natural. In reality, filmmakers have very little latitude in the variety of stories that can be portrayed and it is also possible that some copied/ inspired scenes may emerge, for all we know! Still, one mustn't forget that SS Rajamouli's Baahubali is a story on political dynamics that are not unusual in Indian history and epics.\n\nThe lead cast is supported by strong performances from Ramya Krishna, playing the matriarch Sivagami and Satyaraj as the brave, but morally obligated Kattappa and Nasser as Bhallaladeva's father Bijjaladeva. Minor roles include that of Anushka Shetty as Devasena and Sudeep as Aslam Khan, who may have bigger roles in the sequel.\n\nBang for the buck comes from visual effects that are comparable to any big budget flick involving VFX. The scenes involving the gigantic waterfall and bull fight are on par with the global best such as Avatar or Jurassic World. Having said that, a couple of scenes, like the avalanche and some shots of capital city could have been improved.\n\nComplementing the stupendous visuals was the flawless sound mixing. The dialog, sound effects and the background score blend seamlessly. MM Kreem's ominous 'maahishmati saamrajyam' provides a perfect backdrop to the serious scenes. The songs were decent, however none of them can be categorized as hummable.\n\nEditing was perfect in the second half, while the first half was quite shaky. The movie could've taken more time to establish the characters but instead, some of scenes look rushed up. Frankly, a few minutes of extra runtime wouldn't have mattered if the transitions between some scenes were smoother.\n\nWith massive sets, everything in Baahubali is on a grand scale. The Kingdom's capital was luxuriously large and the waterfall was unimaginably gigantic. The war scenes were realistic and captivating. Maybe, it would've looked tad more realistic if the capital's sets looked a bit weathered. The costumes were well done though.\n\nThe weakest area in the film, that I could fathom was the make-up. Our filmmakers are simply unable to get past the obsession of painting faces. Time they understand that in ultra high definition of digital cinema, the make-up overdose look uglier than blemishes on the faces, that are natural and acceptable these days. This is one lesson that they need to learn from 'Game of Thrones' that got the make-up spot on. .\n\nThe dubbing in Hindi was well done. Nevertheless, it would have been better if distributors had more shows of the original Telugu version with English subtitles running in Mumbai's multiplexes. It would've helped retain the original flavor of the film. Let's hope the distributors release the sequel on more screens!\n\nRupees 250 crore for two films may sound like a big budget. But, in dollar terms a 40 million budget not actually big on a global scale. Yet, the movie has achieved so much. it is therefore testimony to the fact that India has tons of talent and if budget isn't a constraint, in the right hands, unbounded creativity can be unleashed in India.\n\nA brilliant movie like Baahubali coming from the South that is jeered for dark-skinned and fat stars is actually a slap in the face for Bollywood that is churning out trash as hits (at least for the likes of avuncular and narcissistic Shahrukh's Ra.One/ Jab Tak Hai Jaan or pseudo-intellectual Aamir's Dhoom 3 or a Salman who hasn't learnt one bit of acting in decades or Rohit Shetty blowing cars or Farah Khan's outrageous plot lines).\n\nVerdict: Sure as hell, Baahubali is no perfect film. But, for what it's worth, watch Baahubali on the big screen and thus discourage piracy This is the least bit that a movie fan must do to encourage the good guys among Indian filmmakers to take bigger risks in the right path and tell us bigger and grander indigenous stories."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever imagined how our childhood Amar Chitrakatha stories of kings and the kingdoms would look if made on the scale of 'Lord of the rings'? Well the answer is SS Rajamouli's 'Bahubali: The Beginning'; and yes, it's indeed the beginning of grand cinema and believable special effects in India. Great to see, finally Indian movie makers are investing in such work and fortunately, the mammoth success attained by this movie on box-office will pave way for many more works like this. So, before drooling more on the magnificence of this magnum-opus by Rajamouli, let me touch upon major aspects of this movie:\n\n\u0095 Plot & execution: The story is a typical historical fiction of kings and kinship, battles and wars; but here, it is the execution which makes the simple-story-on-paper a larger-than-life saga, an unforgettable epic! Full of melodramatic moments, the movie does succeed to convince the audience by taking them virtually into the fictional Mahishmati kingdom. The abrupt climax might disappoint many, but perhaps that was intentional to pave way for the pre- planned sequel.\n\n\u0095 Cast & performances: Prabhas literally brings alive on silver screen, the machoism and heroics as required for the title role; aptly supported by Rana Daggubati and Tamanna Bhatia (both familiar faces in Bollywood), Ramya (the 90's Bollywood import from South), Anushka Shetty, Nassar, etc. These superior performances are further complemented by some superior dubbing (that one doesn't feel the divide of a dubbed version).\n\n\u0095 Cinematography/ production design: Well these are the areas which make this movie a landmark in Indian cinema! Whether be the picturesque scenes of cliffed waterfalls or the royal arenas of Mahishmati or the marvelous war sections, all just class apart to give you goosebumps! This movie has virtually turned cinematic screen into a sky-size canvass where the director has painted his imagination with immaculate precision and grandeur. High benchmarks set for future!\n\n\u0095 Music & songs: Now that our production scale is matching Hollywood levels, why can't Indian movies do away with unnecessary songs and dancing! Only saving grace in Music department is the fitting and well-suited background score by MM Keeravani.\n\n\u0095 Flaws: No, Bahubali isn't free of vices. Unnecessary songs and romantic angle only slow down the pace of an otherwise swift storyline. Also, melodrama could be toned down a bit.\n\n\u0095 Defense: Offlate, Bahubali has been criticized for being sexist and racist. Well, I do not agree with either. Had it been sexist, they would not have shown strong women like Sivagami and Devasena. Even Avantika's valorous side was well captured and just bringing out her feminine side doesn't make the movie sexist. Also, Kalakeyas being shown as dark people isn't racist. All fairy tales and even epics like Mahabharat and Ramayan have depicted demons and villains as not good looking people. So, this should not be taken as disgraceful and racist.\n\nHope these suggestions are considered in sequel 'Bahubali: The Conclusion', everyone is ardently waiting for. Afterall, this one has left a lot of unanswered questions and raised the expectations to another level altogether. Hope the next one comes in a 3D version!\n\nMust watch this is! (TV sets/ laptops will not do justice to the enormity. So watch it only in theatres!)"

Secondly, apologies from my Indian friends, but even though I understand that these dances and songs are part of their culture, honestly watching those as part of an 'epic' film does not work and just made me laugh.\n\nAll in all, Baauhubali was really one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever seen. Bad CGI, bad acting, bad editing, bad bad bad. Perhaps an Indian person can watch this, but definitely a western viewer will not be able to watch it (especially the first half, as in the second one the battle scenes are somewhat ok)."

Hats off to Prabhas for living king-size; Rana Daggubati for ferociousness; Ramya Krishnan's histrionics; Satyaraj, Nasser - seniors with method performances; Tamannah & Anushka for playing their 'roles' well...\n\nTime well spent n 100% paisa vasool!!

Shivudu as a lover didn't impress but as a warrior, he's up to the mark. There was no place for comedy in the story but some scenes had a light touch of humor in them. It looked like the screen wasn't heavy enough. The BGM of MM Keeravani gave an add on to the movie. An item song in the second half looked like it wasn't necessary but it has also gave an add on. Bhalladeva has his intensity in the first half but became a bit dull in the flash back. Kattappa's costume was meant to make him look like a heavily build person but it was clearly visible that he isn't. The end wasn't good. Rajamouli shouldn't had kept the title Baahubali the conclusion. Otherwise it might had a decent ending. Finally this movie is the pride of Indian cinema and will take the Indian cinema to Hollywood level."

Its good that I watched at home because at least I could leave the room during all the many scenes of blood and gore.\n\nBaahubali is a grandly produced spectacle. It is technically perfect. The acting is good, the story holds the interest and the locations and special effects are stunning.\n\nHowever .... it is far too violent for those like me who cant watch brutal scene after scene of blood and gore. I actually found the item number to be a great relief and a refreshing change from all the violence and bloodshed. Had I watched this alone, it would have been on fast forward mode through all the violent scenes. Alas the others with me were relishing it all, so I took the easy way out and left the room every time I could not bear to watch.\n\nI would not recommend this for children though I understand that some of the video games these days are just as, if not more violent.\n\nThe costumes and period settings are a delight. It is an epic, produced on a grand scale. The only flaw is the far too graphic depiction of violence. In my opinion, violence should be shown as implied rather than in complete gory detail. But it seems that the wider public enjoys this."

Nevertheless, the first half of the movie is utter crap and boring. The story does not really make sense as this guy wants to climb that waterfall mountain and thats it. But, hang on, there's actually a kingdom up there and people are being tortured as well (some work for the hero, after all)...!!!!!!!!!!! The best part of this film is, it lets you watch many movies/series without having to watch them all. Just watch this one and you're done. Still reeling because of the amount of $$$ spent for this.

S.S.Rajamouli is a genius. The person who gave the background music is another genius. The scrip writer is a master. Prabhas, Rana, Ramya are awesome in their roles. Tamanna looks gorgeous and acts well. Anushka is also superb in a short role. Even katappa is apt for the role! The sets,cinematography & songs are surreal.\n\nThe war scenes & techniques can put Hollywood movies to shame. I am not exaggerating! See it for yourself.\n\nThe movie is an out and out epic.

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all Kudos to Rajamouli and his team for their sincere and hard work in creating the cinema of India. Let us get into details.\n\nStory: As with all Rajamouli's previous films the story isn't great or new, so let's skip this part.\n\nRamyakrishna as Shivagami: You must be wondering why I am mentioning her role first because of all the characters in the movie the one which blown me out was Shivagami. Be it her expressions, dialogue delivery or the way she walks and fights, ramyakrishna was simply superb.\n\nSatyaraj as Kattappa: Second to Shivagami this is the most well played character. Satyaraj sir was simply awesome. Even at his age he competed with Prabhas and Rana in action sequences. In movie scene where Prabhas puts his leg on Kattappa's head I think most of the so called senior actors wouldn't have accepted to do this scene which shows satyaraj's dedication.\n\nPrabhas as Bahubali and Shivudu: I must appreciate Prabhas for his dedication and transformation he had undergone to suit for the dual roles he played in the movie. He was good at action scenes but I felt dialogue delivery was not that great (could be due to pathetic dialogs).\n\nRana as Bhallala Deva: Same goes for Rana. I felt Rana is the perfect choice for this role with his demonic expressions and body language.\n\nAnushka as Devasena: Though her screen presence is very limited Anushka was as usual great at expressions and body language. Waiting to see her full pledged role in 2nd part.\n\nTamannah as Avantika: She looks gorgeous in introduction song. She was good and up to her role limitations.\n\nNazar as Bijaladeva: Nazar has very little to play so no comments but this is not the role for Nazar.\n\nTanikella Bharani role was not required\n\nRohini was good as Mother of Shivudu with her expressions and apt acting for a tribal lady\n\nAdivi Seshu : He don't have anything to play except for getting killed by Prabhas and his makeup doesn't suite the role he played\n\nRest of the actors were acted up to their character limits\n\nSabu Cyril: Be it art work or war machines design or anything related to art Sabu Cyril has given his best which played a vital role in movie's visuals. Indian cinema needs art directors like Sabu, waiting to see more of his work in 2nd part.\n\nV Srinivasa Mohan: Whatever directions visualizes it comes to reality only when the visual part is handled by right guy and Mohan done that job to the maximum he can within the limits of budget and resources. Visuals are the best till date in Indian cinema though there is still needs to be improved.\n\nM.M.Keeravani: Songs were okay okay. But for a movie like Bahubali background score plays a vital role which was not handled well I feel. Usually Keeravani gives his best for Rajamouli movies to elevate scenes which is missing in this movie. Hope it will be better for 2nd part.\n\nSenthil: Cinematographer is the director's eye and senthil has done his job perfectly.\n\nRajamouli: He had concentrated more on visuals than narration and screenplay which used to be the strong points in his movies. Characterizations were not built properly and emotions were underplayed. Love track between lead pair seems dramatic. He should have employed a better dialogue writer which seriously effected character's capabilities. Coming to visualizing such a large kingdom and presenting it perfectly was his career best. Without director's vision none of the above mentioned stuff will not come into reality and for that we must appreciate Rajamouli. At some places he has given up logic to present heroism at peaks which was not good. I felt they have designed characters individually well but connecting those characters has gone for a toss.\n\nCostumes: Not apt for a movie like Bahubali but good at some places.\n\nOverall a must watch movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "I thoroughly enjoyed it. :) It will be visually stunning.. perhaps 1st time great use of CGI in Indian Cinema. I always wanted S. S. Rajamouli to get a flop so that his ego goes down remarkably. But now I think he deserves every bit of it. :p Pure Indian culture showing big palaces, elephants, horses.. Indian costumes, war plans, swords and weapons.. Totally a proud Indian film! Those war scenes will make you GOOSEBUMPS!! Jaw-dropping, VFX Spectacle is worth watching.. However, in case of story telling it has nothing to offer as it has a beaten to death revenge drama as its plot. Its not something extraordinary if you judge it by the story but the VFX work is really good specially The Battle Scene. Now, The VFX lacks details at some places and some scenes look very fake but it is amazing when you consider the budget ($40 mn.) You should watch it to see how far we have come. Also, SS Rajamouli took a big risk, we should at least pay him back. Because if this film doesn't make profit, no one in the future will take risks and we will have to watch the same crap that Bollywood has been producing for years now. Overall... It's a visual treat for us. Rajamouli explained us \"what is ostentation?\" and \"what is necessary?\" in film industry. Eagerly waiting for the next part.."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bahubali, directed by SS Rajamouli, is a big, sweeping epic that runs for close to 2 hours and 40 minutes. Spanning generations, going back and forth between the present and the past, alternating between vastly contrasting landscapes, it's an ambitious work from a visionary filmmaker who skillfully blends a tale of old school palace politics with modern VFX to deliver a consistently watchable blockbuster.\n\nSmuggled out of the kingdom of Mahishmati as a baby and raised by tribals in a village located at the foot of a waterfall, Shiva (Telugu star Prabhas) is the Bahubali of the film's title, a human with god-like strength and valor. After repeated attempts to scale the mountains and climb up to the top of the waterfall, Shiva finally achieves his goal, only to encounter Avanthika (Tamannah), a female warrior and member of a rebel group.\n\nTheir frankly silly romantic track - in which he distracts her with a snake while tattooing her shoulder, or undresses her systematically while giving her a makeover - is the weakest link in the film, stretching out an already overlong first half. Avanthika leads Shiva to his destiny beyond the walls of Mahishmati, where despotic king Bhallal Dev (Rana Dagubatti) is installing a 50-foot gold statue of himself.\n\nRajamouli gives us a terrific interval point, and the film moves briskly in its second half, when it goes into flashback mode to reveal a familiar story of family conflict within the royal household, and Shiva's true identity. The piece de resistance of the film is a roughly 30-minute war sequence achieved through a combination of special effects and thrilling in-camera shots. You're riveted by the action, and by the drama that unfolds on the battlefield, leading to an explosive finale. Prabhas and Rana, each flexing his tree trunk-sized biceps, puts up a great show.\n\nSave for a few unconvincing bits, including an escape from an oncoming avalanche that looks completely fake, the VFX in Bahubali are more sophisticated than what we've seen in most Indian films. Art director Sabu Cyril employs them niftily to give depth and scale to his magnificent sets, and cinematographer KK Senthil Kumar gives us beautiful vistas combining the real and the computer-generated more-or-less seamlessly.\n\nBut the film's secret sauce is Rajamouli's expert handling of the simple but dependable screenplay, his ability to whip up rousing moments, and his skill at mining emotions from even clich\u00e9d scenarios. He is aided by an impressive cast who're at the top of their game, including Ramya Krishna as just queen Sivagami, and Sathyaraj as Katappa, loyal senapati of Mahishmati. Rana Dagubatti has a strong presence, and invokes fear by simply bulging those eyes. Prabhas lets his hulking physicality do the bulk of work for him, but brings much by way of performance through his sheer intensity.\n\nFrom the tropical landscapes of Avatar and the bloody battles of The Lord of The Rings films, to the images from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana that it evokes, Rajamouli's film hat-tips to its various influences without ever stealing from any. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Bahubali given that I watched a Hindi dubbed version of the original Telugu film. Rajamouli is indeed a visual storyteller, and he brings the curtains down on this first part of his two-film saga with a curious cliffhanger. I can't wait for Part 2, which comes next year.\n\nI'm going with four out of five for Bahubali. It's exactly what a blockbuster should be. Hugely entertaining, without ever being dumb."

One may not like something but one need not insult the hardwork of this team by using \"off-the-necessary\" words while writing critical opinions..I don't know if this matches Hollywood standards,but by Indian standards this is \"Definitely HIGH\" !!"

        "review_title": "A visually gratifying, yet flawed film",
        "review_detailed_main": "SS Rajamouli's Baahubali is a visually stunning, yet flawed movie. The plot does not need to be revealed as many posters have previously done so, but meanders between interesting and unsatisfactory. While it does a decent job of fleshing out the characters, there is too much Telugu hero bravado and not much credible acting from the leads. The scenes where Shivudu and Avantika meet and fall in love and then he takes over her mission did not make sense and was probably meant for the masses rather for those who want a credible storyline. They should have left out the romantic scenes as they constrict the narrative.\n\nAll the credit should and will go to Rajamouli and the VFX team for their three year hard and tireless work to make this a presentable picture. They will certainly reap the necessary awards. However some scenes looked fake (Avalanche, bull fight) and claiming that they were under budget constraints is not an excuse. There were too many high flying stunts that constrain the movie and as mentioned before are only there to show the heroism of the males and nothing more. The battle scenes do make up for some of the missteps though inspired from LOTR and 300. I hope the team fixes these problems mentioned here and by other posters either from their reviews or forum posts in the second film. It looks like they're moving on the right path in terms of visual effects, but they still have a long way to go.\n\nActing wise, it is the supporting cast of a powerful Ramya Krishna, Nassar (though made as a caricature in some scenes) and Satyaraj who perform the best with the latter stealing the show as a Bhishma type warrior conflicted by his duty to the kingdom and doing the right thing. Prabhas has definitely worked hard on his muscular look, but acts like any Tollywood hero would which is not so great, although he does a good job as the father. Rana is OK but made to be too evil and I would have liked to have seen more depth in his characterization. Tamannah has a decent role and like Prabhas gets to flex her muscles in some action scenes but the change in her character when she gets tempted to fall in love with his character is baffling. Rajamouli, please do not use her as eye candy only! Anushka has a smaller, yet unglamorous and better role though her lines are a bit tacky. I hope she has a stronger and more impactive part in the second film. The rest of the cast which include Rohini, Sudeep and Tanikella Bharani are passable.\n\nOverall, it may be a step in the right direction and is definitely better than the nonsense produced today but it is simply a movie to watch only once. We all know many fans are eager for the conclusion, but may not be able to fathom the one year gap. But I hope this one year wait will give Rajamouli and his team the time to fix the flaws, tighten up the script, stop with the hero worshiping, improve the visuals where they don't look fake and finally present a final product that can stand the test of time like a Sholay. All the best to them.\n\nWatch solely for the visuals and Satyaraj's performance.\n\n6.5/10\n\nPS. What on earth was that language by the Kalakeya tribe? Was it inspired by \"The Gods must be Crazy\"? Did they invent a new language? If so, it was childish and hilarious for the wrong reasons."

Baahubali somehow manages to avoid all these to prove itself to be a class act.\n\nThe visuals are super stunning throughout, though supplemented by CGI (computer graphics imagery). The action is spot-on and is one of the prime forces that make baahubali such an epic. Baahubali is aided by great acting and an intriguing story that keeps you interested till the end.\n\nBaahubali goes from showing off its graphics in the 1st half, to more story and killer action in the 2nd. The movie keeps you interested enough for the 2nd part (i.e pisses you off and leaves you hanging with a twist at the end)\n\nVerdict: Baahubali avoids being a victim of its own un-real hype, and is a masterpiece of Indian cinema. Baahubali is superb in all aspects and made for all kinds of moviegoers."

It accomplishes great storytelling, outstanding sensory reinforcement from special effects, music, photography, ambiance and editing, strong acting while retaining quite a bit of the classical aspects of Indian movies to set it apart from global movies. I am talking about it being a musical, which is utilized deliciously to symbolize critical elements of the epic such as the ethereal summoning of the true king in inadvertent exile, the wild spirit of Bahubali, the daredevil feel of the ghetto etc. There are some elements that did not bode well, some come from exaggerated special effects, some reeking of scenes exuding patriarchal insensitivity towards women. But, these are overshadowed by the masterful and imaginative manner of bringing the characters and each moment to palpable vibrance."

        "review_detailed_main": "First half - Not to be critical but the films needs more originality. The story has greater potential for exploring the subject using innovative techniques. The initial half hour where the lead actress tries to follow the hero is greatly inspired by avatar. The fish healing the wounds, the congregation setting also are inspired by avatar. Nolan also greatly helped Rajamouli- the Avalanche scene with same camera angles are present in inception , the hero trying to grab the tree balk mirrors Christian bale escaping an underground prison in the dark knight rises. The background score is way above the average Telugu film but is also hugely relies on the Hollywood orchestras( thanks to James Horner). I really appreciate the fact that a lot has been tried.\n\nSecond half - Shades Loki and Thor can be seen in our heroes. Rajamouli used this concept in chatrapati but only this time the bad roles is reprised by raana. It felt awesome the way the war strategy is put forward but it all fell apart when it came to execution. It fascinated me how the mother of two could listen and also observe the facial details of her kids who are fighting miles apart. The standard motivational speech that helped the protagonist gain more soldier and win is pure clich\u00e9. The orcs/dorthraki lookalikes did a better job at acting that some of the other characters.\n\nTechnical department The camera work could have been a lot better. The slow motion camera is not used at all, even if it was used the frames do not give you a pleasing effect. The CGI shots are odd, making the scenes look like the quality dipped( like from 720p to 240p).\n\nActing Rana, prabhas, Ramya krishna did a great job. I found it really frustrating when the important characters in the film cannot lip sync.\n\nOverall, the standards of Tollywood films is now raised minus the standard out of the place item songs."

The story, although, in this first part of a two part series, is not very special (in fact, it drags along in some parts) but nevertheless the action is explosive and CGI is good and the story is coherent enough to make us not lose track of the plot and characters. With a good amount of running time, the movie makes sure the important characters are fleshed out properly.\n\nAnd the half hour long battle scene at the end is what makes the movie what it is. Carried out on an epic scale with thousand of crew members with and a lot of acres of land, the director spared no expenses to lay down his vision on screen.\n\nAnd though I knew it was a 2 parter, but I was surprised by the cliffhanger ending.\n\nA movie like this doesn't come often in Indian cinema, so the people missing it are missing out on a lot.\n\nCan't wait for the The Conclusion.

I must appreciate Prabhas for his dedication and transformation he had undergone to suit for the dual roles he played in the movie. He was good at action scenes but I felt still his dialogue delivery has to be improved(could be due to pathetic dialogs).Prabhas as Bahubali brings alive his character in an innocent manner and with his charismatic energy.Rana is the perfect choice for this role with his demonic expressions and body language. Ramya Krishna simply the best in the movie.I would say Baahubali is not only a feast for hungry Prabhas fans, its a film for every TFI fan.\n\nFor those who haven't watched it yet, no matter how big your expectations are,bahubali reaches it.\n\nFor the moment, kudos to Rajmouli for producing a well made fantasy and set benchmark in the field of visual effects in Indian cinema.

The movie has crossed 1.6 Billion in 3 days alone worldwide and even foreign media is all praises for the movie. Excellent work by Rajamouli for giving yet another block buster. The god of all movies yet. Just can't stop praising this work, absolutely beautiful. The storyline and director's imagination, hat's off. Beautiful acting by everyone, including the supporting roles. I could watch this movie for more than 10 times. Dubbing into Hindi language was good as well. Perfect lip syncing unlike many others done in Bollywood.\n\nMust must must watch!"

The most expensive Indian film turns out to be a visual treat with extraordinary vfx and breathtaking camera-work. The snow-clad mountains, beautiful waterfalls and stark battleground were really praiseworthy. Among the performances all were good but Prabhas and Rana Daggubati stands out. Prabhas as Shiva is exceptional as the lead, hulking yet charming. Rana Daggubati as Bhalladeva is perfectly cast as the villain, his performance layered with subtlety and nuance. But the film belongs to one man, Rajamouli. He skilfully combines the crucial characters and their distinct motivations, adds awesome CGI to it and takes us on a 160 mins adventurous journey of love, hatred and war. Overall Bahubali is EPIC and a sure shot Blockbuster. The first part finishes on such a curious note that you wish the next part releases this year only."

Prabhas with such a dynamic personality along with Rana makes you feel like real competitors for their performance. Rajamouli's creation of the set gives you the great feel for the later part of the movie. Tamannah and with a little cameo appearance as a heroin for the first part did well with her energy. MM keeravani sir background music is the Biggest advantage for the movie. Nasser,Satyaraj and Ramyakrishna with their getup's were really extraordinary. Making of the movie at the ice mountains and the war field was incredible experience on the screen. This kind of visual effects will never experienced in any of the Indian cinemas so far. Must watch for all the audience and cinema lovers of India for the ultimate result like Bahubali. Climax scene of the movie is highly appreciated thing for the way they controlled so many people in the shooting period. Overall rating deserves 10 for its making and performance by the artists. Telugu movie standards now reached to another level."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie took 3 years to get completed and it definitely needs a long review. But will try my best to give it in a nut shell. I have been little late for this movie and got lots of reviews among which majority was like a boring first half , average second half and a epic climax but here i say without hurting anybody's feelings that i am completely against them. My view of this movie is quite different and as follows.\n\nSTORY & SCRIPT: I am sorry to say but even when i am typing this review only 2 things keep wavering in my mind about the story. I personally feel the story is not original but inspired from Mahabharata and Game of Thrones.I even felt the characters are inspired by the mentioned epics ( BhallalaDeva, KalaKeya, Kattappa, BijjalaDeva). Few Weapons are exact replicas from video games. But Mahabharata even inspired lives why cant it inspire a movie so its definitely not a flaw. 3/5 CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATIONS : Definitely inspired from the above said epics but the characters were perfectly cast down. Enacting was good by all the actors but i cant say its perfect. 3/5 CGI, GRAPHICS, PRODUCTION VALUES: The movie was a real Grandeur to watch and every penny spent has been seen on the silver screen. The kingdom of Mahismathi really lifts the value of Telugu cinema to the world. There were few glitches but 75% of all the graphic works were very realistic. 4/5 MUSIC: Was really a major drawback for the movie. BGM was good only at few places. 2/5 DIRECTION: Rajamouli has proved himself once again that he is a perfect commercial movie maker which can break the records. He laid a platform in the first half and if u really connect to the movie not even a single frame is boring. As a personal view i felt the whole movie was a platform for what we are going to experience in the Sequel . As many say the ending is not at all abrupt its a perfect directorial talent to create enthusiasm for the next .3.5/5 VERDICT : I enjoyed the movie watching its grand presentation ,,, But did i #LiveTheEpic ???---- Definitely NO. 3.5/5"

Still I am writing some lines for this.\n\n\"THIS MOVIE IS EPIC\" - Hollywood beware\n\nFirstly I would request whoever is reading this review that don't watch this movie by downloading it on your Laptops or PCs. This movie is made to pay every worth your money in Audi and theaters. So please for the sake of this movie go and watch with cinematic effects in cinema halls.\n\nNow coming to the movie. I don't want to compare any movie like 300 or Troy or Magadheera which I think is of same standard to this one. And please don't compare some movies which were made 6-7 years ago with this one. The standards and quality of visuals have risen to great extent in these years.\n\nBAAHUBALI is made in two parts {BAAHUBALI - THE BEGINNING and BAAHUBALI - THE CONCLUSION}\n\nBAAHUBALI - THE BEGINNING starts with the birth of Baahubali in which the lady tries to save the child. The child then went into the hands of some Kabeelewale (early age people) and the story of Baahubali began.\n\nThe start of the movie consists of enough visuals which is enough to describe this movie well.\n\nThe main phase of the movie starts from the section where Prabhas (Baahubali) starts chasing Tamanna Bhatia near the Waterfall.\n\nThe main effects and visuals came on the later half of the movie where Baahubali came to know about his real father, mother and his empire through a story where Baahubali was chosen as the King of the empire.\n\nThe 45minutes \"WAR\" in the end of the movie is Super-Fantabulous.\n\nThe rest will follow in the second and the last part of the movie i.e. BAAHUBALI - THE CONCLUSION.\n\nTo be Honest - IF THIS IS EPIC I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE 2ND PART COZ ACCORDING TO ME THE MAIN PARTS OF THE MOVIE ARE REMAINING WHERE BAAHUBALI(Prabhas) WILL FIGHT WITH BHALLALA DEV(Rana Daggubati).\n\n10/10 from my side....it even deserves 11 or 12 but I can give only this much\n\nWAITING FOR THE SECOND PART TO COME.....TILL THEN BITING MY NAILS"

The characters were developed with much care and actors have executed their directors vision excellently; although Prabhas did not seem convincing for some parts during the first half.

I liked the character of Kattapa most. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj does 100% justice to it. I will be watching the movie at least one more time. Hope y'all enjoy it."

Some of sky shots of Mahismathi kingdom are great. First 20 to 30 minutes is enough to understand the dedication and effort of Baahubali team.\n\nThis movie contains every thing needed by all type of Viewers, It has Emotion, Love, Action, Adventure and many more. Performance of actors is perfect to their roles especially Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati), Kattappa (Satyaraj) and Baahubhali or Sivudu (Prabhas).\n\nBaahubali - The Beginning movie contains unique story and emotion, it is not copy of Hollywood movies 300, Prince of Persia, Hercules, Troy or other movies.\n\nI feel there need to be little more effort in flow of the story and background music.\n\nWatch the movie and enjoy don't compare with another movies because the entire story is collection of two parts, this is the first part i.e The Beginning means only beginning and the second part i.e The Conclusion means the end that is going to be greater than this part. This scenario is common in any movie which was released in different parts (Ex: Lord of the Rings)."

The visuals are outstanding. The war sequence will surely give u goose bumps. The whole movie was a visual feast and every frame was a portrait. There may be a lag of 5-10 min in the whole film including the item song in the second half. The performances of artists are descent except Tamanna, as i felt that she didn't fit in her role.Production values are lavish. The BGM will remind you the work of Hans Zimmer and James Horner. Keeravani triggered the movie to next level by his BGM.\n\nAction sequences are well executed and SSR banged the silver screen again,his hard work and passion towards this movie can be seen in every scene.\n\nFinal Verdict: Go and live the EPIC"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was eagerly waiting for this flick after watching beautiful waterfall sequences in trailer but unfortunately it was not up to the expectations. I tried not to sleep during movie.\n\nStory has all elements required for epic war saga, be it ruthless king, jealousy, struggle, conflicts between 2 brothers for kingdom, betrayal, back stabbing by devoted army general. What it lacks is execution of story. Writer and director have failed to develop interesting screenplay with all above elements. Film maker have heavily relied on CGI and cinematography rather than content.\n\nInspired by Mahabharata, it is dynastic struggle for the throne of Kingdom. Bahubali and Bhallaldeva are cousins in race to be King of Mahishpati Kingdom. Conflict become serious between cousins when Bahubali is declared as King by Sivagami ( Grandmother of Bahubali and Bhalladeva ). Humiliated by Sivagami's decision, Bhalladeva and his father Bijjaladeva plot conspiracy and kills Bahubali ( At least that is what can be concluded from first part of the movie ). Subsequently Sivagami had to flee in exile with Bahubali's son to save his life. Unfortunately she dies in river and Bahubali's son Sivudu is raised by tribal located beneath humongous waterfalls. Sivudu came across another tribal girl Avanthika while exploring unknown place beyond waterfall and mountains. Avanthika's tribe also have conflict with Mahishpati Kingdom now ruled by Bhallaldeva. Sivudu agrees to be part of his lady love's battle. He is unaware of the fact that he has looks of his father Bahubali and he met Kattapa, devoted faithful army general of Mahishpati Kingdom. Kattapa recognize his king's son and Story of Bahubali and his death is unfolded by Kattapa to Sivudu. There we see surprising twist in story as Kattapa confesses that he had killed his father Bahubali. First part of Bahubali - The beginning ends here. The final conclusion will be in second part which seems to be more interesting as it is unclear why devoted army general kills his king.\n\nAs mentioned earlier movie's plus points are high quality graphic and lavish production values. We must appreciate hard work put across to shoot Waterfall and war sequences. Waterfall shots are beautiful and eye candy. War scenes are par excellence and can be easily compare with any Hollywood movie. Except 2-3 scenes inspired from Hollywood movies like Indiana Jones, 300 and Lord of the ring, rest all battle scenes are original and visually impressive. Great work by cinematographer Senthil Kumar, Production design by Sabu Cyril and action director.\n\nScreenplay is not up to the mark. In fact some of the scenes are laughable especially romantic sequence. At least while pouring hell lot of money in such grand movie, one should avoid showing lead characters in funny manner. Typical South Indian hero and heroin material have ruined flow of movie. Can we expect our directors to avoid showing dancing hero heroin and item song, at least in war drama. It really annoys to see item song and dance in this type of movie. Development of characters in proper manner is missing. Many unnecessary scenes could have been edited.\n\nPrabhas and Tamannah have tried to deliver their best, so does rest of the cast. None of them praise worthy though. Prabhas had opportunity to play double role of father and son. He should have used it while showing change at least in body language or look or expression in both characters. We see same Prabhas in Bahubali and Sivudu. Tamannah, well she did exactly what director have expected her to do. Ramya and Nasser who are senior most actors have done their work properly.\n\nOverall this movie is excellent as far as look is concerned. But could have been better considering impressive story line."

PRABHAS never before had expressed the emotions as he conveyed in this war drama. Never to forget the MACHO MAN RANA who portrayed his character quite well(when he fights the bull and when he expresses his envy with his brother).RAJAMOULI, if i have to say,i would say the creator of his dreams,gave an example that he can direct the epic war of KURUKSHETRA.He took care of every frame when he expresses the emotions of characters and when he made the world of MAHISMATHI with perfection. Special mention to be given to KEERAVANI garu who lifted the movie an inch further with his situational and soothing music. Then comes the art direction,in one word SABU SIRIL proved his worth. The characters of KATAPPA portrayed by SATYARAJ,the humbled and dedicated and tamanna with her beauty balanced the seriousness with a bit of romance with PRABHAS. Anushka in her limits gave her best but she must be given credit for the courage to portray this role. Kalakeya and his troops are ferocious. RAJAMOULI, acts like a teacher in giving every minute character,its due importance. CG,It suits the sequences. SENTHIL should be given a hatsoff for his cinematography. THE SCREENPLAY and anxiety through twists will lead u to wait sadly for one year for BAHUBALI-II THE ********.ACTION ENGINEER PETER HEINS PRINTED HIS MARK IN THE MOVIE. NEGATIVES: some unique stunts gives u a hiccup.Steady first half with no major fights makes u to divert ur attention. POSITIVES:SECOND HALF having every scene a worth mention. RAMYA KRISHNA,THE one and only who can live in that character. WAR sequences,where you will feel the novelty(expect the one that the soldiers acts as a shield as in 300). UNIQUE and ULTIMATE war sequences with perfection even in the kalakeya as well as war language. The interval bang makes you to involve in the story with RANA'S huge statue and the scenes there will tell u how much rajamouli cares for perfection. last to say,BAAHUBALI- THE CREATOR'S VISION,CHARACTERS' DEDICATION AND A LEAP TOWARDS THE USE OF CG."

        "review_title": "SS Rajamouli's Magnum Opus Bahubali is an epic of fighting for the throne",
        "review_detailed_main": "S.S Rajamouli's (SSR) magnum opus \"Bahubali:The beginning\" was the most touted movie of this year. So the wait was finally over and it was released worldwide on July 10th .\n\nBahubali is an epic movie with a not so new plot. Story of two hunky cousins Bahubali (essayed by Prabhas) and Palvaaldevan (essayed by Rana) fighting for a kingdom named \"Magizhmathi\". They grow up with similar traits, so Sivagami (essayed by Ramya Krishnan) decides to crown the one who will be found as the noblest, wittiest, strongest, wisest, and mightiest at the end of a major war against one of the strong kingdom led by a beasty king.\n\nNow that's the plot which can be easily compared to any historical epic like Mahabaratham. So let's see how the great visions of SSR have come out.\n\nTechnicalities: The movie is definitely a huge production with its magnificent sets, promising VFX, thousands of junior artists, costumes, make-up, weapons. Though the project is touted to be the most expensive motion picture in the history of Indian cinema it had places in the first half where it was over dosed with CG and VFX making it looking like animation picture rather motion picture. Sabu Cyril as the art designer has really put a huge effort to bring out SSR's vision. Cinematography by KK Senthikumar has definitely elevated us to the historical feel. Dialogues in Tamil version seem well penned by the lyricist Karky. Hats off to the CG team for taking Indian cinema to the next level in VFX. Music by Keeravani has worked well in BGM rather on songs. Kudos to the team (Technical) behind Bahubali.\n\nPerformances: With an ensemble cast Bahubali definitely scores well in the casting department. Note worthy performances delivered by three legendary actors (Ramya Krishnan, Sathy Raj, Nasser) in south Indian cinema. Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami fitted picture perfect to the role with her voice, walk and attitude. Sathyraj as Kattapa the sincere chief brigade of battalion has lived the role. Nasser as Pingala Devan a notorious villain inside the royal family has done 100% justice to the role. These three people are the supporting pillars for the movie. Coming to the leads Prabhas as the Bahubali/ Shivu and Rana as Palvaal Devan has put lots of effort to essay their massive historical characters. Rana seemed more convincing in the first half and Prabhas in the second half. Uff what a tie. Anushka as Devasena the heroine known for her epic performances is least seen in this first part as we would see her more in action in the second half (sorry Anushka fans). Tammanah Bhatia as Avantika a girl with a mission was found less fitting the role though she tries to pull it off hardly.\n\nWhat is on the Downside for the movie: With all respect for the hard work by the team almost 2 years in production I found some minus that makes us feel still Indian cinema seeking commercial values. One unnecessary item song, OK some may argue it was a culture of looters to dance and drink if so where these beautiful girls of Brazilian, Moroccan, British origin did came from. Secondly a typical retro type romance song between the leads which was truly boring. Third CG/VFX overdose during the first half which seemed more fantasy indulgence.\n\nVerdict: A worthy epic movie not to be missed for its magnificence, breath taking visuals and an amazing epic story filled with rivalry, betrayal, rebellion, Prince, kingdom politics, fight for position, war, weapons.\n\nI would easily rate 4 on a 5 scale. SSR has set the bar high so expecting a stunning second part Bahubali: The conclusion."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I feel the whole team which had worked to make this movie must be appreciated. I feel they have achieved a magnificent product. It was really marvelous, if you for a moment forget that Hollywood ever existed. I would say, it's a proud attempt bye ace director SS Rajamouli and I am really amused by the way he could achieve it. Now Talking about the movie, I should say it was an brave attempt as the movie budget was so much more than any Indian movie till date, but apart from that I felt movie lacked few things in particular. The making of the movie (scenes) lacked consistency. I personally felt that few scenes were exemplary while other few scenes lacked the magic. It seemed like all the scenes were not directed by the same director. Secondly, the VFX and CGI were really well used but it's the same with those effects too. Few scenes were really well developed, and few scenes were not at all up to the mark. Third point I would like to make is, the fact that few scenes lacked logic, but these days it has become a common practice to ignore logic and just enjoy the movie, but it was surprising to me as the director SS Rajamouli, is not one of those directors who would miss logic. Fourth point I would like to mention is about the acting skills portrayed by the Actors and they were really well up to the standard, but I personally felt, actress \"Tamanna\" could have done better. Apart from that I felt all other actors did an exemplary work. Fifth point I would like to talk about is, Story. The story is quite normal and common and lot more predictable than what I expected. The movie seemed little slow before the interval but it picked up pace after it and to put it bluntly, the movie actually starts only after the interval. Sixth point I would like to mention is the music. I personally was very disappointed by the back ground scores and songs in the movie, as they lacked the spark to make the movie viewing feel easy, instead they seemed more like some normal tunes being played. For example, a very important and particular scene in the movie which had been well filmed would lack a similarly put back ground score. The other thing which was huge disappointment I felt was, repeated using of same back ground scores more than once. It made me wonder, why different tunes were not created when they had almost three years to make a movie. I strongly feel that music director for the sequel of this movie must be changed for greater good. The abrupt ending of the movie, was also something which kind of makes one wonder, if this was the real interval scene. Anyway what I really liked about the movie was the fact that it was made and it seemed more like a welcoming sign for Tollywood (Telugu Movie Industry). This movie has already proved that people irrespective of there languages in a country like India would love to watch such a flick when picturized carefully. Overall, the courageous attempt by director SS Rajamouli must be appreciated, it was a very daring step and I think he deserves a lot of credit for this movie. I felt it lacked fee elements but I did enjoy the movie. A very Indian movie, making such a huge attempt is something which made me feel proud.\n\nP.S: Watch it as an Indian movie without comparing it to Hollywood movies because only then you can really enjoy it, but once you start to dig deep you would find many similarities or influences from few Hollywood movies and that wouldn't really help and even though it's a biggest Indian movie, not all scenes would please you, especially VFX and CGI."

        "review_detailed_main": "S.S. Rajamauli is one of the finest director from the south. And I think this movie is the finest film from the south I've ever scene. The characterization, the concept, the storyline, sets, costumes, effects, entertaining value - these all are the major plus points of the epic movie Bahubali. Every single person I've met before the movie in the mall, was saying just one word 'Jordar'. As the film starts, I completely attached with the film. Every single illogical moment was becoming touchy. Though, I couldn't control myself in every songs, I was just laughing as those were the dubbed songs. In the film, three times the name Bahubali has been displayed, and every time I was like Woooh! Every single viewer has surely got a surprise kick in the end. Katappa is my favorite character. And I'm totally surprised in the end with the great curiosity as the part two will come with many answers which were untold in this part. Eagerly waiting for the second part. The main drawback of this movie is its romantic track. These are the parts where the Gujarati viewers may feel sleepy. But, the last 30 minutes war sequence is the biggest plus point. You will surely find some noise out there while Rana's chariot comes to the screen. I am still stuck in the film, as I can't describe here much. Forget about acting, direction and other technical aspects, the daring of the makers to make this movie on a very very big scale, and releasing in two parts, with the budget of 250cr, is the biggest risk. And I salute every person who is a part of it, especially Rajamauli. In future, people may recall and say that I've watched Bahubali in theater. And this sentence will make the viewer proud. Those who are skipping this, I call them mental, because in 2016, they will go for Bahubali 2 and as they don't understand it, then they will download the first part to watch. This is going to be happen, I'm 100% sure. This is real Chutzpah! I request you all to go to watch this in theater. This film is earning very good amount. And as the popularity among the viewers increases day by day, I'm worried. I'm thinking of the future, when the part two will release. What will happen then at the Box-Office! If you want one movie in your list that make you proud after watching, then just close your eyes, take deep breathe and go for it!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bahubali is a comic book story based on life and times of the King Amarendra Bahubali during 9th century AD in India. The comic book story is made into a movie by Rajamouli over the period of 3 years. The attention to details in the movie is great. In the first few minutes of the movie, I was completely into it. But the last war scene is what I was completely engaged.\n\nThe technical standards interms of screenplay, editing, background score are on par with any Hollywood movie. This movie can easily be compared with the movies like Gladiator, Spartacus, 300, Ben-Hur.\n\nI must mention the brilliant score given by Keeravani without which the movie would not feel how it is supposed to. I was thinking A.R. Rahman would have been the ideal choice for this movie but after watching the movie, I thought I was wrong. Keeravani is the ideal choice as he can only work closely with the director Rajamouli and spent a lot of time discussing the themes of music for each character & each situation.\n\nActing wise Prabhas and Rana has done very good job. Anushka appeals in a deglamorized role though she would appear in it's sequel as glamarized role as Thamanna is impressive in both glamarized as well as deglamarized roles at the same time in this part of the move. Director Ramamouli has done a fantastic job in translating the story to screen both realistically and grandly. The use of CGI are very apt.\n\nMainly, it's the preproduction work that took almost 1 year that mattered when it come to actual execution. The screenplay is written in such a way that the suspense is held in the first part and is going to be revealed in the second part. All in all the movie is an extrordinary experience.\n\nI would give 9 out of 10."

First half of the movie was OK, I think the intention was to make 'other' audience comfortable and the meat begins in the 2nd half of the movie. I felt the drive around climbing the mountain was weak and other than that didn't notice any issues. 2nd half - The war, characters, concept and action were all in the right mix. Even though it appears as if the movie has been inspired by other movies such as 300, Lord of the rings, Narnia etc. it comes with the right blend of Indian or Telugu characters and the related story.Another good choice or decision is to make this a sequel and I cannot wait to watch the part II of this movie. Good work by everyone on this movie."

Anushka had only a little part in the movie but he make up and acting gave me Goose Bumps in the theater ! Kattappa characterization was great and Prabhas , Rana gave their best to the roles , and were excellent ! There was about 40 min of war sequence in the movie which will make you stick to theater seats and entertain you thoroughly ! i read many reviews saying that the has ended abruptly but i personally feel that was great ending to the movie and will make the audience curious for the second part of the film that is Baahubali - The Conclusion ! On the whole it was a Visual wonder , but lacks content in it with a slow paced narration in the beginning but will surely thrill you in the second half with its visuals ! my final word on this movie is #LiveTheEpic !!!!!!\n\nRating - 4/5 ! This movie will definitely set new standards in Indian film making ! Thank you for reading my review! To describe the experience of watching Bahubali \u2013 It's not a visual wonder. It is a visual THUNDER!"

First part couldn't elevate completely all the characters wee, as the director wants them to reveal in the 2nd part. India story narrated in a word class manner. Couldn't wait for the second part. Background score by MM Keernavani is best at key situations, could be better for overall movie. Initially i was not convinced by the movie first time when i watched, later i watched this grand epic movie in Imax screen and felt the real grandness of the movie, entire cast and crew has done a good job to the person this movie to entire world."

Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it.\n\nEach and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2.\n\nHighly Recommended. Make an effort to watch it on the big screen."

I have just shared some opinions of my own and some facts!\n\nIn 1 word if someone ask me how was the movie then i will say \"EPIC\" and actually the fact is only this word suits it Best. This film has all the materials to be one of the best movie ever made in Indian Cinema! From Direction to Acting, Action to Visual Effects all were just marvelous. You can't even rest for a single moment. I even had goosebumps and shivering on some scenes! If i am not so wrong then Lead Actor \"Prabhas\" & Director \"S.S.Rajamouli\" will be treated as Legend after this Duo-logy(the last part will be out on July,2016). All the Characters were perfectly matched to their respective roles. \"Anushka\" was really an exceptional in a De-glam role as we have always seen her in Glamorous role. All the Action Sequence were perfectly co- ordinated. Direction was perfect, sequential and flawless! And finally the exceptional and spell-bounding Visual- Effects show throughout the movie. Actually the film is an example that finally Indian Cinema has learned how to present a perfect flawless Visual-Effect show. The only thing i disliked about the film(i would rather say its a fault) is \"Why the hell it was not shot in 3D???\" If it was shot in 3D in IMAX format cameras then it could have been another Masterpiece(even then i would actually compare it with some of the Hollywood Films!) Hope the Second Part will be in 3D(fingers crossed). Go, watch it in Movie Hall not in pirated DVD or torrent format. Coz if you don't watch it in 2K or 4K screens, you will miss the real thing of this film!"

Bahubali: The Beginning indeed succeeded tremendously at the box-office despite having a weak and predictable story line and some disappointing screenplay. I started with a negative note as I myself am disappointed with SS.Rajamouli, who's previous movie Eega was such an entertaining flick, he really failed in all the aspects of film making he is usually good at.\n\nBahubali doesn't have enough drama and emotions that would keep you on the edge of your seat. That said, it does manage to grab your attention with some good VFX and some scenes are a visual delight.Some parts could have been cut short like the Item song and the chase in the snow and a VFXed avalanche. That was quite unnecessary.\n\nThe acting could have been better keeping in mind that the actors were reserved for the film for almost three years. Prabhas did a fair job as both Sivudu and Bahubali. Rana should have mastered his accent a bit and Tamanna should have been replaced. She is pathetic as a Rebel(or a soldier).Ramya Krishna steals the show with her dominant performance.Satyaraj is convincing as Kattappa and Nasser is wasted.\n\nBackground score is distracting and the worst from MM.Kiravani till date.None of the songs are memorable.\n\nThe movie could have been extended to 3hrs and ended properly instead of telling the audience to come back in 2016.Comparing this movie to 300,Troy or LOTR would be foolish. 300 made with about $60 million is far far ahead of Bahubali not only in VFX but also on the screenplay and story departments.\n\nSumming it all up, its a costly movie but not an exceptional piece. The team showed a lot of potential but could't really put it together well.Hope the 2016 conclusion (Sounds ridiculous) would be better. 6/10"

And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the ultimate camera work (VFX effects),actors,background score and music, the acting and the story, it all took me by surprise. It is today that I can claim I have seen one of the best movies or can get see rest of my life. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than Baahubali. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film for three and half years and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage.This is outcome of immanence penance of each technician. So Rajamouli and Baahubali team, thank you for this marvelous creation, I will for sure want to see part two at earliest possible. To this Spectacular work I still am anxious to see the movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes action,Love,Epic,war,beauty of nature, best of crew and many more in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."

Though it has little bit poor graphics in some scenes which will lasts only for 2- 3 seconds, but still it deserves 10 rating. very impressed with the war scene, it was choreographed too good. Kudos to your direction sir. Eagerly waiting for Bahubali Conclusion. Hope next time he will take care of graphics in each and every frame. All the best to Bahubali team. Drawbacks in Movie : Tamannah didn't suits to that role. She is really looking very horrible in that role. Except in one song. JAI MAHISMATI. JAI BAHUBALI. A big bow for entire team and specially for Raja Mouli sir."

I didn't realize when and how 3 hours passed by. Such a great movie. Proud to be a part of the century this movie has been released. Every character has played their role perfectly. Every set has been made to appear realistic. After watching the movie, I am really Surprised to read negative reviews about this movie. If not for the story, If not for action, this movie can be happily watched for the giant sets and great visual effects. Mind blowing! I am awestruck really! Hats off to the cast and crew and director specially!! Jai Mahishmati!"

Those who know will have pleasure watching this Indian version. Part 1 of this franchise is honest payback for the money you are going to pay or paid at the box office. First the Director who is the real hero to be thanked for giving us such experience. Next all the actors understood really well what they have to do and did what needed to define their role in the movie. Most prominent of them was Ramya Krishnan. I have never seen such intense delivery. Prabhas was good as usual, AnushkaShetty is saved for Part 2 (Yeah there is a Part 2 next year in June or July). Taamanaah on the other hand did nice for a change as she is an over actor. Rana Dagubati is ruthless villain, you''l hate him from the moment you see him. Overall it is great visual experience with neat effects and gripping screenplay. Worth watching paisa vasool. If possible I will go again and waiting eagerly for the conclusion of this epic tale."

The movie completely stands out from the rest cause first of, you can understand every single word thanks to the English subtitles.\n\nThe first half isn't too captivating. It is long, dreary and boring especially with the lack of complete chemistry between Prabhas and Tamana. The second half blows your mind. It is invigorating and captivating and the C.G.I scenes are extraordinary.\n\nThe climax is brilliant and you have no idea what hits you when the movie ends.\n\nFrom an acting stand point, Prabhas and Rana were amazing (Rana looks extremely hot by the way). Ramya Krishnan, duh, can she do anything wrong? Now, what really surprised me was Tamana. Having always seen her in a girly role, I was pleasantly surprised by the kind of ferocity she brought into the movie as a warrior (please ignore her sloppy running). The only thing that saddened me perhaps was the fact that her incredibly fierce role as a warrior hardly lasts as Prabha takes over very soon."

        "review_detailed_main": "The buzz forced me to watch it. And boy, was I enthralled.\n\nAtheists must skedaddle, for this epic war drama takes references from Indian mythological history, which means some sequences will be specious for those thinking minds to bear.\n\nA queen who is on her way to embrace death uses her supernatural powers to hand over an infant to a tribe habituating under a gigantic waterfall's catchment. This child whose destiny has some relation with what lies beyond the waterfall is the protagonist of the story whose crux lies in that beautiful thing majority of the filmmakers around the world love and majority of the audience around the world hate: clich\u00e9. So to speak, the plot where this kid grows to become a hunky man (Prabhas) who explores his background history and gets absorbed into a period world of power, war, and betrayal is purely basic on a pH scale. Of course, the God-like story makes only half sense. And it is up to the viewers to carry out the process of making the other half sensible.\n\nIt is apparent that telling a new story was never the intention of the makers. They use a tried-and-tested theory to showcase what they can do with the technical aspects. From the entrancing score to the monumental designs to the artsy CGI - everything works greatly in the film, entertaining its audience who feel feeble in front of the lively yet beastly characters. Although, there are instances where there was no blend between the CGI and the setup.\n\nThe mammoth setup and its design is the highlight of the film which demands total attention. Even though the film is long enough for the naysayers to rant about, there won't be any instance when one will feel bored with the events. The score itself is enough to hold you captive. The battle sequences and warfare are so good that anyone who has watched the TV series Game of Thrones (2011) will definitely be able to relate. So much for the epicness, I could even sense few sequences inspired from the series. Performances are better if you compare the actors' previous performances in other films. The blink-and-you-miss love story adds romance to the otherwise tense plot.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The first part of Bahubali is an extravagant feast for the dim Indian eyes which sets the bar high for future epic war dramas, if one is ready to ignore the loads of scenes that defy logic or science or both, ironically on a massive scale.\n\nVERDICT: 6 stars out of 10. Watch it for the goosebumps.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

But this July, man I was proved wrong, not once but twice, in a single weekend. Saw the Hindi dubbed version of Baahubali - The Beginning & Bajrangi Bhaijaan back to back and I am still not able to decide which one of these could I call the greatest creation of the box-office-centric Indian commercial cinema industry. Both the movies deliver on both aspects, quality and masaala. Both the filmmakers have proved that a movie can be a huge box-office success without senseless stunts and unnecessary romance. In simple words, all I can say is that please do not miss watching any of these two movies on the big screen, the way they were made to be watched."

        "review_title": "A daringly brave, never before kind of Herculean triumph achieved in Indian filmmaking by the gifted director that also lacks entertainment to be honest.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Since you must have already read many well written reviews, praising the gigantic, never before kind of amazing effort made in Indian cinema all over the media, here is a different take on the subject that might become an eye opener for many changing their individual viewpoints about our rich regional cinema ignored since ages.\n\nBeginning with a reality check, its simply great that BAHUBALI has released with such huge publicity campaign supported by Hindi film industry's key representative Karan Johar in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi simultaneously in about 4000 screens in the country and widely in overseas too. And I am personally feeling charged to see this all, not because of the 250 crores spent on it with a definite vision or the CGI triumph achieved equivalent to the Hollywood standards, but because of the one man behind the epic, S. S. Rajamouli thankfully getting introduced to our Hindi film audience with a big bang giving him the long deserving recognition as an Indian film-maker and not only a Telugu director.\n\nSo (though he might have ventured in just for his monetary reasons) I am thankful to Karan Johar for releasing this film exactly like a big Hindi project making it reach a wider 'ignorant' audience of our country, introducing them to one of the Top 5 directors of our Indian cinema at this moment, a name they might be hearing for the first time due to their own misconceptions.\n\nComing to BAHUBALI as a film, it needs to be seen (strictly) on the big screen at the earliest to believe the unbelievable achieved by its exceptionally talented team as a collective effort. As a matter of fact no amount of words can explain the gargantuan product delivered by the visionary S. S Rajamouli along with his impressive performers. But if you insist on knowing the words, then it's a mesmerizing epic of 2 hours and 40 minutes that uses the silver screen as its magical canvas throwing amazing visuals one after another like never seen before in our Indian films. Ambitiously conceived by the path breaking filmmaker revolving around a traditional theme, BAHUBALI beautifully utilizes the modern VFX technology generating a larger than life impact on the screen with an incredible scale and grandeur.\n\nIt's mind-boggling visuals of a massive waterfall, the out of the ordinary ancient empire, the 50 feet tall golden statue, the angry bull, the scary snow-storm and an almost 30 minutes long completely captivating, stunningly executed war-sequence in the end with outstanding background score and so detailed sound designing simply forces you to think that, 'How the hell they managed to do it like this in India?\"\n\nThe spectacularly designed world of BAHUBALI is full of many magical moments brilliantly executed on the silver screen by Rajamouli along with his Art director Sabu Cyril, Cinematographer KK Senthil Kumar, music composer M. M. Keerawani and the costume designers. And it does remind you of many blockbuster films of Hollywood in terms of visual treatment like TROY, THOR, 300 and more, that's nothing less than a landmark achievement made by an Indian filmmaker. In fact, last time I felt and wrote something similar was after watching MAGADHEERA directed by the same genius.\n\nKeeping an over-emphasis on mighty visuals offering a colourful extravaganza, this time Rajamouli also stresses more on emotions, well supported by a terrific cast with Prabhas and Rana leading the show along with the impressive Ramya Krishna as the queen. Sathyaraj as Katappa, leaves a strong impact and Tamannah does the action well in her undefined role providing the required glamour. The otherwise dependable Nasser remains much close to hamming unexpectedly and it indeed must have been a hugely difficult task to manage the big number of people visible in its various sequences, particularly in the bloody war executed astonishingly before the climax.\n\nHaving said all the above, BAHUBALI isn't a flawless venture as it has nothing new to tell as far as the story goes. Reminding few reference of MAHABHARATA it's the same old tale of betrayal and revenge around a fictional empire where we have two princes in rivalry for the reputed throne. Plus following a neutral approach of revealing both sides of the coins here in the review, BAHUBALI doesn't come up with a thoroughly engaging first half in comparison to the second. Heavily relying on technicalities and an obsession for visuals, the film delivers \"less entertainment and more amazement\" in its longer duration abruptly finishing on an incomplete note.\n\nAlso I was disheartened seeing few poor additions in the script, like Shiva suddenly dancing after replacing the enormous Shivling below the waterfall, the deliberately added romantic track with all those tattoos and tearing off Tamanna's clothes giving you a feeling of 'seen before', an unconvincingly easy escape from the mahal by the prince and an unwanted item song coming after 120 minutes into the film, that is never a pleasant sight to say the least. In addition, with due respect to all the technical stalwarts and team working behind the special effects, the miniature models could easily be caught in a few particular long shots that was hard to believe in a Rajamouli film made on such a scale (I never felt that way while watching MAGADHEERA).\n\nBut then ending with a balanced insight, respecting the humongous attempt made by S. S. Rajamouli and his team, BAHUBALI deserves to be seen in the theatre as a must to experience the never before kind of magical execution undoubtedly. More so, as it's the biggest, the grandest and the most magnificent visual treat ever witnessed in our Indian Cinema till date.\n\nAnd remember S. S. Rajamouli is to be respected, adored, loved and celebrated as an Indian maestro director and not a Telugu filmmaker alone shedding off that sick, biased and racist approach for good."

        "review_detailed_main": "Have been following Baahubali ever since the project was announced almost 3 years ago. The build up towards the launch was crazy and insane. The wait was well worth it and the film managed to live beyond my expectations.\n\nBaahubali is a Indian historical fantasy set in the beautiful landscapes filled with sky-high waterfalls, lush greenery, magnificent structures and awe-inspiring city called mahishmati. The storyline of rivalry between brothers and fight for the throne is nothing new, but what sets this movie apart is the story-telling and the visual narration.\n\nDirector has given ample screen space for the main characters such as sivagami, kattappa, baahubali (son & father), ballaladeva, bijjaladeva, avanthika, kalakeya and devasena and etches them in the minds of the audience with compelling episodes. All the actors have literally lived their roles. The movie starts off slowly but gathers momentum rapidly and ends with an intense battle sequence. The movie ends on a suspense note and makes you eagerly wait for the concluding part. The characterization of the invading army was very innovative.\n\nThere are few moments in the movie that leaves you awestruck such as the giant- statue-installation scene, the bull-fight, headless body walking scene and the entire battle sequence that lasts for good 30 minutes.\n\nThe movie falls short in few areas. For example, the item song is totally un-necessary. What I don't understand is that why would a director so audacious and visionary does not want to leave out the stuff that does not naturally fit in the scheme of narration. I guess it's too big a risk to leave out the mass audience. Apart from this, there were few instances where the continuity was breaking or the transitions were abrupt. But the movie makes up for these minor drawbacks with a mighty impact on you as walk out of the movie hall.\n\nThe costume designs, structures, war strategies, languages spoken and the weapons used in the movie are well-researched and extremely detailed. The background music beautifully strengthens the narrative.\n\nOverall, this is a rare masterpiece from an Indian film-maker. I cannot wait for the concluding part to arrive.\n\nBaahubali has set a new gold standard for the Indian cinema."

BGM set the pace for the movie, but I felt that the songs fell short Senthil (Cinematography): A+. He \"painted\" and \"rendered\" like a Picaso and a Mozart. The waterfall and war scenes take you to an another level Peter Hein (Action): A. War Scenes, duh! Story: B. This is where the movie falls short. Not much to rave about. We have see many more riveting, edge-of-the seat stories and this one isn't one of them In short, this is a must-watch-in-theaters for all (average) movie buffs like me.

Inspired from the great Indian epics like Ramayana and MahaBharatham. But since this is the beginning, it gives us the taste of evilness and introduces the power which can kill it. Analysis: On a whole baahubali is a movie to go and watch on bigger screen to get thrilled with it's visuals and bgm. but the only disappointment is it's week screenplay in first half. Hope rajamouli comes out with much better second part. But for now this has completely justified the tagline \"The Beginning\" and we can proudly say this is our very own Indian cinema in Hollywood standards. If you haven't watched still go and watch it on big screen if possible in qube digital. Kindly don't encourage piracy"

The acting though is standout by every character and the direction too is touching excellence. Though having no story, the movie will bind you throughout. The scene depicting war is truly magnanimous and good direction highlights the scene as one of the most remembered one's. Lot of loopholes in the story line are staggered. The visuals and acting though completely over shadows them.\n\nAll in all an OK movie, and a decent time pass. Wish the next part to be of some story line and containing more war sequences."

        "review_detailed_main": "When it is announced that tollywood is embarking on a first of its kind visual \"epic\", curiosity rose to the skies, the budget (250 crores), the stellar cast and the technicians all brought goose pimples to tollywood audience, especially when it was announced that the story was so mammoth it needed two parts to tell it. While we walk into the multiplex screening this mammoth spectacle of epic proportions, we prepare ourselves for a visual grandeur of a la Cleopatra, ten commandments, Spartacus or even Ben-hur, but sadly that was not to be, and \"BAHUBALI\" does disappoint on lot of areas, primarily the screenplay and the story.\n\nThe movie begins with queen mother Sivagami (Ramyakrishna) trying to save an infant from some soldiers and dies just after handing over the baby to a tribal queen Sanga (Rohini). Rohini christens the boy as Sivudu (Prabhas), who actually develops an infatuation over a mountain peak and wants to see what lies beyond it.\n\nOne day he succeeds in his mission and goes over the peak and runs into a rebel Avanthika (Tamannah Bhatia) and falls for her. Avanthika is on a rescue mission to save a certain Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who was imprisoned by the cruel king Balala Deva (Daguppati Rana) for more than 25 years. Devasena is waiting anxiously for her son to come and rescue her, though repeated requests from her loyalist Kattappa (Sathyaraj) to free her fell on deaf ears.\n\nSivudu, takes over the mission from Avanthika and enters the kingdom of Mahishmathi to rescue Devasena. He succeeds in rescuing her and also killing the crown prince. Out in the wilderness, he learns the truth about his father Bahubali (prabhas again) and how he was treacherously killed by none other than..........................\n\nSure, the movie was mounted on a mammoth scale, but what was lacking was a proper storyline. I know fans of the actors would argue that the real story is in the part II and this was just giving us a taste of what was to come. Well! I still say that they should have done a better job at giving us a good taste. The battle scene (only one) was neatly choreographed by Peter Heins and yes it does bring to memory lot of Hollywood epic battle scenes most notably 300 and Troy.\n\nAnushka Shetty was breathtakingly horrific as Devasena, her eyes spewing venom and the prosthetic makeup on her was natural and radiated a kind of zombiesque look, but it was magnificent.\n\nTamannah Bhatia was the surprise package, she looked glamorous in the strip battle scene ( a format borrowed heavily from Zorro series starring Catherina Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas) and was chilling as the blood thirsty rebel hacking and chopping her way in her actual introduction sequence.\n\nThe movie belongs to RamyaKrishna who takes charge as Sivagami and radiates an immense presence even in scenes where she is not to be seen. Her performance when she cuts the throat of a traitor and immediately goes back to singing a lullaby to her baby was chillingly horrific.\n\nPrabhas disappoints big time, what was he thinking using the same bhimavaram accent and the hairstyle, they should have at least done something about these two. He does appear confused with both the roles, maybe we get to see some performance in the second part.\n\nRana too dashes hopes, he is not so menacing as the publicity designs make him to be. He is just a sorry mess of Duryodhana and Rameses, the Egyptian pharaoh.\n\nSathyaraj's character reminds you too much of Bheeshma from Mahabharata, a person who knows his king is wrong, but what the hell, he has sworn allegiance and he is to stand by the king.\n\nMusic by Keeravani is forgettable, you don't remember any of the songs except the \"pachhabottu\" song, even that because of Tamannah's strip act.\n\nKK Senthil Kumar's cinematography is a wow, he has managed to capture every single thing the way it was meant to be. The battle scenes were beautifully covered, so was Sivudu's mission impossible mountain hike as well as the palace grandeur.\n\nEnd of the day, it only looks like SS Rajamouli has bitten more than he can chew this time. But yes he does deserve a pat on the back for even thinking of mounting a movie on such a scale, if only he had concentrated on the story as well, we would have had a epic adventure on our hands."

The two potential king construct is not new, but the way of presentation by director SS Rajamouli makes it interesting. Slightly disappointed by supremacy of main hero Shiva who like a macho, does everything slickly, whether it is climbing a huge water fall, or entering the royal palace guarded by an entire army, or taking away their most important prisoner and villain is like \"WTF has just happened?\". Scenes are exciting but predictable. SS Rajamouli used heroism and commercial elements to compose many scenes where fans get exhilarated. More than 50% of the movie has action sequences. No doubt, with so much budget, Rajamouli has used the canvas and technology effectively to bring a visually appealing film. However, the emotional connect should have been stronger. Decision of making this movie in two parts is riskier in Indian cinema."

The story is about two \"cousin\" brothers of which bahubali(prabhas) being the good one and bhalladeva(rana) being the antagonist, have differences in opinions(which will be revealed in part-2) and devasena(anushka) being bahubali's wife and their son \"shivudu\"(also played by prabhas). Part-1 where shivudu goes to the mahishmati kingdom and meets avantika(tamanna) and falls in love with her and helps her in releasing devasena who is kept in prison by bhalladeva and then shivudu gets to know his past and wants to find out how his father(bahubali) died. The part1 is just an intro of the characters.. the graphics are mind blowing for the budget for an Indian movie.. yes we from India are just having these baby steps into a movie which has Hollywood like graphics and infrastructure so no wrong in giving a positive review for the attempt they made to show the world cinema what we are capable of. Being the first of its kind, i appreciate the hard work of the entire team to come up with such VFX for this film.. the war sequences are excellent..i do not say they have copied from movies like LOTR or 300, when you are recreating the past the monuments, the structures, the war sequences, the swords and weapons..it all matters on how you show them and Rajamouli and team were successful in doing so. My rating 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Only one simple word explains it all-An EPIC.\n\nLike Mahabhaaratha and Raamayana epics which stand tall in Hindu epic stories, Baahubali stands as tallest one among all Indian movies in almost all aspects. As a close observer of film making I can imagine how much struggle that Baahubali team has faced to create this epic and hats off to them. They have to imagine each shot with VFX and has to shoot accordingly-which needs pure intelligence and patience. And they succeeded because I understood and felt each and every shot as an EPIC. As a tollywood lover I followed all updates of this movie from past three years which made me to write this big review by giving time to it.\n\nSome simple things which I wanna share are-\n\n1. I'm very proud that our telugu movie has shown the world that entertainment in India means not only bollywood but there is tollywood also. Once Sr. NTR does that and again Rajamouli doing that. Rajamouli should never stop doing direct telugu movies even though he does a Hollywood or bollywood project in future.\n\n2. After 20 years, My father ( Cinema goer during Sr. NTR times) and mom saw a movie in theater with out anybody's force but with true anxiety and love towards Baahubali. Thanks to Rajamouli for making this happen. I think this simple thing is enough to know what is \"Baahubali\".\n\nComing to Movie-The beginning part-My Last Movie this Year in India as I'm leaving to US for My MS- Its the greatest gift I got from Rajamouli. Some remarks even though I rate it as 10/10 are:\n\n1.*************** When Amarendra Baahubali jumps into valley to catch some person by throwing rope to Bhalla,,the travel after catching and before catching that person doesn't seems like true,,it clearly says it as unfinished CG work there and all surrounding valley locations are not finished well and It should have been better.\n\n2.*************** As a song for listening 'Manohari' song is superb number but I dint expected that as Item song and that Item song choreography disturbed the mood of movie even though there are some innovative steps but I and whole theater felt disturbed from that song. As Bhalla hasn't fully turned into villain upto that song, putting some dance steps for him in that song wont go wrong I think and it would have covered the bore in that song if you had shown two dancing handsome hunks Prabhas and Rana in same frame for at least some seconds by sending Rana for finding that required person after some dancing.\n\n3.*************** During war, after the start of \"Thrishuula Tantram\" or something method which was announced by kattappa in the movie, Prabhas suddenly comes in his horse with his soldiers after looking to flag which indicates to start that method where I felt like continuity is missing after previous shot because there are no signs to his soldiers and from where he got horses suddenly. It would have been better if director has kept that shot after showing from top angle how that method is being started since they showed its implementation style in previous scenes where they plan for war with proto type toys.\n\nThese are what I observed after watching the movie two times on July 10th itself and I beg pardon if there are any spoilers and wrong points.\n\nI'm very happy that finally Rana Daggubati got craze all over India with this movie and got identification all over world because almost every telugu guy who meets me will end the conversation by saying like \"You are looking like Rana. Both of your physical and facial features are almost same. Do you have any direct relation with their family? Both of your spectacles design are also same man. So, we can send you for Baahubali shooting\". But Seriously speaking,, WE ARE STUNNED AFTER SEEING BHALLALADEVA's acting as we saw him doing this much of performance for first time because we all already know the capacities of all legend actors in this movie. All The Best and Congrats Team BAAHUBALI. We want more EPICs.\n\n------------- Pavan Kumar Kata"

        "review_title": "Epic grandeur of Indian cinema",
        "review_detailed_main": "In a land far away from the tyranny of oppressors in Mahishmati, a young boy once again prepares to scale the cascading waterfalls that tower over his home. These falls possibly lead to a land unknown to his folk, thus his mother's concern over her adopted child's obsession to explore. Years later, the grown man obsessively pursues his imagination of a fair maiden through the far reaches of the mountain's daunting elevations, only to end up in a kingdom that needed saving. Little did he know of his past and the implications of his return to Mahishmati, that has been under the rule of a terrorizing King, who in turn had wrongfully made it to the throne but the young man who grew up as Shivudu, must embrace his original identity and claim succession to the throne as Baahubali. The much acclaimed telugu film director S.S. Rajamouli brings us the first of two chapters of an epic that draws inspiration from the likes of Mahabharat. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is the benchmark for films of epic nature in Indian cinema. Once you get past the romance and character intros, you will be in awe of the sheer magnitude of Rajamouli's imaginative storytelling that takes you back to the glorious years of Mahishmati when a young prince rose to greatness.\n\nShivudu (Prabhas) grows up with his adoptive family at the foot of the daunting mountains and his curiosity for the world above leads him up top after repeated attempts since his childhood. The beauty and lure of its people, specifically Avanthika (Tamannah) keeps him intrigued and he soon discovers that she is a part of a rebel company that plans on rescuing former Queen Devasena (Anuskha Shetty) from the clutches of the evil King Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubatti). The mysteriously faithful Katappa (Satyaraj) honors the king with the erection of a grand statue that is a cause for celebration for the pompous king. However, Shivudu's timely appearance creates a furor among the slaves of Mahishmati and apprehension among the royalty. Soon enough, he attempts a daring rescue of Devasena, only to be pursued by Katappa's men and in a streak of violence, beheads the young prince of Bhallaladeva. Witnessing a familiar indomitable warrior spirit before him, Katappa realizes that Shivudu is none other than the son of Amarendra Baahubali. The film turns into epic mode in the flashback that relates to the dynamics between cousins Amarendra and Bhallaladeva. While they had mutual respect and admiration for each other, Bhallaladeva's father always sowed the seeds of jealousy and insecurity in him. The result was competitiveness in the battlefield against a common enemy that was at their gates, threatening the very existence of Mahishmati. The Kalakeya army is a menacing creation by the film-makers and with their own language, they are almost as intimidating as the Uruk- hai. This epic battle is what makes Baahubali the 540 crore smashing masterpiece that it is. There may be inspirations from other big battle sequences from Hollywood but most of the sequences are unique in conception and flawless in execution. Make no mistake, this is Indian cinema at its remarkable best. Sivagami (Ramya) has promised the throne to the one who kills the enemy's leader and the people's favorite Baahubali will have to prove that he is more than just a warrior.\n\nPrabhas' efforts in adapting to the characters of Shivudu and Baahubali have resulted in him not only looking like the mighty warrior but his understanding of their back-stories makes him a credible protagonist. The range of emotions, his demeanor as the young Prince and his learned skills in the battle work brilliantly together for a solid, heroic performance. Rana Daggubatti makes a malicious villain and in a movie of this scale, the antagonist must seem more powerful than the hero. Rana's brawn and cunning lend credibility to the negative character that will hopefully play an even bigger role in the conclusion. Anuskha Shetty and Ramya are excellent in their roles of the strong women in an otherwise male-dominated film. Tamannah looks gorgeous as the rebel Avanthika and has executed some fighting skills competently. Kattappa is possibly everyone's favorite character owing to his loyalty and mysterious allegiance to Bhallaladeva. The climax puts him in the spotlight of discussions after the movie and his grey character is just an exemplary portrayal by the much accomplished, Satyaraj.\n\nVijayendra Prasad's story and Rajamouli's screenplay make an intriguing epic. Although it has drawn some inspiration from the Mahabharata in terms of the family rivalry, it holds its own depth and engagement for the viewer. The final twist is exciting enough to justify mass hysteria for the second installment. Barring some of the banal love saga, the film offers few loose ends. Although the numerous songs certainly slacken the pace of an otherwise tight screenplay. The production and art design are very detailed and the use of visual effects to depict the city only make things more credible for the period film. The intricate costumes and weapons match the epic look of each scene and this level of commitment by the film-makers reminds us of none other than Peter Jackson.\n\nIn a feat never before achieved by native cinema, Rajamouli will pull off another huge success when the conclusion of this tale releases in theaters next year. Fans will be eagerly awaiting more revelation of the plot line as well as big battles. Baahubali: The Beginning makes a huge impression for viewers of Hindi cinema who would normally typecast their counterparts from the south. Unanimously, people have concluded that this is a grand representation of the best of Indian cinema, rather than of a particular language or territory. You owe it a viewing just for that.\n\n9.213 on a scale of 1-10."

One can also sense how it is inspired by a lot of things: 300, Tarzan and Hindu mythology; and that ain't really a bad thing. It stays true to the theme and sucks you into the fictional world.

        "review_detailed_main": "The most epic recent Indian cinema told in 2 movies, centers on a mythical figure, facing is heroic destiny.\n\nFirst word I would use would be Titanic, in the first sense, as everything is here to make us feel so little, beneath all of this grandeur. All of it is pretty much working as you wonder in its universe on the rhythm of India and of course it's Bollywood singing.\n\nPlot is not extraordinary in this first movie, but can be intriguing given the storyline mix-up, the various characters and their ambiguity (very little though).\n\nDespite some technical issues and what appears to me, as Asian having no interest in realism for these movies, the whole movie can be of beauty on many scenes.\n\nOf course, it is as clever or dumb as any usual superhero blockbuster.\n\nTo sum up it is a pretty pleasing laid back movie, with lot to offer, from its world, to the glorious epic scenes, and more to come in the following film\n\nOf course, my review is tainted by my occidental self."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, before anyone jumps into conclusions. I live in Australia (Indian born) and have been waiting for this movie for a while due to the hype around it and it looked/looks visually stunning. And I purchased it on Youtube to watch it.\n\nSo, I absolutely agree with the rating in favor of great locations, awesome cinematography, brilliant production etc. Unfortunately, that's where it all ends along with the trailer.\n\nBoth the protagonists, Avantika and Baahubali are not only cheesy but stiff. When you portray a tough character, it is not just as simple as pushing your chest forward and having an aggressive stance. You need to convey the pain and torment in your expressions and I think they both miss the mark in comparison to mid level international actors. Well I am comparing to international movies because it could have been a contender with its massive budget and what not. The best actors in the movie where Katappa and Devasena. To be honest Devasena had more aggression than Bahubali himself.\n\nThe screenplay and direction is cheesy as well. I know most Bollywood/tollywood/mollywood etc always make a khichdi of scripts and get confused between action/drama/comedy/romance etc but you can't have an epic and make it a masala of all sorts as well. Every time I tried to dive deep into the dark story-line, I was unpleasantly slapped back into a cheesy scene between the 2 lovers or a crappy overacted sequence of him doing some muscle showing stunt.\n\nPeople keep comparing it to 300. Now, think how ridiculous it would look when Leonidas says ' THIS IS SPARTAAAA!'.... but before we fight I would like to do a floral paint on a girl's forearm .... really??? WTF!\n\nCome on, I think Indian movie industry is there with the technical side of things, just need to get away from the clich\u00e9s and cheesiness and make some awesome epics. The potential is absolutely there but was underutilized in this case."

        "review_detailed_main": "There have been plenty of good movies that hit the Indian screens from the likes of Maniratnam and Verma.. but this is the movie that has set the Indian Cinema at whole new level... All the Hollywood Movies are Directors' movies.. Here at Indian Cenima.. Movies revolve around the craze and image of Hero mostly and some times Heroine.. When director got the control movies would be like this. Mani's movies are Director's movies.. Bahubali.. every screen of it has been carved to perfection.. And here is the result.. Prabhas, playing the lead role has been pretty good in action sequences and still lacking something with his character.. he tried his best. His dialogue delivery, I think is having a mix of current day accent in it. I would still give him 8 out of 10. Rana has been improving over the years. Could have taken care with his body language. Nazar and Tamanna were good with 7 out of 10. Anushka doesn't have much of a role in this part but she is good in the screens that she was present 8 out of 10. But the highlight this part is Ramyakrishna as Shivagami... she has been the best and highly involved with the character and unbelievably stood better of all those legendary actors and actresses.. As this is the movie of the director.. he had his entire crew in line to have an excellent output probably the best in technical aspect of Indian cinema. For me, Rajamouli and Ramyakrishna have been the best and would get 10 out of 10. One could easily find what and SA Raj Kumar's music is by listening to a song or background scoring. The same is the problem with Keeravani.. He has done good job.. but not out of his box.."

The Story based on a simple war between two brothers, gets drowned into a perfect screenplay and well edited War sequences. The Performances of the Actors are good, special mention to the Emotions carried out as expected in the Director's usual. The songs are good but the major addition is the awesome Background scores by the Music Director M.M.Keeravani especially in the War sequences. Coming to the visual effects, they are apt for the projected Budget for an Indian movie.Though some frames showcase some awful effects, but the first half of the film encasing some beautiful locations and the Avalanche will stun you, especially the war sequences will make you awestruck for the well scripted plots and BGMs. The only drawback being an unnecessary inclusion of an Item number in the later half, only to satisfy some crazy people\n\nFinal verdict: This is a Wholesome Watchful movie, for the wonderful Visual effects and for S.S.Rajamouli touch."

Must be appreciated for its sheer creative imagination, larger than life canvas and mind blowing VFX effects.\n\nDirector SS Rajamouli is known to creating benchmarks in Indian movie making and breaking them too. With Baahubali, he has given \"perfection\" a new identity. We need more directors like him.\n\nPrabhas (Baahubali) & Rana (Ballala) are very convincible in their role and so is Tamanna (Avantika). For a change i see Tamanna acting for the first time rather than being just a glamour quotient, like in her earlier films. But these are just pawns in the larger game of chess who attain glory, the real masters are the veteran actors (Nasir, Satyaraj & Ramya), who bring such great acting finesse to the movie in restricted short screen space they share, that leaves a lasting impression on the audience. And its only for these veteran acting powerhouses, i would want to see this movie again.\n\nAnd the way this movie ended, \"Baahubali - The Conclusion\" will be THE MOST AWAITED MOVIE of 2016"

        "review_detailed_main": "So finally, this enormous media frenzy and extremely viral social discussions over what is supposed to be the biggest leap in India movie-making (especially in terms of VFX and action), snow-balled into an overwhelming urge inside us to watch \"Bahubali\" in the weekend.\n\nTelugu Cinema has always been the front-line runner of the Indian film industry when it comes to visual effects, roaring impactful dialogues, over the top action-sequences as well as greatly unusual scripts. Add 250 crore budget to that and the premise of an LOTR- ish, 300-ish trailer, one just cannot ignore the juggernaut.\n\nSo, the first thought which comes to mind is : The movie delivers on spectacle! Yes. The enormous uproar over what is supposed to be the best special effects coming out of the Indian movie industry is not for nothing. The only disclaimer would be : Don't try to compare it with the contemporary Hollywood Cinema. The visual effects as well as the magnitude of war-scenes along with the costumes do deliver an incredible movie experience, and are surely an epic surge from the usual. But, one could easily say that it is what Hollywood Cinema was roughly 15 years ago. There cannot be any complains though. Considering the budget, though it is giant going by Indian standards, it still lags behind greatly when compared to a usual Hollywood cinema incorporating visual effects.\n\nThe part which is cringe-worthy is the weak script of the movie. One may argue that because it is going to be a two-part movie (Yes, the second part releases in 2016), the strength of the script has yet to be unraveled. But, no Sir ! The major half of the movie was just wool-gathering and did not induce any interest in the story. Considering that the first half was rather more about stunning visual effects, costumes and locations packed into songs and unrealistic romantic overtures, tells us much about how many crores went into those scenes instead of a strong script. But well, audience is the judge.\n\nTamannah is lovable in the movie with her martial techniques as well as her beauty. The romantic chemistry of Prabhas as \"Bahubali\" and Tamannah as \"Avanthika\" may be a bit eccentric for the north-Indian crowd and could make them cringe in hilarity. One could also say that major scenes before the interval are purely comic.\n\nThe movie takes a radical turn after the interval. Rana Daggubati playing as the antagonist \"Bhallal\" is the person for the job. He is as convincing a villain in 'Bahubali' as good a secret agent he was in 'Baby'. Nassar and Ramya Krishnan as \"Bijjaladeva\" and \"Sivagami\" respectively are the two pillars who have kept the movie in hold with their performances. Anushka Shetty as \"Devasena\" reminds you of the role of Rakhee in 'Karan Arjun', but her potential has yet to be revealed.\n\nThe biggest part of the cake goes to Prabhas who plays as \"Mahendra Bahubali\" as well as his own father, who showcases various shades of human character starting right from a loving son to a benevolent prince to a formidable warrior and especially, a weird infatuated lover.\n\nThe movie is not spared of the clich\u00e9d untimely insertion of romantic and item-songs which are the identity of Indian cinema, and surely makes the audience raise their eyebrows. The primary reason for that being more unbearable for the Hindi crowd is because of the dubbed Hindi songs instead of the usual Telugu songs (which could at least hold the Telugu crowd). The Hindi lyrics are totally a work- around to synchronize them with the Telugu lyrics' length as well as the meaning, and are plainly nonsensical. The Hindi dubbing of the dialogues in the movie also render the same effect in a lot of scenes, and thus somewhat reduce the impact the movie must create from its Telugu counterpart.\n\nAll of that being said, the movie is still epic in its proportions and is a great stage for the take-off of the Indian movies in terms of VFX, action sequences and cinematic scale. All praises to S.S Rajamouli for his gigantic vision! Those who complain about Indian movies not being at par with the Hollywood in these terms, have something to look forward to and they should appreciate the effort, time and money put in the movie so as to encourage more such endeavours in the future.\n\nDo watch it for what it delivers, and not for what it does not. A great effort which should be reverted with the same enthusiasm. Just go for the spectacle.\n\nOverall rating \u2013 3/5."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you have grown up reading children's version of Ramayana, Mahabharata and other Indian comic books, and have always felt that why isn't someone in Indian cinema creating one of those epic stories fit for a big screen? Well Bahubali is your answer, it takes several key aspects from the comic versions of epic Indian scriptures and creates a fantastic story line, that most Indians can very easily understand and immerse themselves in breathtaking on screen narration and visuals. Director and the team have done a fantastic job in creating this epic Indian cinema. No words of praise can do justice to their effort, dedication and creativity.\n\nHowever, I saw director Sri Rajmouli's interview on ibn that he is waiting to hear any feed back in the next few weeks, that could help him and the team improve on things for the conclusion of this epic story. So I am sharing some of my observations here, not sure if any of his team members will get this or not, but I have to try.\n\n***Spoiler ALERT **** Since its a period war story and is totally fictitious, I don't care about logic and historical accuracy, but editing, I do expect a better job. One of the points in the story line where I felt a need for better editing was during the scene where Sivudu and Avanthika romance it up in the snow garden and then the scene abruptly cuts into Mahismati kingdom, where Bijjaladeva is reviewing the arrangements for the inauguration of kings statue in the city center. I felt that the smoothness or scene to scene connectivity was completely lost in that aspect of story narration. Instead if the make out scene was followed by Avanthika leaving sivudu and the rest of the snow fight scene, it would have been a smooth flow of the story line. As for the scene about Bijjaladeva reviewing the arrangements for the inauguration of king's statue could have been placed right after the kings bull fight scene, leading into the introduction of devasena. I am not by any standards the go to guy for story connectivity, but hopefully the team can stitch up the scenes in a well connected fashion for the conclusion, which I can't wait to see.\n\nAlso I feel like the movie is spectacular for Indian audience, however it may not be well received by average joe in western world. Reason, they simply don't appreciate a tough guy dancing around with his love interest around trees, especially a prince unless its a Disney movie. Tough guys in Hollywood flicks lack dancing and poetic abilities period, they tend to keep things simple, fight, make out and out wit the enemy. So it might be a hard sell to the average joe from the western world. Hoping that Rajmouli Sir can bridge that gap and make a movie that charms the average Joe from western world and Average Ram/Rahim/Joe from India thus taking Indian cinema truly to the world stage. Good Luck."

The storyline is somewhat OK even though there are some plot holes and Indian film aspects like making the main character very overpowered. If you are looking for a film that tells a legend with some portrayal of ancient India, then Bahubali is a film for you. But make sure that you will have to endure the normal norms of Indian films like dances and songs as they appear way too often just like most Indian films do. For me, I don't even mind them anymore as it is a tradition for Indian film makers to put those in their films. I hope you would find what you are looking for."

Ah, they are truly magnificent. The award winning production designer Sabu Cyril has created grand sets that can be compared with Hollywood epic movies. Senthil and Sabu Cyril have created a world that looks rich on the screen.\n\nSound design and background musical score (by M M Keeravani) is one of the prime factors that have made Baahubali a great audio-visual experience.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSpectacular visuals with high end graphics\n\nGigantic sets and grand production design\n\nPrabhas and Ramya Krishna's stellar performances\n\nOutstanding camera work\n\nPicturization of songs"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having created so much of a hype and going through some early non sense reviews I was fearing that Baahubali will be a big let down, thank god I was wrong and the movie was good and I was happy while I walked out. Having said that, a movie of this magnitude should have been more perfect (to Rajamouli's own standards). Especially I felt the introduction of most of its characters was hurried and lacked the punch that it was supposed to be. Looks like spending too much time of pre-production and other preparations took its toll on the screen play. Introduction of the main hero was spectacular, but hurried and unconvincing. So was the introduction of both the heroines, they lacked the punch and goose bump moments that they were supposed to be. Finally the Villain character was also not so convincingly menacing (Ranadev bhilla's character gave me goose bumps when he was introduced in Magadheera, that was my benchmark here as well). Only Ramya's character had a good introduction, and even there her drowning was not so convincing to me. Even the romance between Avantika and Shivudu was hurried and looked like a one night stand to me. (compare this to the chemistry of the lovers in Magadheera) However, the brick bats end here. Having done with the intro's and after the first 30-40 minutes through tho movie as the main plot is introduced it get better and feels like a normal Rajamouli movie. Now coming to the bouquets, 9 out of 10 review are heaping praises, agree with them and don't want to repeat them again. The production quality and SFX were world class and extravagant and can only make Indian cinema proud and set a higher bench mark. The the director has done well to create and retain the enough suspense for the conclusion part.\n\nMy rating is 8/10.\n\nI Only hope is that the director able to handle this success and able to deliver even better movies in years to come, and not fall into a over budget stereotype.\n\nThough this story is a fiction and may be based on some folklore my belief that Indian cinema can take inspirations from our culture and literature and epics and produce world class movies like troy or fictions like avatar, and conquer more and newer audience and markets and in the language which they understand (read as English). We will get there some day."

The plot is presented in an interesting and competent way and makes the story of the Baahubali family fascinating. The downsides include an apparent overuse of certain camera techniques (i.e. close-ups and slow-motion), a clich\u00e9d plot, and poor writing - at least in the subbed version. Baahubali: The Beginning might not be as big and its underlying concept was intended, however, it could be the start of something big.\n\nOverall 6/10 Full Review on movie-discourse.blogspot.de"

        "review_detailed_main": "It has great sets and some cool graphics. Fight choreography and action sequences are nice. But not always & not at par with Hollywood. The story could have been great. It should be the central aspect of this type of fantasy so that the imaginary world would feel real. Actors have worked hard and effectively to fit in their menacing characters and it worked perfectly. The first half was more or less boring, except some visual flares. Second half was much better, it was all about flashback that lasted to the end with a cliffhanger ending that does not justify the length of the movie.\n\nIt is all about visuals and great sets uncommon to Indian movies, also menacing roles perfectly acted but it's heart of story is missing. Over dramatic situations and excessive use of slow motions are also disappointing, in my point of view. For many Indians it can be ground breaking, but it does not deserve over 9 ratings in IMDb."

When a similar attempt is made in India with total Indian sensibilities they can't accept. Most of the Hollywood period drama's are emotionless VFX epics, you can easily nit pick 100's of faults in each of those movies. But those Pseudo's excuse all those and even give it a classic status. Where as a movie like Bahubali, you dissect and ridicule every minute detail of it. Watch the movie objectively and you will find it on par with those Hollywood classics."

Prabhas actually seemed like he could kill all enemies, his every sword move was looking like it can take someone's head away, great great performance by Prabhas and Rana. Tammanna is damn cute in this movie even her acting is too good. Ramyakrishnan's role is awesome and can give five stars for her performane. As i am a Tamil guy became a big fan of Telugu cinema just because of Director Rajamoulee."

The CGI is mind-blowing and the story and characterization is great. The Costumes and sets are great.

It looks like its only purpose is to make the movie just longer in duration in order to advertise the next movie of the series and attract the audience that is thirsty for bloody scenes. This is also obvious from the last scene in the movie.\n\nAlthough I can not refuse that they did very good job in graphics."

The director knows that mere effects and visuals are not enough to tell a good story and he has used graphics only where he needs it. If you have seen Rudramadevi trailer - you know what an amateurish, mess it is. The end shot in the trailer of Baahubali of the baby being carried through the water - sealed its superiority. This is going to be the biggest historical of the 21st century in Indian Cinema.its an awesome movie. After watching its starting now I can say Indian movie has upgrade enough . This movie is full with special effects .\n\nFull entertainment ."

Post this movie, Rs. 200 crores box office collection looks very simple and may create a new benchmark.Very excited to see the reaction of internal audience once it releases across territories."

Some animations of scenes were not believable here and there (not many) just a few like in that war they were killing and bodies were flying I mean to say that this is a very good movie so they should have worked hard with those scenes and if they weren't able to better them then they should have changed to something else I mean it was a war and everything was nice about this movie but those few or very few scenes lacked quality animation was only thing bugged me a little. In all we should go and watch this movie in PVRS and theatre or DT and enjoy this one so we can encourage Indian cinema a little to push for this kind of stuff because I don't really like those movies they are making these days. They just make lame movies with same lame story and stuff. No quality whatsoever to boast bout Indian Cinema. Some drama movies like OMG, PK etc are good but in action and adventure genre we are far behind with quality. Anyways good movie go and have fun watching."

It has been done way to many times in movies where a mother awaits his son to take revenge from a cruel ruler. The character of Sivagami (played by the actress Ramya Krishnan) is unbelieble and unrealistic. I'm not sure how much of this movie is based on history but it sure doesn't tell the story in an interesting way in my opinion."

Not just visuals,the film is rich in every field.Plot of the film is very good.The screenplay is fast paced and enchanting.There are not many unnecessary scenes or subplots.Right from the first scene,the movie hits the bullseye.Yes,some scenes are over-the-top and outrageous still those scenes contains an exquisite charm.The narration of the movie is excellent.The pace of the movie is brisk that's why it never seems that you are watching a movie of 150+ minutes.It never bores you.It is like a trip on a boat in a full-moon night. The background score is melodious and enchanting.It fits consummately with the mood of the film.And what to say about Visuals.They are simply brilliant.The movie contains one of the best visual effect ever seen in the history of Indian cinema.The bird-eye view of the kingdom,war scenes,avalanche scene,rock climbing scene and Lifting of Sivalinga etc. are some scenes where you can catch sight of the visual mastery.The locations are exquisite and looks like the Elysium has been painted on the canvas.Cinematography is excellent especially during the war scenes. S.S.Rajamouli can easily be termed as the James Cameron of India.His perception about this movie is artistic in sense and is truly peerless.With his new outing,he easily proves how great storyteller he is?He is truly an unparagoned artist. The movie can also be watched for its gratifying acting.Prabhas is amazingly awesome.He is the soul of the movie and with his performance he proves his panache once again.It is difficult to move your eyes away from him.Rana is awesome and is a perfect choice for the role of antagonist.His performance is superb.Ramya krishnan is astonishing.Her acting is another plus point of the movie.She is perfect in the role of a powerful queen.Tamannah is fit for her role.In action scenes she looks amazing.Anushka shetty has nothing much to do.Hoping that she will get a good role in the concluding part.Supporting cast is very good. This is an epic film in true sense as everything about this film is grand and epic.It is the greatest war epic India has ever produced.Bahubaali is an epic which is rich and vibrant and sets a milestone in Indian cinema.It is a must watch for every movie lover and if you are going to miss it then miss it at your own risk.This film shows the growing face of Indian cinema to the world. I would lovingly rate it 8.3 out of 10."

Now the girl comes into a reality...Dear Tamanna, butterfly looks beautiful in rose garden only. That look and aggression was not at all looking good on her face... Then a song starts with a lot of nonsense, that i don't need to tell. starting 1 hr of the movie is unbearable. After that the movie is OK. Story is average. Fighting sequences are good, but every now and then there is a south Indian touch. Though i liked the twist at the end, it would be interesting to see how the second part of the movie will end up. I am giving it 5/10 just for the efforts taken by the director and the whole cast n crew."

More attractive was the use of archaic Tamil pronunciation in the Tamil version and this effort by the director and related units is commendable. Telugu cinema is a massive industry and these kind of movie and budget is the one those people were lacking. With the release of Baahubali it is more attractive and complete. The music is OK but the BGM is the one that stole my heart.The portrayal of some fast paced scene is awesome and more attraction is by the set and the graphics applied on it. Story telling was first class. For the first time the graphics look something like Hollywood graphics and it is not irritating for the common unrealistic nature in most Tamil movies. Even we can spot some artificialness in graphics applied on Enthiran but it is not the case here. The war scene is satisfying. Let's hope upcoming Ponniyan Selvan can do equally or much better."

Spanning generations, going back and forth between the present and the past, alternating between vastly contrasting landscapes, it's an ambitious work from a visionary filmmaker who skillfully blends a tale of old school palace politics with modern VFX to deliver a consistently watchable blockbuster.\n\nLast 45 min of the movie(Battle) explains the management theory Like identifying strength & weakness of problem(enemy),Analyzing own skills, Proper planning & execution, delegation of work, proper utilization of available resources, motivation to team and finally perfect judgment to select the king(HOD)....What a great movie..."

With all this hype and calling this as an Indian answer to 300, may be I was expecting too much from the movie which ended up in a no man's land. It's all clich\u00e9d and as Rajamouli did what he does best in lifting scenes from other movies, he didn't want to miss that in this. you can see shades of Mongol, Red Cliff and most importantly Hercules. I think the entire war scene was a direct lift from Hercules. So, if you doesn't care about the authenticity of the work or watching the visuals in the movie for the first time then you would like the movie and even if you don't fall in the above category you will end up watching this because of the hype generated. So, enjoy the movie. Thanks."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a time when Indian cinema has embraced the worst of CGI effects and decided to make all action sequences lose all semblance of reality and make them all something out the Matrix. Baahubali comes along and makes the very same CGI effects cool again.\n\nRight off the bat, for the people who upon seeing the film might find it over the top and outrageous. The film is a Tollywood film (from South Indian cinema) and thus bound to have certain theatrics that might seem odd to a lot of cinema-goers. Despite all of the theatrics, Baahubali is a fast paced, riveting action packed drama that will entertain and tantalize your senses with breathtaking scenic vistas, amazing depictions of great cities of ancient India and fight sequences that will make you wonder if you are watching an Indian movie or something out of LOTR.\n\nS.S. Rajamouli has yet again done a brilliant job directing this movie with Prabhas or Shiva/Baahubali playing the charismatic hero and Rana Duggubati playing Bhalladeva the conniving and power hungry anti-hero.\n\nEven though the movie is great overall, it seems that Indian cinema has still not reached a stage where mainstream movies can altogether drop the song and dance sequence. So there is an item number which is quite jarring and should have been cut. However that is the extent of what could be considered a flaw.\n\nThe movie ends on a cliffhanger that will make you hunger for the sequel and wish that 2016 would get here sooner.\n\nGo watch this movie without fail. It is one of the best movies that has come out of Indian cinema in recent times and a gigantic leap forwards in the genre as well. You will enjoy it!"

I have no partiality on any movie . Good movie is a good movie no matter where they are from.\n\nBaahubali is one of it. For the past few years baahubali has brought lot of expectations in audience through it promotion, and songs etc. I was expecting it might fall back due its big noise. But once i watched the movie I changed my view.\n\nIt is a must watched movie, All the hardwork done by each and every technicians, from small job to director and producer is seen in the movie.\n\nI need to watch again and again to see each and every details of the movie. It is not a movie to watch one time. Each and every details done on the project water feature , visual effects, set design, creating the atmosphere, emotions, props, development of the character. Each and every character has its prominence. I liked war sequence in the movie. Trust me when i say, i don't like too much fighting. But this movie made that very interesting to me. How they paid attention to each details, help audience to see at each character how they respond and react , not just some bunch of people fighting with sword and killing. Purpose and how they have to make decision in between the chaos of war, ow you can different from great warrior to warrior. Amazing.\n\nI don't' want to spoil for you all, but surely i recommend every one to watch this movie, not only for Indian audience , but international audience because the emotions that played in this movie are same around entire world not just India. And rajamouli did an amazing job with little resources he had.\n\nNow a days as we see lot of movies ( i don't want to name them) release with 700 million dollar budget but they fail to bring a complete movie, either their character has no justification , or they are lacking emotions, or connection to audiences etc. Even though it is big budget in India, i think its still less budget for the quality he brought.\n\nNo director is entirely satisfied with his work. I am sure rajamouli would say this need to be improved and this couldn't have been done better way.\n\nI surely don't want to end without praising actor prabhas for his dedication to completely sacrifice his career to solely concentrate on this movie for more than 2 years. This is very commendable. But it just adds level of appreciation to the movie and his dedication as an actor."

Rajamouli has proved that We can make a good movie without adding any vulgar or double meaning comedy scene which can be seen in our bollywood movies. I'm shocked to see reviews of some of our critics. They gave it just 3 or 3.5 rating out of 5.Some foolish rated it just 2 out of 5. These people seem to be jealous of tollywood movies. But it doesn't matter what they perceive. I'm sure this movie will definitely necessitate our 3 Khans to rethink about theme of their movies which is completely a bullshit. Hats off to Baahubali..."

And 'myth' is the key word, if you're a westerner watching it. To really benefit from this film you need to let yourself enter into the mindset of mythology. It requires that particular kind of suspension of disbelief that was needed to appreciate Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, for instance, where ninjas can defy the laws of gravity. And this is easily equal to Crouching Tiger, but on a grander scale and with added humour and Bollywood-style songs."

When he finally succeeds, he finds the large kingdom of Mahishmati, and falls in love with a girl (played by Tamannaah) from a rebel group who are trying to rescue their queen from Mahishmati's evil king. Shivudu, brave and fearless, vows to rescue the queen himself.\n\nDespite the predictable plot, this Telugu action-drama is all around fantastic. The acting was solid, the scenery and settings gorgeous, and the music (songs and incidental) excellent. Some of the CGI animals weren't fully credible, but the rest of the CGI usage looked natural and impressive. The action scenes generally looked believable, and were always exciting. Overall, for viewers comfortable with violent action films, this is a movie not to be missed."

There were a few corny moments but it wasn't as bad. Ramya Krishnan and Anushka Shetty caught my attention the most, until this movie, I don't think I had seen an badass woman like them (The ones I saw partly of were all old movies). Prabhas was just as fanastic, I love the way his character had a boyish charm and curiosity in what he did. Tamaanaah Bhatia was also fanastic, and Rana was good, I honestly don't have much to complain about, as Bhatia's character was a strong female lead much like Ramya/Anushka.\n\nI still listen to the songs on Youtube, especially Hamsa Naava as it is a good song."

But the first half really builds up the story. Agree with others that LOTR and 300 were an inspiration for few of the scenes. But that doesn't take away anything from the director. Hope more such films are made here. Eagerly waiting for the sequel In 2016. My first review here.... still amazed.... cant say anything else except GO AND WATCH IT RIGHT NOW !!!"

Touted as one of the most expensive films to be made in India, this highly anticipated part one of the two-part period epic, manages to enthrall you with its sheer scale and grandeur. Painstakingly made, paying acute attention to detail for the minutest of sound and visuals, Rajamouli (Eega, Magadheera) , who spent three years making this ambitious film ensures that the larger-than-life execution matches his grandiose vision. Though this swashbuckling adventure relies heavily on CGI and VFX, it doesn't lack emotional resonance. It manages to be much more than a blood-soaked romp.

        "review_detailed_main": "The story takes us in to a fictitious land of Mahishmathi and in no time you will start connecting to the characters. I would have to admit that the Director SS Rajamouli has excelled in creating the kingdom and the characters in it. Utmost care has been taken in designing the beautiful sets and CGIs are used just to enhance the viewing experience. The story is simple and straight forward where 2 brothers compete for the throne of the Mashishmathi and the consequences after it. The hype was so huge around this movie that everyone waited for 3 years since this movie was announced. Gladly, the movie is worth the hype. I get a feeling that second part which is due for release next year shall be a great conclusion to the tale. Don't be disappointed by seeing the CGI used in first half at Avalanche and that chase as it might not look promising. Its the second half battle scenes which make the movie more satisfying. A special mention to the amazing background score. The film is truly a gem and take a bow Rajamouli for the guts to have vision and successfully executing it. Prabhas was amazing as Baahubali and Rana was equally charming. Go see on big screens and celebrate the big leap in Telugu cinema if not Indian Cinema."

Visual wonder, powerful star cast, Mind blowing Back ground music, Super climax. From the first frame to till climax the film was just wonder and SS Rajamouli has taken the Telugu Industry to another level. Cannot imagine any others to direct this film, it is a simple example the way Rajamouli thinks and exhibits about a film, his dedication, hard works always pays and this is the reason he had tasted only success in the tough competition. Rajamouli sir we are just waiting for the 2nd part. My feelings about the movie even after watching 2 times is of same. Waterfalls, mountains, forest, settings, bull fight, kalakeya fight, war equipments, apparels, body language, songs, shivagaami, aslam khan, Anushka 1st powerful dialogue, expressions, etc etc, finally Goosebumps at few scenes ---omg the list goes on....... and on. The film just Rocked."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie review : Baahubali (The Beginning) : A seven course meal for the movie-starved soul!!! I bow to thee -- SS Rajamouli! This is definitely 'Lord of the Rings' of Indian cinema.. An epic in every sense!! The story begins in a beautiful land far far away, surrounded by never-ending waterfalls. At the bottom of the falls, a figure emerges from a cave hidden to the normal eye. A fatally wounded Sivagami (Ramya Krishna) protectively holds a new-born baby as she is chased by a couple of soldiers. She kills the soldiers deceptively and then tries to cross a treacherously flowing lake and is on collision course with death as she manages to hold the baby in her raised hand - and she slowly drowns. Hours later a bunch of tribals hear the baby crying only to find it in the middle of a lake; held in a hand pointing upwards. A swimmer collects the baby.. the hand stays pointing upwards and slowly the body is washed away. Intrigued yet??? This is just the first couple of minutes of the movie! I will not give away any more of the story - would definitely want my beloved readers to watch it on big screen, if possible in XD! The saved newborn then grows up to become Sivudu (Prabhas). His strength will weaken you, his bravado will scare you, his magnanimity will belittle you and his kindness will bring tears to your eyes - such is the persona of Sivudu. Most powerful hero seen on Telugu screens ever and can't imagine anyone other than Prabhas as Baahubali. There is Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati) - the ruler of Mahishmati. His strength is his arrogance, his power is his pride; in short, he is evil personified. He terrorizes his victims and subjects alike. A fitting antagonist. Rana seems as menacing as his character and again cannot imagine a more suitable villain. There is Devasena (Anushka) - the queen of the realm. But as luck would have it, she is chained in the middle of the capitol as a convict, by the order of Bhallala Deva. No one even dares to free her as they would know what would happen to them if they tried. Prisoner in public for 25 years, she is immensely strong in her intent for revenge and hopeful that her son would come some day and free her. A role devoid of any glamor, or screen time for that matter (atleast in this movie), but Anushka nails it to the T. There is Kattappa (Satyaraj). A righteous and skilled soldier devoted to the throne and bound to slavery by his ancestors. Amazing performance. There is Avantika (Tamanna). A soldier loyal to her queen and wants to free her at any cost. Love interest of Sivudu. She is outstanding as long as she is on screen smile emoticon Looks gorgeous in the duet. There is Bijjala Deva(Nasser). Father of Bhallala Deva. Handicapped but every bit vile as his son. He will definitely repulse you. And then there is Sivagami. Most powerful character in the movie. I think after Ammoru, this is the role of a lifetime for Ramya and she doesn't disappoint. Talent meets beauty! There are many more but these 7 stayed with me (Now you know why I said 7-course meal.. And there is a surprise dish too.. Watch and experience it! The battle with Kalakeya was epic. The visuals breath-taking. The sets elaborate and the presentation spectacular. Rarely do we get to see a movie with powerful characterization and story. This has both, and much more. The complete experience was so amazing, I did not mind the minor flaws wink emoticon (yes there are some). If i have to get nit-picky that is .. At certain times, the graphics weren't that great, meaning you can make out it's graphics. And the other issue I had was the forced item song (sort of) with three girls who were looking totally out of place. Overall a great movie to watch. But please do not take kids with you as there is fair share of violence. SSR, I wish there were 51 clones of you and that each would release one movie a year. I promise I would never get bored of watching your movies again and again. And again... Baahubali, The Conclusion - cannot wait for you. Hasn't anyone discovered time machine yet? Time to go back to Skynet (alias Genisys) and see if they can send me to 2016 !!!! So long folks! Happy watching!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "SS Rajamouli's \"Baahubali: The Beginning\", was announced a 'blockbuster' even before it's release. And the film has lived up to the hype, and how! Not only has the first of the two-part series smashed all records by grossing between Rs 60 crore to Rs 70 crore on its opening day, it has made nearly Rs 160 crore in first three days. Its first week collection is estimated to be of Rs 255 crore, Biggest Indian Grocer. So what makes this south flick dubbed in Hindi, so special ? The film is directed by S S Rajmouli. Remember 'MAKKHI' ? He is the one who can create a super hero out of an insect. Baahubali is the biggest Indian Big screen extravaganza. If the scales of Hollywood flicks like The Mummy, Scorpion King, Lord of the rings etc. have charmed you, go watch Baahubali and see all those mammoth sets, Huge palaces, Gigantic cities, Enormous waterfalls, praiseworthy character's attires and massive war scenes in an Indian film. All these & special VFX effects compete with its Hollywood counterparts. And if this is not enough, watch it for a very simply narrated storyline, most architecturally designed cinematography , suiting & soothing songs, thrilling background score & well performed acting by the main characters. Watch it for the acting of PRABHAS, as Baahubali & his son Shivu. Not for a moment he comes out of his role, watch his eyes, face, throat muscles & even fingers\u0085all play the character & only his character. Watch it for the efforts being put, as one year of pre- production, a team of 25 artists creating some 15000+ story boards, a 200 acre set made in some 200 days, 8000 junior artists being ploughed in , and even this was not enough, a new language was 'researched & invented' by the named 'Kilikili', reportedly having 750 words and 40 grammar rules. The language was invented for the terrifying warrior tribe named 'Kalakeya'. Popular parallels exist in the way of the elaborate Elvish language created by JRR Tolkien for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but this must be the first full-fledged new language created exclusively for a character in a film in India. Below is the link of the actor speaking the same language in the audio release function.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ZNCw2yWVpbw&feature=player_embedded\n\nNeed more reasons? Watch it for most gigantically filmed climax war scene ever imagined for an Indian film. It will remind you of the movie '300' for sure at some moments, but this cannot draw it's due of being the most exclusive, grandiose, Epic & thrilling battle scene till now. And yes, watch it for being the first Indian movie of releasing the next part in next year, while closing with a question mark, not concluding the story of part one, as in 'The Gangs Of Wasseypur.' Watch it\u0085Because as the name suggests, it's just the beginning.\n\nWatch here... the making of Baahubali\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ab86hTGc0cU"

His vision, His Ideas, His Emotions everything increased the want for the second part. First part I watched as a night show, and after watching it - I want to watch Second part in a first show. Baahubali - the conclusion, we want it soon - very soon. There are lot of unanswered questions and we cant wait for answers."

        "review_detailed_main": "The largest celluloid production of India, Baahubali, has opened up to a huge hype. The length of production, the commitment of lead stars to the project, the supposed grandeur of cgi in the movie have created such a murmur around the project that whole of India is looking at a regional movie of a Southern state. I have been awaiting this movie for a long time now but I have not kept my expectations to a high. Indian movie, however large the budget may be, would not match the quality of a Hollywood produced movies like 300 or avengers or transformers. I was not wrong. Is the movie bad? No, in fact it's very good. Are the graphics not up to mark? They are by far the best on Indian screen!! But are they a match to above mentioned that graphic based movies... Definitely Baahubali need to catch up... But kudos to SS Rajamouli and Arka media. They did a job that we have always dreamed for. This movie pushed the boundaries of Telugu cinema and it's market to the biggest level ever. The movie attracted attention of Hollywood. Definitely they have seen much realistic CGI, but what brings the attention? The story. Yes I have seen some critics mentioning that the movie has nothing but CGI and there is an old story in new CGI. But the fact is these critics have only ever been to see popcorn action and are critiquing some thing beyond their imagination. Story of the movie though reminds of many dramas from yesteryear, it has its own flavor. The performances though not top notch, they are good enough to carry the weight of expectations of audience. Anushka deserves a special mention. She dared to go de-glam and she gets full marks, even though her presence is very limited. Tamanna was little out of her zone. Rana was tailor made to carry the ego maniac role. The first half is little sketchy and patchy. The hype created brings down the movie. The pre-intermission sequence is the beginning of excellence. Post interval, enter Siva Gami. She not only turns the movie into performance epitome. She single handedly creates an aura of grandeur and royalty. She carries the whole movie on her shoulders and performance. The war sequence comes next. Its no less than any other Hollywood movie like 300 or Troy. Its designed, executed and captured with such beauty and mastery, we really should be proud of SS Rajamouli and team. Their vision was presented picture perfect. The climax and mid credits sequence will keep you glued to screen till it goes blank!! To all the critiques who could not find a story, I pity you guys. If you can't find a story in this movie, please watch those popcorn movies and give five start!! I am particularly not overwhelmed with 9.4 rating. Definitely is one the best movies to come out of India, but definitely there is a little bit more catching up in terms of CGI/VFX to truly make this equivalent effort to those of 300 or Troy or Avengers\n\nWaiting for second movie..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whilst being touted as India's answer to Lord of the rings, Baahubali falls short of such Himalayan standards. However, by tollywood (or for that matter Indian) standards, it is exemplary. It is all too common to see heroes possess six-packs these days. However, in this movie there was a genuine point to all those biceps and triceps. The storyline is perhaps the weakest point of the movie. It is the clich\u00e9 good nephew-bad son-sibling rivalry, etc. plot. The execution was beautiful. As many commented, the land is certainly no middle earth, but the fort, the battle sequences (especially the stratagems, while being inspired or perhaps even borrowed from 300 (the phalanx formation) or Lord of the rings (the battering ram) still left room for some creativity). Prabhas and Rana clearly worked quite hard for the stunts. While Anushka's role in this movie is limited, she had the courage to pose as an old woman (complete with the wrinkles and all. The make up chaps certainly deserve a round of applause). Tamanna, unfortunately, fell short of the mark. It is clear that she put in a gargantuan amount of effort. But perhaps, sometimes less is more. In her case, her expressions were too forced. The dark horse in the movie, the unsung hero was Ramya Krishna. She carried the role of queen with poise and aplomb.\n\nSome scenes in the movie were clearly made for the masses (like the one wherein Prabhas held a huge statue on his own whereas elephants (!) struggled!). Such scenes should've been toned down, especially considering that the director is reputed to be a perfectionist.\n\nAll in all, it is a good watch and sets a great example for the (hopefully) changing trends in Indian, in particular Telugu, cinema."

I have loved Eega ( Makkhi) with impressive CGI and with Bahubali, S S Rajamouli has raised the bar of Indian Cinema.\n\nBahubali tells the about the war, family dispute, betrayal between two brothers over the power and position.\n\nThe trailer itself was spectacular which made audience desperate to experience the cinema in theater. I was enriched by a visuals never seen before on Indian silver screen before. Each frame has been accurately captured with eye-catching cinematography by KK Senthil Kumar. The art direction by Sabu Cyril will carry you to the medieval period of Indian Hitory with gigantic sets. Visual effects by Prime Focus team is applauding especially the 30 mins war sequence. Hats off to S S Rajamouli was handling each area -direction, storytelling and screenplay. The flashback story is enduring and keeps you engaged. On the flip -side - The larger than life action scenes especially the bull-fighting , the unnecessary insertion of songs, the love drama between Prabas and Tamannahh. Nevertheless, the overall film is a exhilarating and enriching experience with impressive star cast who gives a commendable performances.\n\nBahubali should be lauded for surreal direction, exemplary CGI and commendable performances.

Safe to say I wanted to run up and down the walls during watching, unfortunately I was in public on campus. Instead I was so excited to talk about this movie so I went to some Indian kids to see if they have seen the movie.

Thus, I have no reference point with which I can compare how good or bad this movie is.\n\nBaahubali is the first part of a two-part period drama that has been made on the largest ever budget for any Indian movie. The cinematography is immensely beautiful and every shot is well- composed. It is rare to see a movie put so much thought into the set design, costumes and the prosthetic makeup. In every frame of the movie, the extravagance is palpable due to the large number of VFX shots used in order to give the movie more credibility.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, the concept is not a new one. A boy is born who is destined to be great but has to prove his worth. A great amount of dedication and patience is required to make an epic movie like this one. The director must be commended for taking on such a challenging project that might be one of the finest period movies ever made in India.\n\nThere are flaws that are present in this movie. However, some illogical sequences and gravity-defying stunts can be ignored in order to enjoy the great entertainment value that is possesses.\n\nBaahubali is a great movie that finishes on a high note. The ending will leave viewers intrigued and the second part is highly anticipated."

I would say the plot reminds me of the Disney classic \"Prince of Egypt\" with the action scenes similar of \"Troy/300\". The Visual effects reminds me of Game Of Thrones and it does have some musical aspects to it as well. When combining all of this, it does make it a very entertaining to watch and i recommend it to all people that like adventure/action flicks. 9/10"

There are visual effects everywhere in the movie. There are only countable scenes without any VFX. But the digital work is so great that it is a feast to eyes. Maahishmati, the empire of fiction is a work of wonder. Minutes details from each scene are well addressed. Prabhas seem to have generously granted a depth and effect to his voice. Though everyone has casted life into their characters, Ramyakrishna as Shivagaami has an outstanding performance. Sudeep has a guest appearance which notions that he may have more to perform in its upcoming sequel."

        "review_title": "Greatest movie in the Indian History - A visual wonder!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The first thing and the positive aspect that grabbed my attention to the movie is it's great director - SS.RAJAMOULI !!! Rajamouli is one of the fantastic directors in India with all of his films being a blockbuster success in the Tollywood Industry. The people over Tollywood feel proud about him and his films & they go crazy for his films.Rajamouli works with simple stories (mostly written by his Father K. V. Vijayendra Prasad) but his narration and his taking with a beautifully architectural screenplay makes the audience spine-chill and gains him success.\n\nComing to the second thing is the title with strongest pillars - Prabhas and Rana and the other characters.You just have to look at how Rajamouli gives every major character in Baahubali its own heroic introduction to realize how keenly he is attuned to the pulse of the audience and knows what button to push to make them cheer.\n\nPLUS POINTS : As you start watching Baahubali, one thing that hits you instantly is the scale of this magnum opus. The extravagant sets, spectacular visuals and the sheer magnitude has not been showcased in any Indian film before. One cannot shy away to laud Rajamouli for thinking something this huge and also executing it on such a mammoth scale. The war sequences and the way they have been executed are in true Hollywood style. Prabhas is terrific in a dual role and is the apt choice as Baahubali. No one except him could have done justice to the role which is larger than life and has many heroic moments. His sheer screen presence and emotional performance will be immensely loved by his fans. As expected, Rana is menacing as the baddie Bhalaladeva. This is a dream role for him and he gives a top notch performance as the bad guy. Ramya Krishna is elegant as Shivagami and brings a lot of depth to the film. Nasser and Satyaraj play their roles perfectly. Second half of the film has a lot of emotions which elevate the film to another level.\n\nMINUS POINTS : The story line of Baahubali is quite routine and predictable. The actual film kick starts only during the second half and ends abruptly which might leave you a bit unhappy. Anushka has nothing much to do in the film as her character will be revealed only during the second part.\n\nCertain war sequences have been dragged out and could have been trimmed to decrease the run time. There is so much hype surrounding the film that certain unwanted songs side tracks the film. The romance between Prabhas and Tamanna also looks exaggerated at times.\n\nTECHNICAL ASPECTS : Where do I start from in this section. Baahubali is by far the most technically brilliant film that has come out from Indian cinema. Each and every frame in the film is sheer magic. The sets, VFX work and graphics are just out of this world. One should be really proud to see such grand visuals especially in a Telugu film. Music is decent but the background score could have been better.\n\nNext in line is the art direction. Sabu Cyril has done a marvelous job with the sets. Be it the palace sets, the kingdom surroundings or the warfare equipment, everything looks impressive. Senthil Kumar's camera work is mind blowing. His awesome visuals are nicely complimented by the stunning VFX. The water fall scenes and some shots during the fight sequence with Kaalakeya have been executed brilliantly.\n\nThe way Rajamouli has conceptualized the visuals will be a learning lesson for a generation of aspiring film makers. Even though Rajamouli's screenplay dips a bit here and there, his larger than life approach is what makes this film such a visual treat.\n\nSUMMARY : Baahubali is one film which every Indian movie lover can be extremely proud off. Right from the word go, this visual extravaganza treats you to some never before seen elements in Indian films. Prabhas's stunning avatar as Baahubali, brilliant art work to some eye topping visuals effects, this film has it all. Genius director Rajamouli, should be lauded and supported for his dedication in taking Telugu cinema to the next level. Finally, if you ignore the predictable story line and keep your expectations in check, Baahubali is bound to entertain you big time."

Sudeeps appearance is short nd sweet. Songs - awesome. Have seen the film twice already.\n\nEega was a superb hit. Now Baahubali. Another member in the list of Rajamouli's fans.\n\nEveryone is waiting for the second part. I'm waiting to see the first part - twice again ;). More expectations from second part"

Even the prince Baahubali had nonviolent duel with his elder brother Bharata.\n\nKattappa battle shield defensive preparation of infantry is similar to the Lord of The Rings: The Two Fellowship introduction battle with the Elves, Human and Dark Lord Souron.\n\nBut Mouli has used his own creativity and made a best film within his budget constraint. I never compare Indian movie with the Hollywood movies because the budget makes difference for our Indian directors to give us the best output and he has did awesome in this movie.\n\nTamanna attitude as warrior needs to be improved more.\n\nSivagami character is something new traits and Ramyakrishna acting is really extraordinary. Satyraraj action sequence is impressive. The betrayal of Katappa makes more curious to watch the conclusion.\n\nReaders sorry for the typos and grammar."

All the character are except Ramya Krishnan Look Lifeless. The fight, The climbing all the scene so childish and more worst is the fight scene. The hero kills so many people but not even a stain of blood on his Hand . Come on guys at-least little practical in this is also not there. They have showed liked they are gods and indestructible.\n\nIt was such a waste to watch a Movie for 3 hrs and then come to know that this is no better than what they hype in Media and News. I was thrilled to know that we are in a way competing with Hollywood by this movie. But surely we are very far behind the same.\n\nPlease work on the graphic part , the visualization and something realistic more than hero jumping buildings without breaking a leg. And Tammanna is worthless with that Make up and acting."

If you don't really dig most Indian flicks but have enjoyed GoT, LOTR or The Hobbit, you won't regret giving this one a try. The first 10 minutes may be a little OTT but it's still saved by some amazing CG work. Those 10 minutes are a quick albeit slightly choppy set up for what may well turn out to be the best 2-3 hours of entertainment you'll have this year. The rest of the film is absolutely gripping. Brilliant battle scenes, great acting, more amazing CG and then those storyline twists! Man. It is an EPIC film. I just can't wait for Part 2. Bring it out Mr Director!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Why did Kattappa Kill Bahubali....yesterday again I watched & again the question arises in my mind.\n\nFirst of all I would like to thank director SS Rajamouli for producing such a great movie. It is a new bench marks for India. All people of India love it. Now we Indian can proud that we have a movie compare with many famous Hollywood movies.\n\nThough it is said to be great but there are few points that make me unpleasant...\n\n(1)At first the songs 'Dhivara' comes. I do not have any opinion about songs and dances as it is always happened in Bollywood. In the song the journey from bottom to top of the mountain are shown. The mountain are very steep. So it is almost impossible to climb to the top. We are excited to watch how Shivudu succeed his dream. But the movie just skips that part and shown almost in an imaginary ways (superhero type) as it happened in south Indian movies. I am disappointed at the beginning.\n\n(2) Again when the huge King's statue is processing to erect suddenly an accident is happened. The statue falls down. We are again exciting what will happen in next and then Shivudu comes and catch the rope (which is used in erecting). The statue stops and erecting towards the perpendicular direction. I shocked how one man can stop such a statue!! OK\u0085the name of the film is Bahubali so he can. Then my eyes go on the rope and I see \"SAGGING\". How\u0085how with sagging of the rope the statue is erected! Again I disappointed.\n\n(3) At middle of the movie the killing of prince (son of Bhallaladeva) is again most thrilling scene. But I have seen that the plot when Shivudu hits on Kattappa (01.33.32) ;Kattappa falls down on slop and then when both running (01.34.01) towards the sword carried by the horse 'Siddha' is different. This should be the same plot. The distance also increases so much when both running as it should be the short & same in between them when Kattappa falls down.\n\nThough I disappointed at some point but at the end it makes me happy. The quality of graphics work is very good. The war at the end shown is so attractive. The romantic scene in between Shivudu and Avanthika that created by Rajamouli is outstanding. Yes it is a milestone in Bollywood. But we can not compare with Hollywood epics such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings etc.\n\nAt present Rajamouli is one of the best director in India. We are expecting more in his next Bahubali part II. I feel it go to monster hit in India. All Bahubali fans are waiting\u0085.why did Kattapa kill Bahubali!!!!!"

In this part the brothers Baahubali and Bhallaladeva fight for the throne to Mahishmathi Kingdom. The war formations that form a chunk of the latter portions of the film are the best we've seen in Indian cinema so far. These portions are spectacular and show the technical work of the visual effects teams.The waterfall, the mystical forests and water bodies above the cliffs and the lead pair escaping an avalanche all add to the spectacle. This movie is narrated through spectacular visuals and amazing special effects, including a 30-minute battle scene captured with admirable precision. The film's production took more than two years and their work is clearly seen in the movie. Each and every character is superbly framed in the movie. Overall It's a superb visual treat."

Every clich\u00e9 shot is shamelessly thrown in, so there are lots of freeze-frame action poses, running away from burning backdrops, slow-motion carnage, prodigious jumps with heroic landings, hyper-dramatic sunsets, and tough guy squints and sneers \u2013 a little over-the-top at times but always entertaining. As I was watching a sub-titled version, I can't really comment on the acting but the characters all looked and sounded the part. The tone of film is quite uneven: other than the bloody prologue the first act is quite lighthearted but then progresses to lots of bloody stabbings, impalements and decapitations in the second act. The showpiece final battle is a real mix: graphic gore and incinerations mixed with 'cartoon style violence' (e.g. picking up men by their feet and using them like flails \u2013 an absolute lack of respect for the laws of physics permeates the film). Plus, there is an awesome chariot equipped with spinning blades that reminded me of the head-chopper in Caligula (1979), which is good enough for an extra point in my rating. All in all, a fun fantasy epic and an interesting example of the parallels and contrasts between \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" big-budget action cinema. Lets hope the success of this film prompts an equally ambitious movie version of the \"Ramayana\"."

Rajamouli's taking has been an asset throughout the movie which elevated some scenes making the movie overcome the hype that has been created and reach the expectations.Scene after interval definitely sends a chill down the spine of an enthused and sensible audience.The grand scale war scenes are easily on par with Hollywood. Ending the movie on a cliffhanger is icing on the cake. Still the first part of this two part EPIC leaves the audience in awe making it Truly an EPIC!!!!!"

Vijendra Prasad sir and directed by the superior director of India SS Rajmouli sir and I am from Odisha. I am Prabhas's diehard fan from Chhatrapati movie. Since then I have seen every single movie of his. When I was little, I saw the Odia dubbed version of Chhatrapati on our Odia channel. Since then I followed Prabhas's entire movie , i used to watch his movie in telugu while i don't know telugu Because then all his Hindi dubbed movies were not available on YouTube . I am a diehard fan of Prabhassss...I am a huge fan of Prabhas..I love him more than my life..My dream is to take a selfie with Prabhas and touch him. I want to watch all his movies till I die.. I can't miss any one film..My only prayer to God is to give me a lifetime to watch Prabhas's film."

        "review_detailed_main": "A classy piece of art, a story which is told never before over this magnitude and frankly speaking the magnitude of sets and other things is tiny in front of emotions created in scenes.\n\nActing of cast rules the movie. Prabhas was over the top for sure bur everyone else is at peak of performance, Rana, Ramiyaa, Satyarj were brilliant. I generally don't feel Tammanah is a very good actress but the way she has performed with a mature image in the movie is simply excellent.\n\nIn general I find south Indian movies very loud and sometime filled with overacting of the main cast, probably to get whistles in theaters. But this time Rajmaouli Sir has done a never before job and shown the entire world the art of storytelling, the script is fantastic and it's unfolding is even better, sometime you will wonder about Rajmouli, how could he do it? The largest cinema venture in Indian history and it's completely no nonsense?\n\nThe way Prabhas carries the looks in his eyes while having Shivalingam on his shoulders is never seen before, I feel now there is a man who can manage his eyes better than Aamir Khan, so beware bollywood!!! The acting of overall cast reflects Rajmouli effect; sometime the director has that capability to create it.\n\nThe portraying of Bahubali's character as a king is real tear jerker, you feel like having a king like him and to be ruled, Similarly Optimus Prime in transformers.\n\nSo, Go and watch this Magnum Opus if you have not seen till date."

For instance i) the Prabhas/Thamanna Tattoo Palindromes episode,ii) Naming the kid Bahubali by Ramya Krishna seeing the strong palmar grasp Primitive reflexes etc etc many such finer details have been observed by Him & His Team through out the film. #Hatsoff for that Trait !! Truly an Epic, although it did not produce that much of Awe&Kick that His films' usually give, for instance Magadheera,Eega. But is understandable for this 1st part, given the nature of the movie, being split in two. Guess the 2nd part would nail it and produce double the Awe&Kick. Personally i would rather like it to be a single movie somewhere at 3hr40min length maintaining a poised pace,editing & screenplay, than a 2 part movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I read a lot of these comments on here and comparing this to Hollywood and movies such as Lord Of The Rings.\n\nHere is the thing with Rajamouli. He made all the classics, every single movie of his is considered as one. They are considered classics due to the emotional connection we feel with his characters. In Bahubali, the characters were set up extremely poorly. I questioned Shivudu's character. I could care less about him and his love story. It was set up extremely poorly as were many of the characters.\n\nMid way of the first half, I felt the movie to be extremely bored. I watched every Rajamouli movie in theaters on the first day and watched all of his films at least 10 times. This movie, I will not! First half of the movie was not pleasing. Due to the heavy content of the movie, character development was compromised and that is a huge part of what makes a movie successful.\n\nThe second half of the movie was mostly a huge war. It was really great to see that effort and it was through all Rajamouli's imagination, which is laudable! The pace of the entire movie is very slow, which makes me question if both part 1 and part 2 can be done in one movie! The whole movie can be said in one hour!\n\nFor Bahubali fans out there, please stop comparing this to Hollywood! While Rajamouli and the producing teams should be applauded for their efforts, this is not a Rajamouli stamped movie! I would rather the film have OK graphics and an actual story line with emotions than see this! Much like most Indian films with big stars or big budgets, it is initially played on hype. Everyone should go watch this movie for the visual cinematography but if you are a film critic who enjoys a good story...this is not a movie for you!"

There are moments which will make you feel the urge to get up and shout \"Jai Maahishmati\"! It has been quite a while since we have seen a movie coming out of the Indian stable which can have a pan regional appeal. Baahubali will easily be liked by everyone who allows themselves to be swept in to another world for 160min. There are flaws for sure but the few shortcomings will vanish by the time credits roll and you will find yourself waiting to come back to see what's next. Hats off to the team.\ud83d\udc4dbig fan"

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the past decade, Telugu film director SS Rajamouli has established himself as a man who can deliver CGI-heavy cinematic spectacle.\n\nHis latest is reportedly India's most expensive film ever. Bahubali opens with a bang \u2014 we're plunged into an otherworldly medieval landscape, with gigantic waterfalls, towering mountains and forests. A woman (Ramya Krishnan)descends from a mountain top into a river valley, carrying a baby in her arms.\n\nForest dwellers rescue the boy as she floats away to her death. What follows is the story of an orphan boy discovering his true identity, and an expository tale of a heroic king back stabbed by a trusted friend.\n\nAs the protagonist (Prabhas) tails a fairy like creature (Tamannah) over waterfalls, and giant armies clash swords, Bahubali begins to feel very much like The Lord of the Rings. Some of the aesthetics are clearly borrowed from this epic series and Zack Snyder's 300, but there's enough startlingly original design to call it inspiration.\n\nWhat really makes the film work is that it is, at its heart, a fast-paced adventure, fuelled by themes of questing and redemption.\n\nPrabhas is exceptional as the lead, hulking yet charming. Rana Daggubati is perfectly cast as the villain, his performance layered with subtlety and nuance. The final scene of Bahubali reminds you that the tale will be concluded in next year's sequel. By the time the credits roll, you're left wishing it would come sooner."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, the wait almost worth 3 years hasn't gone in vain. The movie is just wonderful though it has minor flaws. First half of the movie is OK and second half is mind blowing with trade mark Rajamouli emotions (I guess you know what I'm talking about). I bet you get goosebumps for the first 15 minutes post interval, emotions run high at this part of the movie. Art Direction and Cinematography are out of the world for a south Indian movie. So is the stunt choreography. Climax keeps you guessing what's next in this master piece.\n\nPlus Points:\n\n1. Art Direction 2. Cinematography 3. Direction 4. Lead Actors Performance (Especially Ramya Krishna and Satyaraj) 5. Background Score (It could have been better but still elevated some scenes superbly)\n\nMinus Points:\n\n1. Tamanna (Definitely a miscast for that role) 2. Screenplay (Especially the First Half) 3. Item Song in Second Half (Kind of spoiled my experience)\n\nOverall, it's a never before experience for South Indian Cinema goers. Go and watch it in a theater with good projection/sound system.\n\nFYI, Don't miss the beginning of \"Baahubali - The Beginning\"!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie makers publicized this movie as 'India's largest motion picture'; that largeness can be clearly seen in this movie. The movie team worked hard for three years, but finally we have to consider what they put up on board. I haven't seen a movie of this genre in Indian Cinema recent times.\n\nPlus Points: For every 15 minutes, we can see some strong scenes that will mark a place in our heart. War episode and visual effects in it are extremely good and executed in Hollywood style. Emotions are elevated perfectly. Sets designed for the kingdom 'Mahishmati' are amazing. Every main artist in the movie have done their job to their best. Prabhas look aptly suited the character of Shivudu and Baabhubali. Rana gave a top notch performance in negative shade. Tamanna is gorgeous but Anushka has little to do in this first part of the franchise. Ramya Krishna is elegant with strong characterization. Nasser and Satyaraj play their roles according the needs. Finally, the extravagant sets, spectacular amazing visuals and the sheer emotional magnitude are the main highlights of this movie.\n\nMinus Points: The story of this film is routine and easily predictable for Telugu audience but I think it may be new for foreign audience. Film end abruptly without giving any high. That disappointed me. War sequences are not so fast and crispy. I think they must edited for fast pace. Songs disturbed me a lot. They take out our attention from the main story. I feel that the romance between Tamanna and Prabhas looks artificial and has no soul in it. I sometimes felt that movie is running in a slow pace. In every Rajamouli's film, there will be some haunting background score which is lacked in this movie.\n\nSpecial Scenes: Waterfall scenes and war scenes are amazing. Sudeep's guest appearance is good but not great. The item song 'Manohari' with Nora Fatehi and Scarlet Wilson is sexy.\n\nFinal Words: One can watch this movie for great visuals and emotions and not for great story or screenplay."

        "review_detailed_main": "Such an awesome and must watch movie.This is the first movie which meets Hollywood standards.Bahubali opens with a bang \u2014 we're plunged into an otherworldly medieval landscape, withgigantic waterfalls, towering mountains and forests. A woman (Ramya Krishnan)descends from a mountain top into a river valley, carrying a baby in her arms.\n\nForest dwellers rescue the boy as she floats away to her death. What follows is the story of an orphan boy discovering his true identity, and an expository tale of a heroic king backstabbed by a trusted friend.\n\nAs the protagonist (Prabhas) tails a fairylike creature (Tamannah) over waterfalls, and giant armies clash swords, Bahubali begins to feel very much like The Lord of the Rings. Some of the aesthetics are clearly borrowed from this epic series and Zack Snyder's 300, but there's enough startlingly original design to call it inspiration.\n\nWhat really makes the film work is that it is, at its heart, a fast-paced adventure, fuelled by themes of questing and redemption.\n\nPrabhas is exceptional as the lead, hulking yet charming. Rana Daggubati is perfectly cast as the villain, his performance layered with subtlety and nuance. The final scene of Bahubali reminds you that the tale will be concluded in next year's sequel. By the time the credits roll, you're left wishing it would come sooner."

        "review_detailed_main": "What amazes me is the arrival of this movie and the fact that in years to come I will get to see more of them. I always kept wondering that if India is a land of myths, history, struggle, why don't we have such Epic movies (with actual visual and sound effects like 300 or Troy) in our country. And Lo! we have one, the first one now.\n\nGreat effort. Songs are always spoilers in Indian movies, but I liked the first one, it was amazing. I found bits and snippets fitting in perfectly well within the realm of the over all story line. I found the song right after the interval abominable. Best characters I liked- Kattapa and Kalkaya war lord. In the movie that was approximately 2 hrs and 25 mins long, I sat at the edge of my seat for about 30 mins in the second half. And that was spectacular. Though I felt that a bit more research on making the war strategy stronger could have made more worth out of the money invested in effects. Nevertheless really liked it.\n\nIf this movie had arrived in the times of Braveheart, I would have given it 10/10, now that a whole family of them have already made their mark, it stole some points away on originality. But still for the 30 mins at the edge of my seat, 8/10. And you can't watch it on small screen, better to give it a miss."

        "review_title": "An introductory part to a forthcoming epic drama",
        "review_detailed_main": "Bahubali: The Beginning_ My Review\n\nThe opening scene has an aged queen drowning herself protecting the life of a new born baby, presumably her grandson, thereby shielding a sovereign legacy. Generations carrying valor and vengeance blended with pride and kingship are what Bahubali offers, with a blockbuster package of breath-taking war sequences, sporadic landscapes and across-the-board epic drama. Though Bahubali has factors which stand out of a usual movie, there are certain things filling the negative side too.\n\nWell, let's start with the making part. SS Rajamouli, a sealed logo of his name on the movie poster itself is a symbol of blockbuster and that repeats here, he packs everything perfectly but misses certain stuff that could've made Bahubali a classic beginning. He requires special applause for making a drama of this kind that raises the bar of Indian movies to the lines of certain foreign movies, that too in a comparably shoelace budget. His vision of building an empire called 'Mahishmathi' is supported by Sabu Cyril, Peter Hein and Senthil Kumar. Those mammoth size sets of Sabu Cyril itself offer that realistic feel of an epic kingdom, while Senthil Kumar ably captures them all, trying maximum to provide novel frames; whereas Peter Hein gives his best at the action sequences. On company of these men, there is MM Keeravani with gripping background score, which simply elevates every sequence to another level. There were more than a couple of sequences every hour offering goose bumps, mainly in the latter half. That quick climax just throbbed my spine, creating a hell of thrill.\n\nWhile there are too many at the positive side, certain portions and misplacements disturb the mood. The supreme of them are songs, Manohari and Pacha Bottesina were purely avoidable songs, which not only disturb harmony but also lower the standard of the movie. Certain portions of Tamannah too required crop tool, especially the makeup scene, the director's attempt to mix stunt with beautification didn't come out well; seemed idiotic.\n\nEpicness of characters is yet another interesting factor of Bahubali. Though Amerandra Bahubali and Bhallaladeva stay as usual hero and villain, the characters of Kattappa , Sivagami , Devasena, Kalakeya and Bijjaladeva make the plot look grand; Satyaraj's Kattappa inspired from 'Parvateshwar'of Shiva Trilogy, being the most interesting one. His performance was best among the actors; came out as a surprise package. Ramya Krishna's grandeur Sivagami was perfect, impeccable performance. Prabhas looked impressive with the character elevation offered to him; gave the best from him backed by macho looks. Daggubatti Rana looked good with cut shots and CGI action, had nothing great to perform, hope he gets better content in the Conclusion. Anushka's brief appearance was damn effective, whereas Tamannah revealed more skin than talent. Prabhakar's Kalakeya war lord was tailor made. Nasser was wonderful as expected.\n\nOn the whole, SS Rajamouli's Bahubali: The Beginning is an introductory part to a forthcoming epic drama, Bahubali: The Conclusion; though certain stereo elements and misplacements come as negative, the visible craftsmanship of talented men make The Beginning a great watch. The IMAX Big Screen Experience of this flick is worth mentioning.\n\nFinal Note: Brilliantly crafted; could've been better. _Sooraj Pattazhy"

Rebel star Prabhas did really prove the point that he is The Rebel. A film gets its fare share of success from a strong villain, and there lies the importance of Rana.

The movie ends on a suspense note and makes the audience waiting eagerly for the second part, which is expected to release in next year.\n\nAfter a long time this movie made headlines all over India and it is worth watching the movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never seen a movie in the history of Indian cinema that could level up-to Hollywood except and only for Baahubali. The movie starts great with the excellent picturisation of water falls and starts all refreshing.\n\nThe camera work has been excellent and a few scenes take your breath away. The performances have been superb and the most untalked and underrated performance being of Prabhakar (Kalakeya). His dialogue delivery has been excellent and the language he speaks reminds you of the movie Apocalypto. By far I credit his performance as the best and the next best being Ramya Krishna's.\n\nThe avalanche scenes of Prabhas and Tamannah takes you to Hollywood and you forget that it's indeed an Indian movie. The war scenes remind you of Hollywood blockbusters Apocalypto and 300 but there is no straight correlation of the scenes.\n\nThe movie leaves you an impression that will remain for at least 2 days and scenes flash in your head that make you want to watch the movie again, the only problem being you don't want to spend another $ 25 to watch it :). You are unhappy at the end as you have to wait for another year for the conclusion.\n\nAll in all, an epic movie that will be remembered for a good 20 to 30 years at least. Kudos to Rajamouli whose caliber only enhances by every movie and can be considered easily as the highly talented film maker India has ever produced.\n\n~ Santosh Addagulla."

Prabhas delivers a powerhouse performance in dual roles as Amarendra Baahubali and Mahendra Baahubali, embodying both the nobility and might required for such iconic characters.

His portrayal of Bhallaladeva was powerful, and it's impressive that he made such an impact despite being relatively new to acting at the time. His ability to shine as a villain, even surpassing the hero in some viewers' eyes, speaks volumes about his talent.\n\nTamannaah may have had limited screen time, but she left a lasting impression with her strong and graceful performance.

Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S. S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.\n\nI was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie.\n\nEach and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2."

Made a few years earlier, this film looks much cheaper -- some of the CGI is so bad that the movie almost looks like a video game cut scene at times. And the actors just don't hold the screen the way the two leads in \"RRR\" did. It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over. If I'd known going in that what starts as a flashback wouldn't so much be a flashback as the actual real story of the movie, I would have been prepared. But as it is, the transition into a whole different story at the mid-way point really threw me and killed what momentum the film had been building."

Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... On the whole,is a revitalizing take on romance and relationships. A wonderful cinematic experience, this one should strike a chord with not just the youth, but cineastes of all age-groups. Watch this celebration of love and get mesmerized!"

Acting, the lead actors have done an amazing job at it.\n\nC. It is not like a mixed items movie Bollywood produces now a days, every scene has its value, not forced to make the length. Action is also reasonable for those muscular guys and their scripted origin.\n\nD. Environment, Creativity falls from everywhere, The looks and feel are so real for an Indian movie. Sequences are perfectly rewind- able.\n\nI would give 9/10, and I am eagerly waiting for the next part. Good job guys. Best South Indian movie ever"

        "review_detailed_main": "Baahubali : The beginning is not an ancient drama rather an action based historical film narrating history with as much reality as it could grasp. The story may seems fictional but it's characters and their emotions are all convincingly genuine, as if the ancient human personalities were resurrected in modern times. This is a Rajamouli's masterpiece, where he bought back life to the ancient Indian history with vigour, passion and confidence. He brilliantly presented it to the modern audience fulfilling all aspects of viewers tastes.\n\nThe beginning is about Baahubali, a young man with tremendous physical strength, who easily lifts tonnes of weight with bare hands, has a princely link with a nearby kingdom Mahismati. He is bought up in a village but at a matured age he learns about his origins and the ugly truth about his past through various circumstances. This basically is the storyline, where then he listens the whole story of his father from the loyal Katappa, a most revered character of the Baahubali franchise. It ends in a question but sets out an interest for the second part. Rajamouli cleverly depicted the exact parallel of heightened emotional deliveries in both words and actions. The brotherhood, the friendships, the bravery, the love-romance, the betrayal, the hypocrisy are all hard hitting and convincingly real. Perhaps the physical strength and the bit pieces of VFX throughout the movie are fake but this could be understood as an entertaining angle rather than serious. We shouldn't forget that history is upto some extent a bit obtuse, somewhat distorted too. Rajamouli's Baahubali fits exactly this issue by means of bodily powers or VFX or heightened emotions. Katappa's loyalty, Baahubali's positivity, and Rajmata's folly are all message delivering plots. They are the brightest points in the film, that will make you remember this film for life.\n\nTechnically, the script is brilliant and performances are applaudable. They fits appropriately in those old characters which were perfect and inspiring in everything they do, whether it be war strategies or archery or community built ups and so on. The music too is uplifting, the characters are gripping, and the direction all marks the brilliance. The VFX issue is somewhere fades the truth hence a 9/10. But I feel Baahubali is not about special effects but rather an ancient political game of good vs evil, where the roles plays a strong parts.\n\nIn the end, it's a believable, uplifting and engaging historical film of political kingdoms fighting one another and within themselves for the power and greed. Though the ending is pessimistic where Baahubali is killed without any valid reasons shown still, it won't outweighs the positivity of the protagony throughout the film. A brilliantly climaxed film linking properly to its sequel, with brilliant technicals all fitting properly and last but not the least the brilliant script which holds tightly everything you would see in it. It's a brilliant historical film from India from south to be precise. A full 91 on scale of 100."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Baahubali: The Beginning\" (2015), directed by S. S. Rajamouli, is an epic fantasy film that takes Indian cinema to new heights with its grandeur, scale, and captivating storytelling. Set in the fictional kingdom of Mahishmati, the film unfolds a tale of power, betrayal, and destiny, anchored by its larger-than-life characters and spectacular visuals.\n\nPlot and Execution:\n\nThe film revolves around the story of Shivudu (played by Prabhas), a young man with unknown origins who embarks on a journey to uncover the truth about his heritage. As he learns about his past, intertwined with the fate of the kingdom, he discovers the legend of Baahubali, a powerful warrior destined to overthrow tyranny and restore justice.\n\nStrengths:\n\nVisual Spectacle:\n\n\"Baahubali: The Beginning\" is a visual extravaganza, with breathtaking cinematography and stunning set designs that transport the audience into the fantastical world of Mahishmati. The grand palaces, sprawling landscapes, and majestic waterfalls are a feast for the eyes, creating a vivid and immersive cinematic experience.\n\nEpic Scale and Ambition:\n\nS. S. Rajamouli's vision for the film is ambitious and grandiose, evident in its meticulous attention to detail and the sheer scale of its production. The battle sequences, in particular, are choreographed with precision and intensity, showcasing Rajamouli's prowess in directing large-scale action scenes.\n\nPerformances:\n\nPrabhas delivers a standout performance as Shivudu and later as Baahubali, embodying the strength, charisma, and nobility of his character. Rana Daggubati shines as Bhallaladeva, the antagonist driven by ambition and ruthlessness. The supporting cast, including Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah, and Ramya Krishnan, add depth and gravitas to their respective roles.\n\nEmotional Core:\n\nAt its heart, \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" is a story about family, honor, and sacrifice. The emotional journey of the characters, especially the bond between Baahubali and Kattappa (played by Sathyaraj), resonates deeply with the audience, adding emotional depth to the epic narrative.\n\nMusical Score:\n\nThe film's soundtrack composed by M. M. Keeravani is majestic and evocative, enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. The iconic theme music and powerful songs contribute to the film's epic feel, complementing the narrative and visuals seamlessly.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPacing Issues:\n\nWhile the film excels in creating an immersive world, some viewers may find certain segments slow-paced, particularly in the first half. The extensive world-building and character introductions, while essential, could have been tightened for a more balanced narrative flow.\n\nPredictable Elements:\n\nThe overarching storyline, while engaging, follows familiar tropes of epic fantasy narratives, which may make certain plot developments and character arcs predictable for seasoned viewers.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"Baahubali: The Beginning\" is a monumental achievement in Indian cinema, setting new benchmarks for scale, storytelling, and visual effects. S. S. Rajamouli's magnum opus captivates with its larger-than-life characters, stunning visuals, and emotionally resonant narrative. It is a cinematic spectacle that transcends language barriers and captivates audiences with its epic tale of heroism, honor, and destiny.\n\nDespite its minor flaws, the film's strengths overshadow them, making \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" a must-watch for anyone who appreciates ambitious filmmaking and immersive storytelling. It remains a cultural phenomenon that continues to inspire and entertain audiences worldwide, setting the stage for its equally epic sequel, \"Baahubali: The Conclusion.\""

I was a little worried at first but once I started watching I did not want to to turn it off.\n\nThe main character, Baahubali, is immediately likable. I was rooting for him the entire movie.

Both first and second parts are great. Great acting, screenplay, location everything. First part is available on you tube for free in HD quality. If you want good entertainment, and looking for movie with good story line, and solid acting then go for it. There are some parts which may seem unreal - like main characters have too much strength, but give it is story about 1000s of years ago. Good things is it is not about any super powers or extra terrestrial powers."

Amazing CGI says IN YOUR FACE to other indian movies.amazing cinematography,story,makeup and BGM.\n\nCast- I was impressed in everyone's acting.the magnum opus made a boost to the already popualar actors career.\n\nPRABHAS-what should i say. He is the bahubali so there is not much to talk about him cause he is just tooooo good.\n\nRANA DAGGUBATI-he is actually having the best perfomance.i actually felt that i liked him who is the villain and not prabhas who is the hero.he only had few years of experience of acting after a couple of flops.but he is just amazing. He also managed to get into bollywood TAMANNAAH-tamanaah got little screen time, but that doesn't matter. It is that she impressed me with her skills within that short screen time.a thing about tamanaah is that she usually refuses to a movie if she just stays there to look good besides the hero, being saved multiple times.in this she potrays a rebel woman who has impressive sword fight skills,who fallls in love with prabhas after she drops her mask tempting him to find her.while wooing her he finds out that devasena is his mother and many other stories about his family story."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a big fan of Rajamouli, but this is not a biased review. The rating I gave is not just for Rajamouli but the entire unit of Baahubali. Right from the story which reminded me of all the beautiful Indian stories that were part of my childhood,(I'm getting back to reading Amar Chitra Katha now!!!) to every guy who says \"Baahubali\" in the movie. There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, not scary ones but like those that put you in awe.\n\nIt should just get better from here for Indian Cinema. This should be the benchmark for story telling, direction, script, visuals, sets, screenplay etc.(but not for acting!!!)\n\nThe story keeps you hooked to the movie. I wouldn't say too many good things about the movie as they may contain spoilers. But I could compare the movie to a good mythological comic that you would like to read again and again.(So I'm watching the movie again tomorrow!!!)\n\nBut I would like to mention why I reduced the two stars 1. The make up was not at all good. Especially Anushka's\n\n2. The costumes could be better, probably more realistic(if you compare costumes in Troy or even Hercules, they were more relevant)\n\n3. At times people in the background were not true to the scene, my concentration was distracted due to some idiots who didn't match the scene. A few villagers, few priests, few classical dancers, few tribal guys. The Kalakeya warriors were amazing though.\n\n4. WHO THE HELL CHOSE TO PUT AN ITEM SONG. There were many uufffs in the theatre at that time. How the hell did probably an eastern European end up in that.\n\n5. There were a few glitches in the VFX, like whenever the hero is jumping around... it made it look unnatural. That's poor graphics. I'm not an expert on this but few of those jumping sequences could be avoided. You don't see them in Hollywood mythological except for superhero movies which are more convincing.\n\nBut not too many complaints about that as I understand there are certain budget constraints for VFX but Makeup, there is no excuse for that.\n\nAll said and done, it was a fantastic movie and worth the wait and ends with a nice climax which keeps you guessing the 2nd half story.\n\nMy favourite characters were Sivagami and Kattappa. I am in love with Ramya Krishna again. I'm watching it again tomorrow."

With any luck the momentum will not be lost and more films of this genre, each improving on the next will emerge."

In spite of liking the directors previous film Eega, this was a complete disaster. The first half was filled with thamana showing her skin most of the time. The director used the vfx well but completely forgot that he has story to think of. This is definitely one of the biggest minus in the movie. And on top of this the songs and background music. I wish I had a ear plug. And just subtitles would have made me a get a better impression on this movie. Horrible music. Literally it was pain. An item song in between. Oh God. Please. This is completely nonsense. Seriously IMDb should change the rating. If this movie deserves 9.5 , then please answer what happened to PK,Endhiran,\"I\",Vishwaroopam,Dasavatharam. In fact \"I\" was shown as the most expensive film. And it did pay off \"I\" was indeed amazing to watch. Rajamouli has failed. Please never compare him with shankar.

This visually stunning epic captures the grandeur and magnificence of ancient India with an engrossing storyline and breathtaking visuals.\n\nFrom the very first frame, the film pulls you into the mythical kingdom of Mahishmati with its awe-inspiring landscapes and intricately designed sets. The visual effects are on par with Hollywood standards, making every scene a feast for the eyes. The film's action sequences, particularly the climactic battle scenes, are nothing short of spectacular and are choreographed with precision and flair.\n\nThe cast delivers powerful performances, with Prabhas standing out in the dual roles of Shivudu and Amarendra Baahubali. His portrayal of the titular character is both heroic and relatable, exuding charisma and strength. Rana Daggubati as the menacing Bhallaladeva is equally impressive, providing a formidable antagonist that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The supporting cast, including Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah, and Ramya Krishnan, add depth and emotion to the narrative.\n\nM. M. Keeravani's music score complements the epic scale of the film, enhancing the emotional and dramatic moments beautifully. The background score is particularly effective in heightening the tension and grandeur of key scenes.\n\n\"Baahubali: The Beginning\" is not just a film; it's an experience. It combines the rich cultural heritage of India with universal themes of heroism, love, and sacrifice. The storytelling is compelling, and the cliffhanger ending leaves you eagerly awaiting the next installment. This film is a testament to the potential of Indian cinema to deliver world-class entertainment and has rightfully earned its place as a modern classic.\n\nOverall, \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates epic storytelling and cinematic excellence. It is a landmark film that has redefined the boundaries of Indian filmmaking, setting a high bar for future productions.\""

The conquest of Avantika by Baahubali was the culmination of film, valued natural situations malice, play without many \"effects of phrases and bed\" as in Hollywood ... it was Magic, Perfect! For a film with a meager budget of 16milh\u00f5es dollars (Compared to the 300 million Hollywood) is excellent! The local artists, unknown and played their roles, although the Indian culture refers us to a young man whose beauty hinders our identification with the character. Great story! By constraints facing the film is excellent worth watching! Excellent movie with 3 exceptions: 1 Tapped hair \"epic\" of artists valuing played hair or sweat out of his face. It was not cool were hilarious ...  2- The chauvinist Indian culture that is clear in the film even though the queen and the warrior. 3 Peca in special effects, but the audacity to try to overcome the mistakes!

Amazing CGI says IN YOUR FACE to other indian movies.amazing cinematography,story,makeup and BGM.\n\nCast- I was impressed in everyone's acting.the magnum opus made a boost to the already popualar actors career.\n\nPRABHAS-what should i say. He is the bahubali so there is not much to talk about him cause he is just tooooo good.\n\nRANA DAGGUBATI-he is actually having the best perfomance.i actually felt that i liked him who is the villain and not prabhas who is the hero.he only had few years of experience of acting after a couple of flops.but he is just amazing. He also managed to get into bollywood."

The parts about revenge the parts about love and hate were all presented amazingly by this cast and team. Bahubali is a movie that will always be in every south Indian's heart. Tammanah and anushka were so pretty and fit for the role. The detailing they added to everything was amazing, the cgi was believable and presented beautifully. This movie is a must watch, it's just perfect."

S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.\n\nI was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is an example of how the movie industry has evolved in India. Baahubali:The Beginning a story about a lost prince who unexpectedly returns to his kingdom under certain circumstances.The story is this simple but screenplay and execution was merely new and never seen before.Lets break it down into a few parts.Firstly,director SS Rajamouli has proved that he is one of the most creative director's in Indian cinema if not in the whole world.His previous movies like Eega and Maghadheera might be low on budget,but new in the creative world and top notch in execution and production value.Again,in this movie he proves that he can use big money to big and great effect.I have to admit that the VFX in this was not perfect,in some parts like the snow scene and the bull scene the green screen is clearly seen,but other than that the VFX is just so brilliant that one would not believe that they are watching an animated live action movie,simply magnificent,especially with a budget of $18 million,thinking about movies that has budgets like $100-200 million and still fail to do good VFX.The sceneries in this film is beautifully shown,especially the scenes with the waterfall at the beginning.Now coming to the war sequences,it was really amazing.I just found out that this is the highest rated war feature film ever on IMDb ever.It thoroughly deserves it.While watching the 40 minute war sequence was so interesting that it felt like it happened in a few minutes.I have to give a big thumbs up for the entire Baahubali team and director SS Rajamouli for creating this state of the art war scene that has been never witnessed before in any cinema.One could never imagine the hard work put in by the entire crew and adding every small detail in this masterpiece of a scene.For the amount that they spent,this is far a better execution that anyone expected.Bringing in more than 5,000 people for this war scene is not a joke,and showing it this convincing for the first time in the taking is never a downhill task,it was purely amazing and great,hats off SS Rajamouli for this alone.Now lets look at the performances of the cast.I never knew anything about Prabhas in the past,but after this I feel like looking at his previous movies.He just blew us away with his mind blowing performance as a son,king,lover and many more.His performance shows how much dedication and hard work has been put in by him just to do these roles successfully.SS Rajamouli has sketched his character perfectly and Prabhas has don his role superbly well that nobody could have ever done it like this.Supporting casts like Rana,Anushka and Tammana did extremely well.Rana was awesome as a brother and villain for Baahubali.Special mentions has to go down to Ramya Radhakrisnan and Satyaraj,both these actors added the extra flair to the movie and subsequently made the movie look brilliant in many parts.For me Satyaraj and Ramya Rdhakrishnan should win the most awards after Prabhas in this film.They were great.Coming to the music,the movie had a great back ground score and songs all the way.Some of the song numbers gave me goose bumps big time.The cinematography of this film is simply breathtaking,kudos to the cameraman. I have written so much and there is still so much more to say about this film and I know I can't fit it all in one review.All I know is that this movie is magnificent piece of art which showcases Indian cinema in the best way possible.Every Indian should and I think will watch this movie.Final say,keep the doors wide open for Indian cinema,we are coming soon."

It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over.

This is probably the first Telugu hero who is actually built for all the action and fights. Rana was also great as the antagonist. Bravo to both of these guys for not only their acting in the film, but also their dedication to their character and spending a lot of time in the weight room. Ramya Krishnan, Nasser, and Satyaraj were all fantastic as well as supporting characters. This was a new kind of role for Tamannah as this was the first time I've seen her as a serious character in a movie. Anushka was also really good and her makeup was very convincing. The music and soundtrack was excellent also. It was so good. Songs weren't that great but the music made up for that. And the highly anticipated VFX effects were very solid for the most part. This is a beautifully looking film and there are only a few scenes where the effects could be made out. The battle scenes were Hollywood caliber. Rajamouli took a lot of inspiration from Hollywood films for the battle scenes, and it definitely paid off. The only reason Baahubali doesn't get a 10 is that the 1st half isn't as strong and entertaining as the 2nd half, and it felt a little boring at some points. Overall, this was an excellent film + and I can't wait for the sequel to come next year. From A+ to F, Baahubali: The Beginning gets an A."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of India identify him as the maker of the 2012 sleeper hit Makkhi (aka Eega/Naan EE/Eecha) as well as the reincarnation saga, Magadheera (Maaveeran in Tamil). However, in the annals of Tollywood, S.S. Rajamouli, is better recognized as the serial blockbuster maker with a Midas touch. Even his lesser known earlier movies have spawn successful remakes/dubbed versions in multiple Indian languages. Seen thus, he is among the few regional film makers who can rightfully claim of winning adulation and appreciation across the country.\n\nBaahubali, Rajamouli's ambitious magnum opus, to be presented in two parts - The Beginning released now to be followed by The Conclusion next year - owes much of its existence to the critical and commercial success of Makkhi (2012) where Rajamouli proved that he could weave a riveting revenge saga with a humble housefly as the protagonist. One can also say that Baahubali as well as Rajamouli's dream took flight with the tender wings of that housefly which could establish him as a maker who could assure delivering the goods on a much larger scale and reach.\n\nSet in a fictional medieval land, Baahubali - The Beginning is a revenge saga of a royal family where the long lost prince - Shivu (Prabhas) - would be seen avenging the injustices of a cruel and corrupt king - Ballala Deva (Rana Daggubati) who murdered his father - king Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) and imprisoned his mother - Devasena (Anushka Shetty goes completely de-glam). While the story is as old as humanity itself, it is in his presentation that Rajamouli scores his aces. Without doubt the design and execution of the movie is on a scale hitherto unseen in Indian cinema. The movie boasts of state of the art CGI which could rival most of what is on offer from Hollywood which is seamlessly complemented by gorgeous art design of the ever-dependable Sabu Cyril which is captured by K.K. Senthil Kumar to spellbinding effect. While the songs themselves are quite unremarkable, music director M.M. Keeravani (aka Maragadhamani) has amped up the intensity of the action set pieces with an energetic score. The extended action set piece of the battle which forms the finale has been spectacularly conceived and rendered by Peter Hein and his team. In fact, the visionary director, his visual effects team, Sabu Cyril and K.K. Senthil Kumar as well as the audacious producer who believed in the director and his team to deliver the wares are the real stars of this movie. Speaking of the star cast, Prabhas and Rana bring on an intense screen presence with their hulking herculean builds even as veteran Ramya Krishna matches them with her fiery presence. Satyaraj (as Kattappa) and Nasser (as Pingala Deva) excel in their minor cameos.\n\nS.S. Rajamouli has the rare twin gifts of being a visual artist and an entertaining storyteller. In Baahubali - The Beginning, he has let the visual artist to overshadow the storyteller in him. Baahubali has several instances where Rajamouli doffs his hat - without copying, per se - to Hollywood masters like James Cameron, Peter Jackson as well as local influences like the epics of Ramayana, Mahabaratha along with notable works in Bollywood and his own earlier works.\n\nIf one were to count the failings of the movie, I would flag the lack of emotional connect with the story and its characters, especially coming from a maker who could hook us and root for the revenge saga of a humble housefly. The insipid romance between Prabhas and Tamannah is unconvincing and is the chief culprit resulting in the extra long first half which feels a tad of dragging. Nonetheless, the movie remains consistently engrossing as Rajamouli shifts the action from one verdant locale to another which rise up in majestic CGI visuals which are well crafted with the exception of few blemishes which look phony.\n\nBaahubali - The Beginning heralds the breach of the long held and accepted horizons of Indian film-makers and explores brave new visual vistas where contemporary Hollywood has held reign for a decade or more. Now, if only our film makers build more muscle in the storytelling side too, our films would be celebrated across the world, besides India. But, till then, Rajamouli and his team richly deserve the shower of praises that are to come their way for imagining and executing an epic entertainer that has taken Indian cinema to an all new apex. Hope he scales greater heights and concludes his epic saga with a fitting finale. I AM WAITING !!"

As always, there are a lot of scenes that will destroy your brain cells with how over the top and stupid they are, but let's be real, you wouldn't be watching this if you weren't expecting that. The thing that elevates \"B\u00e3hubali\" above the rest of India's blockbusters is the fact that it feels like a story written by a kid who is hardcore into heroic fantasy. How is that different from the rest of the movies from India you ask? Well, because this story is somehow actually cool despite being written by a kid! And so, while I was watching the movie, despite my brain screaming from pain this Tollywood absurdity has been putting me through, the kid in me was in awe how cool it feels at the same time. It's hard to explain, but somehow, with it's style and approach to editing \"B\u00e3hubali\" manages to keep you entertained and interested during it's two and a half hours runtime. And, honestly, I really don't expect nor want much more from a movie like this. Therefore, I recommend it to everyone! Turn off your brain and let the kid inside you watch and enjoy itself. 8/10!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Baahubali Baahubali - The Beginning is a film co-written and directed by S S Rajamouli. As I remember watching the trailer about 3 years ago, I could go on praising the grandeur of the film. And I watched the film back then and couldn't stop praising it. Watching it again after a long time, made me feel nostalgic.\n\nPlot: Shivudu's life changes after he meets Avanthika\n\nStory and direction: I still don't think that there is nothing that is quite great with the story. It is a mishmash of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Anyone watching it will know what I am talking about. But the way S S Rajamouli has taken what we know and incorporated into the world of Mahismati is incredible. The story also doesn't provide you all the information at once. It keeps the mystery so that the audience stay intrigued and interested. You can see the hard work that has gone into the making of this magnum-opus. I can go on praising the Mahismati kingdom. The characters are also varied and interesting. You can care for each character that is in the film. The stunt sequences are also great and look very much real (quite rare in South Indian cinema). But everything has faults and so does this one. I felt the romantic track was added just to bring the audience to the theatres. It just added to the runtime and nothing substantial was there in that. Also the VFX was OK. In some scenes, you can just guess that green/blue screen was used. Also the editing is not crisp. Characters happen to just pop up at some places. Some scenes also never made sense.\n\nPerformances: Prabhas stole the show. His dual roles as Babhubali and Shivudu were impressive. Rana Daggubati was great too. The stern and angered looks were nicely carried by him. Sathyaraj was impressive as Katappa. Nassar looked cruel as Bijjalaeva. Ramya Krishnan was beyond praise as Sivagami. Tamannah Bhatia was eye-candy for me. Anushka Shetty was also good in the role provided.\n\nMusic: Very rarely I do love South Indian music. M M Keeravani delivers some great songs and an impressive background score. Although I liked each and every song of the film, 'Dheevera' was the one that impressed me the most.\n\nFavorite Scene: The scene just before the interval where Shivudu helps in the installation of the golden statue of Bhallaladeva. When one person happens to see Shivudu and says 'Baahubali' and everyone just repeat the same, the energy they get helps in the installation of the statue. The sheer grandness and respect for Baahubali the people have inspired me a lot.\n\nVerdict: Even with its faults and some stupidity, Baahubali is an enjoyable experience. I was never bored even for a milli-second.\n\nI am going with an 8/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I learnt about this movie through memes and social media blogs. I didn't have a TV connection back then and I wasn't much into pop culture, so I didn't really know what this movie was about. I just saw that this movie had a lot of special effects and it used animators, so obviously it had to be good. I practically begged my parents to let me see this movie in the theatres. I hadn't been to the theatres for the last 7 years, and they finally gave me the permission to see this one. And I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed to its fullest only in the theatres. Everything about it was superb - the CGI (considering the technology and experience of CGI in India is not very advanced), the acting, the music, the colour palette, the locations, the overall tone, everything is perfect. Watching Shiva climb the waterfalls, the battle scenes, Shiva alone pulling Bhallaldeva's statue, all of this looked great when being watched on a giant screen.\n\nThe story finally ended on a cliffhanger for the second part, which is another movie for which I requested my parents to let me see, but that's for the other review. But it was an actual good cliffhanger, unlike the usual sequel baiters that we normally see in high budget action or superhero movies, or the money squeezing that happens when one movie becomes successful. This one actually meant it.\n\nThis movie basically introduced me to South Indian cinema. Until then I was thinking all South Indian movies are the same, with unrealistic actions and cringy humour. But this one was different. Just by looking at it you know this one really means business. I hope in future we will get to see more such Indian movies that make us proud that we have a film industry that prioritises quality over quantity."

Prabhas is truly a star and carries the movie with his solid performance. There are a few strong female leads mainly the Queen mother portrayed by Ramya.

I don't understand how this movie can even be compared to Lord of the Rings or 300.\n\n\"Try hard\" is the best way I can describe this movie. It's like if you see an experience martial artist do a Kata and you try to copy the movement without understanding what a Kata is. You may think your movement was identical, but those who know about martial art will see the flaws. It's exactly what this movie is doing, it tries to be that epic breath taking movie, but don't understand what made those movie epic in the first place. So we end up with our over the top hero who \"tries hard\" to be badass, but end up being laughable instead, serious scene who \"tries hard\" to be sad and dramatic, but falls into the melodramatic and end us making us laugh.\n\nYou may say it's a matter of taste, but even on a technical level the movie fails. To make a good slow motion you have to film it at a higher frame rate. Because there is more frame per seconds, when you slow it down, you end up with a crystal clear slow motion. In other word, slow motion scenes need to be carefully planned. That's not what this movie is doing and what result of it is a tacky and blurry looking scene. Also balance...if you try to make every little action look epic...nothing end up looking epic.\n\nIt's sad this movie could have had some potential (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.), some scenes do look good and the actors aren't that bad. Its a shame their acting is ruined by over dramatic (to not say parodic) camera shots and bad directing."

The detailing of each aspect of the film,be it the costumes,weaponry,sets especially the grandeur of Mahamishti Kingdom make this film a visual spectacle. The VFX is outstanding,never seen before in Indian Cinema and it wont be wrong to say that they match up to Hollywood standards. Two scenes that that will simply take your breath away are;the waterfall climbing and the war sequences. I can vouch that these are the most well crafted scenes in Indian Cinema.\n\nActing. Prabhas plays the double role of Sivudu/Baahubali. He has pulled off both the roles with great ease. This is the best performance of his career till date. Rana Daggubatti is menacing as the villain Bhallala Dev. Ramya is brilliant. Sudeep has a small role but he plays his part with perfection. The rest of the cast overacts which is a big letdown.\n\nMusic The background is the best one which I have ever heard. M. M. Kreem's soundtrack is a brilliant. All the songs compliment the story and are well written.\n\nVerdict. I go 9/10 for this marvel. The film is way ahead from the ones made in bollywood and will surely bring Indian Cinema into the big league."

Phenomenal script.\n\n\"Baahubali: The Beginning\" and its sequel \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\" stand as towering monuments in the realm of Indian cinema. Directed by S. S. Rajamouli, these epic films have not only redefined the boundaries of Indian filmmaking but have also captivated audiences worldwide with their grandeur, storytelling, and visual splendor.\n\nFrom the very first frame, \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" immerses viewers into a mesmerizing world filled with rich mythology, breathtaking landscapes, and larger-than-life characters. The film follows the journey of Shivudu, a young man with humble beginnings, as he discovers his royal lineage and embarks on a quest to reclaim his rightful throne.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of \"Baahubali\" is its unparalleled visual spectacle. Every frame is meticulously crafted, showcasing stunning sets, intricate costumes, and awe-inspiring visual effects that transport the audience to the mythical kingdom of Mahishmati. Whether it's the breathtaking waterfall sequence or the epic battle scenes, the film's visuals are nothing short of cinematic poetry.\n\nAt the heart of \"Baahubali\" lies a timeless tale of love, betrayal, and redemption. The film masterfully weaves together elements of drama, romance, and action, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its runtime. The chemistry between the characters, particularly the bond between Shivudu and Avanthika, adds depth and emotional resonance to the narrative, making it more than just a spectacle but a compelling human drama.\n\nRajamouli's direction is nothing short of genius, as he seamlessly blends larger-than-life action sequences with intimate character moments. Each character is given their moment to shine, from the valiant Baahubali to the cunning Bhallaladeva, creating a rich tapestry of personalities that drive the story forward. The performances, led by Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, and Anushka Shetty, are top-notch, with each actor fully embodying their respective roles and bringing them to life with nuance and depth.\n\nApart from its technical brilliance and compelling narrative, \"Baahubali\" also serves as a celebration of Indian culture and heritage. From its epic battle sequences inspired by ancient Indian warfare to its portrayal of familial bonds and honor, the film pays homage to the rich tapestry of Indian mythology and history.

The action sequences, in particular, are spectacularly choreographed, showcasing gravity-defying stunts and battles on an epic scale.... \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" stands as a testament to Indian cinema's ability to create visually stunning and emotionally captivating storytelling.

Indian people cant live without putting love stories and bold scene on any kind of movie no matter whether its documentary, drama or action. This movie can be looks good who not watched the class and level of Hollywood. Do not compare it with 300 and Lords of rings. They are light year far ahead from Bollywood. Bollywood is known to make copy of Hollywood scene, story and even dialogue and they even don't think to edit it. Simply use Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. plus the jump scene was a copy from the movie THE DARK KNIGHT RISES..............now, when you realize that the first 20 minutes of the movie contains scenes from over 3 different movies just tell me how much curiosity you would be left with? Its most over-hyped movie ever and Crap Ending for this Movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bahubali review :\n\nBedazzled by the near 3 hour extravaganza scripted and directed by Telugu whiz kid S. S. Rajamouli, I sit down now to write about my movie \"experience\". Yes, Bahubali is not just a film, it's an expeirence; a triumph of Rajamouli's vision and innovation. It is actually a 5+ hour spectacle out of which we get to see only the first part as 'Bahubali:The Beginning'.\n\nRajamouli takes the story outline from Disney 's 'Lion King', indianises it with characters inspired from Mahabharata ( the epic not the TV series) and presents it on a lavish scale in league of 'Lord of the Rings' and '300' series. The end result is a magnum opus never seen before in Indian cinema.\n\nTechnically, the movie is outstanding and every money spent (It's said to be most expensive Indian film) on the mind blowing CGI and VFX reflects on screen. The last hour war sequence matches the grandeur of '300' with possibly just a tenth of that movie's budget. Content wise too, the film connects with its audience and quite a few scenes stand out. The opening waterfall scene, the titular hero (Prabhas) lifting the Shiva linga, the antagonist's entry are imaginatively executed. On flip side, the romantic angle in first half appears distracting. Also, an item song post interval looks forced and needless.\n\nPrabhas and Rana Daggubatti have worked hard on their physique and the effort is evident in their action scenes. Tamannah Bhatia looks pretty and acts better than her Sajid Khan outings in Hindi. Ramya Krishnan and Nasser lend good support.\n\nAfter watching 'Eega' three years ago, I was eagerly awaiting Rajamouli's next. 'Bahubali :The Conclusion' is still a year away. Please bring it earlier, if possible....\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

        "review_detailed_main": "A visual treat.\n\nIf a person is bit of into movies, I am sure that person heard about Baahubali couple of years back. It took almost four years to complete the first part. Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S. S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations 3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have worked their hearts out for this Visual Wonder has paid off well? Not exactly though, since the answer is simple and straight, you just have to wait for the 'Conclusion' till 2016 and that would decide the fate of this franchise on a whole. The story is paced slowly in the first half giving way and screen space to our Mother Nature's beauty and CGI's magic and one might find it a little too draggy if one considers 'Baahubali' to solely be a hero and since that's not possible, Shivudu has a love life and heroic nature and scenes of his own. Abrupt cuts and unconvincing CGI at certain places in first half are the only flaws with the whole film. Coming to the second half, one is told what he'd expect to be told, as the trailer tells the same. War sequences are really well shot and makes it hard to believe that they were actually made by Indians! One has to just bow down to Srinivas Mohan and his team for excellent CGI and Senthil Kumar for superb visuals. As it turns out, it is everything I expected it to be -- mega, ingenious and envelope pushing. There's never a dull moment in this 160-minutes long epic fantasy about a lost prince, rebellion, revenge, rivalry and a shocking betrayal to seize the throne, Our captain gives us a bang, as his trademark style known as 'Interval Bang' only at the end this time because technically this movies' end is the interval for the 2 parts taken as a whole. Art work in this Epic is just out of the world, kudos to Sabu Cyril sir and thousands of technicians who worked on this aspect. BGM is soothing for the first half which is apt for what we get on screen and the second half war episodes get the best of the lot BGMs to elevate the scenes. Songs are places really well except for 'Manohari' song. Dolby Atmos effect is an added attraction and I highly recommend people to watch this flick in theatres with this specific sound system, it will surely remain as a great experience for you. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj Sir does 100% justice to it. Though Prabhas and Rana Daggubati did well only their attitude in their respective roles stands out as the best because more of them is yet to come in the sequel. All you need to do is to watch the movie as it comes because expectations lead to disappointment. If you miss this movie, you've just lost a once in life-time 'Indian' movie experience on a big screen, Please do not add this movie into South Indian movie list. It is an Indian movie that stands on the top of the list. According to the story line everybody did their job well. I have to appreciate Rajamouli for his daring and dashing guts for doing a project like this one. He has set a new trend by directing this movie!"

And cliffhanger at the end keep me waiting impatiently for the Conclusion.\n\nDirection, acting everything nicely complement each other. Leading actors Prabhas and Rana had done lots of hard work which pays off marvelously. They totally own the characters and do that effortlessly. Ramya Krishnan, Satyaraj are heart of the movie. Anushka Shetty is impressive and Tammana looks gorgeous. As a fan of epic movies LOTR, and TV series like GOT and Spartacus it's good to see our very own movie which excel like those. This movie brings new hope that someday we can finally see the adaptations of epic Mahabharata and Ramayana on silver screen which surely will make LOTR run for many... :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was a quantum-leap in terms of indigenous VFX and grand story telling. It generated pan-India appeal and rooted in Indianness as opposed to the popular Bollywood movies which has a lot of global influence and is usually preachy in it's undertones.\n\nIf you are new to Indian cinema and looking for a package of action, drama, romance, value system etc. This would be a great start."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not being all that familiar with Indian cinema or pop culture, I really didn't know what to expect when I added this to my Netflix queue, just that it looked colorful and might be entertaining. Being not all that fond of musicals, I almost bugged out of the movie about fifteen or twenty minutes in.\n\nBut something made me stick with it, and I'm glad I did.\n\nTake one part \"Machiste\" muscleman sword-and-sandal flick, one part \"Lord of the Rings\", add a liberal dose of Shakespearean tragedy, and season the result a bit too heavily (for my taste, anyway) with lavish musical numbers (Okay, I did like the Mahishmati anthem: It's a stirring and very catchy composition.) Garnish with some jaw-dropping wackiness -- from a Western perspective, anyway -- and you've got \"Baahubali\".\n\nI have to admit I found the second movie somewhat better than the first, but by the end of \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" I was captivated by its larger-than-life characters and epic storytelling. This and its sequel are well worth watching, even if like me you're not a big fan of Bollywood films."

        "review_detailed_main": "This comes with a bang into the Indian cinema and sets a benchmark for other Bollywood movies. A wonderful fantasy tale with trendsetting screenplay. The visuals, the dialogues are worth watching multiple times. Prabhas adds new life to Bollywood with his powerful screenplay and so do Ramya and Rana. From the action to the sensual dance to the plot this movie does well in all respect. Rajamouli does a marvel job with the brilliant imagination and execution. Hope to see movies of this class again and again. These movies are one that can make one proud to be an Indian and thing to boast off."
