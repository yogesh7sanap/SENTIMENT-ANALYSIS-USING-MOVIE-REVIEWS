        "review_detailed_main": "I have read plenty of reviews where people are comparing this to 1975's, I don't think that's fair, as the interpretation of the novel is very different. The original film was very much a horror, this is a comedy with virtually no horror at all, but a definite vibe of political correctness.\n\nIt is obviously too sweet and syrupy for many, but it does have good points. It's loaded with irony, it's not laugh out loud humour, it's more tongue in cheek, with some good humour, mainly at the expense of little men. I liked the performances, Glenn Close and Bette Midler especially. It wasn't Kidman's finest hour, although she wasn't bad, just didn't get the best material to work with.\n\nOn the debit side, Matthew Broderick doesn't exactly shine, but worst of all is the lack of any horror vibe, it doesn't really have any suspenseful moments of any note.\n\nIt's a nice vanilla comedy, those looking for horror must avoid. The original movie is way better. 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The original film, and the great novel that preceded it are worthy of a better treatment than this lighthearted, anti-suspenseful, Hollywood variety show. What's more, the excellent veteran cast, the catchy soundtrack and the expensive production values could have made this into the socially serious, poignant and yet funny contemporary masterwork it should have been. Instead, we are left with a film whose campiest moments are clich\u00e9s and whose point seems to be love conquers all - even the sexism, genderism and masculocentrism still rampant in American Society today! I never expect comedies to do a particularly good job with continuity and logic, but some of the continuity problems in this film are really pretty amazing. Plot twists are, after all, supposed to change the COURSE of the plot, not its basic premises. I'm dying to tell you about it, but I won't write a spoiler.\n\nHere are the basics: Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick are a successful couple whose marriage has been suffering a bit because of the stress of their work-lives. Nicole, a TV executive famous for post-feminist male-bashing shows gets fired for no particular reason and they couple decides to move away to Stepford, an exclusive community populated by people who seem to have no particular troubles of any kind, or even jobs for that matter. Some of the first things Matthew Broderick realizes about Stepford is that all of the women are beautiful, and everybody is marvelously happy with a few possible exceptions - his own wife, Bette Midler and a gay liberal whose partner has been sucked into republicanism. Predictably, these three conspire to resist the happiness all around them and investigate the mystery of the Stepford men's club.\n\nI've described the first quarter of the film. Although the central plot is interesting and strong, the lack of even a shred of seriousness detracts very heavily from it - even from a comedic point of view. If this film hadn't made me disinterested, the feminist in me would have simply been angry over the missed opportunity this film represents. Moreover, it is possible to see this film as a justification of the 'blame the victim' mentality so often prevalent in contemporary culture.\n\nMost of the cast seems equally unengaged. They sometimes seem to be playing roles in different films - interacting with each other poorly and playing their roles with no particular goal in mind. I can only fault the director here. Broderick and Kidman are, as usual, very watchable, but even Nicole seems to be unsure what her character is supposed to be portraying at times. Bette Midler is fine, as are Walken and Glenn Close. Close was actually, IMO, the show stealer - making the film tolerable with her excruciatingly irritating and very dominant presence.\n\nWhile not a complete travesty, I can not recommend The Stepford Wives."

And it's fun and funny.\n\nIt is =NOT= a serious film like the first one was. The first one was epic, a real mystery, a real slow burn, a must watch film. And if you haven't seen it yet, don't spoil yourself by watching this first. No, go to see THAT one first, then this one as a very sweet after dinner dessert.\n\nFor this particular incarnation is like a sugar coated Easter egg with a bite already taken out of it, dripping with gooey sweetness to show you how silly and completely off the wall it is. It is not in the least bit scary.\n\nPlace this more along the lines of PLEASANTVILLE and you have a more accurate picture on the theme, plot, and general and overall feeling of the film. --dw817 (11-13-19)"

There is relatively little social commentary or suspense, in fact the only suspenseful scene is just funny. The hows and whats of what the ladies are isn't really addressed much, in part because it would be more disturbing than this movie wants to be. On the other hand, it never breaks character, so you can just cruise comfortably to the end, laughing every minute or so.\n\nAs a professional horticulturist, I must mention the plantings and flower arrangements. The orchids were just becoming available at grocery stores and the gladiolus in the \"plantings\" must have been hand placed in some cases, cause they don't grow in graceful sprays.

The place is wonderful, and the women are very beautiful and perfect housewives, and after a short period living there, Joanna discloses the truth behind such perfection. \"The Stepford Wives\" is a funny comedy, having a magnificent cast and some good moments. There are many good lines, like for example, when one woman has a \"problem\" in a party and somebody says: \"-She is drunk.\"; and Bette Midler's character immediately says: \"-She is blonde\". Or when one of the designers mentions that he worked at AOL, and Joanna says: \"-Is that why the women are so slow?\". Unfortunately, I have never watched the original adaptation of Ira Levin's book mentioned in many reviews, but anyway I found this 2004 version a good entertainment.

Bette Midler, always a welcome relief, goes through her changes withous allowing us to understand or care how, when or why.

There was no disappointment with the cast, the actors made the movie flow nicely. The movie was a bit fast paced, not letting you get too attached to the characters. There wasn't anything deep or scary about it. I liked the fact that the film came off light and comical. My favorite thing about the entire movie is how quirky it was while brushing it off with comedy. It was a very unusual story, but I think that's what makes it so interesting. The only thing I really did not enjoy about the movie is how the main message seemed to be \"Woman are superior to men\". To me that is just being sexiest against men, what happened to equality and gender does not matter? Even though the film had the theme of \"woman rule\" it was still funny and entertaining to watch."

It's as if Frank Oz had a good idea but got bored half-way through realising it. I haven't seen the original but surely the actors who got involved in this read the script of the remake? They can't have based their participation on the Seventies film, surely. Because the 2004 remake is full of awful cliches, bad jokes (OK, there are a couple of good lines but that's about it) and it is so empty of ideas that it makes you want to shout to the screen. If the actors playing in this film were unknowns there is NO WAY anyone would have gone to see it. It's just a parade of famous names (some good actors, some average) that sleepwalk through a dreadful script. It can't even become a cult classic - it's THAT average. 1/10 for me and that's being lenient."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Stepford Wives did what it set out to do. It took the dark and creepy story of 1975 and turned it into a black comedy- and that was its smartest move. To remake this film into a mysterious thriller like the original, would have been a huge mistake. So it is only fair to recognize that its intention was to make you laugh, and it did just that. Although the film isn't overflowing with comedy, it is filled with its fair share of good humor. The best thing the movie had going for it was the element of surprise. The original 'Stepford' wasn't the most successful film, so it is highly possible that a large amount of today's audience has never seen the original movie. But even if you havn't seen the original, the trailer to this remake gives away almost every surprise in the film. In result, the viewer's enjoyment rests heavily on the last few minutes of the film. This is where the disappointment comes in. I won't give away details, but the ending does have a huge unexpected twist; but it's just not satisfying enough. Even though I completely enjoyed myself while watching the film, and was genuinely shocked at the twist ending, I was still disappointed when the movie ended. But as I look back on seeing the film, I realize that there is no way around this disappointment. The flaws lie in the story, not just the adapted screenplay. See the film, and if it's a let down, ask yourself how it could have actually been better than what it was. The answer is it couldn't be. The story is just a flop in its own way. It leads you on a long and winding road of intrigue, but in the end, you know this can't take you anywhere but to a dead end. And even though there are some loose ends that leave you unsatisfied and partly confused, you have to realize that this film was made all in fun. And with that on your mind, you should enjoy yourself in watching the movie, but don't get your hopes up for too grand of a finale, because most of the film you can see in the preview. Because of Stepford's comedic turn, I grant this film 7 STARS. And I'm sure it would be easier to agree with me if you didn't see the trailer before you saw the film itself."

Nicole Kidman, well her presence can be understood in that she is trying real hard to make a stable career for herself...she is a very talented actress (witness \"The Others\")...give yourself a break Nicole and stop trying too hard. I tried to watch this, seriously tried, but before the first hour was us I was folding laundry as that was much more inspiring then this film. My advice, go do some laundry yourself instead of wasting your time. Too much dressing (great actors) not enough substance...a sad, sad film."

The main differences have to deal with the addition of a gay male character who is very funny, as well as a twist ending that I didn't see coming. There's an old saying that \"Your imperfections are what make you beautiful.\" Obviously the men of Stepford have never quite grasped that concept. The movie could've been so much better but it's good for a laid back popcorn night of fun. I remember reading that there were a lot of problems with this movie being made, but luckily not much of that shows in the final product."

And let me share this much, I went on a Wednesday 9pm showing and it was crowded. The audience was cracking up along with me.\n\nI loved the film, Glenn Close stole the movie -- and Bette Midler was her partner in crime! The ending was a great twist and was a riot.\n\nThe original has long been a chilling favorite of mine and it can stand on its own in that thriller genre as much as this remake can stand on its own as a comedy and eventual thriller with a twist!\n\nI applaud Paul Rudnick, the cast, the Director & crew: this movie was a blast and I would urge everyone to see it!\n\nBrava!"

The original version was almost one step away from a horror movie, but this one is more satirical. And to the extent that it is a remake, they expand on the original version to make it more like the 21st century.\n\nAlthough Nicole Kidman gets top billing, my favorite character was Bette Midler, as brassy author Bobbie Markowitz; just listen to some of her book titles (warning: they're not for the squeamish). Also starring Matthew Broderick as Joanna's husband Walter Cresby, and Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, and Jon Lovitz as some of Stepford's other citizens (you'll probably either laugh or get irked by Glenn Close's comment about Bette Midler).\n\nSo what would YOU think of living in Stepford?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Charming Joanna (Nicole Kidman) is a successful and creative journalist of a TV channel , then she suffers a breakdown for a programme . She along with her hubby (Matthew Broderick) and children are moved from Manhattan towards the quaint little town of Stepford (Conneticut) , a very modern and upper class location . She didn't like the neighborhood with attractive and perfect but unintelligent housewives . She is concerned that many wives spend their lives in domestic slavery . Joanna early befriends a pair good friends (Bette Midler and John Lovitz). Meanwhile , her husband joins the mysterious Stepford Men's club (run by a powerful Christopher Walken and married another too perfect wife , Glenn Close) which takes place in an old Manor house . Joanna soon discovers there lies a dark truth about the strange and servitude behavior in the all female residents and the sinister secrets hidden in the Stepford town .\n\nThe film is an amiable comedy with sci-fi , thriller elements and a little bit of drama . Heavily re-edited and re-written following test screenings , with new scenes shot and others deleted . The attempts to cater to audience tastes backfired as the new edits and scenes created continuity errors and major story problems . The casting is frankly well . Thus , a beautiful Kidman and good comedian actors : Broderick, Midler , Lovitz . Jolly and lively music by David Arnold . Special mention to colorful and glimmer cinematography by Rob Hahm . This new rendition is preferably a comedy , while the old version by Brian Forbes with Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss was a chiller and considered to be very superior and being almost a classic film and followed three inferior sequels : \u00a8Revenge Stepford wives \u00a8, \u00a8Stepford children\u00a8, \u00a8Stepford husbands\u00a8 . The film was regularly directed by Frank Oz . The picture will appeal to the gorgeous Nicole Kidman fans. Rating : Average but amusing ."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, given the reviews it got. But how bad could a movie be with this cast? As it turns out, VERY bad. But I have to think that some plot and character development was lost on the cutting room floor.\n\nThe opening credit sequence is absolutely brilliant, with witty use of vintage '50s clips of housewives in their \"miracle kitchens of the future\" and that sort of thing. Deliberately choppy editing and occasionally speeded up action lend the sequence a mechanical feel on top of its satirical air. Too bad nothing else in the movie measures up to it.\n\nI did think there were a couple of decent laughs, mainly when Glenn Close was on screen. Roger Bart, playing a gay stereotype we've seen too many times in recent movies, milks it for all its worth and earns some chuckles, too. But Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick often seem lost. Christopher Walken, Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz are all mostly boring here, hard as it is to believe.\n\nI haven't seen the '70s version in ages, but I remember thinking it was OK but campier than it was meant to be. Upping the camp level was not a bad idea for the remake, but I don't know what happened with the screenplay. Paul Rudnick is no genius, but he's done far better.\n\nI get the feeling that major scenes must have been cut out for some reason, as the plot development felt awkward especially in the early scenes. It might be worth renting the DVD for the deleted scenes.\n\nAlso, as others have stated, the movie is totally inconsistent on the point of whether the women are robots or have simply had their brains altered. It's as if they figured we wouldn't really be playing close attention, so what difference did it make?\n\nMy bottom line advice -- if you get a chance to see it without paying, watch the opening credits and then change the channel."

Nicole Kidman sparkles again, but one could expect a little more ambition from someone with her ability.

This movie is absolutely nothing and I am sad for being spent my time and money on this riduculas movie-called trash. First of all, it is intented to be a movie for grown ups, but everything, including acting, is just childish. Nicole thinks of something and voila it is all done and the Stepford is rescued. What is this really? It may have been good in the past but now I could not understand how anyone can like and, more terrible, can make this kind on movies. I don't know who Frank Oz, the director is, but I promise to not to go to any of his movies, because if all of them are just like this one, he can keep them in his private collection. Actually, I am sad because, I really liked the story and the idea of seeking perfection but the plot and the realization of the whole scenario is so premature that it makes you curse and curse and curse. With little talent and more realistic conclusions this could have been at least a watchable movie. But right now, it is just an idiotic masturbation of Frank Oz. Sorry, but I just can't accept being treated as an idiot. Also, if Nicole Kidman is participating in these kind of projects then I should be sorry for her as well, because most probably she is getting old and uncapable of better roles. I am sorry, if I offended anyone, but this movie sucks in every aspect. I rarely write my opinions on world wide web, but the movie made me so angry that I decided to warn you about it. It is the worst movie that you will ever see."

I was a big fan of almost every cast member, including Glenn Close, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, and of course Bette Midler. The cast member's performances were pretty good, not Oscar worthy by any means, but still pretty good fit the kind of movie it was. Some scenes were funny, including the scene with the wive's book club. Let me just say that for me personally, Bette Midler was the best part of this entire movie, by far. The script was kinda lackluster and poor, and some of the jokes were just bad, and didn't work. I would've liked a little less comedy and a little more seriousness. The look of the film was good, the shots and costume design and sets all looked very good. Overall, the movie was just a little too silly for my personal taste. So would I recommend The Stepford Wives (2004)? No. It's not worth your time, there are much better movies out there to enjoy. After re watching it: I liked a lot of the jokes better, the comedy works, I found myself laughing so much the 2nd time I watched it. It was a lot more entertaining this time, and I had fun watching it, it's a comedic, cute, interesting film. My NEW rating: 7/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Stepford Wives has some really funny moments in it but in the end its one big mess. In this remake of the 1975 thriller, Nicole Kidman plays a professional woman who moves to the beautiful suburb of Stepford with her husband (Matthew Broderick), only to discover that all their female neighbors are a bit too perfect, lacking any semblance of personality or character, and completely subservient to the men. Along with the town's only normal woman, a sarcastic alcoholic played by Bette Midler, they must uncover the secret of Stepford and why all the men are all so deliriously happy. The original was a Thriller and a Mystery this one is a Comedy, Drama and a Thriller. So that's its first problem it doesn't know what its wants to be, even though I have never seen the original I know it has to be a lot better then the remake. The film has the comedy down with some really funny dialog but the rest falls apart. There are some dramatic scenes but its hard to tell if its making fun of itself and most of the dramatic scenes are boring anyways. There's no thrills in this movie so if your expecting something exactly like the original you will end up disappointed. The film has a top notch cast and that helps out a lot. First there's Nicole Kidman, she is very good as Joanna and at the end she's very pretty. Bette Middler is hilarious and she steals the movie having all the best lines. Glenn Close is good as Claire Wellington and she brings humor into the film. Christopher Walken is good as well and makes up for the horrible Envy. Matthew Broderick is horrible in his role and I think he is funny in some movies but most of the time I don't really like him and also he hasn't made a good film since Election. Jon Lovitz and Faith Hill are in it too but they aren't used much. Overall The Stepford Wives has a messed up story that's funny but not very scary like it promises. Rating 5/10 this is a decent movie to watch now that its out on video and worth watching if you're a fan of any of the stars involved."

Her husband moves the whole family to the town of Stepford--a quiet little town where Joanna can recover. Joanna notices something strange about the town--all the women LOVE doing housework and cooking, look perfect at all times, are ALWAYS happy and do anything for their husbands. Slowly Joanna realizes something is terribly wrong...and this is a comedy! This remake of the 1975 horror movie takes the plot and (almost) the entire screenplay and turns it into a comedy. The making of this movie (I heard) was a nightmare. Cast member Bette Midler had screaming arguments with director Frank Oz, there were numerous rewrites, there were (at one point) FIVE different endings and other cast members hated the changes made in mid production. Preview audiences hated what the saw and the whole movie was overhauled--many subplots were deleted and the ending was changed! I expected the worst but--it's not too bad.\n\nThe beginning was dreadful--it was a very unfunny bit about a reality show gone wrong with people being killed. Homicide is not funny. It really picked up when they moved to Stepford. That's when it actually got pretty funny. There were plenty of stupid jokes but the good ones more than made up for them--the introduction of Robo Rover 3000 was VERY funny. It does fall apart at the end but it was still pretty good.\n\nThe acting--Kidman is just great--she handles the comedy and drama very well; Matthew Broderick (all grown up) was OK as her husband; Bette Midler was hysterical as a very crude neighbor and Glenn Close was just wonderful as the VERY sweet wife of the mayor. Christopher Walken however was DREADFUL as the mayor--but there may have been a reason for that.\n\nNot bad but no great shakes. The major problem is the obvious cutting and a bad ending. The infighting couldn't have helped either. Worth seeing--but don't go out of your way."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie should have been a disaster. The character development was weak, the script was uninspiring, the jokes were clich\u00e9d and the whole sequence of events throughout the whole movie was exceedingly predictable. Even though I haven't read the novel, I'm quite sure that this movie was quite a weak and flawed adaptation of the story contained within the book. You can actually see from watching the movie that the original novel must have had a significant and intriguing depth and dimension that fails to be conveyed in the movie. And I'm quite sure the book had a much more intellectual focus than this movie did. If not for the excellent performances of the main players in the cast, I'm quite sure this movie would have been a flop\n\nBut it isn't. And the fact that it isn't can be attributed entirely to the excellent acting provided by Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick and to some extent Bette Midler. They manage to give this movie some life, vitality and enthusiasm that is sadly missing from the whole script and plot of this movie.\n\nNicole Kidman is outstanding in her portrayal of Joanne Eberhard. She portrays the various dimensions of her character's personality with a radiance and a realistic quality that gives a depth that effectively brings her character to life even with the flaws and defects of her script. Glenn Close also gives a flawless and wonderful performance as Clare Wellington and perfects every aspect and dimension of her character through her facial expressions, her manner of speaking and her strong on-screen persona. Matthew Broderick also performs strongly in his role even though the aspects of his character and his adjustment to Stepford could have been explored much more extensively on the part of the scriptwriters. Midler also portrays her role excellently \u0096although she runs the risk of being typecast in the role of the characters that she has consistently played in various movies. And Roger Bart is absolutely priceless in his role as the `Stepford husband'\n\nThis film does suffer from some major flaws but, despite this, it is still relatively pleasant and enjoyable to view. It will never be a classic but is nevertheless harmless fun"

They all soon realize that something isn't right in Stepford. Why are the women of Stepford so perfect? They'll have to solve the mystery before it's to late and they'll turn into one of them!\n\nThis is a hilarious comedy thriller that'll make you laugh the whole way! Lines are memorable in this film and there are some sweet moments. The original film was a horror and Frank Oz took his risk to make this remake a comedy. Well, it looked like it worked. The acting for Kidman, Broderick, Midler, Bart's performances are hilarious! They'll put a big smile to your faces when you watch this film.\n\nThere is a plot hole in this movie I can't get out of my mind. It's how they make the Stepford wives. Are they robots or implants transplanted in their heads? Well, we can let it out of the way.\n\nThis film is hilarious and anyone could see it. It's not a chick flick. This is not as bad as many people had said so trust my review. It's really funny!"

I heard horrible things about it and eventually went to see it this weekend solely because I knew it was a chance to see a stellar cast of actors in a really bad film....most of the principles in the film have either won or been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe original book and film were a chilling portrayal of how far men would go to control women. The fact that both book and film came about in the early/mid seventies during the height of the women's movement made it even more relevant and both book and film stand the test of time.\n\nThe movie I saw this weekend had nothing to do with the original material. Paul Rudnick is a great, quirky writer, but re-writing this material was not his fort\u00e9. Plus, how much more muddled could this story be? In the original, Joanna was a troubled woman who had many layers to her character.....in this version, she's an obnoxious TV executive who you could really care less about. They couldn't even decide if the women in the film were robots or just had their brains altered. No one can seem to decide on the answer to this issue. They made some lame attempts at real horror by repeating scenes from the original film: Joanna discovering her robot without the eyes and the scene in the supermarket. The supermarket scene was the final horror in the original film....You knew the real Joanna had been murdered by her robot replacement and that there was no hope to be found. In this version, it's followed by a complete, nonsensical \"happy ending\" that was annoying to say the least.\n\nThe only thing I can give this movie credit for is that they brought it into the modern age by adding a gay couple. At least that's something."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm generally wary of remakes, especially when studios can do nothing better with the original material than update it with current stars and a dumbed-down script. Remaking \"The Stepford Wives\" as a comedy was an inspired idea, but the resulting movie is not. The potential to turn Ira Levin's thriller into a black comedy is there, but in the hands of screenwriter Paul (\"In & Out\") Rudnick and director Frank Oz, \"The Stepford Wives\" is light n' amusing--and muddled--fluff. Rudnick is quick with the one-liners, but seems unsure with the plot, which is filled with contradictions. For instance, are these women being turned into robots or do they just have a chip implanted in their brains? (The movie presents both explanations with no attempt to reconcile them.) And the tacked-on epilogue appears to be just that: tacked on.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to overlook flaws in its plotting and obviousness in its humor, there are two reasons to see \"The Stepford Wives\": Bette Midler and Glenn Close. Midler is Midler, but that's exactly what her fans want. And following such un-funny comic vehicles as \"Isn't She Great\" and \"Drowning Mona,\" it was nice to enjoy her in a movie again. Close is perfect as Claire Wellington, the most domineering of Stepford's wives, simultaneously creepy and hilarious. An honorable mention goes to Roger Bart, who plays one half of Stepford's token gay couple as if channeling the spirit of the late Paul Lynde. Top-billed stars Matthew Broderick and Nicole Kidman have their moments, but they're easily upstaged by Midler and Close.\n\nBy keeping your expectations low, there are enough laughs in this comic take \"The Stepford Wives\" to make it worth seeing, if only at matinee prices."

It was the east coast N.O.W. culture in the movies. Supposedly it was a horror movie with the obviously politically correct nod toward woman's lib. There was no horror it was just long and boring. This one is much better and probably too short. Their's some good dialogue and humor that makes the settings less picture perfect. The settings are pleasing to the eye much as the housewives but the husbands are software executives and would like their woman more compatible, like their computers. So they decide to combine the two. I think Matthew Broderick is a good choice to play Nicole Kidman's husband. He's very likable and not as pushy until the other husbands work him over. Kidman plays a successful television executive who loses her job after a reality show she made backfires. This is an entertaining comedy and doesn't try to be anything more."

Nicole Kidman does a fantastic job as Joanna Eberhart, a high strung business woman who gets fired from her job and suffers from a nervous breakdown. Matthew Broderick plays Walter Kresby, her supportive yet worn out husband who yearns to get away from the big smoke. Along with their two kids they move to Stepford, a perfect town that becomes a bit too creepy from the first moment they move in. Bette Midler and Roger Bart are hilarious as Bobbie Markovitz & Roger Bannister. If I ever moved into a creepy town like that, they would be the two characters I would love to have as friends.\n\nThis movie is fun to watch and I give it a 7/10!\n\n(Although I think Nicole Kidman could do with a bit more food!)"

The idea behind this film. I haven't read Ira Levin's novel. So the idea quite fascinated me. And the presentation in the film deliberately using stereotypes in every character is something that fits.\n\nReason not to see the film:\n\n1. The futile and irritating attempt to make this film a comedy. I gather that Levin's novel has no comic elements. It would be better if they restrict the story to plain thriller. the necessary dark humor is the plot itself. One doesn't need to overdo it.\n\nSo, I'd definitely try to see the original 1975 film. This film has a star-studded cast, but as a film it's hardly above average."

However it is good to know that I am not the only one doing this only to realize there is nothing wrong with you just the way you are. Laughter was hear throughout the cinema and the actors were so entertaining. So nice to see them all doing something different and moving away from their normal pigeon holed characters of the past. I totally recommend that you see this movie - not just for the wonderful talent of the cast but to have a laugh at yourself. The simplicity and perfection of the set in this movie was a cross between 'cat' in the hat and the 'Truman story' just fantastic, and lets be honest wouldn't we all just love to live there - it's brilliantly done. The costumes were wonderful and gave just the right amount of the sixties feel to enhance the original movie. Grab a coke and some popcorn and enjoy the fantasy of being a Stepford wife, grab the most comfortable chair in the cinema and squirm at the fact that you too thought of this plot yourself years ago - don't deny it! we have all thought that life would be better if we could just change to people we love or in fact ourselves in some way. Come away with the feel good thought that you can do just that for awhile through this movie. And then buy this movie so you can relive it time and again."

Real films with real subjects are being made elsewhere these days, and Wall Street had better take off its ideological glasses pretty soon."

That's what life is all about, people - differences!\n\nI went and saw 'Stepford Wives' with my boyfriend, my dominatrix pal and her grand-daughter. Well, the 3 adults thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed our collective butts off! Why? Well:\n\n1 - The casting if PHENOMENAL! Kidman, Broderick, Hill, Midler, Lovitz, Walken and (especially!) Close are perfectly suited for their characters! Kidman's character is decidedly over-the-top and could not have been played better.... Sure, she's witchy (but with a B) in the beginning and you can't stand her, but she grows on you - much like moss. Broderick plays a perfect dweeb, in love with a girl 2 notches above his own standing in life. What you see of Hill is minute, but somewhat worth it. I truly believe she needed more of a role, but.... maybe in the DVD release & deleted scenes? Lovitz is great as his own dweebish and goof ball self, and Midler does a stand up job as the perfect 'self help' author - trying to tell everybody else how to live their lives, all the while having a perfectly f---ed up life at home. And Walken and Close as the leaders of this little community are fantastic! Especially at the end!\n\n2 - The take on today is quite truthful! There are WAY too many people tied up in their high power careers and they don't see their own lives falling apart around them. Case in point - Broderick shows Kidman a picture drawn by one of their kids - the child is SHOOTING a gun at mommy! There are WAY too many cases of kids going wrong because mommy OR daddy (and more often, BOTH!) not being able to give enough to their kids.\n\n3 - There are a TON of funny lines and sight gags in this movie. But, humor is all based upon perception.... what I find funny, you just don't get and vice-versa.... Some people go off on seeing a guy get a ball in his balls on 'America's Funniest Videos' but I just don't get it....\n\nFinally, don't let ANYBODY'S opinion turn you off from seeing this movie or make you go see it. Use your own best judgment. If you like it (as I did), tell people! If you didn't, well, same thing, TELL people. Personally, I can't WAIT for the DVD - just hoping that they show deleted scenes, bloopers and all those kinds of great extras!!\n\nENJOY!!!"

Needless to say, he was gutted... LOL. In a way, I think the film comes a little late in our evolution to have the sort of impact it could have. In the days when Feminism was raging would have been a better time for this film. All those women wearing 1950s outfits - the sort of thing my mother would have worn! Glenn Close looked fantastic. I've never been disappointed by any of her film performances."

The ending isn't terrible. The technical logistics of how exactly this science/process works is a little slack for my liking. The resolution is lazy because the sci-fi tech aspects are lazy. Very hand-wavey. The message is predictable and a little heavy handed toward the end. However, the dialogue is often cute and the costuming and lighting is also excellent. Writing overall is the weakest link in the chain - should have been a better movie with all the cast & crew clearly working hard and making magic where they could."

There were some really funny lines and very good performances, but the screenplay was sophomoric and strident. A good dark comedy has to take itself seriously, but this movie expended more effort setting up the one-liners than it did developing a believable context for the plot. What a disappointment, and what a waste of a terrific cast. I'm going to run out and rent the 1975 version today, to show my son how to do it right!"

Joanna cannot fit in and this leads her to want to find out what sort of strange dimension that is.\n\nThis is definetely an easy film, a soapy comedy which provides just a few laughs. I did not enjoy it much, it left me with nothing and I did not particularly appreciate any of the characters. Nevertheless Glenn Close's great performance deserves to be mentioned: her character is the prototype of obsession, she wants beauty and perfection no matter what and she ends up being utterly creepy.\n\nThe film deals with an extremely important topic, it is a pity it wasn't deepened in a different way..."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Take: The comical and satirical tone proves to be more than appropriate in this 2nd screen incarnation of Ira Levin's novel.\n\nIf you ask me, I prefer seeing Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIVES, on the screen, as a comedy. It might have worked in the novel (you tell me, I haven't read it yet), I haven't seen the 1975 original either, but exactly how scary can these wives be on the screen, seeing them dressed with Barbie doll-gowns and talking in soft-natured voices. If it might have worked on the novel, it will definitely lose something on the screen. It's fun to see the creators of this new version of Levin's story who lighten it up a little. Although criticized, this remake of THE STEPFORD WIVES is enjoyable lighter entertainment with a lot of laughs thrown it for good cause (and effect).\n\nNicole Kidman, who has not gone to much roles in years, gives a delightful performance as Joanna Eberhart, a sassy New Yorker, who is fired from her career as VP of a successful TV studio after having problems with one of their sexist TV shows. To cure her from totally loosing her self, his husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) takes her and their kids to move to Stepford, Connecticut, where everything is perfect. And where perfect isn't always good. As Joanna discovers, when the wives are just too darn perfect.\n\nKudos for the delightful script by Paul Rudnick, for providing a lot of laughs (instead of scares). Much of the film relies on his script, and manages to make them all work. I can honestly say Rudnick almost owns this movie, but director Frank Oz also provides his own mastery to provide the film with bizarre special effects and outlandish looks (I never felt Connecticut to be this, well, perfect).\n\nThe cast also give their terrific contributions, enjoyable performances and the lot. Although Kidman is adorable as ever, my vote (for the best) is Glenn Close as one of the wives. Close is really good in this roles and, for not seeing her in this kind of performance (since 101 DALMATIANS), she's a delight. Bette Midler proves, once again, that singing isn't the only thing she does best.\n\nAlthough thumbs are mostly down for this movie, I give this film a major thumbs up. Some people (critics and public alike) are so used to liking the originals over their remakes, they tend to forget that not all of them are bad. THE STEPFORD WIVES is not one of these bad remakes, and for those who thought so, may want to give this another chance.\n\nRating: ***1/2 out of 5."

I enjoyed this movie along with its feel goodness about it. An uplifting, entertaining movie - this is a great girl movie along with a date movie (with the more intelligently inclined or at least open minded male of the species). Unlike the stilted and underperformed horror version of the original, this update is superior and plays with its material in a well paced fashion.

Her perpetual happiness was a major nuisance. The movie is a little entertaining in its campiness, but it tries too hard to achieve this.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Stepford Wives is about a young woman named Joanna Eberhard who is the executive of a television network. After being attacked by one of the deranged guests of a reality show she was working on she suffers a mental breakdown. Her husband played by the brilliant Matthew Broderick, takes the family to the Stepford Community to live. There Joanna meets some friends and neighbors who are more than average housewives. Overall it was a good movie, but it lacked in comparison with the first. It was an okay movie that could be enjoyed by fans of the first, as long as they don't go into the theatre expecting anything as dramatic or intense. The mental breakdown scene was my favourite part. The movie relied entirely on suspense to scare you, even though it wasn't really that scary, the suspense made it seem scarier. I enjoyed it and gave it a well deserved 6.0/10.0"

Nicole Kidman is a self absorbed TV big shot who gets fired for bad judgement on TV programming that leads to a crazy little scene at a showing for TV execs. Kidman and family then decide to movie to the burbs for a some piece and quiet and get more than they bargained for when they arrive in Stepford. The Divine Miss \"M\" plays a writer whose forced by court order to move to stepford with family but we are warned by her \"Dont ask\". The pharmacy guy romancing Brie on Desperate Housewives plays a guy whose hubby has brought him to the open minded Stepford for a \"Change\" as well. The three become fast friends and soon learn that Stepford has sinister secrets. Glen Close gives a fine performance as one of the loony wives of the town along with Faith Hill who has one of the funniest scenes early on when she \"Malfunctions\" at a square dance\". There are funny one liners and banter back and forth from the cast and I laughed out loud and generally had a great time watching this film. It entertained me and thats all I was looking for. Although the part that doesn't make sense which has to do with the question the film makes you ponder at the very end \"are they robotic or human, or are they the six million dollar women\". Watching the deleted scenes involving Faith and Bette really make you say \"hugh\"...only because of how the movie ends with regards to the fate of the wives....you'll see what I mean. Incedently that scene with Bette should have been left in. It was hilarious. Thankfully its on the DVD. Have fun watching this wickedly funny take on the original and ignore the elephant in the room."

But this one hit its mark in so many places. It was a spoof, first of all, on the original Stepford Wives, with some contemporary issues thrown in. It busted on reality shows, on career women, on male egos with inferiority complexes, on surface religious tolerance, on acceptance of gays, on gay relationships, on politicians, on marketing, on sci fi, and on community leadership.\n\nThe electrifying ending let the whole thing unravel, and delivered its serious message that imperfection is more interesting and more fulfilling than perfection \u0096 and that pursuit of perfection is a form of madness.\n\nAnd, of course, we loved the wrap-up cameo at the end."

Yes, things are weird in Stepford.\n\nSo we slowly learn the secret, Nicole Kidman does that as well. The film seems constantly silly and the ending was pretty bad but when it was over I realized something. Most of the time I was smiling while watching this film. I was smiling because of the weird events, the funny lines especially from Midler, and because of Walken, although I have to admit the last couple of years he always makes me smile. 'The Stepford Wives' may be silly, it is quite some fun as well. Since the film is not that long it does not become boring, just some simple entertainment."

I should have known, yesterday, while searching for the DVD at my local video retail store and surprisingly finding it in the comedy section, not the horror, that I was in for a big disappointment. The first few minutes into the film I caught on quickly that something was wrong. Wrong in a sense that the remake was not going to provide the original atmosphere --the same creepiness generated in the first one. And wrong as far as dealing with believable characters. Off the bat, Joanna was ruined. One of the reasons the original worked so well and provided terror was because we got to establish/feel the humanity of the characters for a great deal of the film and then watch things go dreadful and machine-cold. I personally feel that a movie like TSW would only work if it was made with the fans of the original in mind. In this case, it's too modern for its own good. And not in the special-effects department, but more so in social and political representation. Do we really need a dash of SNL in our TSW? I don't think so. The comedy was counter-productive and made my experience with TSW (2004) lousy."

        "review_title": "An EMBARRASSING Remake",
        "review_detailed_main": "The movie The Stepford Wives, directed by Frank Oz was absolutely and truly horrible. There are few things I genuinely enjoyed about this film, and the end was almost painful to watch. Now, it is important to note that this 2004 film is a remake of the 1975 movie, and the 1975 movie was adapted from the novel The Stepford Wives, which was written by Ira Levin. And sadly, this tacky comedy remake, which had endless amounts of potential, was horrendous to watch and downright embarrassing. The main character in this film, Joanna, is a strong, driven woman who runs a reality television network. Surprisingly, she is fired after a man, who was on one of her shows, attempts to shoot and kill her at her own award ceremony. After this incident, her husband, Walter, and her family decide to move their family from Manhattan to the suburbs of Connecticut. Upon arrival, Joanna notices how perfect everything is, especially the woman. The wives in her new neighborhood always have their hair and makeup perfectly done, with their clothes always perfectly clean and ironed. The women in this town even work out in their baby pink high-heels and lavender seersucker day dresses. After going to a neighborhood barbeque with her husband and kids, Joanna became extremely suspicious when she saw one of the Stepford women fall down and begin to spark after violently dancing and twitching. After this incident, Joanna and her two Stepford friends seem to witness more and more strange things as the movie progresses. Joanna knows this town is hiding something dark, and she is determined to solve the mystery. While the idea of the movie sounds smart, intriguing, and creepy, the way this film was remade and executed was shameful. The producers attempted to turn an originally interesting and well respected film into a comedy, which sadly just ended up cheesy and hard to watch. Although the majority of the acting was terrible, I will admit that I believe Nicole Kidman played her character, Joanna, fairly well. Personally, the script and dialogue were some of the worst aspects of the film, and one specific example is Bette Midler's role. Midler played Bobbie, one of Joanna's new Stepford best friends, and many of the jokes she made were tacky and the acting seemed as if she were a 40-something-year-old mom trying too hard to act cool around her daughter's friends. To be blunt, Midler's acting and script seemed far too forced and ended up being cringe-worthy. This film and the overall plot and idea is so clearly not meant to be a comedy. The original film, produced in 1975, is known to be unsettling and thrilling, as the idea behind the movie is extremely creative and not too unrealistic to still be considered creepy. The issues presented in the 2004 movie are just as prevalent today as they were in 1975, when the first film was adapted. This movie deals with the roles and expectations of women in one's household, and to turn a film that has the potential to be impactful into a comedy is a very slippery slope. The remake also replaced many good aspects of the original film with less-powerful ones. For example, in the original 1975 film, the wives of the Stepford men were murdered and then replaced with robots. But, in the 2004 film, the women's brains were just altered by having microchips in them. This does not make complete sense given their bodies could be physically changed with a remote at any given moment, but if the chips were removed or destroyed, they went completely back to normal. How could one of the wife's bodies be physically changed with only a microchip in their brain? This to me is a major plot hole. Personally, in my opinion, the story is far more powerful when the wives are murdered (like the 1975 film) by their husbands and then are replaced by robots, rather than just being brainwashed by a microchip. Overall, the 2004 version of The Stepford Wives was more than underwhelming; it was awful. Yes, I think Nicole Kidman did the best she could have done under the given circumstances, but that is the only positive thing I could take away from this movie. The acting was bad, the dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the plot was weak and inconsistent at times. I would most definitely not recommend watching this film, as it will be an enormous waste of your time."

And he actually manages to include something to offend everyone - not in a Michael Moore, politically pointed way, but in a monstrously inept display of sheer excess.\n\nThe film is ugly, pointless, humourless and in the final washup, completely worthless. There is something seriously wrong with your movie when Bette Midler is your most restrained cast member. Indeed, Nicole Kidman offers what may very well be the most appalling performance she has ever offered in a (to say the least) bumpy career. She makes no attempt at all to find a recognisably human foundation for her character, playing it instead as a broad caricature.\n\nAnd since the film's thesis is that the loss of humanity for a 'perfect society' the film virtually crumples into dust amidst Kidman's embarrassing mugging. I know there are people out there who maintain she is some sort of goddess, but sorry guys, you are worshipping the wrong diva.\n\nBette Midler provides a few smiles along the way, but she is way below par. At least she seems to know how wretched the material is, which is more than we can say for Glenn Close. She actually makes Kidman look subdued.\n\nThe film's finale is muddled and unclear. Are the Stepford Wives robots or women with computer chips in their brains? Do men in America really desire overdressed zombies for wives? Do men even think about repressing women any more? Undoubtedly some do, but the notion that an entire community would launch itself into this bizarre scheme is ridiculous, even by this film's modest standards.\n\nThere must be some virtue in this film. How about a triumph of style over content. Alas no. The film rambles along in sub-par Tim Burton style. How about making a few bucks at the box office? Alas yes, though at least the public has belatedly seen the light.\n\nAwful film making. I don't mind if I never see anybody connected with it ever again - Midler excepted."

        "review_title": "\"Stepford\" as robotic as its wives",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Stepford Wives\", in a similar fashion to the film \"Pleasantville\", sets out to be a satirical comedy, lampooning the ideals of the 1950s--specifically, the perfect homemaker wife. Unfortunately, quite unlike \"Pleasantville\", \"The Stepford Wives\" fails miserably.\n\nContrary to the claims made by the posters and trailers for the film, the plot of \"The Stepford Wives\" is no secret. No thanks to the trailers which reveal many of the films secrets, most moviegoers will already be familiar with the mystery of Stepford.\n\nThat said, the story revolves around Joanna, a highly ambitious and incredibly successful television executive. Her career comes to an abrupt end when one of the reality shows from her new fall lineup causes disaster. In an attempt to save his wife's sanity, Joanna's husband, Walter moves her and their kids to the gated-community of Stepford \u0096 a town with \"no crime, no poverty, and no pushing.\" But, of course, the reason Stepford and its women are so perfect lies in the fact that they are robots ... or are they? One of the main problems the audience must face while watching \"The Stepford Wives\" is the enormous plot holes, especially in the case of the wives, who seem to change from robots to normal women with brain alterations and back again whenever the plot calls for it. Or rather, to whichever is funnier at the given moment. The issue is, robots or not, it's NOT funny, and most certainly not clever, as a satire should be.\n\nThe film shows promise in the first act, as we are first introduced to the bizarre antics of the wives (partaking in homemaker aerobics, \"Let's be washing-machines!\" and discussing the \"controversial\" Christmas crafts book during their book club sessions). As we reach the second act however, the film shifts gears into breakneck speed, (with each sequence lasting no more than five minutes) as we watch Joanna slowly solve the mystery of Stepford. This might have been more engaging had the audience not already been aware of the secret long before Joanna.\n\nAs \"The Stepford Wives\" crawls into the ending stretch, it backpedals, rapidly unraveling with one twist piled onto another in an attempt to keep the audience guessing. Sadly, it only confuses us more, until, finally, the plot is so convoluted we can no longer tell what's going on.\n\nThe movie constantly contradicts itself, right until the bitter end. Some say to enjoy a comedy, you must suspend disbelief--I agree, but in the case of \"The Stepford Wives\", the comedy is almost non-existent. The film had so much potential, but inevitably, fell short."

For someone who usually finds some redeeming qualities in every film experience, and who is interested in all genres and extremely open-minded, this vehement speech I give against The Stepford Wives is meant as a general warning to all people not to waste their 1.5 hours like myself--to spare their dignity and taste, and avoid their being haunted later by some of the vulgar, repulsive images and ideas put forth by the film. The modes of comedy, horror, thriller, drama, and science fiction alternate in unpredictable and unpleasant fits and starts throughout, with excruciating non-transitions linking them. The dialogue is as shoddy and trite as dialogue can be; the score sounds like tawdry elevator music and consistently tries to drown out the poor dialogue (unfortunately, without complete success); the tone with which the material is handled is disastrously ill-chosen--when striking a feminist note the film comes across as pathetic and sentimental; when striking a historically particular chauvinist note the film is dull and offensive in its baseball-bat-over-the-audience's-head polemic; when attempting to strike a tone of technological innovation and sci-fi imagination, the film flops for its utterly improbable, illogical, simplistic, inelegant presentation of devices, practices, and themes (the scene where Broderick shuts down all the computer clones comes readily to mind--are the women controlled by a central device, or are they clones, or are they the same women, slightly reprogrammed, with new bodies, or....? the film cannot decide and it's painfully obvious to any child who's lived this life in our world for six years at least that none of this is either possible, believable, or even pleasant to conceive). I dare not think that the two very intelligent main actors--Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick--could be anything less than deeply ashamed when they hear the name of this movie mentioned."

(I will say, though, that it's a crime Katharine Ross was asked back for this one- maybe for the Glenn Close role?)\n\nAnd now, the part so few people want to hear.\n\nThis is, as has been mentioned elsewhere, more comedy than horror. Most fail to realize however, that it's more satire than either comedy or horror. Such *nasty* satire at that, that the humor becomes almost serious by the end of the film, and we should be left realizing that the first 15 minutes are meant to be as disturbing as the last 15 minutes.\n\nHELLLLLOOOOOO America! Stepford is supposed to be us. Worse, it *is* us. Put down the popcorn and think about it, because despite the laughs, this is a very serious movie.\n\nThe original film was made during a time of radical social change in the sexual arena. Feminism and sex roles were revolutionary concepts, and were thus best presented in a horror film, with the main character teetering on the brink of the unknown, unsure of the fate which awaited her, until she was eventually consumed by her existence.\n\nThis film is made during yet another time of social change: although we have largely accepted that gender roles and stereotypes are idiotic, we nonetheless cling to them because we don't know what else to do. Take a look at our country's division over same sex marriage- do you think it's an accident that they put a same sex couple in the forefront of this film?\n\nStepford *is* America, a land where we have two kinds of people: men and women. The men act like men, and the women act like women. Anyone not fitting into the pattern will be *forced* to fit the pattern, because deviations . . . well . . . they're just not very nice.\n\nAre you still laughing? I hope you like irony with your popcorn."

Matthew Broderick plays one of her employees, a VP. Kidman gets fired and the family moves to the idyllic, pristine, gated community of Stepford, Connecticut. Early on, they realize that something weird is going on as the women are all like giddy airheads, always wearing dresses and high heels, while the men are relatively normal, if not a tad nerdy.\n\nThis film makes some prickly comments about societal trends, hence its satirical side. Bette Midler is very funny. Glen Close looks badly preserved, Kidman and Broderick are fine and Christopher Walken is excellent. Due to the weak ending, this film falls short of being a must-see, though."

This remake of The Stepford Wives is not as abominable as the Psycho and Wicker Man remakes, but that is saying very little because very little, if anything, in this movie works at all.\n\nI will admit the way the film looks is not bad at all, at least the scenery is striking and the photography not on slip-shod level. However, coming from a very keen musician and music enthusiast I did find the soundtrack rather forgettable. However that is the least of The Stepford Wives' problems.\n\nThe story for starters is very predictable, right up to the contrived finale. The black humour is lowbrow and misses the mark far too many times to make it truly funny, and some scenes drag on for too long. The cast is great on paper, but Nicole Kidman looks bored, Bette Midler's character grates and she overdoes it and Matthew Broderick is miscast and in an embarrassing way.\n\nIn all honesty though, the characters are not at all likable and mostly very uninteresting. So all in all, a great disappointment and one of my least ever remakes. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

Matthrew Broderick was his usual self, sleep walking through the film, and the usually-malevolent Christopher Walken looks embarrassed to be involved. One can only question how and why 'the King of New York' has lost his way so badly. But my gravest criticism has to be levelled at Nicole Kidman. I'm sure I've seen her act, and I'm sure once upon a time she conveyed an emotion to be through the medium of film. But I can't now remember when. She's just not funny. At all.

So, to remedy that, her husband \"Walter Kresby\" (Matthew Broderick) decides that the best thing for her is for them to move to Stepford, Connecticut where they can start a new life. Once there, however, Joanna is shocked to discover that all of the women are rather dull and don't seem to have any interests other than keeping their husband's content. Fortunately, she subsequently meets a woman named \"Bobbie Markowitz\" (Bette Midler) who is the exact opposite of all the other women, and they become fast friends. She also meets another interesting character by the name of \"Roger Bannister\" (Roger Bart) who also doesn't quite fit the Stepford stereotype either. But things take a dramatic change for the worse when Roger suddenly changes--and they realize that something sinister is going on. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I honestly expected this movie to be an updated remake of the original horror film produced almost 30 years previously with only a few minor alterations to fit the times. Needless to say, I was completely surprised! That being said, it's possible that, because I wasn't prepared for a comedy, the humor of it all made it that much more entertaining. Admittedly, it took a dark turn about halfway through which caused the film to seem a bit uneven--but the surprise twist at the end made up for it to some degree. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

In a pivotal scene, Nicole Kidman's character discovers that one of the local zombified Stepford women used to be a prominent judge. Bette Midler's character, meanwhile, is supposed to be a best-selling author. Judges and best-seller authors generally make decent salaries.\n\nNow, unless the men of Stepford are all multi-millionaires, would they really be willing to so readily sacrifice their wives' earning potential, just so they could enjoy the comforts of robotic domestic divas? More to the point, could anyone besides Donald Trump actually afford to live in Stepford if they didn't come from a high-earning double-income family? In the 1950s era (which this film is allegedly sending up) it was possible to get by with The Man as sole breadwinner, but methinks such days are long gone, except in ultra-rich communities.\n\nJust one of the many, many, many flaws in this terrible turkey.\n\nNate H.

Bette Midler plays Joanna's best friend while Glenn Close & Christopher Walken are on hand as high society leaders.\n\n\"The Stepford Wives\" (2004) is a confused comedic remake of the iconic 1975 film.

At the end, however, Joanna (Kidman) discovers they've just been brainwashed by microchips inserted in their brains. If the latter is true, why was there an android version of Joanna?

I think the story is pretty consistence once we pass the first 10 minute of the movie which is there to kill time and making the movie really cheap.

When they arrive they find themselves in a surreal world, which looks for all intents and purposes like 1955. Men spend most of their time relaxing and doing man stuff with other men while the women watch the home, always striving to be better wives. Everyone seems happy, but something seems amiss. Johanna intends to find out what has got into this town.\n\nIts alright, but just thought it could have got crazier and more intense. Seeing as it was directed by the guy who's the voice of Kermit The Frog, maybe my expectations were unrealistic. The movie did remind me though of how much I rate Matthew Broderick. This is probably his best role since Project X (the one with the monkey). Seriously, he must be peed considering he's pretty much in the John Cusack mould of actors, but hasn't had anywhere near the success."

I have seen my share of dark comedies from 'Arsenic and Old Lace' to the present. In those movies you knew when it was supposed to be funny. Sitting in this packed audience, you could tell no one was sure if something was supposed to be viewed as being funny or not. For a book that bordered on suspense/science fiction...this movie turned it upside down and into something that only resembled the book and the 1st movie by the name and the robot-like women. I heard enough grumbling as I walked out the theater to know that just about everyone thought this was a BAD movie and not worth the price of the movie ticket or gas to get there.

The remake is a lot more cynical than the original and seems to be in some ways farther away from the sexual revolution and the women's movement that the first one seemed to highlight. Kind of like Dr. Strangelove and How I Learned to Love the Bomb being rewritten so that President George W. Bush stops all the WMD from being dropped and kicks Saddam Hussein's butt to boot. The major character played by Nicole Kidman seems to be a lot less easy to empathize with than the character from the original.\n\nThere were good lines though and I did find this worth the price of a ticket to see some of these actors in form. Seeing pop singer Faith Hill act and doing a good job is also a pleasure after seeing various other pop singers fall on their behinds so to speak with respect to showing that they can play any character with more depth than you find in a three minute video."

They were simply sent away to camp or whatever and that was the end of them.

I also quite liked the gay people too, but don't actually think that they were very likely people to be accepted to a place like this.

Lovitz was funny as he represented all the husbands who just wanted to be waited upon as they played games. I recall someone saying that if our wives were not around, we would all be in boxer shorts, smoking cigars, and watching football. The men in this movie were pretty close. They were all married to strong women and just couldn't deal with it. Too bad! Let's make them robots.\n\nMatthew Broderick was cool as Kidman's husband, and Christopher Walken, well he plays weird characters well, as he did here.

I like the way that the film mentioned that there are no minorities amongst the town people and the only gay couple is \"straightened out\" if you will. There are some quick one liners about it being in Connecticut and boring but, scarily, this really does reflect the right wing mentality of what married couples are supposed to be. Some of the shot selections were a bit odd or uninteresting and uninspired but it's a commercial film. Anyway, it was fun and I found myself laughing.\n\nOVERALL: 6/10. Worth a watch."

Kidman played a network executive, an arrogant feminist stereotype which lacked any dynamism but following boring formulas to lead us into the context of the plot in this flick. Midler plays this arrogant woman archetypal of the type of woman that perfectly resembles an angry old liberal woman. I can't shake that quote out of my head, where she uttered at the 4th of July party, which I will paraphrase: \"We are celebrating Independence Day, where are all the African-Americans here?\" -- a line as contrived as the whole film tended to be. (If you look, you will see one or two black women, making that quote stick out more.) Now whether it was a contrived political piece to boost of the Hollywood status quo or just mere entertainment, it fails on both accounts. Every character was typically annoying cookie-cutter character constructs that brought nothing to a storyline that could of had substance.\n\nCan someone please take this as well as all those inane teen movies and chuck them in the fire?"

Nicole Kidman is inspired as powerful Manhattan executive in self-imposed suburban exile. But the show-stoppers by far are Glenn Close and Jon Lovitz, two geniuses of character and satire.

        "review_title": "disastrous remake",
        "review_detailed_main": "For its 21 Century movie incarnation, Ira Levin's classic feminist thriller \"The Stepford Wives\" has been re-imagined as a feel-good, slapstick comedy - a shift in tone that is, to put it mildly, a complete disaster for this story. Bryan Forbes' wonderful 1975 movie version (starring Katherine Ross) included many comic scenes as well, but there the humor was pointed and dark, and provided a perfect counterpoint to the sinister thriller elements at the story's core. In this \"new and improved,\" ever-so-sunny edition of the Levin work, written by Paul Rudnick and directed by Frank Oz, the whole thing is played for laughs from the get-go, instantly robbing the story of its edge and diluting its delicious social commentary about a society in which women have literally become mindless robots responding to the commands of their misogynist husbands. All we're left with, in the end, is a really bad, over-the-top comedy that wastes the talents of Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler and that tarnishes the memory of a good movie into the bargain.\n\nA pixie-haired Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a driven TV network executive who is fired when one of the man-hating programs she produces goes terribly awry. Determined to become a more supportive wife and engaged mother, she allows her husband to cart the family off to a gated, crime-free, all-white, politically conservative (though, somehow, a gay couple is allowed to slip through) community in Connecticut known as Stepford, a 1950's throwback where all the wives are perfect little Susy Homemakers who dress in poofy, pastel-colored gingham dresses, maintain spotlessly clean and flawlessly decorated homes, smile constantly, and dutifully cater to each and every one of their husbands' whims and wishes. Even though Joanna intends to make every effort to become the ideal wife that her understanding husband wants her to be, she soon begins to suspect that there may be a dark secret lurking beneath the impossibly perky dispositions of all the women in town.\n\nAlthough the plot here is virtually the same as it was in the 1975 film, this \"Stepford Wives\" has taken the entirely wrong approach to the Levin material. Part of what made the earlier version so much fun was that we learned right along with Ross what was actually taking place in the town. Her slow awakening to the truth was what provided the suspense so essential to making the tale frightening and compelling. Here, however, the women are such ridiculous space cadets from the outset that any newcomer would have to be a complete idiot not to figure it all out the moment she hit town. Moreover, as a comedy, the film falls miserably flat, going for the cheap and easy laugh at every opportunity. And, of course, the movie lacks the courage to carry through with the earlier film's downbeat, defeatist ending, opting instead for an upbeat and \"clever\" surprise-twist finale that shows just how far film-making has fallen over the past 30 years. (It also makes absolutely no sense in light of the scene where Midler puts her hand directly into the flame of a gas stove and suffers no burn - but then who expects coherence and consistency from a film this badly written and thought out?). The irony is that the first version, while retaining the thriller elements of the story, was far more humorous and far more effective as a satire than this limp little remake could ever possibly hope to be.\n\nPerhaps, after this movie and \"Bewitched,\" Ms. Kidman should avoid appearing in any more comedies - or at least any more comedies based on decades-old cultural artifacts - for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis dreadful, ill-fated version of \"The Stepford Wives\" leaves us with just one basic question: if you're not going to do a remake properly, why do it at all?"

Her and her husband decide starting a new life outside the city can both save their marriage and jump start new career directions. However, shortly after getting to their new location they notice things are a little odd all around them...\n\nThis movie is directed by Frank Oz (What about Bob) and stars Nicole Kidman (Eye Wide Shut), Bette Midler (Hocus Pocus), Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter), Glenn Close (Fatal Attraction) and Jon Lovitz (The Benchwarmers).\n\nThis was a big turn from the look and feel of the original picture/series. This blends the strange and eerie circumstances with a lot of comedy and carefree perspectives of the circumstances. The cast is absolutely awesome and Midler and Lovitz as a married couple was hilarious. The robot elements are very well done with updated special effects and over the top circumstances. I will say Kidman was smoking hot in this and there's a solid twist at the end.\n\nOverall this was a huge step down from the original but still worth a viewing.

        "review_detailed_main": "A comic remake of the 1975 classic, based--like its predecessor--on the Ira Levin thriller of 1972. The plot is the same, even if the horror quotient has been dialed down a notch: after uber-successful executive Joanna Eberhart suddenly loses her job in New York, she and her husband Walter move with their children to the happy hamlet of Stepford, Connecticut; it's peaceful, pretty, and will give Joanna a chance to catch her breath and recover from the rat race. Soon after arriving, though, she can't help but notice the town's alarming number of stereotypically \"perfect\" housewives, with their expertly coiffed hair, impeccably applied make-up, colorful summer dresses, and toothy white smiles. What's more, their interests appear to be limited to child-rearing, house cleaning, and shopping--areas in which their smugly satisfied husbands aren't helping them a bit. Exactly what's going on in picture-perfect Stepford? And what is Joanna to make of the mysterious Men's Club that all the guys seem to belong to? Key moments that were played for chills in the original are played for laughs here, including the surprising (you really won't see some of the twists coming) and over-the-top finale (which differs from the closing moments of the original). Nicole Kidman is as reliable as ever as Joanna, Matthew Broderick is not quite his usual nebbishy self as Walter but close to it, and Bette Midler as Joanna's equally suspicious pal gets most of the best lines. (The script, by the way, was written by the very funny Paul Rudnick, which helps to explain the film's engaging--and wacky--sense of humor.) Roger Ebert once said--and I paraphrase--that if the characters in a movie behaved normally from the get-go, there wouldn't be a movie; here in \"The Stepford Wives\", if poor Joanna only listened to her gut, she would have said sayonara to Stepford at the first sign of trouble. An entertaining re-interpretation of the '75 classic--as well as the earlier novel--and a fun film to watch. Recommended."

Bette Midler is unappealing and the actor saddled with the supposedly funny flamboyant gay role is sunk by the embalmed material. Glenn Close plays the campy it's-really-a-drag-queen part that we encounter in seemingly every Paul Rudnick-scripted film - and lately in many Glenn Close films as well; I like her a lot better when she's actually giving a real performance not working overtime on broadly comic schtick. (Memo to screenwriter Rudnick, from the mouth of that smart underground filmmaker, Bruce LaBruce: \"being gay is not enough.\"). Bryan Forbes, Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, et.al did this movie much, much better back in 1975, and it should have been left at that. The Stepford Wives is, for all its efforts, another pointless, badly written (the plot holes are already legendary), and yes, mechanical Hollywood remake."

I can't really pinpoint what made feel like that while watching the movie so perhaps the director wasn't up for the task.\n\nI also felt that the characters were left quite shallow. That didn't work too well for this movie as the viewer has to follow the characters waltzing around. After the initial introduction of the characters they didn't really grow or change at all.\n\nThe movie could have been way better if the plot (the script) had been better but it was way too predictable and full of un-logical behavior or happenings. The movie is tagged as comedy/scifi/thriller but I didn't find anything to laugh at nor was the scifi part believable. Actually, some of the CGI had been left so rudimentary (on purpose I believe) that it was just sad. The thriller part failed to deliver too with the predictable plot. The characters were too sweet to make the viewer expect anything else than a \"happy end\"."

It actually isn't bad at all.\n\nTo appreciate this movie,the 2004 version, you have to take it in its historical context. When made George W. Bush is President and all of the talk is of a Republican Majority for years to come. So liberal Hollywood is angry beyond belief... and they are even more angry that with all of their subtle but deliberate attempts to manipulate political and social attitudes over many decades they are completely shut out of Washington.\n\nSo this movie is made with NO attempts to be subtle and its nothing but a seething attack on white/Christian/middle class/heartland America which is blamed for voting Republican. Watch as the Hollywood constituency of Jews, Lesbians, and Feminists join together to stomp out the \"evils\" of the Republican Party allegorically represented by evil people turning women into robots.\n\nNo doubt while many would be offended by the seething hatred of the movie makers towards a majority of Americans, I couldn't control myself laughing hysterically at the over the top attacks (which weren't meant to be funny) but somehow were. And it just got worse being in proximity of three teenaged girls too dumb to see how mad Hollywood was and who were actually getting mad at the over the top sexism of the imaginary town folk Hollywood was trying to lump in with Republicans.\n\nWatch the knitting scene... omigosh! how awful... women getting excited about celebrating Christmas when we all \"know\" they should be joining Rosie for a good bit of anti-male bashing lesbianism. And how important for the effeminate husband of Nicole Kidman to give up his career and ideas for a family so that she can slave herself for a corporate entity. Which is OF COURSE what Nicole Kidman's character should WANT to do with her life... no matter how corporately shallow and hollow.\n\nTruth is, unless you've learnt to laugh at the Hollywood Political machine this movie is awful unless you're fully and completely behind the Hollywood agenda that baffles even most American LIBERALS."

And in a way, its not complete suckiness made it harder to sit through. Worse movies are more fun to sit through. Darkness, which is a far worse movie, hands down, was much more fun to attend. I can laugh at a super bad movie. This movie was just so dull, it sucked the humor out of my veins, my brain. It was just so DULL! If you want to watch bad movies and laugh, stay away.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Stepford wives\" (2004) is a remake of the original movie from 1975 (Bryan Forbes).\n\nOne question I always ask in relation to a remake is its added value. With respect to \"The Stepford wives\" (2004) this question is very hard to answer. For a long time the story is very faithful to its 1975 predecessor. Only the ending is very different, about which more later.\n\nOf course the \"faithful\" part of the remake is not identical image for image, but the differences are in the details and are not always a lucky choice. The addition of a gay character for example seems more inspired by the wish to update the movie than that it contributes something meaningful to the story and/or theme.\n\nThe main difference with the 1975 film is that this was a horror movie whereas the 2004 version has more comedy elements. Apart from the fact that some scenes that are intended as comic are outright tasteless (the scene in which a woman is used as an ATM), there is something more fundamental wrong with this approach.\n\nIn my opinion by making it a comedy the remake suggests that it does not take the theme very seriously and think this theme is outdated. I don't think so, and I think in one scene the film contradicts itself. In the 1975 version we saw men that were uncomfortable by the thought that their wive had a job of her own. In the 2004 version we see men frustrated by the fact that the career of their wives outshines their own.\n\nAs I said earlier the ending of the 2004 version is very different. I wondered if this ending was added for its surprise value or introduced a new aspect to the theme. The so called tradwives movement came to my mind. I think however the ending was primarily added for its surprise value. The tradwives became only prominent on the social networks after 2015."

The final result looks more like something that was scheduled to appear in Marvel comics, but somehow got turned into a new big-budget Nicole Kidman flick.\n\nJust look at the basics of the plot: insecure husbands turn their successful wives into robots. This operation consists of (not actually seen in the movie) removing the brains from the wives, putting them in robot bodies, AND mind-controlling those brains. What I want to know is this - WHY NOT JUST BUILD A ROBOT WIFE AND BE DONE WITH IT?!? Why this whole \"brain-removing\" part? Yes, yes, I know, it's a - *wink* *wink* - social commentary. Yeah, right. So is Tomb Raider.\n\nTo sum up in one sentence - if you put the gaping plot holes and ridiculous storyline aside, what you get is a light comedy with a moderately good cast, a few little laughs and a horrible please-the-audience ending.\n\nTo be sincere, this movie left a bad taste in my mouth. I expected it to be much more intelligent. After the showing I felt like somebody suckered me into seeing a Pokemon movie. If I had to rate this flick, I'd give it 4 out of 10, but only because the average quality of recent Hollywood movies is so bad it wouldn't be fair to go any lower.\n\nDon't rent this.

        "review_detailed_main": "Take two things into account with this review.\n\n#1- The Stepford Wives movie from 1975 is one of my favourite movies.\n\n#2- I completely understood that this remake was going to be something different.\n\nIn fact, I was so accepting of the fact that Frank Oz chose to make this a satirical comedy, that I was actually looking forward to the many changes and updates that this remake was going to have. Even walking out of the theatre, I was judging this very much as it's own movie. Having said that, I have to say that I don't completely dislike this movie, I just felt very let down, not just as a fan of The Stepford Wives, but as a normal filmgoer as well. There are a lot of good things offered in this remake. The cast is outstanding. I disagree with many who think Matthew Broderick was underused. I thought he was perfectly used, and I liked that they made his character more sympathetic. In a way, you have more respect for him than you do Joanna, unlike the original. And also unlike the original, Joanna is very sleezy, and overall a horrible human being with some redeemable qualities. Being a straight male, I almost feel weird saying this, but Bette Midler was perhaps the best thing about the movie. She put an interesting spin on the character of Bobbie. Most of the jokes are clever, and for the most part classy.\n\nBut here is the major problem. Frank Oz made the horrible mistake of updating this movie and changing a lot of the story, just for the sake of changing it. I have a feeling that he wanted to do something different to make this his own movie, but never thought about it hard enough to make it different in a clever way. The climax plays out just like the original, and has the supermarket scene with the Stepford Wives, but then there's a whole \"second ending\" that not only seems like a sloppy and thoughtless twist, but it makes very little sense. This is the same mistake that Planet Of The Apes and Rollerball both made with their remakes. They tried to surprise the audience with a new shocking twist, but it's not thought out or well executed, and it's just plain dumb. Then my other big complaint is the pacing of the movie. There's far too much \"filler\" in the middle section. Scenes that draw out the inevitable un-necessarily. Then when it finally comes time for the real excitement in the climax, they rush through it. I was very pleased how Oz filmed and pieced together the climax. Even the way the confrontation at the mansion was changed up, I was impressed. But what was the sense of condensing the best part of the movie into a few rushed minutes when there were several scenes in the middle section that were tediously dull? Ultimately, it's the various new twists and cheap modern day updates that bury this movie. It's not at all that I objected to the changes as a fan of the original, it's because they don't fit the basic theme and tone of the rest of the movie. So many of these modern day changes (just for the sake of changing) feel wildly out of place.\n\nThere is a lot of good material and great scenes, and for the most part the story is told well. I think when this comes out on video and DVD I'm going to put this on tape, minus some of the scenes from the middle, and minus the second ending. I'm hoping I'll enjoy it a lot more that way. One more thing. Why did they change the knife scene????? A hand on a stove element? Lame substitution."

        "review_detailed_main": "For the record, I never saw the original.\n\nPlot: .6/2: Joanna Eberhart (Kidman) has had a nervous breakdown. She was a major TV executive until one of the participants on her show (White) gets screwed over and loses his wife in the game and tries to kill both his wife and Joanna. This gets Joanna fired. So her husband Walter Fresby (Broderick) quits his job and gets his family to move to Stepford, a town in Connecticut, to get away from it all. When they arrive, Joanna realizes this place is nothing normal. The whole town is full of women who are apparently perfect. They all have blond hair, do all the housework and have screaming orgasms. All the men go away to the Men's Club on a regular schedule, where they have a meeting hosted by Mike Wellington (Walken), apparently the town leader. Joanna, along with Jewish novelist Bobbie Markowitz (Midler) and flamboyant homosexual Roger Bannister (Bart), apparently the only other normal wives (or in Roger's case, bitches), sets out to figure out what the secret is behind Stepford's closed doors.\n\nIf you don't know what is wrong with them, you have been hiding in a hole since the '70s. Since everyone knows what the Stepford wives are, there is no shock factor involved in this movie. They told you in the goddamn trailer what was happening. Since it is a remake, none of the plot is surprising, besides one slight twist that might not be completely what Stepford newbies may expect. The problem is that there are about 50 plot holes all over the place. Are the women robots or have they been programmed. It obviously says they are programmed, but there are many instances where it clearly shows them as robots. The ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. In fact, most of the movie is nonsensical. If this were an original, I'd be lenient. This is, however, a remake, so I would expect them to build on the original, not make it crappier.\n\nComedy: .7/2: Any comedy in this movie is just a zinger here or there. Granted, those are some good zingers (\"I worked at AOL\" \"Is that why the women are so slow?\"), but it rarely ventures outside of that. There are some easy gay jokes involving Roger, some funny Jewish jokes involving Bobbie and a great cameo by Mike White, but it's not enough, and they could have spent much more time making fun of the Stepfordians while instead they tried run of the mill jokes.\n\nSuspense: .3/2: Since it is a remake of a movie that coined an almost Dictionary worthy term, there is little suspense left available, probably the reason they went for the comedy angle. They do squeeze a little bit of suspense here and there, but most of it is just too silly to take seriously.\n\nActing: 1.3/2: Oh, the acting is average. Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut) is OK, Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) is mediocre, Midler (Get Shorty) is good, Bart (the upcoming The Producers) is stereotypical but good, Close (Air Force One) and Walken (The Rundown) are good, but wasted, Lovitz (SNL) is a great choice, but wasted and Mike White is great in his short role. It could have been worse.\n\nEntertainment: .5/2: For all the crappy plot, all the crappy zingers and all the crappy suspense, The Stepford Wives could have been worse. It needed to be a lot better, however. It's too silly to take seriously, to dark to be funny.\n\nTotal: 44%: As I said above, The Stepford Wives is too silly to be suspenseful and too dark to be silly. It has one of the biggest plot holes in recent memories. It could have been good, but it just didn't try hard enough. It was directed by Yoda. That's pretty funny."

Television executive \"Joanna\" (Nicole Kidman) has burned the candle at both ends for too long, has a bit of a breakdown, and is shunted off to the manicured hedges and lawns of Stepford in Connecticut by her rather insipid husband \"Walter\" (Matthew Broderick). It doesn't take them long to realise that this is conceivably the most sterile, charm free place on the planet. All their neighbours have wives who would vie for the most vacuous woman prize - doting on their looks, their dresses, their hair, their gardens - whilst their men folk, under the watchful eye of \"Mike Wellington\" (Christopher Walker) and his uber-glamorous wife \"Claire\" (Glenn Close) seem to live the life of Reilly. Luckily, \"Bobbie\" (Bette Midler) offers \"Joanna\" the vaguest of lifelines as the only other voice of near sanity in this oasis of feminine perfection, but how long before they succumb too - or can they resist the mysterious effects of the spa and the gentleman's club? There is really very little to like or enjoy in this. For it to have worked, it would have required much more humour and charisma on screen. The narrative meanders in just too flat and stolid a fashion, with little for us to get our teeth into. Middler has probably the best chance at injecting a degree of personality into the thing, but even she struggles with the wordy dialogue and the lacklustre delivery. It looks good, effort has certainly been expended there - but the rest of this is just poor and disappointing. The 1975 film isn't great, but it's way better than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with this film is that it could have been an absolute masterpiece... if they'd managed to figure out how they wanted to do the robot/brainwashed women. If you're paying attention during the film you'll eventually realize that the filmmakers obviously couldn't decide whether or not to go with robots, or with some sort of nano-tech engineered chips being implanted in the womens brains. My guess is that the nano-tech chips were what they decided on after shooting too many scenes with robot oriented material. My wife has decided that the fact that they couldn't make it one way or the other gives this film a D grade, but I tend to like it more than that. If they would've just gone with the nano-tech chips from the beginning the film would've been spectacular! The mood, set design, acting, and dialogue were very entertaining... thrilling, comedic...very engrossing. But at the end of the day you're still left bothered by the obvious fact that they reshot some material, but used other material and so it comes off as a film that isn't pure. I suppose it feels a bit insulting to the intelligence - did they not realize that the public would catch that glaring mistake? It just makes me sick to my stomach when I see something like this happen to a film that could've been amazing. Shame on whomever didn't approve enough budget to rewrite and reshoot EvERYTHING that needed to be fixed (to make it either all robot material, or all nano-chipped material). It's your fault the film has languished at the box office. In the future, remember that the public will catch you EVERY time you try to get away with less than 100%.\n\nIn closing, if you're in the mood for an imperfect but entertaining film then this one should fill the bill nicely."

A bit more drama and horror and a lot less Midler, Lovitz and gay jokes.After all, the main idea is great. Curse the person who had the idea of putting a drop of Police Academy into it.\n\nNicole Kidman plays well as always, rest of the cast is a little disappointing (and, again, cut out Lovitz and Midler!). It is bizarre how the woman who played in a Trier movie ended just a year later in something like that. Did she forget to read the whole script before saying yes?\n\nFinally, did Frank Oz write it in a bus? The plot holes drive just mad. It would be nice if next time he read the script through BEFORE he starts making the movie. The result might be a lot less puzzling."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite \"iffy\" reviews, a friend and I could not wait to see this remake. We went Friday afternoon and the theater was full. During the movie, there was lots of loud laughter throughout the theater. The audience clearly enjoyed this movie, as did we.\n\nIn fact, this movie is a hoot. From start to finish it is a side-splitting, over the top, tongue-in-cheek revision of the original film. Although (as has been noted in other comments) the ending is a \"little\" disconnected from the earlier explanations of the Stepfordization process, it was not until I had gotten home that I even realized this.\n\nIt is precisely because the remake is so over done, the circumstances so outrageous, that the present-day setting provides such a perfect comedic set-up for this introduction to the town of Stepford. In the beginning, Kidman's T.V. executive persona is seen presenting a Fall line-up of reality T.V. shows that mimics Survivor and its progeny, but also introduces the battle of the sexes that is taken to the extreme in the town of Stepford. By the time of her sudden departure from the network and her family's move to the suburbs, I was already in fits of laughter (as were those around me) and looking forward to the introduction of Bette Midler and Glenn Close's characters. I was not disappointed.\n\nBette Midler's droll commentary on her too-perfect neighbors, and the friendship between Bette Midler's Bobbi, Nicole Kidman's Joanna, and their Gay neighbor, provides the context for some of the absolutely funniest movie moments I have seen this year. As with many absolutely hysterical movies, if one examines the plot too closely deep holes can be discovered. The beauty of this film is that while in the theatre, you are kept laughing too hard to give much thought to anything other than catching your breath before the next joke is upon you."

Then I heard it was going to be a comedy and Glenn Close had another eccentric role unworthy of her talents. The film is mercifully about 20 minutes shorter (script issues?) than the original and the last 20 minutes are ludicrous. It appears there may have been tampering with the editing after the first test-showing, causing inane plot developments. If the women are indeed human (with electrodes in their brains) how can a character spout ATM bills? How can the Midler character not feel the stove flame burning her hand? In a final confrontation, Kidman stands by her robotic replica as they descend to the dungeon (but the women were supposed to be real with electrodes in them)! In the last scene poor Close is actually cuddling a HEAD. The story stands much better as a horror-mystery thriller so see the original Ross, Paul Prentiss classic. While leisurely, it builds to an unforgettable final sequence."

It's as though the filmmakers changed their mind halfway through as to exactly how the story should be resolved, which in turn caused the filmmakers to contradict themselves on more than a few details. Apart from that, the movie simply isn't entertaining for any extended period of time. The whole thing is just a mess.\n\nNicole Kidman continues to prove that she is perhaps the most overrated actress in terms of marketability. This isn't a critique on her talent, but she continues to get massive paychecks for roles she doesn't really fit, and her string of box office flops is growing to epic proportions. Compare the budgets vs. returns of her last several films. It's amazing.\n\nAnyway, if you want a good rental some evening, take whatever movie is on the shelf next to this version of the Stepford Wives. I guarantee you it will be better than this."

Nicole Kidman said nasty things about director Frank Oz behind his back, and the cast and crew in turn said things about her. Matthew Broderick said it was one of his worst filming experiences of his career.\n\nAnd then the movie came out and flopped. It deserved to. It's a huge mess - an uninspired, silly, over-the-top, stupid, insulting, smug, self-conscious little \"comedy\" that is too nice to be dark and too dark to be nice.\n\nThe first half is pretty clever and I found it amusing. Nicole Kidman has a nervous breakdown and moves out of the city with her husband (Broderick) to get away from the chaos. Once there they find a home in a small community named Stepford, begun by a local millionaire (Christopher Walken).\n\nShe makes some friends with neighbors Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler, but soon realizes the local \"perfect wives\" are indeed just that - and may in fact be robots.\n\nThe movie tries to be a satire of our repression of women's rights and so on and so forth. It tries to criticize the lustful sexual appetite of men and say that women are more than just bodies. They have souls and feelings and emotions.\n\nBut this is a simple point and even by today's standards it's outdated itself - this was far more prescient back in the '50s and '60s when the original took place. Nowadays it seems redundant and smug.\n\nThe ending is where it all falls apart - it was obviously reshot to be \"happier\" and you can even tell because Nicole Kidman's hair is completely different at the end of the movie, which implies she was brought back months later for the re-shoot.\n\nIt's a horrible little film that is instantly forgettable and annoying."

The starry cast all perform well enough with Roger Bart in particular delivering an engaging comic turn as one of Stepford's gay couple (a feature which, unsurprisingly, did not feature in the novel or the first film version but which actually works quite well here) but the actors are really taking part in something here which is beneath them. That said, the film is never less than watchable and it certainly looks good throughout. The problem is, it's ultimately a rather silly and forgettable affair which, for a big budget, big studio summer event movie, is disappointing to say the least."

The film lacks any of the mystery (one of the two key twists is revealed early on), suspense, or horror of the original (which, while a flawed film, at least had some convictions), though many of the scenes are lovingly reproduced (the concluding grocery store sequence, por ejemplo). Nicole Kidman fits well as the lead, a cold-hearted woman looking to jump-start her life, possessing the right blend of sex appeal and comic timing; Bette Midler steals the show as the only other non-conformed female in Stepford. But despite the faithfulness to the original film (transposed somewhat uncomfortably into the realm of comedy), the ending is a shameless cop-out of politically-correct silliness, defying the downbeat sense of total male domination over the female gender which gave the original an eerie resonance--the climax plays it far too safe, and ultimately ruins any modern-day prophecy this film would have been looking to convey (if at all).\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a disappointment this film is. I saw it at a sneak preview over a year ago, and hadn't seen it since then, but just remembered that I didn't really care for it. Until the other night when I watched it again, I was reminded just how disappointing this film really is.\n\nI saw this before I saw the original from 1975, and that version is so much better. It's eerier, and much more intense than this version is. In this film, they're too focused on making it funny, which it really isn't at all. I was also disappointed that Bette Midler didn't have better lines, or wasn't in as much of the film. She's my favorite actress, but I just felt that she wasn't given enough to work with in this piece. Nicole Kidman was alright, but she's always great in every role that she takes. Matthew Brodrick was good, and was the dork that he was meant to play, however in the original although the husband of the Kathrine Ross character was a loser type, he wasn't as big of a nerd as they made Matthew Brodrick. That was the other mistake of the film, was that they changed a lot of the characters' characteristics. It would have been better, as just a straight thriller, and not a dark comedy, because it really didn't work well that way. The first twenty minutes of the film are pretty good, but in my opinion it's pretty down hill from there.\n\nThere are a few funny lines from time to time, but generally speaking, it's not scary, not intense, and not funny. It failed on all accounts. The real sad part, is that you can tell a lot of work and production went into the film. Frank Oz and his crew spent a lot of money, time and effort into making the film, and in the end it was just a bomb. Glenn Close was probably the best looking she's ever been, and one of the best performances and roles I've ever seen her give or be in.\n\nI really wouldn't recommend this film. It's a let down right from the start, and I wouldn't waste your two bucks renting it."

In general, I'm not fun of remakes, because original is always original, number one, but this movie has some qualities on it's own, and that's why it should be watched in that way. Maybe it's the best for everyone who attends to watch this m movie not to read Ira Levin's book, or not to watch any movie based on it.

The men are mostly male chauvinists who want their wives to wait on them hand and foot. The women come across as shrill and unhappy. Bette Midler and Nicole Kidman are good in their roles, but their characters are simply not interesting or likable. I have never been a Bette Midler because I think she comes across as simply loud and that's what happens in this movie. Kidman's character makes mean spirited reality TV shows (the footage from which is funnier than most of the rest of the film because it actually satirizes reality TV which I hate)before moving to Stepford. Are either of these characters worth rooting for? I don't think so. Matthew Broderick actually comes across best as Kidman's loving husband. Glenn Close and Christopher Walkien are also very good. Faith Hill has some good moments of physical comedy. However, John Lovitz (!) is badly miscast as Midler's (!!) husband. There are some laughs but you know exactly whee this movie is going before it goes there. 5/10 and I think that is generous."

Discussing the movie with a friend, she said that if she was heavily hung-over, unable to move from the sofa and turned on the TV to find that there was absolutely nothing else on except the film, she would watch it. I wouldn't go this far.\n\nThe Commentary by Frank Oz is conversational and informative. Oz is an engaging speaker, rather more involving than the film itself, and reveals that he shot, at great expense, an entirely different beginning featuring hordes of marching, Prada-clad women that proved wrong for the film (it's odd that this isn't included in the deleted scenes). He explains why several comedic sequences were cut in order to drive the story forward and provides a very comprehensive (and extremely complementary) overview of the different crew and cast members who helped make the film."

It was just an ordinary, watchable movie and rather confusing. I was able the watch it until the point I stopped and told myself that something was wrong. It was like watching two different films especially beginning and the end of it. In the beginning, we were being implied that Stepford women were models and Nicole Kidman was a closest example of human being close to it but definitely with lots of flaws. But, but in the end what we have is there are actually no robots. I think something happened during previews that the director had rearrange the movie and it was all messed up. The ending of the movie was wrapped up in a rush that you actually don't realise things like Matthew Broderick saying\"Oh, she was never a robot whilst she had been robot for like a couple of minutes. There are a few question marks in my head. What happened to the dog? Has it ever had the chance to be a normal dog again? What did the gay guy see from the window inside the club? I am pretty sure the film was much longer than its running time and a big slice of it was cut on the way to the cinemas. Such a shame as it might have made more sense and maybe a bit more enjoyable and made more sense if it was shown as it is. ** out of *****"

There was alot in common except for a few major points. It could have been so much more. With 3 maybe 4 funny lines, it was just drab. Did the producers try and make it funny? I hope not because they failed miserably. Of course Glenn Close came through at the end with a well acted speech and Nicole Kidman showed her acting chops but Christopher Walken was wasted.\n\nI should mention the ending, which is the kind of ending that just constantly gets worse. The ending starts out with a complete distortion of the original movie, then builds up to the most ridiculous plot twist I've seen in any movie, before finishing off with a vacuous female fantasy that's even more chauvinistic than the shadowy men's association from the original movie.\n\nThe first film was bad and the followup (or whatever) was bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE STEPFORD WIVES is Frank Oz' radical re-thinking of the 1975 classic about the mysterious town of Stepford where everything is not as neat and clean as it appears on the outside. In the original, Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss played two relatively new citizens of Stepford, who desperately tried to figure out what was going on with the women of Stepford before falling under the \"spell.\" In this remake, Nicole Kidman plays the Ross role, Joanna, who is now a high powered television executive who was fired from her job and had a nervous breakdown, who is brought to Stepford by her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick)to start a new life with her husband and children. Stepford has been updated for the new millennium: there is even a gay couple played by David Marshall Grant and Roger Bart (THE PRODUCERS; DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES), but it's the same old evil. Unfortunately, Oz plays all his cards right away and all the suspense of the original is drained away. In the original, there is some mystery as to what's going on with these men and women, but there is no mystery at all in this version...it's spelled out for us five minutes after Joanna and Walter arrive in Stepford. Not only is the mystery of the wives completely spelled out but the mystery of the Stepford Men's Association is laughable in this version...it comes off looking like a bunch of teenage boys sitting around drinking and playing video games. It also breaks my heart to say, as a huge Nicole Kidman fan, this is the first performance of hers that was really a disappointment for me. I found Kidman's performance to be broad and affected, somewhat like a Stepford wife before she is Stepford-ized. There are laughs to be found here and they come from Bette Midler, a joy in the Paula Prentiss role, Bart, Christopher Walken, and Glenn Close, who are perfection as Stepford's version of Welcome Wagon, all set against Oscar-worthy scenery and costumes, but next to the original classic...this is a pale , pale copy."

She looks good, as always, and as someone else said, is quite lovely with dark hair. Glenn Close and Bette Midler played their parts in much the same way, and most people seem to think they can act.

It's a different sort of film than the original and probably would amuse (if not offend) Ira Levin if he were alive today. But to put it bluntly, the film is a sellout to politically correct mentalities and could quite easily be called \"Revenge of the Stepford Wives.\" (Actually there was a TV movie from 1980 by that name that I haven't seen.) The original Stepford Wives starred Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss and was a dark science fiction satire with only a few chuckles and a decidedly dark ending. This film is played mostly for laughs and is full of all sorts of silly (shall I say stupid?) updates, like having a gay couple instead of a black couple and making the wives (prior to their coming to Stepford) very accomplished--CEOs, scientists, etc., while the husbands are Neanderthal nerds. Nicole Kidman's Joanna Eberhart was a top TV exec while her husband Walter Kresby (played sheepishly by Matthew Broderick--note that Joanna did not take his last name) is a kind of ordinary joe and caddy to his wife.\n\nBut what about the premise? Let's be honest guys. Wouldn't it be wonderful if our wives were totally devoted to our comfort and pleasure? If they obeyed us and always kept the house and themselves spotless and catered to our every whim? If they didn't get moody and were always rational, etc.? Isn't it the natural state of the human male to be king of his castle and to have dominion over all he surveys? Well, at any rate here's an update on the Stepford Wives for the new millennium, an expansion of the concept, if you will. Every man has not only a totally devoted and loving wife, but a totally devoted and loving mistress (or two). They would be robots of course, manufactured as consumer goods by General Electric, Microsoft and Intel. But here is the zinger: every woman would have a slavishly devoted husband and secret lover, etc. And while we are at it, they would have loving, appreciative and accomplished robotic children. In other words, nobody would actually interact with other living, breathing human beings. How crude, how disgusting. Instead all humans would interact only with perfect robots perfectly designed to make their world a heaven on earth.\n\nOr, more likely we would just be hooked up to an elaborate software program with an utterly convincing virtual reality in which we would have a loyal and loving spouse, two extracurricular lovers..., etc.\n\nFly in the ointment? I think it would be called boredom.\n\nBottom line on this film: a few laughs, a good cast wasted, but a nice documentation of filmland executive stupidity.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)"

I suppose the Disneyesque music is a big clue to the tone of this film. The actors are, as you'd expect, competent. A comedy version? I suppose it's in keeping with a post-feminist reworking of more 'serious' work, but then it really should be a lot funnier than this simple pastiche. All of that said, maybe it really took off in the half hour I couldn't force myself to watch. If you're a director and decide to remake a good film, please try to add something..."

The only woman who seems in the least genuine is Bette Midler - but even that's spoiled, imho, by her obvious misandry and her unlikely marriage to Jon Lovitz (I'd have forgiven that if the director had allowed Lovitz to be funny). So even Bette Midlers character, the enlightened Manhattan writer, is underneath just another castrating clich\u00e9 of modern femininity.\n\nA pathetic movie, unfunny, disjointed and possibly Kidman's worst effort ever."

The movie just rushes itself along, hoping you won't ask any questions or wonder just how the heck certain parts happened (the actual Stepford-ing process being foremost in my mind), which anyone with an IQ over 30 is going to have, and the ending is so appallingly lame and saccharine that you could only wish it ended at the same point as the original version did (which would be about 29 years ago).

He has noticed the despite being a successful couple their marriage has suffered because of the work/life balance.\n\nAfter her dismissal the couple move to the town of Stepford which seems like an idyllic retreat from the stresses and strains of the rat race in the city.

Kidman along with frumpy author Bette Midler and a renowned gay designer finds there is something wrong with this white picket fenced Republican wet dream.\n\nThis version is a satire mixed with black humour and a surprisingly amiable film as long as you park your brain elsewhere. The film went through re-shoots with an ending that does not work. Then again a lot of the film does not work if you spend too long thinking about it. Its as a half good idea and an unfinished script which got the green light to go into production.\n\nAre these women robots or was there some sort of brain re- programming? If they are robots the original women must be dead? We have a scene where one of the women dispenses bank notes for some reason. If its some sort of brain re-programming then the women could become normal at the end of the film.

Wholesale changes were made, apparently, and the resultant film is something of a mess. Despite this, it shows occasional flashes of the bright satire it might have been.\n\nThe film opens brightly with a neat credits sequence and an amusing riff on reality TV as hard-hearted TV executive Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman, looking very plain and unglamorous throughout) unveils her station's programmes for the new season. Sacked by her network when a contestant from one of her shows kills his ex-wife as a result of being on the show, Eberhart moves with her husband (Matthew Broderick) to the wealthy town of Stepford, where she slowly discovers that things are not as they should be.\n\nNearly all the laughs in this film are contained in the first fifteen minutes (apart from a great AOL dig near the end), but things become increasingly silly once the action moves to Stepford where all the hot wives wear plastic smiles and occasionally move in perfect synchronicity. It's the lazy male's fantasy made real, and there should be a rich vein of humour for writer Paul Rudnick to mine, but unfortunately his script is flat and uninteresting, and modern day sensibilities simply insists that one of the eventual wives is a gay man (Roger Bannister). Once Stepford's wicked secret starts coming to light, the script plays like a 'serious' horror film without all the horror bits taken out as it abandons its increasingly woeful attempts at humour for an ill-conceived mystery that completely fails to involve the viewer.\n\nFor a smart, hotshot executive, Eberhart is incredibly slow to fathom out what is going on \u0096 in fact she's so slow she has to be told \u0096 and the promotional film of the town's leader, Mike (Christopher Walken), while an amusing riff on 50s promo films, actually flies in the face of all we have seen before. The Stepford wives aren't robots at all \u0096 even though they double as mobile ATM machines \u0096 but real women who have had chips inserted in their heads after \"first, we locate the brain.\" Ah well, the film has lost all audience goodwill by then, anyway, so it doesn't really matter."

The film uses the plot in Ira Levin's book and in the older film as a pretext for a more deep and critical view of life in America. I liked it, and I believe that it is one of the best satiric films of the year, more serious and deep than it seems, saying a lot about the rush for kitsch, the politics, the false morality, and the standardized 'model' life as that is so common in the American society today.\n\nIt's certainly not a masterpiece, and the lines of the plot are too much simplified and too obvious sometimes. But after all, this is the case with good classic comedy in the tradition of Chaplin. What remained for me are the memorable characters played by Bette Milder, Glenn Close, Walken, and of course, Nicole Kidman. What a great actress! Just watch her in the 20 seconds first plan screen shot when she is told that she is fired from her position as TV anchor. Real anthology stuff.\n\nYes, this film will not get Oscars this year, and was not well received. Is this because the conservative atmosphere in the US today? Maybe. However, time will make justice to it - I am sure and people will get back to it and love it. It may become a cult movie, but for different reasons than the original 'Stepford Wives'. Right now I gave it 8 out of 10 on my personal scale."

It is very easy to explain everything very straightforwardly: this guy is a devil, shame on him! ... and now everything will be OK again, we know who's guilty.\n\nI will tell you a story: man and wife move to town where everything seems to be just perfect. Everybody happy. But slowly they see that behind this happiness there is something strange: this happiness is just too perfect to be real. Real one is a bit sad, too, even if this sounds strangely. It isn't that \"cool\". The presented happiness is the one without ANY feeling, just the happiness like by produced by some machine. She didn't like this way of being happy, and of course she didn't. Who would? Well, maybe the man, since a PART of this happiness is that wives are sort of slaves to their husbands, which the men would like after all. But the women seem to be happy about this, too. And you may ask: is this OK or not? ... a lot of questions arises, you may try your own ones.\n\nSlowly we are led to the point of the story: the woman becomes the same as the others. So what? Is there somebody who changes the wives into some strange kind of robots, whatever this means? Or she just merged into the society? Isn't this the problem of all of us, after all? Every of us probably told to him/herself once: I will NOT be like them (when I grow up, when I do the same job, when I move to this part of town...). But we did, probably? At this point the story ends. No explanation, you may say.\n\nAre you interested in such kind of a story? Well, read the book, since nothing of it the movie offers. In the movie everything is clear: there is somebody changing the women into robots just to make men lazing their lives comfortably. The laboratory is shown, men has remote controls in their pockets. Even more, the reason is told: every one of these women has been once a successful director, manager, a.s.o. And... finally everything is explained plainly, and all the men meet in the shopping center forced to do the shopping.\n\nOh my god, how flat story has been made from a three dimensional book full of interesting questions!"

Matthew Broderick was so unaffected, that I thought his performance was going to cause narcolepsy.\n\nThe plot is simple-minded. The direction is awful. This tries to have a sci-fi twist to it, but they got that wrong as well. It is so far removed from anything close to reality, that the movie is more in the fairy tale genre than sci-fi. I can suspend disbelief, but there are limits. C'mon.\n\nThe deleted scenes on the DVD reveal that their was some notion of going way, way over the top with characters spontaneously developing long reaching mechanical arms and lawn-mowing attachments. This is in direct conflict of the premise that something is being done to these (human) women. It's good that they removed those scenes, but some of the remaining scenes suggest that these are robots, not humans. It's all a real mess.\n\nThis is total garbage and a total waste of my time."

Really dated in light of the Me Too movement and recently more 'enlightened' attitudes to race and LGBT. Borderline offensive at times with those men sitting around and objectifying women. The Mathew Broderick character was awful and the way the story progresses makes you question Nicole's motives for staying with him. The 2 gay characters were stereotypes in every way imaginable. The Jewish character played by Bette who I usually love in anything was again awkwardly added in. She was very unfunny throughout and you got a sense she knew she was in a stinker. I love Nicole in everything but this was a bad mistake for her to lower herself to appear in. What was she thinking? Was there lots of money involved for all these A listers?This is one movie that should be quietly filed away somewhere...and forgotten...."

Actually, I'm sure it wasn't all his fault for the outcome of this totally and utterly pointless remake of a decent film from yep, you guessed it, the 70's. Is it just me or is Hollywood having a midlife crisis? What's with all the needless remakes of already well-done flicks? What gives? Why can't they remake a crappy film and turn it into a true success story? Oh, because that would actually mean it has to be good...sorry, I forgot. With an excellent cast of tried and true actors you would naturally think they'd be able to bring the quality up past the mediocre script that was summoned for this ridiculous excuse of a film. Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler would usually make for a pretty powerful cast. Here, however, they're all just flopping around in a nice-looking but astonishingly empty rehash of stuff we've already visited. Where's the novelty in that? It would be one thing if the creators attempted to take it into a different direction, thus giving validity to this remake. Alas, no such luck here. They just go through the motions and expect everyone to \"ooh\" and \"aah\" at a plot they think no one's ever heard of before at all. Who are they kidding? This is probably the most unfunny \"black comedy\" I've ever seen...And I use that term loosely, since there's really nothing \"black\" or \"dark\" about it at all; even though it wants you to believe that it indeed is...Don't fall for it. Do yourself a favor and just go watch the original 70's version which is much better than this thing could ever hope to be...It's lifeless, toothless and completely worthless...Don't waste your time..."

The reality show parodies at the beginning fell flat, Bette Midler had no particularly funny lines, and the only laughs came from the tired queen stereotype gay men and some comically demented moments from Glenn Close. The 1975 film with Katharine Ross is no classic. Ross was such a passive movie presence in general that there was nothing at stake in the threat of her being transformed by the nefarious doings of the Stepford Men's Club. So the idea of a remake is a good one, especially since the backlash against feminism is still going strong even with the advances women have obtained in the last few decades - conservatives (male and female) are still criticizing working moms and some religious groups are more proactive in proselytizing about women subjecting their wills to their husbands. To give \"Stepford Wives\" the treatment it needs would require a dark satire, not the over-the-top dumb farce we get here. The performers do their best with the lousy material, though the idea that someone as young as Kidman would run a network struck me as implausible."

Selfishness, greed, and immaturity, is in my religion considered great sins, and creates great carnage. This movie hits the issue that God never made us robots, but gave us free will; the robots were not real people. No choice, like in 'A Clockwork Orange'. This would be a very dry relationship. I don't think that either the control freaks on both sides were happy people. I found acceptance in whatever my fate is, a better way; for my life has been one of misery, and I found control and illusion. One can just plan and do their best. The humor lacked on this heavy subject, and this movie got across as a TV movie. Christopher Walken is the only saving grace, as usual I give it a 5 out of 10."

The costumes, by Ann Roth are beautiful and the setting are superb. Bette Midler is in top form and Roger Bart practically steals the show. One note: Even though Faith Hill is featured there actually is very little of her in the movie...she must have been a victim of the cutting room floor."

The cutesy-poo whodunit ending make me want to vomit and every time I saw Matthew Broderick I was expecting him to yell out \"Go-Go Gadget\" because thats about the limit of his acting ability. So bad is this remake that I was actually shocked and taken aback at how different this is from the original. Even the controversy the original movie had over the womens lib movement back in the 70's is nothing compared to how horrible this movie is. This movie just goes to show that the American movie audience has lost its edge to distinguish what is good and what is bad in the filmed entertainment industry.The only thing I must strive for you to do if you see this abomination is to see the original and then compare the two. you will be shocked just as I was in how the quality of films have degraded over the years."

But if you just sit down and enjoy the film for what it is, it's actually a very watchable and amusing experience.\n\nThe person who makes the film is Bette Midler as the eccentric hippie writer. Once again she steals every scene with her funny lines and hilarious comedy timing. All fans of Bette Midler should definitely seek this out just for her alone! The film on the whole is actually quite witty and enjoyable it's just a shame the screenplay wasn't stronger on the story side!\n\n\"The Stepford Wives\" could also be quite offensive to any gender or gay people. It's sexist in the way it portrays men as slobs sitting around in a circle playing robot wars and just treating women as objects, wanting nothing from them but sex and cash. Now I'm sure some men do (I hope the don't!) but for the majority of men I don't think that's what they want! It's also sexist in the way it portrays women as being good housewives, sitting around cleaning all day and making thousands of cupcakes. It's homophobic in the way it thrusts gay stereotypes onto us. Bear in mind that all of this is done through humour and shouldn't be taken seriously, but still some people could find this offensive!\n\nBasically this is your standard chick-flick but with an added fizz, it's completely daft but fun. You can tell that everyone involved was having fun playing there part, Glenn Close was particularly enjoyable as the crazy owner of \"Stepford\". I quite enjoyed it, it certainly wasn't dull but is nothing out of the ordinary!"

The film is a good one. It makes you laugh. It turns ugly when they drop the comedy element and try to scare you in the last 30 minutes of the film. Also, with the continuity. They switch back and forth from saying the women are the original woman with microchips in their brains to saying they are robots. If there were only chips in their brains, why would the \"robot\" of Nicole Kidman be laying on the surface when it opens it's eyes. Doesn't anyone else find that strange? Seriously.

        "review_detailed_main": "This remake offers a good cast, a promising team and first and foremost a very intriguing plot. Unfortunately the filmmakers could not entirely decide whether to make a sci fi thriller like the movie from the seventies or a comedy. It has a wonderful opening-credit sequence which hails the fifties with their nightmarish perfect-housewife-commercials and groundbreaking kitchen inventions. Then the movie sets his tone introducing Nicole Kidman as a superpopular TV-host (Mr. Kidman was never colder as a character)who bathes herself in the success of her cruel real-time TV shows. After getting fired for basically ruining peoples lives with inhumanly disgusting shows she finds herself in the superclean and somewhat unreal little town of Stepford. While Kidman's character is very well developed, her husband's is not. Matthew Broderick fails to persuade us that he is a true heartbreaker and a great companion for a career-woman such as Kidman. You don't believe that she actually fell in love with him, he is just to weak and boring.The couple just does not seem to belong together, the same problem we found in COLD MOUNTAIN with Kidman and Jude Law. Later we do not want to buy that Broderick's character is turned around by the macho-attitudes of the Stepford-husbands, he is too nice for that.\n\nIn the third act the whole thing collapses because the filmmakers do not succeed in turning this comedy into a really frightening thriller. This story is interesting because of the horrible truth being discovered at the end. Instead of leaving us with an open end which would make us moan the characters we fell in love with before (Kidman, Bette Midler) this movie delivers us a poor explanation that takes away the horror - and the horror is the most attractive part of this story in the first place. THE STEPFORD WIVES wants to be a comedy and a thriller, wants to be sarcastic, full of secrets, exiting, a little heart worming and shocking - and is nothing of the above completely. A straight thriller with this cast and crew would have made a great film. OK, I also had some laughs...only to bow my head during the last 15 minutes!"

But they had artificial bodies of the woman laying around... WHY!? So they're not robots, the movie tells us this... BUT they can burn themselves and not be hurt, have ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, and DISPENSE CASH FROM THEIR MOUTHS.

The sets look as if they came under budget on time and effort. They look cheap and quickly thrown together. The change from Manhattan city life to perfect Stepford land is unnoticeable in the way the dress, setting and style of the film and characters appear. Because of this, it's clear that the \u0091clean and neat' style the film may have been going for is not a commentary on its theme of perfection, but simply the lack of effort to make it otherwise. The story is adapted from the original thriller, The Stepford Wives and hence the originality of its plot is not something the crew of this production can take credit for. Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has lost her position has a high ranking official in the television world and, with her husband (Matthew Broderick) and their children, moves to Stepford, the setting of this mediocre thriller and `mystery'. Why are these women so perfect? Where do the men go all day? What do they do there? The audience knows the answers and so we watch Kidman try to answer these questions but instead simply establish herself as a drama queen. Her performance lacks originality and, although she is believable, she has not completely separated herself from Nicole into Joanna. The supporting cast is comic relief (and they're not really all that comical). Bett Middler plays the odd girl and with her gay sidekick, they join Joanna in an attempt to answer their questions about the robotic barbies posing as wives, but instead feel like extra baggage. Of course, it's just now that Joanna's there that the preoccupied feminist and her Queer Eye clone have decided that there's something strange going on. That's the movies for you. Or rather, that's Stepford. The cast and crew of this movie knew it was bad. They refused comment on it. They went back and attempted re-shoots to improve open it's flaws. But however it happened, a week of pick-up shots can't change the problem of this movie. In fact, the entire thing looks like it was filmed with ten different directors over the course of ten months. Every aspect of each scene looks like it was stolen from twenty different movies and then photoshopped to fit the current directors image. This movie is clumsy, confused and very un-Stepford. **/*****"

The idea of changing your woman's mind and body with electronic device and then control her with remote control is funny. Where you can also inflate your woman's breast with remote. :-D Where every couple have sex in the daylight. I still wondering if the husband did go to work. When?"

        "review_detailed_main": "First, Kidman, a poor actress, is perfect in this ridiculous and annoying movie.\n\nYes, poor. An anonymous reviewer put it better than I could: Through most of her film roles, Nicole Kidman more or less comes off as the tall poppy with whispery voice and an ice queen propensity. If not that, she tries too hard to come across as a serious actress and unfortunately, falls short when it comes to her range of expression capability.\n\nThat aside; this flick is disjointed. The best part is the climax (as you might expect); where we find out Glenn Close is even more insane than the Stepford husbands; who willingly have their wives sacrificed in favor of obedient, physically hot Robotesses who scream in bed each time their vaginal micro-switches are tripped. Really? The only ones that would go for this, are guys that already own blow up dolls, and I would surmise that's a very small percentage of the population.\n\nAnd the opening scene is just plain dumb & insulting It comes off as a poor play.\n\nThe original was fairly creepy (and unfortunately poorly directed as it moved much too slowly the 1st hour or so), otherwise it had great potential. This 2004 remake; is well...... I guess 'Hokey' & as I said, annoying would be apt terms. And the original had the gorgeous and lively Paula Prentiss. What a doll she is in that.\n\nI'm still trying to determine if this remake was worth the time of one viewing. Its attempt at works a couple times, but that's it. And the movie doesn't know what genre it wants to be.\n\nStill, with Midler, Close, Ferris Bueller, and a wacky Chris Walken, I guess I'd have to lean for recommending watching it once; you know; if your in a leg cast and you misplaced your walker and remote.\n\nI'll say this, my wife got semi-hooked on it (according to her); \"just to see where the heck it was going\". But she said it basically stunk overall.\n\nSorry, I realize this is not a very objective review this time. I'm hoping my subjective comments point you in the right direction though.\n\nFor me, I found the acting and directing, repeatedly annoying. I've never seen that before and I hope I don't see it again.\n\nThx. Bob R."

The movie gave away pretty much all it's secrets right away. I was unfamiliar with what it was going to be about and found it highly disappointing. Even when I see movies I know the end to I expect more suspense than this offers.\n\nI thought all of the actors turned in brilliant performances; Nicole Kidman was emotionally driven, and all the other actors seemed to really do a nice job, including the Wives, who had to act perfect in unison. Even the oft-criticized Matthew Broderick made a good mediocre husband to his powerhouse wife, and I could see him wrestling with his decision, but it created very little drive for the story.\n\nI think the bulk of this movie's problem seemed to be how it was all put together. It could have explored a lot of issues deeper, it could have been a lot more engaging, but it wasn't. The film couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be, and wound up being nothing.\n\nPlus there was the robot/microchip inconsistency..."

I am embarrassed for him after seeing his remake of \"The Stepford Wives\". Not sure if this should be called a remake since its predecessor by 29 years was a much darker, more serious film than the current fluff. This script is awful and the casting is equally atrocious. Matthew Broderick is no actor. He peaked at \"War Games\" and should just sit back and spend his husband money from \"Sex and the City\". I fully understand Nicole Kidman wanting to take a walk on the lighter side after her last 3 or 4 years, but even Kidman can't make this one work. Glenn Close steals most of her scenes as the smiling twin sister to her Cruella Deville role from the Dalmation movies, but even her role falls apart at the end. Christopher Walken is good for a couple of laughs, but overall this is a real stinker. Bette Midler does little but pose in a frumpy manner a couple of times. I did like the premise with the twist on the previous lives of the husband and wives, but of course, it was not developed properly. Terribly disappointing, so skip it if you are looking for a comedy, or pick up the original if you want a darker drama."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to review films which are re-makes or re-hashes of an original. But lets try! We all know the basic conceit of the film in that husbands can replace their over-achieving wives with eponymous housewives - who are for decorative value with their 'drive' in business/science/political life etc removed and replaced with a subservient decorative 'housewife' aspect.\n\nI find 'successful America' a shallow backdrop, but this is necessary here as the plot involves the well to do in their gated estate. The general situation emerges in an unsubtle way. Wives are shallow and ornamental, and time is spent allowing the husbands to confirm that is how they want their wives to be.\n\nWe know there is something peculiar going on when one of the wives has a malfunction during a civic dance. This pretty much confirms Kidmans sense that something is amiss. Walken makes an an appearance as the brains behind the situation, but without any suspense or intrigue about his character or what that character does. There is a housewife who doesn't appear to fulfil the ideal presented played by Midler. But the role played is simply to provide the contrast between actual wives and the 'ideal' wives. She ends up being converted, but to be honest, I was wondering why she had not been up to that point.\n\nThere is a decision to be taken by Broderick in respect of his wife, but watch the film to see what this is. The final part of the film comes at a ballroom event, and we are then told what we need to know about the wives, who is responsible and the status of the relationship between Kidman/Broderick.\n\nThere is a pretty poor twist to the film's ending, but it adds little.\n\nA film which seemed more about the American high-life than the basic scenario about re-manufacturing individuals as life-style accessories and dealing with issues that might be expected to arise.\n\nThe film was visually attractive, but lacking in any real plot development and ultimately for the characters, a lack of empathy or understanding."

The Stepford wives is really a movie worth watching and I must say, I really (!!!) like it. If you like comedies with heart, charm, a touch of romance and also some things to think about, then this is definitely one for you. All actors are at least doing good jobs, some are splendid and the story itself is really lovable. Yes, the plot has some tiny weaknesses, but nothing to really bother about. Watch it and judge by yourself. The story itself is witty, smartly designed and it will catch you in a way that you will lose your interest in looking for some minor flaws. I give this movie 8 out of ten and it really deserves this vote. Try it!"

Me sitting in the movie theater just wanted to take a remote and hit \"fast forward\". The movie had a lot of nauseating all happy scenes, that didn't contribute anything to the plot. I feel they were inserted just to eat up time. I feel this whole movie can easily be edited into a 1 hr primetime TV episode.\n\nAlso there were many conflicting things that just didn't make sense. Making you feel there are different scripts and plots that were edited together, I cant even say combined. Most of little scenes aren't linked to each other.\n\nAlso I could predict the entire movie from just the TV trailers. There really isn't anything to see, its just like waiting for the end, no climax. Plus I feel like I wasted my time in the theater, if this was HBO I would have turned off the TV after 5-10 minutes. Only reason I sat it out was because I paid $10 to see and I wanted to get something.\n\nThis movie was a good idea, but just is too unorganized. It would have made a very nice horror/thriller movie/crime drama/horror sci-fi. But instead it tried to be funny, but not in a SNL or scary movie style funniness or a parody. This mixed genre just made the movie nauseating. There is subtle humor, but it just isn't mixed in very nicely (mostly Nicole does it).\n\nIn my opinion, if u need a movie that u can, um, be affectionate to your partner in. Stepford Wives is perfect, its so boring and not really interesting u can um take care of your partner."

But, if you're in need of some mindless fun and stargazing, this is the right movie. The cast does a wonderful job with what they have, turning what could have been some horrid, mind-numbing garbage into humorous, exceptionally cheesy fun. Nicole Kidman does a bang up job in this less than stellar role, as does Matthew Broderick and Christopher Walken. But the movie was stolen by the supporting cast of Bette Midler as the outspoken wonderfully blunt Bobbie Markowitz, Glenn Close as the psychotically perfect Claire and of course where would we be without the dumb blonde? Faith Hill does a hilarious job as the seemingly brainless Sarah Sunderson. If you happen to find this movie, do not expect a chillingly dark horror, but rather a fairly corny comedy that still leaves you wondering."

The women are all really unpleasant people (to put it in a very nice way), the men are their little slaves... When the families of two of these women move to a little town where they see that all the man can do what they want, don't have to bother about what the women think and clearly are the boss at home, the husbands want to change their wives as well.\n\nThan of course you get the obvious scenes which belong to this kind of movies.

Ladylike realtor Glenn Close (as Claire Wellington) explains, \"It has no crime, no poverty, and no pushing.\" Strangest of all, most of \"The Stepford Wives\" obey their husbands with robotic subservience.

When her imperfect pals begin to change, Kidman thinks something's rotten in Stepford. And, she's right. Watching it unfold is moderately enjoyable, but there are missteps and missed opportunities. Kidman, to her credit, tries to turns it around; but, the opening makes you dislike the lead character.

        "review_detailed_main": "Usually I have no problems with remakes if they're done successfully. Of course, that didn't authorize Gus Van Sant's Psycho, but that's beside the point. Frank Oz (who many recognize as the voice of Yoda and Miss Piggy from the Muppets, among others), already had one successful remake under his belt (the enjoyable Little Shop of Horrors), but needed more. So he decided to remake an obscure 1975 thriller about a town that's too perfect, The Stepford Wives. And now I think I'm on the bandwagon on saying that all of these remakes need to be stopped NOW.\n\nJoanna (Nicole Kidman, badly masking her accent yet again) is a successful TV person (executive? president? I don't remember), but after there's an assassination attempt on her (during a 15 minute overview of the new season-completely unnecessary [except for a 'pun' later]), she's fired. She and her less successful husband Walter (Matthew Broderick, who seems to be underused lately) move with their two kids to Stepford, Connecticut, where it seems like everyone's stuck in the 1950's. But something's not right, as Joanna senses, and tries to discover what it is, while Walter gets dragged into the chauvinistic society that the Stepford husbands share. Random characters (including that ubiquitous Christopher Walken) ensue.\n\nI could reiterate what every reviewer has been saying. I could say how this attempt at comedy, drama, and horror tries to be all three and fails at all three-which it does, completely. It falls over on its padded-runtime face many times whenever it tries to be one of the three. When it tries to be funny, it just isn't: you can flush the toilets from a control panel by the front door. Now isn't that hilarious? And when Walter has to choose between Joanna and a \"perfect\" wife (you'll understand if you see the movie...but you really shouldn't see it), the drama's supposed to be running high up. DUH! What do you think's gonna happen? And the whole concept (which might have been scary in the 1975 version, I didn't see it) just isn't scary. All of these problems don't lie in Oz (it seems like he's doing a bit of struggling for work), but in Paul Rudnick's screenplay. He tries to squeeze so much into it that it just doesn't work. Any of the plot \"twists\" that come about can be seen basically during the opening credits. Well, not the \"final\" twist, but that's too stupid to even mention.\n\nCharacters run to and fro without an iota of development (Jon Lovitz was in the movie?) and pop in just to say \"funny\" things or to help the \"plot\" along. But that's not even the worst of it. In every single scene-no exaggeration-there is either a boom mike or part of the camera in frame. I can forgive one or two-those things are pretty hard to avoid-but Stepford is such a slipshod, one-hand-tied-behind-your-back movie that they just don't care about making something that's technically well done. The only thing well done about this movie is Roger Bart as one of Stepford's only two gay men (such a stretch from his role as Carmen Ghia in the Broadway version of The Producers). Without his small character, the movie would be laugh less, every character uninteresting, and, well, the movie would still be awful. Basically, stay away from The Stepford Wives.\n\nMy rating: 3/10\n\nRated PG-13 for sexual content, thematic material and language."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Stepford Wives\" is a weird but fun film. It is like some reactionary's fantasy, or a liberal's nightmare. It is actually pretty deep, pricking at the zeitgeist of its time, of women gaining power, career, and influence at the cost of their more traditional feminine roles and how many men, and even some women, fear and dislike this. It concurrently and oppositely expresses the fear of working women, of losing their gender and family, of losing the progress and achievements that they made, but also of being put back into a little box of proper expectations and actions. A good film overall, especially well done visually, however I disliked the music and found is discordant and stressful, and perhaps it was supposed to be so, but it hurt the film for me, thus I only rate it a 4/10. And this was my second viewing of this film; it had been many years since I saw it last but I was surprised by just how much I recalled upon watching. It really is a memorable film."

You can kinda expect how it ends, but I had a great time,but there were parts where I was a little confused. Go watch it for yourself, you won't regret it, its got a great cast of actors/actresses such as the beautiful Nicole Kidman(Joanna Eberhart), the very talented Matthew Broderick(Walter Kresby), the hilarious Bette Midler(Bobbie Markowitz), Glenn Close (Claire Wellington), Chris Walken(Mike Wellington), And for her big screen debut as Sarah Sunderson, Faith Hill. All in all I give it a 10/10"

John Carpenter's \"The Thing\", and Cronenberg's \"the Fly\" automatically spring to mind because they truly weren't beholden to either of their respective originals and made them their own movies. What do we have that's new in the Stepford Wives? A flamingly gay half of a homosexual couple and a moronically lame ending. Which isn't innovative in the least really. The great Christopher Walken gets to play a pale parody of himself, Bette Midler is painfully unfunny, and the whole production just reeks of bad decisions. It's so awful that Ira Levin is undoubtedly spinning in his grave. Now he's not dead yet. The movie is just so atrocious that it made Ira drive all the way to his burial plot (the only time i'll mention \"plot\" in this review by the way), dig it up, put a casket down there, climb in and spin around in it. Which would be a hell of a lot of work and I bet is extremely tiring, Without a doubt Frank Oz's worst film and yes i DID see \"Housesitter\"\n\nMy Grade: D-"

The best of \"The Stepford Wives\" is the cast, no doubt about it. It is always a pleasure to watch Nicole Kidman, 'cause she's able to shine even in the worst circumstances. But she's not alone, you may look at the cast list back there at the movie's main index: Christopher Walken, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close... what a waste of talent.\n\n*My rate: 3.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching \"The Stepford Wives\" I can't help but feel cheated. I wasn't exactly expecting a movie that would be filled with non-stop laughs, but I was expecting at least a chuckle or two.\n\nThe movie stars Nicole Kidman as a TV executive who is unceremoniously terminated after a reality based show she produced resulted in a jaded husband going psycho and shooting up his estranged wife and her lovers (oh please). To brighten her perspective on life after show biz, her husband (Matthew Broderick) moves her and their children to a small town named Stepford in Connecticut. Here everything seems to be perfect. The wives are the epitome of happiness; smiles, cheerfulness and a spunk not seen since the late 1950s. On the other hand, the husbands seem to do nothing but play with rock 'em sock 'em robots, smoke cigars, and generally be chauvinistic. Kidman's character slowly begins to discover clues to point to something dark going on behind closed doors in Stepford that causes the women change their personalities.\n\nThis film was a poor attempt at a dark comedy. The jokes fell flat and some of the actors did not even appear to enjoy being in the film (watch Kidman, especially). The film also starts Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler as residents of the community. The ending is quite predictable and leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth.\n\nI'm giving this film a 4/10 just because I have seen much worse in recent months (i.e. In the Cut, Center Stage, 3/4ths of Dirty Dancing, etc. )"

To be fair, I laughed a few times, and this movie was not nearly as bad as my measuring stick for all-time worst movie, 2003's The Medallion. However, there are oh so many things wrong with this movie.\n\nI have not yet seen the original, but I have heard much about it and it appears that it was a thriller/horror flick. That sounds like the way to go with this material. Oz's version leans heavily in the direction of camp, and the one-liners start to pile up like driftwood.\n\nThe characters react in totally illogical ways; no one seems to be at all fazed or even mildly surprised about the sinister goings-on in Stepford. Furthermore, there is absolutely NO chemistry between Kidman and Broderick on-screen. The few scenes that do attempt to convey emotion are static and stale and incredibly awkward. It seems to me that a trained chimp could have done Broderick's job in this film, which seemed to consist of complaining half-heartedly and looking slightly confused. And don't even get me started on Christopher Walken. The man has played some incredible roles and he is as intense an actor as you will ever find, but in this film it seemed as though he were playing a bad parody of one of his Saturday Night Live roles.\n\nAs if this already weren't enough, we are treated to a jangly edit, where it seems that everything is rushed along just a bit too quickly, and it looks as though vital scenes were just clipped right out of the movie. A solid, slow development of characters and mood is trashed in favor of more unfunny one-liners. Furthermore, Oz changes direction on us mid-movie and attempts to create a creepy sci-fi thriller vibe, but it falls flat after all that camp shoved down our throats in the first 50 minutes.\n\nAs a testament to how bad this movie sucked, the best aspect of the whole film was the outrageously stereotypical flamboyantly gay Stepford 'wife.' He was the only funny thing in the entire movie. That is just plain sad."

Nicole Kidman was great and Bette Midler was the star of the film. 8 out of 10. I really doubt this film will even come close to it's 90 million dollar budget but it was an interesting film."

You can make a film critical of past social mores, but you can't present it as an edgy contemporary satire. It's an \"answer film\" that's 50 years too late. Imagine if Ted Post had answered John Wayne's 'The Green Berets' with 'Go Tell the Spartans', only in 1997. Maybe the producers can follow up 'The Stepford Wives' with a withering satire of class-snobbery in Victorian England or the hypocrisy of New Left hippies in 1960's America. Because these films would be PRECISELY as relevant and edgy as 'The Stepford Wives'.\n\nIf you want to see a film that is a great satirical comedy *and* has something to say about gender & feminism in contemporary society, watch 'Fight Club'.

        "review_detailed_main": "Frank Oz's remake of The Stepford Wives is a convoluted, misguided film, one that has a great idea but can't separate itself from it even at arm's length to show the audience why the idea is so great. It's a film that was ostensibly built off of the love for a premise but burdened by an inability to communicate that premise's ideas and thematic relevance to the audience. As a result, we get a ninety-three minute affair with unlikable characters, lackluster jokes, and a film that seems to be completely robbed of its social commentary.\n\nWe focus on Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman), a lanky, corporate woman who runs a successful Television network; we open on her pitching a series of shameful, dehumanizing reality TV shows that involve married couples making the decision to either stay with their husband or leave them for the hunks or goddesses they've acquainted themselves with over a lavish retreat. When one of the cuckolded husbands takes a gun to Joanna in the middle of her pitch, she carelessly moves on to trying to pitch a show to her boss about forgiving the shooter and helping the newly destroyed couple's marriage situation. This opening scene is about as pointless as they come, telling us very little about Joanna other than there's no real reason to care about her or sympathize with her.\n\nWhen Joanna's controversial pitches result in her getting fired, Joanna's husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) suggests they move to the quiet haven of Stepford, Connecticut. Stepford is a plastic village, filled with mansions, perfectly trimmed shrubbery, and the appearance of perfection so pristine that any gated community would be jealous. Upon moving there, Joanna spots a cloying and disturbing \"perfectness\" to the females of Stepford, who operate with a coldness but immaculate precision (one of these females is Faith Hill, who, sadly, has no character and no real significance here). She quickly befriends the sassy Bobbie (Bette Midler) and the effeminate Roger (Roger Bart) in efforts to see through the women of Stepford, especially the maniacal Claire (Glenn Close), who runs the community and maintains its level of obsessive perfectness.\n\nThe Stepford Wives' immediately problem is it simply doesn't know what the hell it wants to say about men and women in society, gender roles, the male perception of females, vice-versa, or really anything. It simply exists to show a gaggle of unlikable, affluent characters complain at one another (the repetitive arguments between Joanna and Walter wore me down almost as quickly as the entire film itself), and without the presence or significance of social commentary, this film quickly becomes little else than an empty candy wrapper.\n\nThe original Stepford Wives novel, written by Ira Levin, concerned the impact submissive, obeying housewives had on a community and really peeled back layers of gender relations to show how men really like their women in society with science-fiction twists. The film adaptation, directed by Levin as well, drifted from the science-fiction genre into the horror genre, another passable approach to the story, which led to its cult status amongst horror fans. Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick's attempt to bring comedy into the mix, however, feels like a cheap ploy being that the film doesn't have any of its satirical elements in place nor anything meaningful to say about the relationship between men and women in society.\n\nThe cast here is also wasted, as Kidman's incredibly serious demeanor - which throws off any kind of likability for her character - becomes grating when you realize it's as if she was put in this film only to argue with everyone around her. Broderick is given a thoroughly lame character, as are most of the male actors here because they're not only robbed of personality but they're given the depressingly shallow male roles which perceive women as nothing more than nagging shrews. Finally, as stated, Faith Hill is criminally shortchanged here, as so much time is given to Glenn Close and Kidman it's a wonder why the casting department went through the trouble and the added expense to get a talented personality they weren't going to utilize.\n\nFrank Oz's The Stepford Wives is a curious comedic failure, robbed of almost any and all wit with its commendable, picture-perfect set design being its only commendable asset. The supermarket settings are meticulously rendered to give the impression that not a carton of eggs is uneven or a gallon of milk is crooked. If only the film's screen writing had the same kind of explicit order and gave the appearance of something that was checked multiple times before it was allowed to pass.\n\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Roger Bart, Glenn Close, Christopher Walkin, and Faith Hill. Directed by: Frank Oz."

They sold it out. I get that they made it into a comedy which is fine. The first half was very funny. But when it decided to become a \"thriller\" it fell apart. The tried to make you care when they whole time they've created this Willy Wonka world that is so unreal that you could never take it seriously.\n\nThen there's the ending. I don't know that I love the ending of the original but at least it's more real than the train wreck of an ending they up on on the end of this. It is neither real nor funny.\n\nAs Nicole Kidman doesn't even hold a candle to Katherine Ross in terms of sympathy in the role of Joanna."

Why do some people take everything so seriously? I wasn't laughing from start to finish, but there were enough chuckles to make it OK. There were certainly more laughs here than in the much acclaimed \"Sideways\". Stop over-analyzing and laugh at the jokes. See a movie to have a good time.

There may be some sort of explanation that I didn't see because I was watching it at one in the morning. The book that this movie is based on was a social criticism but this movie was not realistic enough and wasn't at all close to the way our society is. If it was made to be more of a comedy than it was very poorly done because none of the people in the theater laughed through the movie. The movie just wasn't interesting either. Most people left the movie halfway through to see THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. If you still want to watch this movie, then go watch the commercial for it and sneak into the last ten minutes."

I mean if you can have a gay couple, you can't have an African American couple and Hispanic couple in Stepford. This is 2004. As for the remake, this movie is a comedy. The first movie version at least had the effort to make it a thriller. I love Roger Bart as the gay husband/wife but it's redundant for him. After all, when he's cast as straight like George Williams on Desperate HOusewives, he becomes a homicidal maniac obsessed with Bree. Nicole Kidman is good in the role that Katharine Ross made famous. Bette Midler is always welcome although not on film sets because of her difficult behavior. I love the casting of JOn Lovitz as her husband, John Malkovich and Glenn Close as the all too perfect Stepford couple. The movie is entertaining but it's 30 years later, times have changed. I guess the message is that it's changed for gays but not for African Americans or Hispanics in this country."

Ask the Stepford husbands, who've created this high-tech terrifying little town, in a very modern comedy-thriller.\n\nThis film is notorious for the numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule. The tension started when both John and Joan Cusack, originally slated to star in supporting roles, pulled out of the project and were replaced by Matthew Broderick and Bette Midler, respectively. After filming was initially completed, several changes were made to the new script, which created a number of plot holes, and the cast was called back for reshoots. Nicole Kidman was reportedly so dissatisfied with the new screenplay that she considered pulling out of the project.\n\nAnd, indeed, it just has no punch. The original film, like it or not, is a cultural touchstone and really served a purpose. The remake seems to have no purpose, and although it has a few good qualities -- the attempt to make it a comedy rather than a social horror tale -- it just seems flat. Amazingly, despite overwhelmingly bad reviews, it was praised by Roger Ebert. Maybe he saw a different film.\n\nThe potential was there, but something went horribly wrong. This is a film that could possibly be considered \"so bad it's good\", but even that might be giving it too much credit because it is not nearly that much fun."

The cast alone was enough to send shivers down my spine. Such campy ensembles have been devoid from cinema for awhile since Mars Attacks. Having not seen the original, my knowledge of the film was limited to the seductive teasers and trailers of the re-make and the word of mouth of others familiar with the original story. I was fortunate enough to view a preview screening this week and with the start of the opening credits and Danny Elfmanesque score (is nothing sacred?), I must say, I was engaged. On further noting Frank Oz and Paul Rudnick's collaboration, I was indeed expecting great things. To my chagrin, I was let down.\n\nWithout sounding pessimistic and spoiling, for all the \"hits\" this re-make succeeds, they do not compensate for the misses. Camp and fun are one thing but, the necessary flow and logic (in expositional arc, that is) were just too terribly vacant. It was fun though to see the great cast together in all of its kooky glory and Rudnick successfully created a subtext that echoed the dark themes of misogyny. His comment on gay marriage was also appreciated but seemed a little forced and out of place. I do feel, that this would have made a great musical! A Tim Burton take would also have been cool. Overall, however, one might forgive the creators for their folly and take heart in the heart of the film, however lukewarm."

Nicole Kidman hams it up with an over the top performance, Matthew Broderick seems bored, Glenn Close chews the scenery and the props and the rest of the large cast does a decent job. The whole last act feels tinkered with from being test screened to death, including a tacked on final scene meant to explain everything with Larry King. While not a disaster, this Stepford Wives remake is a mess of uneven tone and feels oddly sanitized considering the subversive material, which was gutted during the testing process. All of the plot points have a connect the dots feel since everything was reworked after production ended and added scenes are usually expository instead of letting the action dictate the plot. The end result is a great cast stuck inside a film where egos and production nightmares prevented everyone's best work and a behind the scenes documentary on this troubled production would be a hell of a lot more entertaining than the film."

Everybody notes the inconsistency between \u0091robots' and \u0091women with implants' concepts throughout the movie. So did I. That's, probably, the only annoying glitch that doesn't affect the overall impression - after all, the dubbing in the copy I saw was one key frame too fast, and it was much worse a trouble.\n\n2. I saw the very final scene coming (I'm not the only one, huh), and IMHO those should have been \u0091implanted' husbands there, not the househusbands-in-training.\n\n3. Bobby's plain terrific.\n\n4. Nicole's started showing her age. And it's good for her.\n\n5. Mr.Oz couldn't refrain from throwing in just a tiny bit of gay cliches, but at least they were up-to-date. Let's call it a cameo appearance of Mr.Bloom. And Mr.Mortensen, of course.\n\n6. Is it finally proven that all blondes are dumb? Or that all dumbs are blonde? Stereotypes, stereotypes. However, in my opinion one can afford them in a movie dominated by male inferiority (a nice change, for a change).\n\n7. The inferiority and superiority complexes can drive one whole small town crazy. I wish they had a chance to run Roger for President.\n\nHighly recommended. 8/10"

It was a great film, for me it would have been enough to watch it a little.\n\nSadly movie took a unusual turn and a step back in many regards. I didn't got the CD yet, but I think in my opinion it would be a good DVD for collection."

One minute it has Mathew Brodrick making hidden malice faces and the next moment they are cracking jokes about AOL. However, by not trying to follow the formula of a strict remake they came out from the shadow of the original and made a stand-alone movie on its own. The commentary track was just as good, if not better than the movie itself.\n\nThe actors themselves were quite good: Nicole Kidman of \"Natural Magic\" fame, as usual, can look so emotional.\n\nMathew Broderick looked like Farris Buller with a secret.\n\nBete Midler was just being herself(s).\n\nChristopher Walken adds that sinister touch. Nothing mechanical.\n\nFaith Hill adds a real spark to the movie.\n\nGlen Close can keep a straight face.\n\nJoanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has it all and puts her whole life into her career. Through a series of miss events when she goes into what she expects would be a raise is let go. The trauma sends her over the deep end. Her husband quits working for the same network to care for her. He only wants the BEST. So they moved to the quainter environment of Stepford. There, men can be men and women can be women. Joanna being her cantankerous self has trouble adjusting to life and the people around her that only wanted to help. Her husband threatens to leave her if she does not change her ways. So, she does and solicits the help of two other disgruntled friends.\n\nWill she change?\n\nIf not what can be done?\n\nWhy is the mechanical dog asking for help?"

Highly recommend for a girls night in.\n\nIt's one of my favourite movies to sit and watch with my mom. Don't believe the old bad reviews, it's a must see at least once. I made an imdb account just to leave a review for this movie, it's underrated. The mindset of the older generation must've been different 20 years ago. Now I'll watch it for a 4th time \ud83d\ude0a"

Nicole Kidman is brilliant, and from her first appearance in the movie, you know it's not one of her regular parts. Matthew Broderick is a very good surprise, I didn't know he could be so good.\n\nBette Miller may not have a very big part, but she's hilarious. And Glenn Close is perfect. As for Christopher Walken, well let's just say that he proves once more that he can play anything. Now I know some didn't like the movie and will always find something to say about it but speaking for myself and the two friends who came to see it with me (and the whole theater as a matter of fact), we couldn't stop laughing. Sure, like I said, the preview may look like it's telling too much, but only a tenth of the movie is actually shown in it. That film is full of surprises and laughs. So my advice is: don't read the critics, just see it, you may just be surprised how much you loved it. The not-so-silent Bob"

As a comedy, it WORKED! I could not stop laughing throughout the 90 minutes and all the jokes were really creative and original. THe cast seemed like they were having so much fun with the movie, and that fun definitely came out of the screen and affected the audience. I probably missed 25% of the funny lines because people were laughing so hard you can barely hear the dialogue. The pacing was good, without a slow moment, as well as the acting. Can't say much about the directing, as it seemed to be a relatively simple movie to make.\n\nI gave it a 9 out of 10, and am planning on seeing it again when it hits the theaters this Friday!"

Rather than try to capture the expectations of the original film, this remake looks at the already-familiar story in a whole new light as a dark comedy. Even more effective is the fact that this is a truly funny and well-written dark comedy! The direction is lavishly good, the film has some wonderful sets, a great music score, and a very stylish credit sequence.\n\nThe great cast is yet another highlight. Lovely Nicole Kidman does an excellent performance as usual. While supporting cast Broderick, Midler, Close, Walken, and Bart make for some nicely colorful characters.\n\nJust why so many people dislike this film I don't know, but it's a remake that is worth being viewed before being judged.

        "review_detailed_main": "The opening credits remind you of a 1950s TV commercial for Aerowax and Amana refrigerators. In the opening scene Nicole Kidman perfectly portrays the totally phony baloney, plastic banana, good time rock 'n roller that television executives really are. Proving that comedy must have an element of truth to be funny, the new network shows she previews for the network affiliates are probably only a season or two away from being on the air. After that, it's slow for a bit but starts to pick up when Bette Midler appears. As in every movie she's in, Bette steals the show. Matthew Broderick plays his usual genre--baby faced Mr. Nice Guy. He keeps playing that same role so often one wonders if he really can act. Glenn Close is superb--a cross between Donna Reed and June Cleaver, squared and taken to the Pth degree. When the plot takes a twist at the end she plays it magnificently. If you rent the DVD version be sure to watch the outtake scene in Bette Midler's kitchen. This is the funniest movies I have seen since \"The First Wives Club\". Why it is characterized as \"Drama\" or \"Thriller\" defies logic--it's a farce, pure and simple."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some critics disparage this film as a flimsy remake of the 1975 original but: Though the premise is the same, the Frank Oz movie is a comedy from start until the credits roll. I don't think of Nicole Kidman as a comedienne (nor is she much of an actress) but she handles this part very well. She exaggerates appropriately as the TV exec fired because of a \"reality\" project based on sex that threatens to ruin her network and subsequently as the post-nervous breakdown wife moved to Stepford to recover from the wreckage of life as a superstar. Moreover, while I doubt many people will agree with me, Kidman is far more attractive as a brunette than as a blonde. She reverts to her usual blonde self only at the end of the film when she's presented as a blonde robot. I wonder if she understood the irony. In short, Kidman is okay, though the comedy is supplied mostly by Matthew Broderick as her husband and by Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken (parodying his usual persona more or less) and Roger Bart and David Marshall Grant as a gay couple also newly arrived in Stepford. If seen without preconceptions based on the earlier movie, the new edition of Stepford Wives can be quite entertaining. I give it an 8."

Of course, could be because I found the first film quite boring with all the preaching - also I think K. Ross is a very bad actress (awfully Sixties). Although the book was great, like all Ira Levin's work.\n\nThis was just a \"light-hearted romp\", sending up every clich\u00e9 in the book - the TV executive, the big houses in the country, the happy families of what looked like very over-weight children, the rampant consumerism. To a European, this is in fact what Connecticut looks like (only in parts of course!). Having just come back to a visit to Sharon Connecticut, I could empathize with the inhabitants of Stepford.\n\nGreat cast - Glenn Close as usual looking more intelligent than anyone for miles around, Nicole Kidman showing a wonderful sense of fun (specially as the last time I saw her she was drooping around the place as Virginia Woolfe).\n\nThe transformation was particularly good - much less ghoulish than in the first version - in keeping with the generally light tone.

Matthew Broderick played fair, his character was not believable at first, but he turned out to be okay in the end. Moreover,I think this movie not only entertains but also provide life's lessons: one is that life indeed is not perfect, inevitable things really happen to us because God wants us to learn the hard way and become stronger the next time, and second, you have to love not BECAUSE OF but INSPITE OF.The only flaw for me is that the movie itself is quite fast paced. The scenes are very fast up to the end. You'll be surprised that the movie is already finish."

They really brought life to this movie. Now the disclaimer. I gave it 8 stars because it was alittle weak on story but overall I thought it was very enjoyable so I guess I'm in the minority."

It wasn't heavy duty, sure, but many movies are not.\n\nThe script isn't brilliant, but Frank Oz shines as director as do the star studded cast- Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken and especially Glen Close... I won't spoil the ending for you but she is simply fantastic in her role. The cast make the not-so-brilliant script really, really good.\n\nMatthew Broderick stumbles through this film, as he does in any movie he's in. I never expect much from him and was not surprised by his performance in this movie. Faith Hill doesn't have more then 4 lines in this movie, but she is pretty believable in her role.\n\nIn short, good movie... don't go looking for some great masterpiece, some great thinker that leaves you shaken and stirred and you will be entertained."
