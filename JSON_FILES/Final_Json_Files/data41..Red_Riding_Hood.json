        "review_detailed_main": "Just returned from a nearly sold out theater and I must say the film was somewhere between decent and good!\n\nI've read quite a few reviews here and was truly surprised about the supremely negative feedback. \"The Grimm brothers would roll in their graves,\" someone wrote. My response to that is: \"Really, would they now?\" I believe a bit of research on the subject would do some quite a bit of good. The brothers Grimm -which weren't the original story tellers of 'Rotkaeppchen' as they called it- told folktales, not fairy tales\u0085they were the very first tabloid writers and although their stories all had a grain of truth at the very core, the brothers wrote them to feed into peoples believes, superstitions and prejudice in central Europe in the 1800\u0085their tales were often capricious and usually cruel, showing very little moral. It took generations of translations and retelling to soften the originals enough to be considered bedtime stories because the originals would have provoked nightmares in grown man at their time. Does anyone know what the significance is of the name Peter and why he wears black throughout the entire film?? I'd love to read your ideas about that. The film is a nice translation\u0085yet another one. And by far closer based on the Grimm brothers vision than the stories we all were told as kids. I did see a bit of parallel to Twilight but only because both, this film and all the Twilight movies were filmed in Vancouver and surely used the same scenery. The Storyline is based on the folktale and (in my opinion) it has been done rather well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Has it become increasingly difficult to write an ending? Have writers suddenly forgotten that the climax is the high point of a story? Or is Hollywood getting lazy? Red Riding Hood is probably the most frustrating and unsatisfying movie I've been to, and the above reason is just one of many. While it certainly isn't bad, I haven't finished feeling so let down since Haneke's \"The White Ribbon\".\n\nOf course, Hardwicke is a director who is willing take big risks. She did so with Twilight, which was a huge smash with teens everywhere. And she does have a good eye for a shot, and several scenes here show. If had to recommend the movie for one thing alone, it would be for the visuals. The look of the film has a gorgeous, lush and colourful palette that made this film worth seeing on the big screen.\n\nThe film's biggest problem aside from being anti-climatic is that the plot is just... a mangled mess. It reads like a really bad fanfiction. If you thought Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was bad... .wait till you get a load of this movie. We have several plot points that come in and suddenly are left do die, one of which includes Father Solomon played by Gary Oldman, who is made to be a crazy bastard type character, and we don't see anything to prove it. To top it all off, it's rife with clich\u00e9s, like the obligatory love triangle, the whodunit, damned protagonist.\n\nThe actors are a mixed bag. Seyfried does a good job here and has plenty of emotion in her performance. She has plenty of cheesy lines but she does a good job for what she has to work with. Gary Oldman was also great, but that was expected as he always shines with every performance. On the downside, Shiloh Fernandez gives one of the worst performances ever here. He spends the whole movie looking like he wants to punch someone and reads his lines like he's reading them off a paper. And Virginia Madsen just awful here as well, and is over-acting Billy Burke In short Red Riding Hood is a film that has plenty of promise, but sadly doesn't live up to it. It isn't a bad film by any means, but you are most likely to leave disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see this movie. I am not a fan of the Twilight movies(the first of which Catherine Hardwicke also directed) and it didn't look like my kind of film. But I saw it for the wonderful Gary Oldman.\n\nI wasn't expecting much, and I didn't get much. Red Riding Hood(not the fairytale by the way) does try hard to be a lot of things, including introducing a number of horror, fantasy and mystery elements. But due to the sluggish pace and disjointed story structure(that is full of overlong filler, particularly the celebration scene, and the dream sequence was very awkwardly placed) the film fails at pretty much all these elements.\n\nThe script is very clunky, underdeveloped and banal as well. A lot of it did not keep my attention and I found myself chuckling into my coke at any unintentionally funny bits. The CGI is quite poor here, with the wolf looking as though it was done in a hurry. Hardwicke's direction never rises above mediocre, the editing is unfocused and frenzied and the three titular characters are incredibly dull and uninteresting with the romantic elements between them poorly written and directed.\n\nThe acting doesn't fare much better. Amanda Seyfried is pretty but bland in the title role and shows little or no chemistry with her co-stars, while Max Irons(son of Jeremy), Lukas Haas and Shiloh Fernandez show good looks but awkward line delivery. Virginia Madsen and Billy Burke are both wasted, both over-doing it in a valiant attempt to elevate their weak material(these two actors probably had the worst of the dialogue next to the leads actually). And the climax is little more than a mangled mess and devoid of depth.\n\nDespite these many cons, there are some decent assets. The score is atmospheric enough and the costume and set design are spot on. Plus there are two good performances, Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. Oldman does chew the scenery, but he looks as though he's having a ball, while Christie is very enchanting.\n\nOverall, not terrible, but deeply flawed and over-ambitious. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "You'd be hard pressed to find a better example of a film ruined by trying to be too many things to too many people than Red Riding Hood, which opens Friday and, by all rights, should close Saturday.\n\nThe most obvious audience Hood hopes to attract is fans of the Twilight film series, snagging the director of the first film, Catherine Hardwicke, and refashioning the Little Red Riding Hood folk tale into, in a remarkably halfhearted way, a love triangle between three extraordinarily uninteresting characters. (If all three had been eaten by the wolf in the first act, we might have been onto something.)\n\nWhat's weird about Hood, which inexplicably counts Leonardo DiCaprio as one of its producers (stick to swimming in icy water, Leo), is that this romantic angle is not its main thrust. It doesn't have a main thrust.\n\nIn fact, for a supposedly sexier take on a classic folk tale, it's in desperate need of thrust in general.\n\nIt flits around the idea of being a more adult folk tale but never commits. It throws in a bit of (pretty bad) CGI werewolf attack action from time to time, but it's nowhere near violent or bloody enough (it's PG-13) to interest action or horror fans. It has moments of campy fun, specifically every second Gary Oldman appears as a sinister Cardinal Richelieu-type character, but other scenes are played ridiculously straight.\n\nPerhaps the film's biggest mistake \u2014 and that's saying something \u2014 is structuring itself like a Scream film. The Big Bad Wolf is indeed a werewolf, and our sweet little Red (named Valerie, played by Amanda Seyfried) has to figure out which of her fellow villagers turns into a beast when the moon is full. Is it her forbidden love, the dull as dishwater Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), who presumably equates to the hunter of the folk tale? Or is it the man she's been arranged to marry, the somehow even duller Henry (Max Irons)? Or is it one the other remarkably dull villagers? And given how dull Valerie is, who the hell really cares?\n\nOn looks alone, Seyfried perhaps is perfectly cast as Red, considering Christina Ricci might be a bit too old for the role. Seyfried's pristine, alabaster skin and enormous eyes give Red just the right look, but every time she opens her mouth you're begging for that werewolf to put her out of our misery.\n\nTo be fair, no actor could be expected to excel given the cheesy dialogue and Hardwicke's uninspired direction; solid veterans such as Virginia Madsen, Julie Christie and Lukas Haas struggle to make an impression, with Christie holding up the best. As Red's father, Billy Burke seems more zoned out than James Franco at the Oscars, suggesting he's only here for one more Twilight connection.\n\nOnly Oldman acquits himself well, simply because he treats the film as the campfest it should have been from the opening credits. He's acting in an entirely different movie, a Sam Raimi romp like Army of Darkness or Drag Me to Hell, and Red Riding Hood briefly becomes almost fun during Oldman's most animated scenes.\n\nThe film doesn't even look that great in a technical sense: The exteriors look fake, all clearly shot on soundstages, and not fake in an intentional \"this is a dreamy heightened reality, because this is a folk tale\" way. They look fake in a \"we really suck at our jobs\" way.\n\nRed Riding Hood is pretending to be a darker, more adult take on the folk tale, but it's hardly the first: Neil Jordan mined the territory in 1984 with the R-rated The Company of Wolves, focusing more on sexual metaphors and heavy werewolf action. It wasn't great, but at least it knew what it wanted to be. Red Riding Hood tries to be a little bit of everything, but ultimately it succeeds only in being a tedious mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "This certainly isn't the best werewolf movie you're ever going to come across (not by a longshot) but I thought it was better than you'd imagine from some of the responses the movie is getting. It's very loosely based on the old folktale of Little Red Riding Hood (which, by the way, goes back far into European history long before the now famous version by the Brothers Grimm; the first print edition of the tale dating to the late 17th century) and it also has one scene (really just one line) that for some reason chooses to pay homage to the story of The Three Little Pigs (\"I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down\" cries out one young man as others fall down around him.) Although you can't avoid those connections (and are probably intended to make the connection) it's probably best that you try not to, and watch the story in its own right.\n\nIt's the story of a small village that has arranged a truce of sorts with a local werewolf. Every full moon, they put out livestock for the beast to devour and in return the beast leaves the people alone. For some reason, though, the beast breaks the pact and people begin to die. The mystery revolves around the identity of the werewolf, once a werewolf-hunting priest (Gary Oldman) shows up in town and warns the people that the werewolf is one of them. The question becomes \"who is it?\" and the mystery is pretty decent. There are any number of reasons to suspect any number of people of being the beast, and the ultimate revelation of the werewolf's identity surprised me a bit - it was not my first choice.\n\nI thought director Catherine Hardwicke made pretty good use of the setting of a small, isolated town deep in the mountains, and Amanda Seyfried was excellent in the role of Valerie (the Red Riding Hood character.) The movie also provides a pretty good depiction of paranoia and the ultimate consequences that paranoia can have, even (and perhaps especially) on people who know each other as well as the residents of this town obviously did.\n\nThis isn't really (in my opinion at least) a horror movie. It's more of a mystery, and as a mystery I thought it worked pretty well. I certainly think it deserves to be rated more highly than it is. (7/10)"

Its latest victim is Valerie's sister. So to solve the mystery of who the werewolf is, as well as to kill the creature, they seek the help of a religious priest (Played by Gary Oldman), a man experienced in the killing of a wolf. One night, the wolf attacks, but Valerie discovers that... she can talk... to the... wolf...\n\nzzzz...\n\nzzzz...\n\nWhat? Oh, sorry. I guess I'm as bored summarizing the plot of the movie as I was watching the actual movie.\n\nFirst of all, Amanda Seyfried makes an attractive fit for the role of Valerie, and the production design of the film is interesting, but that's as close to complimentary as I'm going with this movie.\n\nDirector Catherine Hardwicke really has trouble keeping an even sense of rhythm, and the cast is a serious disappointment. Gary Oldman hams up the scene, while Julie Christie is sadly exploited for her willingness to stand around and do nothing. The leading men of Valerie have the personalities of water and sandpaper, while Billy Burke and Virginia Madsen can't make anything out of their roles. They do bad jobs, but it isn't all their fault. I know I'D have trouble trying to do a half decent job with this kind of writing.\n\nThe screenplay is awful beyond comprehension. Full of contrivances, unbearable dialogue, and a needless sense of piling on characters, and twists and turns until the final product is a total WTF of lame explanations. I wouldn't be surprised if someone fell asleep watching the movie, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they woke right up. The movie, with it's musical thumps and white noise, is near as loud as a rock concert... and I never could understand why they felt the need to play alt. rock music during a period piece.\n\nIn short: One or two bright spots - bland acting + ridiculous screenplay + off pacing = Terrible.\n\nRed Riding Hood = * out of ****"

The dialogue was so incredibly cheesy that at several points throughout the movie, groans were heard throughout the audience. Visually, the film is beautiful but the plot is choppy, the romance scenes are cringe worthy, everything about this film was just painful. Shiloh whatever his name is has a constant sneer/smirk on his face that makes his character so annoying. And the other love interest was just plain dull. Seyfried is a perfect Red Riding Hood but she brings nothing to the film other than her constantly doe eyed, surprised expression.\n\nDo not waste your money on this crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "The plot of Catherine Hardwicke's \"Red Riding Hood\" revolves around a series of massacres and a pressing question. The said massacres being caused by a werewolf and the said question being who the wolf is. But as I watched it, the question that kept on running through my mind was not who the wolf was, but rather who cares who the wolf was? This is a very flabby-footed, self-delusional mess of a movie that succeeds in making even the great Gary Oldman look as unnatural in his performance as Steven Seagal.\n\n\"Red Riding Hood\" suffers from a poorly-constructed screenplay, one that seems was written within a handful of days and not given a single second of revision. The writer, David Johnson, was a production assistant on Frank Darabont's masterpiece \"The Shawshank Redemption\" but his talents seem to be more focused on polishing up a movie rather than spinning up a story. The plot of \"Red Riding Hood\" is contrived, flat, and lacking any zest. In fact, even though the denouement has great potential to be a real shocker and (I'll be honest) caught me by surprise, it was handled and executed so sloppily and the writing that summarizes it all up was so flimsy and manipulative, that it registered no impact on me whatsoever.\n\nThere are no characters worth caring about and next to nothing in terms of acting. The titular character is played by an up-and-coming starlet by the name of Amanda Seyfried, although if all of her performances are as uncharismatic and dull as this one, I cannot imagine why. In this performance, at least, she did not strike me as being a natural actress. Then again, she has nothing to work with in Mr. Johnson's screenplay. She also has two romantic interests, one played by Max Irons and the other by a wooden-faced Shiloh Fernandez. They are just as boring as their characters. They have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever with Miss Seyfried; I never felt any passion. Even Gary Oldman, so good so many times before, is awful here, hamming up and chewing apart every scene that he is in. His introductory moment, where he explains his experiences with werewolves, is handled by him in a way that is so over-the-top, almost like a really bad vaudeville performance. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor from \"The Dark Knight,\" \"The Book of Eli,\" and the Harry Potter movies.\n\nIf there is one good performance at all it is by Julie Christie, who is just as magnetic and wonderful as she was when she graced the screen in David Lean's \"Doctor Zhivago\" forty-six years ago. She has a powerful star presence and quality that allows her to overcome even the trashy dialogue and nothingness that she was supplied.\n\nAnother strike against the movie is the apparent lack of experience by its director, Catherine Hardwicke. She was a production designer before this movie (she designed the wonderful town reconstruction for \"Tombstone\" in 1993) but her skills with a motion picture camera are next to nothing. She doesn't seem to even know the basics about misc en scene and how to structure a sequence. Not even enough to know that a moment where Mr. Oldman gives a last minute warning to a stubborn old villager about the impending threat of the werewolf that she should have had a reverse angle to show the villager's reaction; instead she chooses to stick to the back of his head. There is no steady flow of images here, with too many medium and long shots and close-ups so claustrophobic that they enter the territory of being loony. One scene that was directed particularly badly was a laughable love moment between Miss Seyfriend and Mr. Fernandez. There is a problem with a romantic moment where the sight of two people making love is neither heart-warming, nor, obviously, erotic.\n\nBut Miss Hardwicke did coordinate well with her production designer, for the sets are quite good. And the special effects are decent enough in and of themselves. The werewolf, computer-generated of course, are much better than the cartoony wolves I saw in \"Season of the Witch\" earlier this year. It's only a shame that that wolf was not on-screen more.\n\n\"Red Riding Hood\" has a feel of so many medieval melodramas of recent years: half-hearted and flimsy. It is also crippled by that haunting feeling that even the people who made the movie would not even want to see it. It feels like an assignment done by people hopelessly unhappy in their work, who just wanted to get through the dailies so they could go home and relax before getting up to do the same thing again the next day."

Further on mister Dracula (for the new generation) Gary Oldman was in it too and I like him too as an actor. But I can understand that people will hate Red Riding Hood. It's in the kind of Van Helsing and Wolf Man (the new one with Anthony Hopkins and Benicio Del Toro). in which I mean the use of CGI of the main creatures. Here we have the story of a normal girl falling in love with, well, you will see. Of course I couldn't watch it without comparing it with Twilight. Much better this is, there is some kind of atmosphere all over it done with color grading. There is a lot of CGI used for making the woods creepy but it worked out fine. It really looked like a fairy tale. And the most famous words of the fairy tale are in it, you know, grandma what big....It can be watched by teens because no gore or almost no blood is seen in this flick.

However, it is not as good as it could have been. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy some of the film. Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fernandez, Max Irons and the excellent Gary Oldman acted brilliantly in the film, and the effects for the Werewolf were pretty fantastic as well. However, the rest of the cast let this film down and although it is classed as a \"horror\" movie, there is only really one jump-worthy moment. I don't want to give away the secret of the wolf, but if you listen closely, you can easily tell who it is...\n\nThere is a bit of gore, but if you are into some of the supernatural stuff (especially Twilight, even though I'm not a fan), you should give it a shot and might like this... but horror-lovers, keep well away, you might end up feeling a bit ripped-off..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Riding Hood is like a mix of Twilight and Gary Oldman villainy. There's a young adult naive romance to it and then it takes a turn into 1600s-1700s psychosis and witch paranoia, blood and torture. And then it goes back again.\n\nIt's a fascinating mix of genres that honestly I did enjoy. There's potential in the film and I wish that it did just have that extra finesse to make it more of a timeless film. The attempt to twist the little red riding hood tale into something different was commendable, but sometimes veered too far into teen fiction territory.\n\nPart of the reason for my low rating is that the final unveiling of who the wolf is didn't quite ring true as the clues didn't line up in a satisfactory way. And also some of the actions the wolf did which were uncovered at the end seemed unnecessary.\n\nProps to Gary Oldman for his scenes and being a hateful fear mongerer.\n\nBonus trivia one of the actors from Twilight is actually in the film, Charlie, Bella's dad from the story."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is a steaming pile of cinematic poop. It's dreadful in every single way. There's not one nice thing I can muster to say about it. It makes the Twilight series, which it so blatantly and unashamedly mimics, look positively brilliant. I can understand the logic from Warner Bros; in a time where Edward Cullen and Bella Swan rule the roost, why wouldn't you want to get in for your share of the pie. I'm sure it will reap the rewards at the box office thanks to the universal lack of taste teenage girls have in picking fads. That doesn't stop it being the worst movie of recent years.\n\nIt all begins with the downright hilarious dialogue. In a film rife with atrocities, this stands tall as the most dreadful of the lot. I almost feel sympathy towards the actors as no-one, and I mean no-one, could make some of those clunkers work. Trite clich\u00e9s such as \"I don't want you to see me like this\" (complete with sooky head turn) and \"I'll do anything to be with you\" (barf) rear their ugly head throughout. Even the attempted humour, mainly from Julie Christie's Grandmother, falls flat thanks to some lamely scripted jokes. Hardwicke does what she can to emulate her Twilight success, but her regurgitating attempts at hitting gold twice is boring, lazy and worthy of the regret she'll feel at the end of her career looking back.\n\nYoungsters Seyfried, Fernandez and Irons can be forgiven for signing on as I'm sure they all had grand illusions of being the next Bella, Edward of Jacob. I can even give Burke and Haas a pass as they're not exactly thespians of a standard where they can be too fussy with their roles. What I can't figure out though, is what in the hell is Gary Oldman doing here? An actor who has produced so many memorable characters and starred in so many fantastic films, Hardwicke must've beaten a drunken Oldman in a game of poker to get him to appear in this garbage. Surely he didn't select this role whilst of a sane and sober mind. Hopefully for him his upcoming Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and The Dark Knight Rises wash away all memory of Red Riding.\n\nPathetic.\n\n1 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is very little to like in Catherine Hardwicke's latest offering. She does have a good casting concept, however, with Julie Christie, Virginia Madsen and Amanda Seyfried as three generations of the same family. There is a distinct resemblance among them. But this marvelous potential is pretty much wasted. Gary Oldman carries his weight well as Father Solomon, a priest with colorful trappings who comes to the village to destroy the werewolf who threatens it. Billy Burke is very interesting to look at as the title character's father but he too is given little to do. Seyfried and her romantic leads (Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons, who looks and sounds nothing like his famous father Jeremy) get to look pretty and add another notch to their youthful resumes. There is no suspense at all despite the formality of medieval villagers fearfully wondering who among them is a wolfman in disguise. It's all very similar to another bloated, boring, CGI-dependent medieval fantasy from the 90's: \"Dragonheart,\" which also featured Julie Christie in a matriarchal context, wearing flowing garments. The camera swoops down and jiggles through the cotton candy gingerbread house-style set to the accompaniment of the usual synthesized swooshes, inducing yawn after yawn, kind of like leafing through a perfumed issue of Vanity Fair while you're waiting to get your teeth cleaned. Movies are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from the overpriced candy bars sold in the lobbies of the soulless venues in which they are shown."

Some of the villagers have sought the assistance of one Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who is an expert in this field. Seems like the wolf is after Red Riding Hood (Amanda Seyfried) but she has a love, a protector named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). \"Under the blood moon, once bitten is a man cursed\". Before the werewolf kills or turns all the people of Daggerhorn into werewolves it's a mad dash to find and kill this beast. A little slow at first but a good movie. I mean were looking at a kid's tale, a priest, a village, and a childhood sweetheart. PG-13 1 hr. 40 min. The attention goes back and forth between the Red Riding Hood and the wolf, not to mention the heartthrob of Red. That's where it lost it for me. But still entertaining 3 \u00bd stars out of 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is an awesome film. Some reviewers have criticised the sets but I thought they were superb. The story of the film bears very little resemblance to the original fairy tale. Or perhaps I should say that in this version the original has been very considerably 'fleshed out'.\n\nIn some ways I feel the narrative of Red Riding Hood is very much a story for our time. At times I felt I was seeing parallels with things currently of concern - especially to western societies. I'm thinking in particular about such things as religious zealotry (in certain individuals) and paranoia (in the general population) concerning external and internal enemies. (As for instance in the current 'war on terror').\n\nThere are elements of several genres - not just those of fantasy or supernatural. There is a love story, but it is a psychologically complex one, and it is brilliantly intertwined with an over-arching tragedy of (to me) almost Shakespearian proportions.\n\nI'm not usually keen on films having supernatural or fantasy elements. In this film, however, the fantasy element (the werewolf) could arguably be considered as representing the embodiment of every individual's fear. In any case the depiction of this werewolf is far more 'real' than I believe the werewolves in the Twilight series of films to have been (though I've only seen one of those - which I can now barely recall).\n\nAmanda Seyfried is well cast in the lead role. All the other actors and actresses play their parts with appropriate conviction.\n\nIf you enjoy a suspenseful film (and are prepared to have your disbelief suspended for an hour and a half) I feel sure you will not be disappointed by this film. I thoroughly recommend this - even if you normally shun werewolf films."

That, along with the choice of soundtrack, proved to be a very captivating combination.\n\nConcerning the actors, especially the younger cast, beautiful as they might have been their acting was most lacking, with the exception of Amanda of course, who delivered the role of Valerie spot on. The senior cast did not disappoint as well, notably the performance of Gary Oldman.\n\nDialogue wise, I couldn't help but feel that it was dumbed down to appeal to a younger audience, enriching the lines would have gone a long way to improving the movie and even substituting for the incompetence of some cast members.\n\nThe story was acceptable considering we're talking about a fairy tale, personally I would have seen a few things done differently.\n\nTo sum up, despite all of the numerous cons my final impression of the movie was not bad at all, I actually liked it very much, probably due to the fact of being an avid fantasy fan.

The movie really wasn't that bad, but could have been so much more. I hope someone comes along and does this fairy tale justice and makes a great movie. The acting was below average and the special effects were blah considering effects can be really good these days. The ending was terrible. I did like the mystery of who the wolf was, just not in a fairy tale setting. I think if I had to do it over again I would have rented this on Bluray. The whole family went to see this so it was 4 tickets, the Bluray rental would have been easier on the pocketbook with this movie.

But somehow, director Catherine Hardwicke decided she was going to make the worst possible version imaginable.\n\nThis is, sadly, more like her \"Twilight\" film than anything else. A teenage girl (though Seyfried, like Kristen Stewart, is actually years old) who is attracted to a pale guy with terrible hair... and we throw a werewolf in there... and heck, why not add Billy Burke as the girl's father? Very disappointing. The color scheme, the thin plot, everything points to this being a pre-teen romance film and not horror, and that is just unforgivable.\n\nWhy Gary Oldman agreed to this film is beyond me.

I don't know that werewolf stories just work or that we're just programmed to expect it at this point.\n\nAs a big fan of Amanda Seyfried, I think she worked hard to carry this movie, but because it actually does a decent job of multi-threading a few stories she shares the weight with Billy Burke and the great Gary Oldman.\n\nThe writing actually does a fun thing: the A plot, the 3 act arc is a mystery trying to identify the werewolf, but the movie is sort of broken up into smaller chapters, almost like comic books, and we transition from the focus of one story line to the next: engagements, wolf hunting, werewolf hunting, witch hunting, romance, battle, resolution. This could have easily been at least 5 8-episode seasons and worked, but it's carefully balanced into a well paced single narrative.\n\nWhile I don't think it's a terribly deep mystery, I think it will appeal to mystery fans, and has plenty for all sorts of audiences."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Brothers Grimm are rolling in their grave laughing at how bad this movie is. I walked into this moving not entirely expecting much which got a few looks from the teenage and college girls in the theater that were within earshot. The younger crowd really wanted this movie to be a winner largely due to the vision from Catherine Hardwicke who is the director of the first \"Twilight\" movie. The studio even tinkered with the idea of bringing in some familiar actors from \"Twilight\" by including Billy Burke and Taylor Lautner, but decided not to include Lautner. Instead the eye candy for this movie is Amanda Seyfried (Valerie aka Red Riding Hood), Max Irons (Peter), and Shiloh Fernandez (Henry). Since the cast up to this point doesn't have much acting the studio tried to balance things with Virginia Madsen (Suzette aka the Mother) and Gary Oldman (Solomon aka the werewolf hunter).\n\nWith all of the effort to putting together a cast that would meet the masses; the movie fails on every level. Set in a small dark village that is haunted by a werewolf, Valerie is in love with Peter a lumberjack, but her family has given her hand to the village blacksmith Henry. The story is simple enough that Valerie and Peter plan to run away together, but the story gets turned on its head when the town calls on Solomon to hunt the wolf before the village is destroyed. Of course nobody is innocent and the methods used to flush out the wolf are insane including a Trojan Horse in the form of an Iron Elephant. Not to be outdone was the accusation of witchcraft where Valerie is put into an iron mask that looked like \"Alf\".\n\nGary Oldman and Virginia Madsen are complete opposites in this one where Virginia Madsen is shockingly under performing and Gary Oldman extremely over acts. Amanda Seyfried is like a deer in the headlights acting as stiff as a board during the \"emotional\" moments. The male eye candy wasn't much better.\n\nI certainly hope that they never attempt to make the Russian tale of Peter and the Wolf because that is pretty clear the direction the studio is trying to go with this movie in the end. Since I have to give this movie a rating, I guess that it is 1 Quack (moviequacks.blogspot.com), but to be honest it isn't even worth that much. It will no doubt receive nominations for the Razzies or the beavtrash awards."

Yet we have no time for those things as the wolf seems to be expanding his diet and a professional is called in for the dispatching of the misunderstood furry creature.\n\nSeems that our hooded heroine can communicate with the wolf which does not bode well for her future.\n\nWill she go quietly or be eaten herself. Could be we are in for a big surprise.\n\nThe movie was not brilliant but watchable. There was a wolf, a riding hood, and big teeth. There are a few scuffed and missing body parts as part of the story; however, no excessive gore. It is good to see that Julie Christie (age 70 at the time of filming) is keeping a hand in acting like the big-eyed grandmother."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really wonder these days when a movie like this which seems to have something going for it, end so badly. It's rare to find a movie with no dialogue these days, and by that I mean every single word that is spoken in this movie does nothing more then move the plot painfully along. Why all this topic most of the phrases given are old clich\u00e9's that apparently never get old, I could almost recite what the actors were going to say before they said it half the time.\n\nNow to be fair the premise for this is actually rather pleasant, it takes the Red Riding Hood story and kind of twists it around a bit. In this version the town Red Riding Hood (Valerie) lives in a village that has been cursed with a werewolf for two or three generations. For the last few years the town has been able to appease the beast by offering it livestock during the full moon. Then a young women is killed and then the town goes on the hunt.\n\nReading that paragraph it sounds that this should be a good entertaining movie, but it falls horribly short of that. Besides what I already said about the dialogue it actually gets worse then that, the acting by itself ranks up there. Let's put it this way when you're out acted by a computer generated wolf there is something wrong.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke started strong with her great teenage drama \"Thirteen\" and then steadily declined after that ending with her directing the first of the inane \"Twilight\" movies. I really wish when directors got bigger budgets they'd spend it on more then CGI or fancier sets.\n\nIf this is the type of movie that Hollywood thinks we should be subjected too, then they really have to take a few steps back and rethink who their target audience is and try to give us a movie that can either entertain, educate, or any other number of things. Sadly this movie does none of that and should be skipped."

Visually it was everything that people complained about Twilight lacking (because of budget). The story was way more action charged. The plot is focused on figuring out who is the wolf (werewolf aka whom is changing into the wolf). Very sexually aggressive but I felt it was geared in a appealing way towards men more than women. I also felt it lacked that romantic factor in the story.\n\nI thought the real breakout in this film was 3rd counterpart (Max Irons) to the love triangle with Red Ridding Hood (Amanda Seyfried) and her childhood friend Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Max played the role of the individual that Red Ridding Hood's mother had arranged for her to marry. I got the impression that Shiloh was more focused on how his performance was being filmed not the chemistry he evoked with Amanda. His performance didn't feel very genuine. Max definitely gave a far more genuine performance whenever he had the opportunity to be on screen. In my opinion, the director missed out when she didn't use Max in the role of Peter.\n\nThe most solid performances were from Solomon (Gary Oldman) and the Grandmother (Julie Christie) but they are seasoned veterans and I wouldn't expect anything less from them on screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I saw the movie in the cinema I checked some critics (without spoilers) and the IMDb rating and I instantly got disappointed since I expected a very good movie from the title. However, after seeing the trailer, while watching another movie in the cinema, I realized what a good movie I probably was missing and then I decided to watch it by myself. To be honest it was the best thing I've done. This movie is very underrated and seriously I don't understand why people reacted with such negative critics.\n\nFirst of all the script and the plot seem very good, you can clearly see the little red ridding hood story in the movie, which surprised me a lot. This is very much like Titanic: you take the plot of a veridical/\"already-known\" story and then you add an original story that makes the movie not boring and predictable but instead very interesting. During the movie I didn't realize the time passing, you don't know who is behind everything until the end which is what makes the movie even better.\n\nThe directing isn't as bad as I thought, you clearly some shots very similar to twilight, after all is the same director, however, people tend to create some kind of clich\u00e9 about it that we can sum up as - twilight's director = bad movie - which is WRONG. Although there are some scenes I would alter, the movie have very good shots, the music and the environment make you fell some suspense like in a good thriller.\n\nFinally the acting isn't top notch but in my opinion isn't that bad as some people say. Amanda Seyfried does a great job as the main character, you understand very well the character and you can feel all her emotion. Gary Oldman is once again brilliant, he's an amazing actor that portrays very well father Solomon. Julie Christie is also very good as the grandmother, however, I can't say the same from other actors like Shiloh Fernandez. He seemed to be out of his character reading the script.\n\nSuming up I think the movie is pretty much good and much better than what average critics say. I definitely advise you to see the movie, don't get influenced by all the negative critics (and I speak by own experience). I also advise you to see it on the big screen since you can immerse in the dark atmosphere of the village and feel all the suspense that the wolf creates. It's truly worth seeing it!"

Not all that scary, Sponge Bob has startled me more. This is a suspenseful movie, not horror. The story is great and has a good plot. The whole time you are guessing and being told to be quit by the surrounding viewers because you are arguing with people about who the wolf is or what is going to happen. The actors did great for the most part, however the main character could have used a little more emotion. She did not act the way most would act during several situations. This overall is a good movie some little improvements and a better ending and it would be 10/10."

I saw it in the hopes of another Gothic \"Sleepy Hollow\"...and found an emo-marathon and dullness.

There's a werewolf and a lead named Peter who has feelings for Lil Red...so imagine someone had a great idea: Peter and The Wolf story meets Little Red Riding Hood, and together they defeat a big bad. Only instead of taking this into fun innuendo territory or at least having \"Snow White: A Tale of Terror\" quality to it, they just make it Twilight version 2.0."

Far from the innocent childhood story we heard as children, this patently dark movie is a superior cut above the norm. The reasons for it's success are manifest and begin with the superb cast which includes Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons. In additions are the stark locations, exceptional make-up, period costumes and serious dialog. The story-line holds well against the legendary script and the terrifying scenes which included slow burnings, maiming and medieval torture. This latest offering is not for the faint of heart. Indeed, one should be prepared for some black arts, mixed with brutal depiction of life in the middle-ages. If you've seen the romantic Twilight series, then this movie follows in like manner.

        "review_detailed_main": "Many people know that the most common children's' tales, especially those from the likes of the brothers Grimm, started out as scary, violent, and unpleasant, but have evolved over time, being toned down with each generation, until they are just a shadow of what they used to be, no teeth, no claws, just innocent & sugary sweet stories with little heart and too much nostalgia.\n\nConsidering this, you'd have thought writing a good script for any movie based on a fairytale would be a piece of cake. Just do a bit of historical research, find an old version of the tale, flesh it out, and hey presto! Great storyline!\n\nRed Riding Hood shows us how not to do it! For a start, they stripped the story down to the raw ingredients: (Pretty girl with a red cloak, a wolf, a grandmother, a forest), stuck in a whole load of other characters that serve little purpose to the storyline, added a love triangle and a baddie, then suddenly remembered that this was supposed to be a horror film, so they made the wolf into a WEREwolf.\n\nOK, so it's difficult to spin the tale out to a 100 minute long storyline, but it would have been more entertaining to have just seen Valerie walk in the woods for 80 minutes, and the remaining 20 minutes to be filled with the encounter etc. - All things considered, because the cinematography was absolutely beautiful, this would have been a vast improvement on this film!\n\nTrying to follow the story, the love triangles, the family trysts and deceptions, the \"Who desired who, and who has an unrequieted love for...\" was more akin to a really bad soap opera than a Gothic horror. This comparison is all the easier considering some of the trite lines and deadpan expressions from some of the actors.\n\nA few moments made this film more bearable for me. It was very stylishly shot, and Gary Oldman's presence made the movie slightly more entertaining, but not enough to rescue this movie.\n\nUnfortunately, it is one for the Twilight generation - a bunch of very pretty boy & girl actors who affect unfocused glassy-eyed expressions to try to convey 'Wisdom beyond their years', and a storyline that was borrowed from a Mills & Boon novella & forced into a mould that didn't quite fit."

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading so many negative reviews, I'm compelled to write something. I was looking forward to this movie and went to see it on opening night. The showing was nearly sold-out. Look at who is attached to this film - Catherine Harwick, Leonardo DiCaprio, Amanda Seyfried, Gary Oldman, Julie Christie. With suspended belief, the movie is enjoyable. Look, there are players from both the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. It's more of the same - dark fantasy perfect for teens. The acting is not bad. Seyfried is stunning, as is Oldman. I'd consider my taste in films to be refined, but I still managed to enjoy this. If you like beautiful wintry scenery and fairy tales, you will get something out of this. The plot is a bit flat, and yes, the characters have curiously American accents but it's not nearly as bad as many say it is. The set and costume design are gorgeous and make up for the inconsistencies. I got my $$s worth."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like some of the other reviewers I was attracted to this title because of the presence of Gary Oldman. My expectations for the film as a whole where low and shockingly this film even under delivered on them.\n\nFirstly, the acting was forced with only Julie Christie truly providing and intrigue to her character. The headliners for this movie a delivered their poorly written dialogue in a manner that left me asking myself, \"have people ever really spoken this way?\" The answer is of course a resounding no. Ultimately this film is supposed to have an element of fear and suspense to it and throughout it I continually thought to myself, I have zero interest whether all of these characters live or die.\n\nSecondly, the writing provided the atrocious dialogue to which I have already spoken, but also created a plot that jump around in thought so much that despite being a \"thriller\" created no suspense whatsoever.\n\nLastly, the editing. This film might have been passable had it been about 20 minutes shorter. The celebration scene dragged on for so long that being forced to wait on the tarmac seemed like a suitable alternative. There was no pace to this film at all and if a film is going to have poor acting, poor writing and poor direction, the least it can be is quick.\n\nIn my estimation, a great film is a good story, well told. This was neither."

        "review_detailed_main": "...It wasn't great either. But considering the original fairy tale is quite interesting itself, I would say this was a step downwards. When you try to add horror werewolf elements, and an obvious Twilight-ripoff into the mix of updating a fairy tale there really is only one way to go. The three leads were all extremely boring. Beautiful but boring. All the extras were good, and its sad to see fine actors like Virginia Madsen, Julie Christie, Michael Shanks and Gary Oldman taking a backseat to the three snooze-athons in the main love triangle. It did have an interesting atmosphere - all the medieval houses in the snowy mountain village were cool looking, I especially dug Grandma's house. The CGI werewolf was ridiculous. I didn't mind so much about the wolf speaking like a human, but it was just silly to see a fake cartoon looking wolf mixed into the live actors, and if it looks cheesy now, imagine how bad it will look in a couple years! Still, it kept my interest up until the (corny) ending so I give it 6 stars for the casting of nice extras, the cool looking village, and the couple of back-stabbing bitchy friends of the main character."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was literally the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and this is coming from someone who sat through 'The Love Guru'.\n\nLet's start with the ridiculous setting. You're led to believe this takes place somewhere in Norway with all the mountains and greenery and fjords you see in the opening, and yet, oddly enough, the entire cast - except for Gary Oldman, who at least attempts to revive his Count Dracula character - has an American accent. They don't even attempt the old standby of faking an English accent. And last I checked, America didn't resemble Middle Earth - at any time in history.\n\nNext, we'll go to the characters, who are extremely undeveloped, and some even go unnamed. Lukas Haas is in the movie, but what's his character's name or role - does anyone know? Because the movie won't tell you. Amanda Seyfried's Valerie is so pointless a character that you never develop a reason to like her or root for her. In fact, I just wanted the wolf to eat her already. The rest of the cast consists of pretty people who can't act their way out of paper bags. Except for Oldman, who can make any terrible movie seem at the very least, okay. The man is too talented to be involved with drivel like this, and one can only assume he really needed the money to take this role. Oh, and I don't want to leave out the two token blacks in the film who serve as Uncle Toms to Oldman's character - whatever that character was, I still can't figure out. Lastly, there's the \"werewolf\", which looks like something the props department picked up at FAO Schwartz. Oh, and speaks, too. (roll eyes).\n\nBy a certain point, you won't care who the werewolf is, you just sit there hoping it comes by and knocks off everyone in the village because they're so dull, you couldn't care less if they live or die.\n\nWe walked out after maybe an hour and couldn't get our money back because we didn't leave sooner. Remember the 30-minute rule, folks - after 10 minutes you think the movie will be a major stinker, follow your gut, get up and leave and get your money back because you sure won't get that half hour of your life back."

It reminded me of it because the main girl is stuck between loving to guys. This movie is a lot better then Twilight. The movie really kept you guessing who the wolf was I seriously had no idea who it was the entire movie.

The movie tries to do too much. Basically, the editor needs to be shot. I don't think they edited anything out from the original screenplay and it needed to have some of the fat trimmed. While the movie could've done with out some of the major scenes, it didn't have enough continuity shots. This made some of the action sequences and the overall flow of the movie choppy. Also there is nothing scary about the movie and the visual effects are poor. Perhaps if you watch this movie when it is on TV, you can enjoy it for the ridiculous bad movie that it is."

And these 2 hours were not unpleasant at all. In the middle of Christmas (or winter solstice?) fairy-tale invasion, I don't dare to hope for characters, breaking the rules of cheesiness, heteronormative love etc.\n\nThough...\n\nI enjoy the movie's visual - modern fairy-tales tend to be overdecorated, bright, sterile or too stylized for its own sake. The forest and village of RRH were quite suggestive and appealing for an eye without being smarmy. Realistic as well as beautiful of magical kind with a little touch of poisonous... as much as the whole movie, that balanced on the border of fairy-tale and horror, though it was neither oversweetend as Christmas bakery, nor \"something barks at you from darkness\" fear-exploitation. Besides that, this fairy-tale was definitely not sexless - and even if the \"erotic\" scenes were tamed and cut-short, they were more vivid or daring than I have seen in the genre.\n\nThe strongest point I have found with this story was the fact, it is not a Christian propaganda. Luckily I cannot use word \"politically correct\" - i.e. for Christian (abrahamic), wiccan, (neo)pagan and atheist audience inclusive. The rituals of the village seemed quite unashamedly pagan - e.g. not-too-repressed sexuality, weak and not-so-respected priest, tribal dancing in the feast scene. Especially that one - for many spectators too long, for me these scenes where story stops going forward and I am given a smell of atmosphere allows me to dive into the settings, stay in the different reality for a while. There was a slightly modern undertone (music), but unlike many other modernizations of classics, this did not feel disturbing or out-of-place. The pagan element showed up quite well in contrast with arrival of Christian witch-hunter, who sets up the machinery of inquisition (love to see that, especially during Christmas)... the village is submitting, but not enthusiastically cooperating. As one of the characters says - the inquisitor's suite is worse than a wolf-menace.\n\nAvoiding the spoiler, the Christian narrative tells us about the \"battle of good and evil\" and it is in some way just a variation on hockey match (who will win, who will loose)... everyone must choose sides \"are you with us (and shall live) or with them (and will die)\". Pagan narrative tells us about different forces in nature, each one with a right to be, that sometimes cross ways. Everyone has history, pains, traumas, anger, record of injustice done upon him, handicaps or talents - motivations that are behind our acts - which may seem \"evil\" from one point of view, \"justified\" from another. This movie, better than many others, admits the non-black-and-white reality, out of infantile simplicism. It is a fairy-tale for adults."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems the current obsession with vampires and werewolves is so omnipresent that it even invades fairy tales. The original children's story is described as this: 'The earliest known printed version was known as Le Petit Chaperon Rouge and had its origins in 17th century French folklore. It was included in the collection Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose (Histoires et contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s. Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this version is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault. The story had as its subject an \"attractive, well-bred young lady\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. The latter ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.'\n\nNow take that old tale and replace the wolf with a werewolf (this is not the first time in world literature that this has been done!) and presto, RED RIDING HOOD appears as Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) who since childhood has been in love with the poor woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but Valerie's parents (Virginia Madsen and Billly Burke) have other plans: marry Valerie to the wealthy (but oh so good hearted) Henry (Max Irons),a factor that sets up a love triangle for the film. Valerie's sister is found dead, the victim of a werewolf who has the reputation for killing all members of the family once he has a victim. The village is terrified and arms against the werewolf. Valerie seeks solace from her grandmother (Julie Christie) and with Peter. A charlatan arrives in the village - Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) - to choreograph the end of the werewolf: he is assisted by a little crew of soldiers and by the local priest Father Auguste (Lukas Haas). The werewolf strikes again and from there on out it is a wild chase to discover the daylight identity of the werewolf who only takes on the form of the beastie when the moon is full and red. To say more would be labeled spoilers and the story is so simple minded that no further help is needed.\n\nThe story was written in this format by David Johnson and directed by the queen of vampire and werewolves Catherine Hardwicke (the Twilight series). The producer of this film is Leonardo DiCaprio which may explain why so many good actors were drawn to this insipid little disaster of a film. By now even the appetites of the teen audience for these stories is pretty saturated and this film did not succeed in drawing a big audience. The cast does the best with what they are given (Max Irons gives evidence of a true find but the talents of Christie, Oldman, Burke, and Madsen are frittered away. Perhaps with popcorn and coke in the theater this would be more entertaining.\n\nGrady Harp"

Never becomes a great movie though.\n\nAmanda Seyfried does a great job, nearly carrying the movie herself.\n\nProblem is, a lot of the characters are type cast, and if the script doesn't give you enough to work with, it is really hard for the actor to make you see the character, you just see an actor doing his usual schtick.\n\nI would definitely watch it again in a few years when I've forgot most of it. As a fantasy with a serious tone and some soft horror, it's a genre I like and not much to choose from."

It is a really good spin to the classic \"Red Riding Hood\" tale, and I love how the writers incorporate a lot of the details from the story into the movie. And for people who are afraid to watch chick flicks... it had more action than some would think. I would personally say it is not a chick flick, just because a story has a romance in it doesn't hinder it from being good.\n\nAmanda Seyfried did an awesome job acting along with her co-stars, and personally Billy Burke played a better father in this flick. And the soundtrack was great! I've become addicted.\n\nThis movie is definitely worth the rent, or buy, or at least a watch on netflix. Not a waste of time."

I remember watch the fable about \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in the old days. The wolf eats grandmother, and transforms itself into the grandmother. I become the same horrible emotion at that time. I look back on it, and watch it on the YouTube. It is exactly different contents to compare with fable. However, I enjoy this film very much. One of my friends love Amanda, and she recommend me to watch this movie. After watch this, I feel a little bit scare. Because it is perfectly took us the horrible world. Especially, I sympathize with the main character, when she is scared of everyone around her. Who is the real wolf which is called wolf-man in the film? It maybe your friends, family, and somebody who well known of you, and love you a lots! In my opinion, I cannot doubt my family, friends, because I love them. However in this film, the main character, Red Riding Hood should have solving the problem, and rescue villagers from danger.\n\nThe only thing I can't agree with this movie is the setting about this story, which says people who bite from the wolf-man will become wolf. I can understand the meaning of the setting, but it is unnaturally and sounds unlikely.\n\nTo sum up, I enjoy this movie very much. Amanda is so beautiful and the partner who becomes wolf also looking-good. You will fun to watch this impressive interpretation full of immediacy! It is valuable to watch. People who only watch this movie will be realized the real wolf-man, and why the man kills Red Riding Hood's sister at the first....."

And ill stop here because the less you know the better the movie will be. the story was suspenseful and intriguing, it kept me guessing. the acting was excellent by Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman, the rest of the cast did a good job too.\n\nthe set was great and the director managed to capture great footage of lovely scenery.\n\nSo why are people rating this movie badly ?\n\nsome were saying, characters should have spoken an English accent rather than an American one, well, I didn't feel like that really ruined the movie for me, and besides, better this than a fake rubbish English accent.\n\nmost were probably just wanted to hate it because critics have already gave it bad reviews, so they felt like they had to agree with the critics. and then some say they actually knew the ending, and I only think they should blame themselves because probably they read and knew more about the movie before hand, which is wrong.\n\nA piece of advice, Don't ever visit movie forums or read movie reviews before watching it !!! I even avoid watching trailers because they give away too much, and in this case, it paid off, as I went into this not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nBut if you are one of those people who has to read reviews and is obsessed by reading articles, then ill summarise for you : A perfect Movie, very enjoyable with very good acting overall. it has suspense and mystery with a nice story. I highly recommend this."

Now, all horror movies require a willful suspension of disbelief--duh!--and most of us have no problem with making the necessary adjustments. Occasionally, however, a plot contains a hole big enough for a herd of elephants to march through. \"Red Riding Hood\" is a prime example. The action takes place in a very small secluded village. When Gary Oldman, typically and delightfully over-the-top as the werewolf-slaying religious zealot, assures the villagers that the beast lives among them, he solves the mystery on the spot. He just doesn't realize it. Why not simply assemble all of them, preferably inside the boundaries of the church, on a night with a full moon and see who transforms? How many seconds would Sherlock Holmes puzzle over such a \"problem\"? I mean, really! Ah, well, Amanda Seyfried has wickedly pretty eyes. Virginia Madsen is quite good and seeing Julie Christie again is certainly worth something. Take a chance on the Big Bad Wolf, but don't expect a classic."

Amanda Seyfried acting here is annoyingly stale, and Amanda Seyfried gave quite a beautiful performance in last years Dear John, but here she looks confused on which emotion to show during any scene. The werewolf part seems to bring some interest, that is until you finally see the wolf, and your like \"What\". Gary Oldman is unwatchable and brings no interest, and that accent he does is hurtful to listen too, almost as bad has Brad Pitt in Inglorius Bastards(2009). Only Max Irons seems to give a some what descent performance. Everybody else unbearable.

Apparently this wolf has been killing for 2 generations, so why people aren't moving away from this village is beyond me. Instead they feed it. The film soon drops the romance angle and focuses on Gary Oldman as he brings his own brand of werewolf hunting to the village. Oldman makes everyone turn against each other in what is probably the least productive way of tackling a werewolf problem. It certainly tries and draw parallels with the war on terror. With added elephant contraption torture. It has contemporary music and modern looking guys, I often forgot what time period it's set in. The best thing of all is the mystery aspect of the film. It managed to cast suspicions over most of the characters, and though you will probably guess who the wolf is, you'll certainly second guess yourself."

Yet it keeps to a medieval village feel. Liked the dance scene.\n\nCatherine Hardwicke is an exciting fast paced director. There are no wasted scenes or draggy moments. She creates a beautiful atmospheric backdrop for the story. I think she did a great job in the original Twilight when she found a fantastic cast and set the suitable tone. There are some similarities to Twilight like the 2 suitors for 1 damsel. And the wolf is a bit like Twilight.\n\nSome of the actors are well cast. Virginia Madsen looks the part and a bit like Amanda so she is just right as her mother. Billy Burke is quite good as the woodcutter father. Amanda Seyfried as Valerie looks like a fairytale maiden - she doesn't look so bug eyed in this movie. Julie Christie is a fascinating grandmother and Gary Oldman is watchable in his inquisitorial role.\n\nMain fault: The 2 male romantic leads lack charisma. Shiloh Fernandez as Peter resembles Joaquin Phoenix and is just a bit too unattractive for the role. Even though he is supposed to be a simple woodcutter they should have chosen someone more appealing. Chemistry was lacking with Amanda. Max Irons as Henry is a bit daft looking and tentative in his acting. But this doesn't matter since the movie is more a fantasy adventure and the romance isn't that central to it.\n\nOverall - very enjoyable - it is as well done as it could have been."

I guess that 1 can go towards the girl actually looking half decent. The directing is awful, the acting is awful and the storyline is horrible. only thing that keeps your attention in this movie is the fact that you don't really know who the wolf is. This movie reminds me of the movie the village.\n\nsave yourselves the time don't even bother watching it unless you want to know what a bad movie looks like."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Riding Hood is boring. It perhaps shouldn't be, but it is. It wants to be part love story, part action flick, part whodunit. But it isn't much of anything but a bland teen-targeting borefest trying to elbow into Twilight's audience.\n\nLong ago. A remote European village filled with brooding beautiful and/or handsome citizens is under siege from a werewolf. Each month at the full moon the village goes into lockdown, with no-one emerging until daylight. Yet still some locals manage to turn up dead.\n\nThe latest is Valerie's (Amanda Seyfried) sister. It is obviously a very sad day for the village and particularly the family, with Valerie's alcoholic Dad and super-serious Mum both extremely upset.\n\nValerie loves Peter, a local woodcutter who seems decidedly swoony. She is unfortunately arranged to be wed to Henry, who isn't a woodcutter but is almost as dreamy. And he's rich.\n\nAfter the latest fatalities an outside expert is brought in to rid the town of the furry evil, a man who chose to kill his own wife when he found she turned into a snarling, vicious monster every month or so (I'll leave the obvious and unsavoury joke alone).\n\nThe new wolf-hunter is Solomon (Gary Oldman), he is brash, loud and confident, perhaps because he is backed by several heavily armed men, perhaps because he swiftly realises that everyone else in this crappy film is too busy brooding and looking mysterious to show a pulse.\n\nSolomon summons the entire village to inform one and all that not only do they have a werewolf, but he is a resident of this very village *GASP*\u0085and soon a 'blood moon' will come, meaning the wolf can infect others and make more werewolves.\n\nSo we're left with two questions: 1/ Will Valerie break with formality and choose beefcake over rich-boy? And; 2/ Who is the wolf? The answer to both is that only teen-girls could give a damn. I tuned out early, then had to hold back vomit when I learned that the dodgy as hell looking werewolf could communicate with Valerie via telepathy or something.\n\nAs mentioned only Gary Oldman seems to realise just how bad this all is, and his over-acting replicates that of Anthony Hopkins in Dracula \u2013 in fact his character is basically the Van Helsing role here in this patently obvious rip-off. Everyone else shuffles about like emo-zombies with flawless skin, backed with tasteful lighting and teen friendly angst music.\n\nI could write this off as being 'not for me', but I sincerely hope that utter garbage like this isn't possibly right for anyone\u0085\n\nFinal Rating \u2013 3.5 / 10. A film aimed at a Twilight crowd that is so awful in every respect that I would rather rewatch Twilight than this."

Finding out who the wolf is and stopping it is the point and it leads us to those points beautifully.\n\nThe film artfully leads us from one suspect to another throughout the better part of the film. Just when it gives itself away it takes it back and leaves you guessing once again. I watched this with my husband and my teenage boys and all of us were making guesses throughout the entire film. That is what made the film worth watching.\n\nIf you like trying to figure out who done it. This film is good for that.\n\nMy only complaint is that I didn't particularly enjoy the steamy star crossed lover angle.\n\nAmanda Seyfried makes a hauntingly beautiful red riding hood. I don't think they could have chosen better."

Instead of a wolf terrorizing Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, it is a werewolf and it is terrorizing a whole town. The townspeople believe that the wolf is someone who lives among them, and the film does a decent job of keeping it a mystery right up until the end of the film. Amanda Seyfried stars as the title character, Valerie, who lives in a medieval village with her parents. Gary Oldman hams it up as the werewolf hunter that has come to the town to slay the wolf. Seyfried's dad is played by Billy Burke, who is better known as Bella's dad in the Twilight films. That isn't the only similarity between this film and the Twilight franchise. Director Catherine Hardwicke directed Twilight, this film is also filmed in British Columbia, and there is of course a love triangle. The film feels very similar in mood and tone to Twilight, and considering the director, that comes as no surprise. One primary difference is that unlike Kristen Stewart, Amanda Seyfried actually has more than just one blank expression during the movie and is a lot less wooden than Stewart. All in all the film is an average film, with some OK sequences involving the werewolf, but it doesn't cover any new ground in the werewolf genre. If you like Twilight, watch this, otherwise take a pass."

I literally had guessed 3 characters to be the werewolves however it turned out to be none of them. The characters were perfectly cast with mentions going out to Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fernandez, Max Irons, Gary Oldman and Billy Burke all gave amazing performances and were perfect for their given roles. This movie is a must watch as it was really good, and a very good romantic movie as well without even trying to class itself as a romance flick. Go watch it"

        "review_detailed_main": "As soon as I saw the trailer to \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011) I wanted to see it. This is basically a werewolf mystery with elements of the tale. What sets it apart from other werewolf mysteries, like The Howling V: The Rebirth, The Beast Must Die and The Beast of Bray Road, is that \"Red Riding Hood\" is set in medieval Europe, possibly France near the border of Germany (the writer of the fairy tale, Charles Perrault, was a Frenchman).\n\nEven people who don't like this film acknowledge the outstanding cinematography, locations, costumes and medieval sets (shot in British Columbia). But some grumble about it being a \"Twilight\" imitation or that the story's boring, etc. Although I'm sure the incredible success of the Twilight films contributed to the production of \"Red Riding Hood\" it's vastly different in tone simply by the fact that it takes place in 1300s Europe. As for the story being boring, it might not be the most compelling screenplay ever written but I was intrigued by the werewolf mystery and the film nicely created suspense concerning who might be the werewolf.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are no less than seven suspects and I wasn't able to correctly guess, even though I pinned it down to a possible three or four. When the werewolf is finally revealed and the explanation given it all made perfect sense and there are a handful of solid clues for sleuths. Excellent job on this front.\n\nI was also impressed by a couple of original elements that \"Red Riding Hood\" brought to the table of werewolf lore. I can't share them here because I don't want to give anything away.\n\nAs far as cast goes, you have heavyweights like Gary Oldman and Julie Christie, as well as Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen and Amanda Seyfried. Amanda is great for the titular role with her big beautiful eyes.\n\nThere are a couple of quality Goth songs on the soundtrack, including \"The Wolf\" by Fever Ray, which makes the relatively long celebration sequence in the village a highlight.\n\nFINAL WORD: More than anything else, \"Red Riding Hood\" struck me as a modern-day Hammer film. If you appreciate Hammer films like \"The Curse of the Werewolf,\" as well as movies like \"The Village\" and the three mentioned above, don't miss out on \"Red Riding Hood.\"\n\nThe film runs 100 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B"

This is just a warmed-over Twilight clone, right down to the vapid female lead and metrosexual love interests. I was frankly surprised that the werewolf didn't sparkle."

        "review_title": "The Adventures of Little Valerie Riding Hood",
        "review_detailed_main": "Once upon a time, in the village of Daggerhorn, deep in a forest somewhere in mediaeval Europe, there lived a Mr. and Mrs Riding-Hood, who had a daughter named Valerie. Yes, I know that in the original story she was named \"Little Red\", but the makers of this film clearly wanted a more traditional Christian name. The people of Daggerhorn are being plagued by the attentions of a wolf, and not just a common-or-garden wolf either. This one is a werewolf, believed to be one of the villagers with the power to transform himself into a wolf. The people believe that they have come to an arrangement with the werewolf; they will make regular sacrifices of cattle to it, and in exchange it will not seek out human prey. The wolf, however, breaks this arrangement when it murders Valerie's sister Lucie, and the enraged villagers set out to kill it.\n\nI won't set out any further details of the plot, which is a very complex one, except to say that it involves a love-triangle between Valerie and two local boys, Peter and Henry, some disturbing revelations about Valerie's family background and the arrival in the village of the famous witch hunter Father Solomon to help the people in their fight against the werewolf. These elements will doubtless make it clear that \"Red Riding Hood\" is not, by any stretch of the imagination, simply a retelling of the familiar story, although some elements (Valerie's red cloak, her grandmother) are retained. Like this year's \"Snow White and the Huntsman\", another film ostensibly based on a traditional folk tale, it uses its source material very loosely.\n\n\"Snow White and the Huntsman\" is essentially a sword-and-sorcery fantasy, owning more to Tolkien and Peter Jackson (with contributions from Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam) than to Disney and the Brothers Grimm. \"Red Riding Hood\" is more of a \"dark fantasy\" essentially a horror film with a period setting, with similarities to some of the Hammer horror movies of the sixties and seventies. Some reviewers have compared Father Solomon to the witch-hunters in Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\", but a closer comparison might be with Weill in Hammer's \"Twins of Evil\". In both that film and in \"Red Riding Hood\" we are asked, for the purposes of the drama, to suspend our disbelief in malevolent supernatural beings, vampires in \"Twins of Evil\" and werewolves here. Weill and Solomon are both cruel and fanatical, but the forces against which they are fighting are nevertheless real. Miller, by contrast, takes the view (as did Michael Reeves in his film \"Witchfinder-General\") that belief in witchcraft or the supernatural is irrational and superstitious.\n\nThe best acting performance comes from Gary Oldman as Solomon, playing him as that all-too-familiar type, the religious fanatic who in his zeal has convinced himself that he is doing God's work and that he therefore has a licence to commit acts from which, under other circumstances, he would recoil in horror. None of the other contributions, however, stand out. Both Shiloh Fernandez as Peter and Max Irons as Henry are forgettable, although I must say that Amanda Seyfried as Valerie is a lot better here than she was in the last film in which I saw her, the dreadful \"Mamma Mia!\" (Amanda's striking blonde looks also contribute to some of the film's more memorable images).\n\nDespite some variable acting, \"Red Riding Hood\" is not altogether a bad film. Some (Roger Ebert included) have complained that the plot is preposterous, although in my view it is no more so than most horror films about the supernatural. Films about werewolves are not generally the place to go if you are looking for hyper-realism. Despite its fairy-tale origins, this is a very atmospheric film, dark, moody and unsettling film, with something to say about the nature of fanaticism and cruelty. It is certainly not a film for children; had that pun not already been overworked to death, I would have called it a \"grim fairy-tale\". 6/10"

She wanders through the film as if she is half asleep, failing to hit even one note.\n\nAs far as story goes, there isn't one. Well that's not true. Just imagine taking Red Riding hood and putting her in Arthur Miller's the Crucible and you'll have the gist of this film. What it translates to unfortunately is far from the integrity of Miller's play. Instead we have a bunch of hapless peasants running around their village for a hundred minutes whole the church tries to shield them from the Big Bad Wolf who lurks in the shadows to hide the poor quality of his CG body. One thing I do like about the wolf is that the animators have envisioned him with a kind of characteristic body, the kind that we might have seen in picture books, with exaggerated features.\n\nOne of the irony's of movies that fall apart as badly as this one is that, is that when they come with a sense of anti-climax (as this one does) it proves to be a positive quality, because you just want to get out of the theatre. There is truly no use for a movie like Red Riding Hood. It's pointless, boring, unscary, unromantic and just about unwatchable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Riding Hood is so ridiculously pathetic on so many levels that I find it difficult to separate and itemize each attribute which contributes to that statement in any concrete and specific fashion. It is awful to its core. It wreaks! Gary Oldman took the cake, though, with his typical overacting and apparent attempt to reprise his Dracula role which ruined Coppola's 1992 remake. Hey Gary, why the thick and phony accent? Didn't you notice none of the rest of the cast even bothered? No troll here. I forked out $50 for a couple of my kids and I to go see this joke and it was my choice. I wasn't expecting Oscar material and I figured it would have a Twilight-type storyline. I'm usually able to find something positive in any flick. Hell, I even surprisingly found the Justin Beiber \"Never Say Never\" film to be somewhat enjoyable (which eerily enough currently holds a one-star average on IMDb whilst this soft and sloppy piece of dung has five.) If I could have achieved it without embarrassing the kids, I would have walked out and requested my money back. Honestly, folks, it was that bad and I grew up as a teen in the 80's and that decade farted out some real doozies...\n\nJust like everyone, I believe in guilty pleasures and movies so bad you can't help but like them... But unlike those, this takes itself seriously and that is both worrisome and frightening. However, what is even more concerning is that so many movie-goers actually attempt to courageously defend and recommend it. There is definitely something toxic and mentally debilitating in the public water system."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the same director who brought the first book of the Twilight (2008) saga to the big screen comes the retelling of a classic fairytale about the young girl who journeys over the river and through the woods to her grandmother's house. For Twihards and fans of the Twilight movies, Red Riding Hood (2011) is just the dose of young, tragic love that you'll need to hold you over until Breaking Dawn (2011) is released and the battle between Team Edward and Team Jacob can rage on. For the rest of the world, you're out of luck with this one, especially if you are a fan of intellectually stimulating dialogue and realistic reactions to extreme terror.\n\nLeading lady Amanda Seyfried, who you may recognize from your favorite chick-flicks as the star in Dear John (2010) and Jennifer's Body (2009), plays the part of Valerie, the doe-eyed villager who has to decide if she'll lead a safe and wealthy life with the silversmith's son, Henry (Max Irons), or abandon her family and village for the devious hottie with whom she claims to love, Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Her plans to run away with Peter are put on hold when the full moon brings the monthly arrival of the werewolf, who is usually satisfied with a simple animal sacrifice from the villagers. However, to complicate matters, the occurrence of a rare, blood red, full moon allows the werewolf to transform the victims of his choice with a simple bite. Red Riding Hood exemplifies the prototypical who-dun-it tale that will transport you back to your Scooby Doo-watching days (settle down Shaggy; it's not Old Man Jenkins dressed as the haunted scarecrow so that he can claim the gold for himself). The audience is not allowed to sit for more than five minutes without being reminded of the love story that has been weaved into the tale, but love it or hate it, the cheesy romance is what sets this version of the tale apart from the others.\n\nAs much as I know Red Riding Hood missed the mark with every audience that does not include oversexed females between the ages of twelve and seventeen, I still find myself wanting to defend it for leaving the ending open for young viewers to fanaticize about what might happen next in the world where werewolves and witches are able to exist. The verdict: teenaged viewers will eat up the supernatural romance story and will not hesitate to add it to their home-theater collection. Mature audiences will find it silly and severely lacking in substance as an interpretation of one of the most famous horror stories of all time. I recommend waiting until it's available for rental, because it's worth a watch, but it's not a brilliant cinematic piece that you'll be discussing and trying to dissect over a family dinner."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whose afraid of the big bad wolf? A better question to be in this case is 'Who really cares?' What becomes of the childhood story is a romanticised silly love triangle that incorporates elements of the original story very slightly while making everything else downright silly.\n\nI don't remember much from the original story except for the fact that the girl obviously doesn't have much sense in recognising a wolf from her own grandmother \u2013 big family relationship problems they must have had. Amanda Seyfried wouldn't be that stupid, and luckily the plot adds an element of the 'who is the culprit' to make it look as though she can pull the film together, but fails miserably.\n\nWhat you get is a love twist that is never really developed. Valerie (Seyfried), blonde, pretty and with the look of innocence that would attract most men is soon to marry Henry (Max Irons) has been seeing her love Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) who is a woodcutter much to the disapproval of her family. The villagers are all terrified of the wolf that terrorises the village once in a while. After they summon the help of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman in a laughable performance), things get tense as he claims that one of them must be the wolf and he or she will rise during the event of a blood moon (which is pretty much when the moon is just red).\n\nAnd that's all you really need to know. You never really get to know any of these characters well enough to really care about what will happen to them. Valerie is simply a pretty face that is swooned by two pretty boys, in which you could probably make a comparison to a Twilight fantasy. The love triangle is not developed at all, in fact many of the characters seem to appear then come back later on making you wonder who they are again.\n\nThe music score was perhaps one of the most annoying things about the film. I suppose they wanted to market this as a thriller/horror but it fails miserably on both accounts. The music almost felt like a teenage grunge/drum theme at times and this did not create the mystical or fairytale likeness that Red Riding Hood should bring to the screen.\n\nSome scenes just feel added to add some glamour into it \u2013 the dancing scene is simply to arouse lust and jealously amongst the characters. The music score in this scene made me think that they had recorded the wrong track onto this part. With repeats like this, it distracts you from the purpose of the film and leaves you wondering what you are watching at times.\n\nWhat is probably the biggest fault is that it tries to make it too many things. A tale of forbidden love that barely scratches the surface, a period piece that fails to capture any of the medi evilness tone and a suspenseful mystery. You honestly don't really care who the wolf is after the halfway mark because they keep you guessing too much and once you find out, the payoff doesn't really add anything to it. It's almost as if the script writers decided to make this person the wolf because they had too many alternate versions which didn't work.\n\nI will have to say the production design, sets and costumes are nicely handled. Seyfried looks almost like a little schoolgirl in the red hood; hence the 'little' in riding hood. But she fails to bring any real depth to the character and in the end, this is simply a film about her wanting to find the guy she wants rather than wolves and grandmothers.\n\nI don't have a thing against Twilight, and found the first film interesting, but the romantic elements in this film feel so flat that I really didn't care who she ended up with, and the lack of chemistry between her and the guys is rather stale.\n\nWith some really dull dialogue and lack of any real wit, I'm thinking that they should have just stuck to what the story is really about; a girl who visits her grandmother and is eaten by the wolf. Not that you can't add some extra things into it, but if you do, at least make us care about it and make it a bit more plausible."

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Riding Rood, the latest in a line of live-action adaptations of fairy tales, hinders in its pursuit of bringing the classic red riding hood tale to life. Riding Hood was bitten, not by a wolf, but by a disjointed story line, unconvincing acting, wrong casting (besides Seyfried) and clich\u00e9, unimaginative dialog. The real shame is that the basic premise of the film has great potential; the concept of turning the classic tale into a real life world of fantasy could have been rather fascinating. A young girl from a quite village near a dark, dark forest who must make her way through the forest to the house of a loved one, could have paved the way for many twists & turns, a complex blend of drama & romance, and a world of action and fantasy. Instead, what we are left with is a film with an unbelievably bad twist, and an unconvincing village from the...I guess 1700's?\n\nAmanda Seyfried is well suited to role. She is beautiful, but not sexy. She is strong willed, but retains an innocence one can see from the sparkle in her eyes. She was indeed convincing as the young Riding-Hood. The supporting cast however was a major let down. Max Irons and Billy Burke play the two love interests. Director Catherine Hardwicke was unfortunately unable to let go of the major love interest from her box-office hit Twilight, which she directed previously to Red Riding Hood. These two men who fight over Seyfrieds character in the film, were too reminiscent of Edward Cullen. Their acting was clich\u00e9 and unconvincing, as was their dialog. We have seen it before. Julie Christie who played Seyfried's grandmother gave a good, but not a great performance. And the rest of the cast, especially King Solomon (played by Gary Oldman) are not worth assessing.\n\nThe setting was also unconvincing. Which country are they meant to be in (especially with all the different accents; American, English, and Native African)? What period in history was this set in? If I had to guess I would say that it was located somewhere in North America toward Alaska, set during colonial times, perhaps when the settlers and pilgrims came to North America in search of the 'new world.' However this is unclear. King Solomon has two black bodyguards, one Asian bodyguard, and there was not one sign of a Cherokee Native-American anywhere. Any good writer/director knows the setting paves way for the story. The number one rule in film making is that the setting must speak for itself.\n\nThe story line was extremely disjointed and unconvincing. Aspects of the storyline simply didn't make sense. One minute a character (weather it be her Grandmother, her father, or the love interests) gave the impression of evil and cruel intentions, but then the next minute we are suppose to be believe they are good, by the sudden shift in their tone of voice. It dimply didn't make sense. The ending of the film didn't make sense, the twist didn't make sense, and Seyfried's character at the end of the film, didn't make sense.\n\nIn all, the film fails in its pursuit to tell a love story; an effortless tail of romance, drama, and fantasy. It fails to follow a linear plot, and fails to demonstrate any particular moral or theme. The film was unbelievable and unconvincing, set in a town that looked to plastic and technically constructed. The best part of the film is Seyfried's performance as the young hooded girl. If it was not for her performance, I would have given the film a 2/10 rating. Seyfried bumped it up to 4."

        "review_detailed_main": "M. Night Shyamalan's The Village meets Twilight, giving birth to an hour and 40 minutes of torture. It makes sense. Catherine Hardwicke directed the sparkly vampire teen romance. Red Riding Hood plays out in the same fashion - brooding young hotties fighting for the same girl, in this case Amanda Seyfried as Valerie. (I did go into this film not knowing who directed it. I didn't find out until afterward so I viewed it unbiased.)\n\nFor many years, the townspeople have kept the beast away by offering it an animal sacrifice every month. With the appearance of the blood red moon, its hunger can only be sated by taking a human life, Valerie's sister. A grieving Valerie returns home to find out that her parents have arranged a marriage with Henry, a wealthy suitor, but she's in love with Peter, a lowly woodcutter (who, by the way, not only can't bring home the bacon but can't act to save his life).\n\nSeeking revenge and justice for the slaying, the people of the village summon Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a renowned werewolf hunter. He warns them that the beast takes human form during the day, inciting paranoia in everyone, including Valierie who wonders if her true love could be the one who killed her sister. The watered down romance suddenly turns into a whodunit mess.\n\nDespite the trailer and theatrical poster that emit a dark vibe, horror/thriller fans will be grossly disappointed. Even with veterans Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, and Virginia Madsen, the film is constantly bogged down by its simple dialog and cheesy CGI. There is also a lot of nonsensical filler that stretches 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Why can't Hollywood ever offer a decent ending to a movie? It doesn't have to contain a clever twist but it shouldn't be so anti-climactic.\n\nYou may think I'm being harsh but, in fact, I bumped my rating up to a generous 40% because of Oldman. Tweens and teens will like the re- imagined fairytale but serious movie-goers will probably walk away frustrated."

Save your money and watch \"Cat People\" instead. you'll get a much better value.\n\nFrom the start, sets looked fake. Things simply looked slapped together, with little effort taken to build a cohesive whole.\n\nAmanda Seyfried delivers a great performance. Unfortunately, it isn't equaled by the rest of the cast. Gary Oldman acted as well as one would expect, but his character didn't seem to fit the story. Where did he come from? Why did he have black servants? He simply seemed out of place.\n\nThe cinematography wasn't great either. Even scenes designed to be picturesque, for example, a panoramic high perspective scene with the red cape flowing in the wind was destroyed when the wind changed direction blowing the cape into a pile."

        "review_detailed_main": "And I thought \"Hoodwinked\" was crazy enough. This is definitely one of the most unexpected, and creative, interpretations of the classic fairy tale. It basically took what was essentially a harmless children's story and turned it into a creepy mystery/monster movie. My interest was instantly sparked the moment I saw the trailer to this movie and it has lived up to most of my expectations.\n\nPlot: The village of Daggerhorn has lived under the fear of a ruthless werewolf for years and when it has finally killed someone, the townsfolk have had enough. Some believe in taking justice into their own hands by killing the beast while others support a visiting werewolf hunter (Gary Oldman) with questionable sanity. To make matters worse, the wolf seems unusually focused on Valerie a.k.a. Red Riding Hood (Amanda Seyfried), who has her own problems with the love triangle she's in, leading people to suspect Valerie as well as her friends and family. Since the werewolf can be anyone, tensions rise and the monster's attacks become more violent. Will the killing stop and why does the wolf want poor Valerie? The mystery begins!\n\nI love how this movie messes with your mind because it keeps you guessing on which person could be the big bad wolf. The chaos is furthered with Gary Oldman's character Father Solomon being insanely determined to kill the creature by any means necessary. Amanda Seyfried's performance as Valerie is pretty interesting and you do basically feel for her as she struggles with her life, and love life, while the madness is occurring around her. The big bad werewolf himself is an awesome and scary creature as he is utterly merciless and remorseless in what he does and his voice has a menacing quality.\n\nThere are a few things to nitpick around here. Seeing as how this was made by Catherine Hardwicke who directed \"Twilight\", you can see some obvious influences by the best-selling series by how certain characters look (you'll know who I'm talking about), the werewolf looking very much like the ones from twilight, and the love triangle going on here between Valerie and these two guys Henry and Peter. There's also an exceptionally corny dream scene near the end, which you'll have to see for yourself to understand what I mean by \"corny\". And just on a smaller note, I would have liked to have seen the werewolf a little more.\n\nWhile this movie does have a few problems, it's still an entertaining movie and one of my favorite werewolf films. I certainly had fun with it and I do recommend that you check it out just for the thrill and the mystery. Be sure to bring silver with you."

I don't want to post an unwanted spoiler, so I will keep it at that. The film sets the tone nicely in the beginning, and it keeps you interested for most of the film. The characters are fairly interesting, and it really does keep you guessing until the very end. So, I do like the mystery side of it, but I am just a mystery movie fan in general, so I'm not very hard to please in that area. I'd say as a mystery alone, this is actually a little above average as you have at least a half dozen suspects, and the director keeps alternating between them. BUT, the ending to me was pretty lame. I'm not a big moral type guy when it comes to movies, but the implied point in the ending was disturbing to me from that standpoint. I just feel like they took a film that could have been great and spilled grape juice on it - and once that dries, it can't be cleaned up."

The movie kind of reminded me of Twilight because of the two guys fighting over the girl they love and trying to prove it to her (Peter and Henry). I liked that they kind of the same kind of scenery and the way the wolf looked the same. The heroine in the story is Valerie (Little Red riding hood)she does have some help escaping and some help from Peter. The new version doesn't really remind me of the old versions the only thing thats the same is the red hood and the wolf and the basket.There were many differences between the original version of Little Red Riding Hood and this 2011 version Red Riding Hood. Over all Red Riding Hood was a good movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I do love Red Riding Hood stories and especially The Company of Wolves from Neil Jordan. The micro-stories inside the main story have been absolutely magical. Unfortunately, there is different sort of magic in this new movie - the magic of marketing. There is many ways how to tell the story (Hoodwinked is good example) - and the marketing guys came with idea that it would be wise to Twilight a little this old story.\n\nThe result is very mixed at best. The scenery is amazing, beautiful, almost baroque and it is probably the most important reason to view the movie. All scenes are detailed, rich in color and remind me of illustrations from fairy tale books from the end of the 19th century. Even death scenes are arranged to look really good, almost artsy. Seriously, I do like the visuals.\n\nThe Twilightization actually seriously damaged the rest of the movie. There is \"1 girl, 2 boys\" trilemma, all looking good as if they just left the stylist in the shopping mall so they look charming working in the woods or in the foundry. I find this plainly bizarre.\n\nThe story has been changed to follow more Twilight ways of storytelling, which means lot of emotions, relationships, family problems, little bit of political intrigue, little bit of personal intrigue and some pretty strange twists. The wolf is not wolf but werewolf, so the story is really closer to Twilight than to Red Riding Hood. There is more emotions, but strangely the story is very boring.\n\nI think there is no need for more Twilights. There is too much of them already and the supplies of teenage girls are limited. Everyone more mature or less mature will be just pretty bored by the movie. What a wasted opportunity!"

Yeah it looked pretty, the colour and sets are everything you expect from a big budget preteen horror and the wolf was good for a completely CGI villain. The one thing i always judge a werewolf film on is the werewolf transition. and this just bitched out completely. There just wasn't a transition from man to wolf. Leaving absolutely no room for in camera special effects and the chance to do something memorable in this otherwise forgettable film. Hollywood keeps telling me to find Amanda Seyfried attractive but I just don't. I'm sure I will once she acts enough to impress me in a film. But Gary Oldman kicks ass, his character makes the movie for me, because my dream job would be mythical beast hunting in Medieval Europe and because its Gary Oldman... C'mon. The film was dark enough to make it interesting but their need to keep it in the PG13 bracket made it suffer in serious creative restraint.

Yes they're right, this is sort of a teen twilight version of the classic fairytale, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is all bad. Some people with knowing that will purposefully stray far away from this movie and never want anything to do with it, but I honestly think that's a mistake because it does get better as it goes along. When the movie first started, I really didn't think it would be all that good, The acting was just kind of so-so and the visuals were lackluster. The visuals though was one thing that didn't improve as the movie went along, The visuals just simply aren't that good, the special effects look hokey at times and the scenery shots look kind of fake. In the beginning, like I said, the acting really isn't that good, but I do think that it improves towards the middle and the end of the movie. It's my opinion that Amanda Seyfried was the right choice to star as Valerie in the movie, and I also liked the casting of Virginia Madsen is Valerie's mother. I didn't like the choice of Gary Oldman, he just seemed way too over-the-top and really cheesy, his character was a whole lot like a cartoon, and not in a good way. Shiloh Fernandez is actually really good in this movie and I thought he was the perfect choice for his character, he has just the right amount of charming good looks and acting chops to play the part. Max irons does a pretty good job with the role of Henry. To me, the first 25% of the movie was pretty bad but the other 75% progressively got better and I was very entertained by the end of it. Yes, there are some parts where the writing is kind of cheesy and could be better, so with all these factors considered, both the good and the bad, I'd say red riding hood is a solid 7."

At times during the movie, I thought that some of the dramatic scenes would increase with depth and draw me in. Each time these moments would deflate as quickly as a balloon released from a person's hand without tying a knot to hold in the air. Choice of most of the actors was very weak.

        "review_detailed_main": "I just decided to watch this film despite so many bad reviews because I liked the idea of a modern telling of Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe first thing I noticed as the film started was some very nice cinematography. Then some pretty bad acting. Followed by some impressive wooden houses in a village that looks really nice even though it is also obviously a set.\n\nThe female director also directed Twilight and comparisons have been made. Yes, it does have that Twilight 'teenagery' feel to it but not as much as Twilight because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to stomach this film, never-mind enjoy it (which I did).\n\nThis film reminded me more of something Joss Whedon might do. I really love Buffy, Angel and Joss Whedon stuff in general, but you have to admit that the budget was not the highest and the acting was not always amazing.\n\nThe pace of this film is good though. It never gets boring and I don't agree that it was trying to do too many things at once. Why is it that if a film has more than one storyline or is not completely linear, American audiences complain? Are you really that thick? Sorry brothers from another mother, but the first Mission Impossible was brilliant BECAUSE it was complicated and it was criticised for its strength. Mission Impossible 2 was rubbish, and yet it was a box office smash.\n\nI don't get you guys some times.\n\nIf producer Leonardo DiCaprio had picked some better actors to be in this film, I would have given it an 8 out of 10.\n\nAs it is, I can't say it is bad enough for a 6 so it scrapes a 7.\n\nReally it should be 6 and three quarters of something daft like that because the low budget doesn't excuse that 'plastic' feeling when it comes to sets and acting ability.\n\nThere are enough people out there in the world who want to make it in the acting world that all the handsome actors out there can't be as bad as Shiloh Fernandez who plays Peter, the twilight-style love interest for Red Riding Hood aka Valerie (sorry mate. got nothing against you personally but maybe acting isn't your thing? But then again, acting wasn't Arnold Schwarzenegger's thing either and it got him a place as Governor of California. Your name is cool if that helps).\n\nMax Irons as Henry, Valerie's mother and father, and all of Valerie's friends in the village don't do a very good job either.\n\nAmanda Seyfried does pretty okay as Valerie, Gary Oldman does well with the role he has, but I found Julie Christie as the Grandmother to be the most engrossing. She was really good to watch.\n\nThe important thing is that I did get past the bad acting (we managed to survive Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter) and did start to get sucked into the story ...\n\nWho is the wolf? What is going on here? The ending was also obvious enough that my mum would have worked it out in the first half an hour, but clever enough that I thought 'of course' but never got it.\n\nThere is a review here from 12 March 2011 by M Smith that I read and agree with. This is not a modern bedtime fairy tale telling of Red Riding Hood. This is a really interesting modern telling of a traditional folktale."

Well either that or Catherine Hardwicke can only make a certain style of movie because style wise they are very similar. The opening is actually almost identical with overhead forest shots and a girl's voice-over. The CGI wolf is identical, the filming location was also the same which didn't help matters and then we have Billy Burke AKA \"Charlie\" as the Dad.\n\nI did get wrapped up in this though, following a young medieval girl who falls for an orphaned woodcutter even though her parents have arranged for her to marry another boy, her sister has just been killed and a wolf is stalking the village. The love triangle was suitably angsty and the mystery of \"who\" the wolf is going to be was well done (I didn't at all suspect that outcome). Unfortunately the flashbacky way of explaining things was kinda lame.\n\nSome of the cinematography is beautiful here, the contrast of Valarie's red cape billowing in the white snow, the cool look of Grandma's house (I want to live there). I did have a bit of an issue with the fact that its continually snowing yet nobody seems to feel the cold and dresses in t-shirty type clothes. A decent cast here too including Gary Oldman as the werewolf hunter, Lukas Haas, Virginia Madsen and of course Amanda Seyfried as Valarie. 12/17/14\n\nBurnaby B.C plays some medieval folksy town where snow isn't cold."

I expected a film more in the vain of Sleepy Hollow, something stylish and exciting with suspense, intensity, tremendous atmosphere, however a loose interpretation of the source. The film was, indeed, stylish. Hardwicke has a great eye for cinematography, Red Riding Hood is mostly beautifully shot. I was distracted by the mainly shaking sequences, but that might be more to do with the fact that I am fighting a head cold and they made me sick. The costumes and sets are beautiful as well (though you'll note that their \"snow\" is just white sand), and has brilliant lighting. All in all, it is a very solid film from a technical aspect, which is why I gave it so high a rating. The performances were adequate, and most of the cast is terribly wasted. The biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. I firmly believe that this film was Hardwicke trying to prove she can do more than Twilight, but found herself trapped by the same teen romance melodrama that gave her the stigma to begin with. There is little suspense, and the resolution is anticlimactic, tepid, and boasting all the drama of a rerun of Scooby-Doo."

        "review_detailed_main": "'RED RIDING HOOD': Two Stars (Out of Five)\n\nThe first in an upcoming Hollywood trend of dark re-imaginings to children's fairy tales (there are three 'Snow White' films in the works). This one is a very loose adaptation of 'Little Red Riding Hood' (and it bars very little resemblance to the actual fairy tale). It's more so inspired by the books 'The Uses of Enchantment' by author Bruno Bettelheim in which he uses Freudian psychology to analyze fairy tales. It's directed by Catherine Hardwicke, who is most well known for directing the first 'TWILIGHT' film but also directed 'THIRTEEN', 'LORDS OF DOGTOWN' and 'THE NATIVITY STORY' (which were all much better films). Here she falls even further from her former grace by producing more teen angst dribble. The film is written, very poorly, by David Johnson and stars Amanda Seyfried.\n\nThe movie's set in the medieval village of Daggerhorn, where townspeople are haunted by a viscous werewolf that lives in the woods. Seyfried plays Valerie, a young woman who's arranged to marry a blacksmith's son, Henry (Max Irons), in order to pay off the debt of her father, Cesaire (Billy Burke, who also co-starred in Hardwicke's 'TWILIGHT' as the father of the heroine). Of course she's torn between two bad acting pretty boys and is in love with a woodcutter named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Valerie and Peter plan to run off with each other but their plans are halted when Valerie's sister is murdered by the werewolf. A well known hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), arrives in town with several followers and locks it down. He's had experience dealing with werewolves and wreaks religious havoc on the town while trying to kill the deadly beast.\n\nSeyfried is good in the lead role, Burke isn't bad as usual and Oldman really hams it up as the movie's villain. There's also a nice supporting turn from the legendary Julie Christie as Valerie's grandmother. The rest of the cast is pretty bad, especially the two leading men who also have no chemistry with Seyfried. The dialogue is mostly nauseating, the directing is pretty poor and for the most part it looks and feels like a 'Lifetime' TV movie.. The cinematography is decent though and the film has a nice creepy mood to it at times. The werewolf scenes aren't bad and it's definitely better at it's horror elements than the 'TWILIGHT' movies but for the most part it's just more of the same. Hardwicke can do so much better than this 'sell out' crap.\n\nWatch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko"

What many of the lower reviews are saying is definitely true. Being that the story of Little Red originated as one of the twisted Grimm fairytales, a dark and suspenseful live action portrayal loaded with A-list actors has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, Hardwicke tried too hard to recreate the success she had with Twilight and capitalize off of the werewolf-packed love triangle story, turning this film into more of a cliche teen drama than anything else. Regardless, the cinematography was well done, and the actors sold the story well with the material they were given. I still enjoyed watching it and I love the soundtrack. This will probably only remain in my once-a-decade watch list when there's nothing better to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Right, this movie had an interesting trailer back in the day before it was released, though I never got around to watching it before the following year. And with good reason, I might add, now that I have seen the movie.\n\nIt was an interesting enough take on the classic Red Riding Hood tale, but of course in the wake of the crapfest that is \"Twilight\", they just had to mix in that particular teenage lovefest element, didn't they? And I am sure that it went straight home if you are a little teenage girl dreaming about big, dark, and dangerous creatures that look like a human, but quite aren't human. But for the rest of us, the ones that have developed just a hint of common sense, then this movie was sort of a slap in the face.\n\nVisually, the movie was great. I enjoyed the costumes and the village that they had built. But then they destroyed it all by adding pseudo-techno music as the score to the movie. What the... Seriously? Couldn't they have chosen something more suitable for the period in which the movie was supposed to take place. Having a 13th or 14th century settlement shown while pseudo-techno was blasting through the speakers just didn't really go hand-in-hand.\n\nAnd while we are on topics that didn't work well. What was the deal with the character Peter's hair? Everyone else had hairstyles that looked proper for the time in which the story was told, but Peter had 21st Century hairstyle that so obviously was kept upright with hair gel. It was a fail of epic proportions. But of course, why not cash in on that horrible phenomena that is known as \"Twilight\" and have someone run around with hair similar to that Edward Cullen guy? It was just horrible to look at.\n\nStory-wise, then \"Red Riding Hood\" actually did it well enough. It was a good take on the classic tale, and they had managed to incorporate the tale well into a more dark and sinister storyline. It worked out well enough, and the story was helped along by some adequate acting performances. Of course, most noticeably here, was Gary Oldman. There were some great moments throughout the story and it was interesting. I liked the fact that they managed to keep you guessing at who was the werewolf, that was a nice part on the director's side. And when it finally was revealed, it was actually a good moment as clarity was suddenly illuminating the story.\n\nOne thing that I didn't really enjoy was the werewolf. Sure it moved nicely enough, but it was kept too much in the dark. When I watch a movie, especially a movie that has any kind of monsters in it, I want to see the creatures and the monsters. I don't just want to sit and watch it draped in darkness and shadows, getting only outlines or hints of what it is. That is just fooling the viewers and keeping us lead around by the nose.\n\n\"Red Riding Hood\" had potential but it failed greatly to appeal to a mature audience. This is a teenage love-romance movie with a twist of darkness and wickedness to it. Great if you like stuff such as \"Twilight\", but not all that great for us proper movie aficionados. What would have been interesting would be having Tim Burton put his unique artistic touch to this tale."

The \"wolf\" is nothing special, and we are not treated to any transformation, merely a shaggy beast that does little to frighten. The plot is formulaic, which I somewhat expected, but without some back-story to explain its origin, or some philosophical discourse about the beast that resides in the souls of each of us, the movie merely plods along as a \"who done it\". There is no connection between the characters to make one concerned for their plight, the dialogue is without depth, and the general styling of the movie is underwhelming. That being said, the movie is OK, but seemed more like the typical sci-fi channel fair, which is fine if the budget and one's expectations are low. My suggestion, wait until it makes its way to network TV and save your money for something of value."

The role of Valerie could have been played by a better actress, one who's better looking for a start. The beginning starts off with a slow pace which quickens as the movie goes on, but is never slick and speedy, the expected pace of a horror movie. The story line is not very interesting and the settings are a bit simple, and when the wolf attacks not many people panic (signs of bad acting) and when the wolf kills people it shows us them with barely a mark on them, so it's all very unrealistic. The mood of the movie isn't dark and gritting enough to make it as enchanting and enjoyable as any of the Twilight movies, and my opinion this movie is not worth spending a lot of money on. I was excited at first when the wolf showed up, as I was expecting large amounts of drama as shown in Twilight, but I was left disappointed. It actually made me happy when the movie finished! I might watch this movie again sometime with one of my friends who has never seen it, but probably not out of intention."

The motion sickness factor for this movie is WAY too high! I literally left the theater before 1/2 way thru and got sick. There should be warning on movies that use this kind of camera motion before we pay our money!! Otherwise I think the movie would have been fine - the content was OK - the actors OK... No Oscar nominations! The lead boys could have been cuter and more of a love triangle going. I did not get to see the end and would love a play by play of the parts I missed but I guess I will have to talk to someone who has seen the whole thing. Sorry the motion was so bad that I could not have gotten my monies worth!"

Alcohol may produce better behaviors.\n\nThe setting is a medieval village in the woods. A girl named Valerie stands out from the crowd because she wears a bright red cape and because she is played by Amanda Seyfried. Right across her is Peter, the hunky wood chopper. His face appears to be stuck in a state of no emotion. Even when he's really mad, we can't feel a single thing. I think it's a talent.\n\nPeter is like a less pale and less sparkly version of Edward Cullen, whose hair is so perfectly in place we begin to think real hard as to where he got his hair care merchandises. In a scene where Valerie and Peter are about to part ways, Peter steps backwards real slow, making sure that she gets a good look at his pretty face. Why Valerie, what vain men you have.\n\nRead more here: http://localmoviereview.com/red-riding-hood/"

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Red Riding Hood",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's almost inevitable for many to link this to Twilight just because director Catherine Hardwicke is at the helm, and the story having elements of a love triangle coupled with the presence of a werewolf - yes the big bad wolf has evolved from being Big Bad to hulking proportions seen in the Twilight films, but don't let this unwarranted association detract you from what would be quite an adult retelling of this aged old story done in stylized terms and dripping with plenty of sensuality.\n\nThe largest credit here will go to the story as re-imagined by David Johnson, crafting something that would appeal to the Twilight generation weaned on a love story with some supernatural elements that many fantasy films of late would have aspired to be, but failed. It's kept relatively simple with the basic character set up of Red Riding Hood, her family, the grandma out in the woods, the wolf and the woodcutter saviour, but updated for the modern audience in quite intelligent, engaging terms, putting together an intriguing guess who mystery with tragic twists.\n\nAmanda Seyfield may have progressed to more adult fare in Atom Egoyan's Chloe, but here retained some girlish innocence with quite the bold, rebellious streak hidden underneath her Valerie's virginal demeanour, forming a long friendship that blossomed into a relationship with woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). But alas her family in wanting her to have a better life, betrothed her to blacksmith Henry (Max Irons), whom she is dead set against in marrying. In what would be like taking a leaf from M Night Shayamalan's The Village or Christophe Gans' Brotherhood of the Wolf, the community here is plagued by a werewolf problem, where 20 years of sacrificing animals for a truce have come to naught when Valerie's sister is found murdered, thus sparking off the villager's proactive hunt for the werewolf, coupled with help from the outside coming from Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), and his posse who seem to have abandoned from the Crusades.\n\nThough limited, this film does boast some nicely designed set action pieces in many large scaled battles, where Gary Oldman was at his element in wielding his character's unorthodox brand of justified punishment techniques, and being that self appointed voice in the name of religion to impose his will and style on the villagers. Once again the statement of hypocrisy reared its ugly head as a theme here. The production sets were gorgeous and so were the many costumes, with the crimson cloak and hood making a very striking appearance in stark contrast to the colour schemes around it, leading to very aesthetically pleasing scenes thanks to its picturesque environments and cinematography.\n\nMuch has been said about Shiloh Fernandez who is better known as the Edward Reject, but I suppose stardom came late for this star whose good looks here will probably earn him a lot of fans given his alpha-male role. Max Irons too didn't let his lineage down, providing that ample, conflicted fodder for competition. Ah, the choices that a girl has to make to swear allegiance to one camp only. Additional supporting roles from Virginia Madsen, Billy Burke, Julie Christie, Lukas Haas and others all add to the fun in allowing the audience to partake in the deduction of the mystery in the film, which turned out, to me at least, quite the surprise thanks to the many inherent red herrings and suggestions which are more than likely to throw you off track.\n\nLike the reboot of Star Trek, Red Riding Hood is that surprise package in being able to find some common ground and believable rationale to tell the story the way it had to, coupled with recognizable elements from the classic so as not to alienate fans or abandoning what made it stand out altogether. The soundtrack of the film is to die for in my opinion, and I can't get the tunes out of my head, enough to go look for the soundtrack to experience the sensuousness all over again. My, what big features this film had indeed. Recommended!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Who doesn't know the classic fairy tale of Red Riding Hood? Now, it must be said that even if there are people that haven't heard of that story it doesn't matter too much \u2013 The story of the film bears very little resemblance to the original fairy tale. Or perhaps you could say that in this version the original has been very considerably 'fleshed out'.\n\nThe premise for this is actually rather pleasant, it takes the Red Riding Hood story and kind of twists it around a bit. In this version the town Red Riding Hood (Valerie) lives in a village that has been cursed with a werewolf for two generations. For the last few years the town has been able to appease the beast by offering it livestock during the full moon. Then a young women is killed and then the town goes on the hunt.\n\nReading that paragraph it sounds that this should be a good entertaining movie, but it falls horribly short of that. This one is what i would like to call a miss-shot! It had a lot of potential and the re-write of the classic story had many ways to become a good thriller. But somehow it fails to suck you in the story. *spoilers alert*(some may find this as a spoiler) The plot that comes as a surprise (sort of) Due to the attention you'll give the too lover boys you forget there are others suspects who could be the Wolf! *spoilers end*\n\nEven though the identity from the werewolf is kept in mystery for a pretty long time, there is not too much suspense or any sensation of danger, anguish or horror. Due to that uncertainty, Red Riding Hood lacks of identity, because it is frightened of being too violent for the teenage girls, and it does not entirely delivered to the romance in order not to drive away to fans of horror cinema either. The result is that the film fails in every aspect. Otherwise, while I like the idea of reinterpreting tradition fairy stories in darker films, this movie is a chaotic mess. It simply doesn't know what to be or how to be it. I would have loved to like it, but it is a couple of hours of tedious nonsense with a thread of \"Guess who is the werewolf?\" running through it.\n\nA still from Red Riding Hood Concerning the actors, especially the younger cast, beautiful as they might have been their acting was most lacking, with the exception of Amanda of course, who delivered the role of Valerie spot on. she's the perfect Red Riding Hood: sweet, goth, dark and just perfectly beautiful! Shiloh Fernandez, who plays her love interest Peter, looks continually perplexed by everything, almost as though he is trying hard to remember his lines. Max Irons as Henry, the man Valerie is betrothed to doesn't impress as well. Let's put it this way when you're out acted by a computer generated wolf there is something wrong. However, the senior cast did not disappoint. Julie Christie perfectly cast as Grandma. Billy Burke is great as the drunkard Cesaire. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always, however, his character Father Solomon feels too lightweight. He should have been let off the leash and allowed to take the character to the edge of madness. More should have been made of the men he brought with him to fight the beast but they are generally glossed over.\n\nNevertheless, the filming style and the way the town is depicted is beautiful. The cinematography is enchanting. There is also a twilight- esque feel to the relationship triangle characters as the movie is directed by the same director. The rawness of the soundtrack works to good effect, helping to create a fraught atmosphere.\n\nOverall, not terrible, but deeply flawed and over-ambitious. Teenagers may find the movie pretty good. I rate it 4.5 out of 10 for being beautiful and mind-blowing cinematography."

        "review_detailed_main": "This Red Riding Hood is based loosely on the original fable with parallels able to be drawn from it. We have a girl wearing red, a grandmother who lives in the woods and of course a wolf. The girl, Valerie, (Amanda Seyfried) lives in a small village in the mountains that is cursed by the presence of a werewolf. There has long been an understanding between the villagers and the wolf whereby they leave out their best livestock every full moon and in return the wolf does not harm them. However on this particular full moon a girl is found dead and the villagers seek revenge.\n\nA reputable priest (Gary Oldman) who has slain werewolfs before for other villages is called in to try and rid them of their curse. He is ruthless and will stop at nothing to see daemons rid from the Earth. While these events are unfolding there is also a love triangle developing with Valerie. She is engaged to be married to a reputable man (Max Irons) but longs for the tradesman woodcutter (Shiloh Fernandez) who she often goes to visit in the woods.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily class this as an out and out horror, I suppose it can have its moments but apart from some suspense and shadows there isn't a lot to get you jumping out of your boots. If you liked the Twilight saga on screen then I can see you liking this as well with Catherine Hardwicke giving this production a similar feel to that of her previous work. She has also, like Twilight picked relative unknowns to act the main roles- Oldman aside and I'm sure they will be popping up again and again over the next few years.\n\nThe most impressive thing about this movie is the set and backgrounds which are beautifully designed, especially the thorny trees that surround the village and 'grandmother's house'. Unfortunately that is the only thing I can think of at the moment that would make me want to see any part of this movie again and that's not enough.\n\nIt also becomes quite predictable and despite keeping me thinking for a short while, it's increasingly obvious who the werewolf is by the end.\n\nSo in conclusion, I found this to be another below par movie that doesn't offer up any real surprises or intrigue. I would not recommend going out and paying for this and even when it hits the TV's it will not be hard to find something better on.\n\nFor further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so somebody had the great idea of turning the classic Red Riding Hood fairytale into a movie squarely aimed at the TWILIGHT crowd (the two movies even share a director). The resultant mess is a film that focuses on soppy romance and safe, PG-13 rated thrills and spills as the inhabitants of a medieval village find themselves at the mercy of a vicious werewolf.\n\nDearie me, this is woeful indeed and a film that just doesn't gel. It's apparent that the scriptwriter really struggled at turning a one-page tale into a feature-length screenplay; the actual Red Riding Hood story doesn't appear until twenty minutes before the end and when it does it feels like the whole preceding running time is entirely superfluous.\n\nIt doesn't help that the characters are twee and one-dimensional and that the film plays safe by Hollywood standards throughout. It's entirely sanitised, never too scary or nasty, instead trying to please everyone and pleasing nobody in the process. By the time the CGI werewolf shows up I was entirely bored, and the whole whodunit aspect of the narrative is a complete non-starter.\n\nCast-wise, the simpering Amanda Seyfried is fairly irritating in a goody-two-shoes performance (just like MAMMA MIA!), and Shiloh Fernandez's love interest is lacking. Max Irons gives an entirely wooden performance and reveals that he's inherited none of his father's talent, and veteran performers like Virginia Madsen and Julie Christie are relegated to nothing roles. The only one I liked was Luke Haas, and he's barely in it. At least Gary Oldman gets into the spirit of the thing, with flashes of his glory psycho days at times. Anyway, as expected, this is a mess and a film that only teenage girls are sure to enjoy."

        "review_title": "Tepid and unimpressive storytelling, but gorgeously shot",
        "review_detailed_main": "In Catherine Hardwicke's \"Red Riding Hood\", the tone goes darkly dreamy. Not that the fairy tale it's based on doesn't already have its fair share of undertones but the whiff of sexual earnestness gets angsty and its facade as a hip re-imagining of its innocuous source material gets revealed for what it is: \"Twilight\" in full-on werewolf mode. With a sexy soundtrack of Fever Ray punctuating rolls in the hay and make-out sessions, the film looks firmly onto a teenage audience to fill its coffers given how weak-kneed it is to actually confront any semblance of true horror.\n\nNeil Jordan's 1984 re-telling of the fairy tale, \"The Company of Wolves\" approaches the psycho-sexual themes inherent in the material to better and haunting measure. And who can forget the truly unique and energetically fervent \"Freeway\" in which Kiefer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon play the wolf and Little Red respectively -- how wonderfully crafted that film was in bringing into a modern world, showing how reworking it into a contemporary context isn't just all fluff. And you get a sense that \"Red Riding Hood\" initially attempted this sort of deep introspective look into the mythology and the foreboding milieu of a town deep within an enveloping wilderness but just loses itself in adhering to a formula of teenage love triangles, familial discords and shirtless hunks glistening in the moonlight.\n\nIn the medieval fantasy village of Daggerhorn, sacrifices of pigs and livestock are made each full moon to appease the werewolf that prowls the woods surrounding them. But when a young woman is killed, the men of the village decide to rebel, heading up onto a cave they believe the werewolf dwells and bringing home a wolf's head on a pike. Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), an expert werewolf slayer and overall puritan evil-hunter, tells them that the werewolf would return to human form when dead. The gorgeously red-lipped Valerie (Amanda Seyfried), sister of the slain woman, steps into the picture as a young woman caught between her betrothed fianc\u00e9, the rich Henry (Max Irons) who her parents want her to marry and the woodcutter (Shiloh Fernandez), who she wants to be with. This burgeoning sexual awakening is short-lived however, when Valerie is given reason to suspect that one of her suitors might just be the werewolf in disguise.\n\nHardwicke juggles treacherously ludicrous red herrings to keep Valerie from finding out the true circumstances and identity of the murderer. She visits her dear demented grandmother (the fabulous Julie Christie) and learns deep dark family secrets, revealing her own connection to the plot. The essential elements of the fairy tale are here but it's a wholly whodunit and wholovesme affair. If there's one thing to be said for the film though, it's how lush and inviting it all looks on the big screen. Despite its many failings as a motion picture, Hardwicke hits the mark on that aspect. She creates a great atmosphere on a sound stage in the village scenes and splices that in with sweeping aerial shots of the breathtaking and isolating wilderness that sets the film up for so much more than it actually is.\n\nThere's a deep dissatisfaction in the film given how polished it looks and how much promise it holds. The lack of gore, sex and true tension is regrettable in how tepid and mediocre its aspirations ended up being but at least there's one thing to be gleaned from this relatively new sub- genre of films and books sexualising dangerous, feral men who survive on blood and flesh is that every girl just wants to be eaten."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was interested in seeing this movie because it had been compared to \"Twilight,\" which I had loved. I was surprised at how much I liked Twilight, movies that are filled with teenage angst don't usually do much for me.\n\nRed Riding Hood's setting is a medieval village which is terrorized by a computer wolf. Really cute little pigs are sacrificed to satisfy his blood lust, but alas, speaking of the sanguine variety, it's a blood moon. And that means humans must die.\n\nIt all seems quite staged, as the villagers go about their daily business, and there is even a village idiot. I'm no medieval expert, but I'm not sure all the costumes were historically accurate, and they were also amazingly clean. Let's not forget, these people lived without running water or any of the other amenities, in dark huts lit by candles, and yet their hair was perfect, their clothing clean with no visible rips or tears. All except Valerie's father. He looked a little rough around the edges, and he was constantly drinking from a flask he carried around with him. I think his name was Cesare, but lets just call him Dad. I was really hoping that the wolf would kill him first.\n\nValerie, our heroine, is a beautiful blond lass, always dressed in blue. Shades of Alice in Wonderland, without the change in costumes. She is portrayed as having the ability to kill, because she has the courage to slit the throat of a cute little bunny at the beginning of the movie. (Alice in Wonderland rears its ugly head again) She is also portrayed as a witch later on in the show, because she understands computer wolf language. The wolf wants her to run away with him. Isn't that romantic? Shades of bestiality people.\n\nI suppose it was compared to Twilight because most of the lead characters were teenagers and two men loved the heroine. Peter, our heroines \"real\" would be lover, bore a resemblance to Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen in the Twilight series). He also bore a resemblance to Johnny Cash, and I didn't find him appealing. Not dangerous enough I guess. Although he tried to be darkly brooding, maybe I just missed the sparkles.\n\nA La Twilight style, another man is in love with our heroine, his name is Henry, and he is at first portrayed as being kind of wimpy. However, he does mature during the film, and becomes likable. In fact, I'm tempted to say he's the real hero of the movie.\n\nEnter Gary Oldman, as some sort of religious figure with dubious intentions. He brings with him an entourage of people, and a big iron elephant. People address him as \"Your Eminence.\" Later in the show, the iron elephant is used as a sort of burning pit, similar to the Brazen Bull, a torture device used in Greek and Roman times. Talk about a copy cat, although I don't imagine most people seeing the burning scenes would be familiar with this piece of history. No, the elephant was meant to be an original and horrifying part of the action. FAIL, at least for me.\n\nI liked the set design and the colouring in the movie. The brightest colour is the red cloak given to Valerie by her grandmother (Candice Bergen, a glamorous grandmother for the middle ages). The cloak's colour stands out in the forest and snow.\n\nAnyway, his Eminence says that the wolf lives in the village and that it could be anyone, thus setting the scene for some good old fashioned witch hunts.\n\nNo spoilers in this write up folks, you can read this and go see the movie without actually knowing the ending. I must admit to being surprised at who the wolf turned out to be, when in human form.\n\nRating: Watch it at home, on your big screen TV."

        "review_detailed_main": "I keep reading that tons of people are upset with Hardwicke and/or David Johnson for turning a sweet fairy tale into a horror movie. When in reality such stories as Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Hansel and Gretel, Sleeping Beauty etc were all horror stories that were written to scare people and warn them of the dangers of the world.\n\nTo the people who are mad at Hardwicke and/or Johnson for Red Riding Hood, I say read a book once in awhile! Don't blame Hardwicke or Johnson, blame Disney for sugar coating some incredibly gruesome tales and amazing works of literature!\n\nBesides that...I liked Red Riding Hood. B-\n\nWhile the story was slow at times and there were a lot of unnecessary character development and side stories, it was overall good. The numerous side stories/characters could have been in place to confuse the viewer and make you second guess who the wolf was so if that was the purpose then job well done.\n\nVisually the movie was great but sadly I think that if they made this rated R we could have seen more gore and actually explored the wolf nature a bit better to scare you like it was meant to. Unfortunately Hollywood has decided to make more movies that are PG-13 so that they can allow a wider group of people to see a film which will make them more money.\n\nSuspense was great and it kept me guessing and trying to figure out who the wolf was. While not all of the actors were marvelous in their roles most of the main cast was great. There were some incredibly cheesy lines and moments that were unnecessary for the story.\n\nI enjoyed Amanda Seyfried's performance, I thought she did a fantastic job! I did like both of Amanda's opposites Shiloh Fernandez (Peter) and Max Irons (Henry) they were the right guys, visually, for the characters but I feel that Shiloh tried to hard to be mysterious and Max didn't try at all, he was forgettable. They both could have done a better performance, I've seen Shiloh in a couple other movies and he's a great actor but I think he wasn't comfortable in this role.\n\nI definitely recommend seeing Red Riding Hood at least once, especially if you think Fairy Tales were meant to be sweet!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is one of those films that my wife got me to watch and I should have known it would not be as horrific as the description made it out to be. What we basically get here is a Twilight style take on a Brother Grimm fairy tale; albeit, with much better actors than in the Twilight series. I thought it could have been really good had they focused a bit more on the horror aspects of the film and less on which dude red riding hood was going to end up with in the end. Then there is all the obvious characters that one thinks will be the wolf, but you know in your heart of hearts it will not be anyone too obvious so it can be a surprise!\n\nThe story has a young girl and boy capture a bunny and they are always hanging out until they get older and the girl is betrothed to a man who is from a more wealthy family, but who can tell as everyone looks pretty poor in town. Well, a wolf comes and kills the girl's sister and this sets people out to kill the wolf though the local priest has summoned someone who is particularly skilled in killing werewolves. They kill a wolf and considering the thing has been terrorizing the countryside for decades anyone can figure out it could not have been so easy. Even the expert says no, but the people say yes and celebrate until the wolf kills in sight of everyone. The girl finds she has a connection with the wolf as the expert uses more and more horrific methods to try and lure the wolf out into the open.\n\nThe film would have been so much better if it had more blood and killing and less, \"I love you!\" going on. Thankfully, Gary Oldman does a good job as the expert, but I did not like the direction that took, making him a bad guy. I thought it unnecessary and the film would have been better with some sort of ending that had the wolf battle him rather than what we did get.\n\nSo, I like aspects of this one as I enjoyed the look of the village and the atmosphere was good too, but then Peter, the girl's love interest would show up and totally destroy the look of the village as he looked like some teen in one of those WB teen dramas. Even his outfit did for crying out loud! They should have just stuck to a killer wolf, make it dark and run red with blood, but around the time of the release of this film, Twilight was still big so a lot of film's took this wimpy route. Once again though, at least the acting was better than the Twilight series."

From writer David Johnson (Orphan) and director Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen, Lords of Dogtown) comes this chillingly unpredictable spin on the classic children's tale. Set in a small, medieval village that is plagued by a werewolf, a young woman, Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is torn between two men: Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), a woodcutter she has been in love with since childhood, much to her parents displeasure, and Henry (Max Irons), the wealthy welder her parents have arranged for her to marry. Not wanting to separate, Valerie and Peter plan to runaway together until getting word that the prowling werewolf has killed her sister. Seeking revenge, a famed werewolf hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), is called in only to deliver the villagers some unexpected bad news... the werewolf takes human form by day and it could be any one of them. From start to finish, Hardwicke takes you on this gripping, carefully crafted and well-written ride that leaves even the smartest of audience detectives baffled as you just cannot peg who the werewolf is, even if you think you know. Along with the incredible leading players, a well respected supporting cast that includes Virginia Marsden, Billy Burke and Julie Christie, all take you on these unsuspected twists and turns that inevitably leave you suspicious of everyone... only to have your jaw drop when the conclusion is reached."

However, Valerie grew up with Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), and she has been in love with him most of her life. They are planning on running away together, when her sister is killed by the wolf that has been terrorizing the village. For many years, the wolf has not attacked the village people as long as they provide him food on a full moon. But under a blood red moon, the wolf has now killed a human. The villagers have had enough of this wolf, and they band together to hunt him down and kill it. They are not successful, so they call in Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), because this is no ordinary wolf. Father Solomon warns the people that this wolf takes human form by day, and the wolf could be one of them.\n\n(My Comments) Everyone knows the fairy tale story of Little Red Riding Hood and the big bad wolf. Well, this is not it. The writers have turned that story into a modern werewolf story to capture the teenage audience, who seem to love werewolves. If you saw the movie trailers, you would think this was a scary movie. I don't think you will jump out of your seat once. The acting was below average, and the special effects of the wolf were marginal at best. The only mystery or surprise of the movie that was held to the end was the person who was the werewolf. But by that point I didn't care; actually, by that time, I wanted the werewolf to kill the main cast and end the movie. The actual ending was anti-climatic. If you see this movie, you are most likely to leave the theater disappointed. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 1:40, PG-13) (3/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Red Riding Hood (2011) follows a woman who falls in love with a mysterious man, all while a werewolf terrorises the village they live in. I'm struggling to put my thoughts about this movie into words, it isn't terrible but just feels so bland and has nothing interesting about it apart from the cinematography.\n\nIt really is a shame that the film is so dull, because it can be very visually pretty at times! I liked the colour schemes and the setting is quite beautiful. However, the lighting is very unimaginative and some of the CGI is super goofy which distracted me from the cinematography.\n\nThe soundtrack is very unfitting and feels weirdly out of place all throughout the film. The score also isn't special and there just isn't much to say about it. The sound design is decent, but once again, nothing memorable. The sound as a whole just shows how forgettable the film is.\n\nThe acting is very poor and so distracting, I ended up not caring about what happened to the characters purely because they're all so dull, which isn't helped by the poor dialogue too. Also, this film has a weird love triangle reminiscent of Twilight. None of the characters have any chemistry though and the relationships just feel unrealistic.\n\nThe film is very dull and not very engaging, and the story isn't compelling enough to keep my attention. It also lacks scary, tense or emotional moments so the film really doesn't hold any kind of weight. I ended up completely losing interest, and the ending feels rushed and is overall just very cheesy."

The fake snow was very obvious, how could the main character just stroll around in a flimsy dress in real life? Even the music doesn't really work. The climax is borderline comical and the less said about the love Triangle cliche the better. Our main character also does almost nothing the whole movie looking back. One to avoid for sure."

This film gave me the same feelings I got when I watched M Knight Shalamans The Village and Lady in the water etc, the feeling I get from all his films, and I do love all his films...I know a lot of people don't like lady in the water or the village or the happening, but I liked them all.\n\nAnyways I guess all I can say is just try the film for yourself and ignore the reviews, I started ignoring the reviews years ago...if I listened to reviews I wouldn't have gone and watched Battle Las Angelas other week, which I thought was amazing by the way.\n\nThats all I've got to say, I give the film (red riding hood) 7.5/10, I cant give it higher because its not as good as avatar/district 8/star wars/inception haha.\n\nScott Kelly, Leeds, England, X"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was totally expecting this movie to be every bit as awful as the Twilight films/books that clearly inspired it. I wanted to hate this just as much as I hate that other franchise, so it is with significant reluctance that I have to admit that, ultimately, it's not that bad. In fact, it's pretty darn good. The premise certainly solid, a Gothic horror re-imagining of the Little Red Riding Hood as a werewolf story. This has been done many times before, most notably in the film The Company of Wolves by Neil Jordan, so it's a proved idea. And while Company of Wolves is an excellent film, it's also one that doesn't follow a conventional narrative structure. The visuals of the film are striking, though the sound stage sets couldn't possibly be more obvious. Everything about the sets look too bright, too colorful, to pristine, to planned and staged, which takes some of the credibility away from the medieval village setting. Sometimes you can even see where the floor of the studio meets the wall that they've added a matte painting onto in post production. But despite this, after some time it becomes sort of quaint, as if you're watching a stage performance, which may just have been the director's intent. The characters are fairly bland archetypes, but unlike that other franchise, Amanda Seyfried at least has some acting talent and the two young men pining after her are generally likable. I've heard a lot of complaints about the CG werewolf, but I thought it was as good as a CG wolf can possibly get and definitely better than the ones in Twilight. Most importantly, the romance is not the only plot driving the movie, and the mystery of who the werewolf is actually takes center stage and manages to remain compelling until the big reveal. Overall, it's certainly not as good as it could have been, but so much better than I had expected it to be."

It is no more the average young folk tale, but now a love story sweeping into the hearts of many individuals. The basics include Red (Valerie), Grandmother, wolf, child hood beau (Peter) and the almost mistake (Henry).\n\nThe movie comes with great expectations of a thrilling ride through Red's story with a twist from director, Catherine Hardwicke. The shots were filmed wonderfully with a set laid in a medieval forest village. The costumes made beautifully, clear casting but bad execution of acting.\n\nThe story takes of soaring from the lush mountains in the background following Red's masculine tracks. Red's activeness gives the audience a challenge compared to the old passive Red we've heard from the old folk tale, this comes in handy through the movie. Red must keep her stance in order to find out who the wolf \"haunting' the village for some time.\n\nThe general execution follows most teenagers' deceptional thoughts. Remembering the directors past films, such as \"Twilight\", Red Riding Hood comes out more gruesome then the Brothers Grimm."

It's very \"young adult romance-y\", but that should be expected from the description/cover art/etc. Worth watching, but probably not the best if there's higher rated ones you're also interested in.\n\nRed Riding Hood was pretty decent and probably lives on the higher end of a 5/10. I'm glad I watched it, but it's not amazing.\n\nThey do a really good job with the general visuals and an alright job with the werewolf. Everything feels very stylized and engaging to look at and that made it nice to watch. Amanda Seyfried looks great in role with the giant red cloak, though the writing is lacking so she's not very exciting.\n\nIt has a medium-mystery feel. They don't give you enough clues to feel like you're \"solving\" it, but it's interesting enough to keep you involved.\n\nThe acting was fine, but the whole thing was *very* 'teenage romance'. That isn't my thing, but I expected it from the description and box art, so it's not losing any points for that and if you're really into that you might like this a lot more. It loses steam to a pretty lame final act, but it's not awful.\n\nOverall, I think it did everything good enough to be enjoyable, but not good enough to feel like it was great. There are some unfulfilling characters that feel *almost* there, some logic issues, and not particularly exciting action."

Just some clever camera work and a sound-track for 14 years old... which might very well be the target audience. The ending is the most boring and idiotic of all the movies I've seen these past years (and that includes Battlefield LA).

        "review_detailed_main": "A few years ago, a series of films for teenagers and young adults emerged from traditional fables and tales, giving us new stories full of adventure, action and CGI. It was a fashion that gave us blockbusters like \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" (2012), \"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\" (2013), \"Dracula Untold\" (2014) and others. Some were more successful, others quickly fell by the wayside and there is not much to talk about them now, ten years later. This is one of the movies that ended up being forgotten.\n\nThe film's problem begins when director Catherine Hardwicke decided to try to reissue the huge success she achieved, years before, with the \"Twilight\" franchise, based on the timeless story of Little Red Riding Hood: nothing easier than making the innocent and disobedient girl from the classic story in a hot-blooded teenager who, against her family's will, lives a burning passion with a boy from the same village, a village we don't know where it is but is isolated in the middle of a dense forest where a werewolf lives. And we have the elements for a story that appeals to young people, full of action, fights, suspense and, of course, sexual appeals that just don't go any further because it's a film for young people.\n\nTo talk about the cast, we first have to talk about something that usually bothers me a lot whenever I see a period film: the anachronistic errors. Assuming that cinema is a field of entertainment, I try to be reasonable with this, but I value a film that respects the past. There are mistakes that can be forgiven: the wrong kind of weapon, food that didn't exist at the time... but it's harder to forgive if the entire cast decides to behave like they're in the 21st century. Unfortunately, that's what happens here, and it adds to the bad material and the bad dialogues given to the characters.\n\nAmanda Seyfried is beautiful, and the film knows how to explore the attributes of the actress. However, she is a 21st century girl dressed in medieval clothes. Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons don't even try to look medieval, and Lukas Haas could be anything but a priest. Even stranger is to see Gary Oldman give life to a hybrid character, who mixes a witch hunter and a fanatical inquisitor with a Catholic bishop, in purple robes and a pectoral cross, who only lacks the miter, the crosier and the cape! There are good actresses (Virginia Madsen, Julie Christie) with characters who are totally insipid and uninteresting. The inclusion of black actors is a sign of their racial integration, but the Middle Ages were not politically correct and nothing helps me to understand what they do in the middle of medieval Central Europe, retrograde and isolated from people coming from so far away. It was a casting mistake that the script doesn't even bother to explain. For what?\n\nIt is in the technical aspects that the film finds some redeeming elements: the cinematography is truly good and makes good use of elements such as fire, the flickering candlelight, the shadows of a rustic house, a misty and gloomy forest environment. The sets and even the costumes fulfill their role well, even though the director's lack of concern with the chronology has given rise to a mixture of bad taste of medieval elements from various periods and different moments (remember that the Middle Ages lasted practically a thousand years). The action and fight scenes work and help to give the film some movement, they fit more into the context of the film than that brief attempt at a sex scene by Seyfried in the straw, which will only serve to keep the boys looking at her cleavage. The CGI, and especially the wolf, is somewhat disappointing and the soundtrack sucks."

The werewolf has been kept appeased by being offered livestock as a sacrifice.\n\nHowever when Valerie's sister is killed by the werewolf. Father Solomons (Gary Oldman) turns up as a werewolf expert. He thinks someone in the village is a werewolf, he even hunts witches as well.\n\nWhen Valerie discovers she can talk to a wolf one night, she is accused of witchcraft and tied up to burn. Will Peter the woodcutter the man she loves be able to save her? Why does she keep having strange dreams about her grandmother?\n\nThis is a pretty campy and tepid film.

In a realistic-I'm-the-kid-who-told-others-that-Santa-is-not-real-skeptic way I had several issues with the film.\n\nStripping the controversies down to the bone, the nostalgic approach awakened memories of the famous fairytale itself, although the concept of the film was slightly different. I was surprised to draw some certain parallels between the film and the fairytale itself, however, coming to the plot of the film, the elements of the fairytale didn't come together when used in the film, being completely out of place and time. Like someone tried to glue two watermelons to a broomstick.\n\nSpeaking of fairytale elements not making it in the film and expanding the thought, the main issue I have with the film is I felt that it just stole the idea of the story and then, to avoid accusations of plagiarism, it tried to take a bit more adult-like approach to the story adding a clich\u00e9d love triangle, the everlastingly self-contradicting religious matter, some typical village lifestyle episodes and a bit of this and a bit of that...\n\nUnfortunately, in this frenzy of add the story loses itself completely. I wasn't sure in the end which line to follow because the film tried to depict too many major plots at the same time. It could have done with only a half of what was in it, assuming it had been executed with professionalism.\n\nThe other main issue with the film was indeed the obvious lack of passion, desire and acknowledgment of what was being done. The script was poor and uncreative, most of the dialogues were strongly clich\u00e9d and at some point I was just embarrassed myself to be listening to those. What is more, I was waiting anxiously to see the film for the actors as well because the names were promising. Unfortunately they weren't given much to work with, especially considering what a mess this film is. The actors looked great, and beautiful Amanda Seyfried surprised me with her essence. However, I'm sorry to admit that she, and many others, were wasted in that film.\n\nThe village at nighttime was mysteriously romantic (this is the little dark-loving witch speaking in me). The fog on the water was sweetly eerie. Some camera angles were fascinating. But the most beautiful asset of the film was definitely the wolf. I would go anywhere with that creature.\n\n5/10. For each of the positive thing I brought out and one extra for the wolf."

The film starts as the denizens of a a picturesque village in the mountains are going through their merry way of every day life. Little do they know that their pleasant life is about to be disturbed quite badly, but soon they will come to realize that life will never be the same again.\n\nTrailered as a modern retelling of the fairy tale this one comes out well enough - the twist they make to the story isn't all together bad (but a little full of the standard clich\u00e9s that make up for too many films). It would have worked out rather well I think, if it hadn't been for the fact that many of the players either don't really fit in their roles or don't play them well enough. This makes the film feel fractured and at points even irritating.\n\nThe filming style and the way the town is depicted is nice - even though some of the houses are all too clearly the effect of CGI. The music is not disturbing and adds effects where needed. All in all, it should have been a fair deal better.\n\n5 out of 10 hoods coloured red"

I felt as if they ran out of steam at the end. But it was a fun film. It kept me guessing all the way, and truthfully, I never guessed correctly. I do feel like it lacked a certain oomph. Somehow I was expecting the wolf would be someone more exciting. BUT the storyline all makes sense, and in the end you do see how it all fits together. It was a fun twist on an old story. Perhaps it should have been marketed for a less gruesome seeking audience. This is not a spooky movie, unless you are 10."

I'm not saying that this is as bad as bad as Batman and Robin, but too be honest its not too far off it. The one thing I really hate about this movie is that it is so unoriginal. It's like Cluedo and Twilight had a baby that grew up and started wearing a big red cape on its back. I mean seriously:A girl who lives in a small ,very isolated town and has absolutely nothing special about her is caught in the middle of a love-triangle, and she is willing to run away from this so called 'European' town where everybody except Gary Oldman has an American accent, just to be with on e a these guys.Oh yeah and there's a werewolf involved .Sound familiar? As far as visual effects go, its pretty good. Acting was overall up to the standards of tired toddlers . But I must admit, there are some very clever twists and turns that you probably won't see coming. Overall,this movie was pretty rubbish.Unless your a Twilight fan girl.Then its probably the best movie you've ever seen. I hope for the sake of your sanity,that it's not."

If not the acting, I can appreciate or enjoy the scenery, music, or something.\n\nBut there is nothing enjoyable about this film. It is truly one of the worst things I have ever seen on screen. The acting is laughable, the plot is ridiculous, and there is nothing memorable about the film's scenery or score. The movie also seems to suffer from something of an identity crisis- it can't decide if it's a horror film, a supernatural thriller, or a romantic teen drama.\n\nI like Amanda Seyfried just fine, but she is just not a good enough actress to carry a leading role in a film. Not even the lead in this film which, to be perfectly honest, doesn't require her to do much other than widen her eyes. In my opinion, she is better in smaller, supporting roles and that is what she should stick to.\n\nEven renowned actors like Gary Oldman and Julie Christie cannot save this movie. In fact, why either of them would agree to be in a movie like this is beyond me. Maybe they really needed the money at the time, I don't know.\n\nI saw this movie when it came out in theaters, and it was a regrettable waste of money and time. I advise anyone who happens to catch this movie on TV not to waste their time with this film by watching it. You will regret it."

Plenty of personal interaction to make you like the characters (or not), a setting that should tickle the fancy of any fairy tale fan, and enough mystery to keep you guessing right till the end. Not many movies these days can manage that, but this one did.\n\nWe have some bigger name actors doing their usual great work, and some lesser known names filling in their roles very nicely. Madsen, Burke and Haas all deliver, without taking away from the story by making themselves the center of attention, and Oldman does a convincing job of a crusading slayer of evil creatures.\n\nThe set is perfect, with just the right touch of \"magical\" needed in a fairy tale, without going overboard. Thatched roofs, narrow twisting streets, and snowy forested hillsides all add up for a beautiful yet eerie setting; just what we want for a fairy tale.\n\nThe writing and directing combined to give us a more grown-up look at an old classic story, without the usual Hollywood errors of depending on overdone special effects and too much fake blood. Red Riding Hood isn't supposed to be a gore fest, but a head game. We all know the classic tale, and the fun is in the mystery and the surprise. What we end up with is a classic \"who done it\" from a well loved story, and it's quite enjoyable.\n\nIf you want a gore fest, or a lot of sex, this isn't your movie, but if you want something fun, a twist on a classic, sit back and enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was pretty bad overall. Here is a bullet point list in no particular order:\n\n1. Acting: Terrible! There seemed to be no actual connection/chemistry between any of the characters. Trying to think of a single actor that did even remotely decent in this movie - I cant.\n\n2. To many \"suspects\": The movie focused heavily on the eyes of people to give the illusion that that particular person was the enemy and was trying WAY to hard to give other false impressions throughout (if you watch it's easy to pick up on). It's one thing to keep people guessing with plot twists, but this tactic seemed like a cheap trick that was overly used.\n\n3. Little (or big) details: Normally when it's snowing, or there is snow on the ground through the entire movie that means it's cold right? You wouldn't know it was cold because no one, and I mean no one is dressed for the cold ever! The movie didn't even go out of it's way to make peoples breathe be seen. This might not be a big deal for some, but if you're going for cold, at least make everyone act and look the part.\n\n4. Nod's to the original story: I literally almost turned the movie off at a couple of points because the cameo's of originality were completely cheesy and off.\n\nHere come the two positives but not redeeming enough qualities to be above a 4.\n\n5. Village: The setting was decent actually. Set in what I would guess is the 1800's? Not sure. The village was deep in the woods and was decorated fairly well. It looks like most of the budget went into the village and not much else.\n\n6. Plot twist: I wasn't paying much attention because the movie wasn't catching it but the plot twist of WHO was actually the werewolf genuinely caught me off guard a bit. From that point there is a bit more that goes into the plot that I certainly didn't think would materialize. Pity, because if the rest of the movie had been good leading up to that then it would have been totally worth it."

It's mostly because it takes a classic story and puts all these ridiculous elements in it. We get this stupid love triangle that doesn't seem to really amount to anything. There's at least some references to the original story.\n\nThe plot is that this village that sacrifices to a werewolf is now being attacked by it. I'm probably being kind to this movie only because I saw that horrendous \"Daddy Day Camp\" and really anything would be better than that. At least this movie didn't cover itself in bodily fluids. It's still boring and poorly acted and obviously just made to cash in on the success of \"Twilight\". I think Leonard Maltin said it best when he said it answered questions about Little Red Riding Hood that no one wanted to have answered. It's just another dumb pointless romantic movie with laughable romance. *1/2"

If the film was not enjoyed, I assure you it is not because of past projects! Hardwicke is not the first director to use actors they love over and over again in their films (talkin about you, Whedon & Tarantino), and Red Riding Hood is certainly not the first film about a girl who has two guys vying for her affection, (not to mention, Hardwicke did not right it, so lay off). Twilight happened guys, get over it.\n\nOn to Red Riding Hood - Phenomenal.\n\nWhat I love about Catherine Hardwicke is the way she uses the camera. Her films are just beautiful, and in this period piece, that is amped up to full potential. The film rises and falls with intensity and soft intimate scenes. Seyfried has such an expressive face and commands the screen every second that she is on it. The story is, yes, a teen love story - watcher be warned. Don't take it too seriously, there's love, there's conflict, but there is also a brilliant twist and interesting side story! The beginning was so innocent and by the end our world has totally been rocked out of control.\n\nI highly recommend this movie - do not listen to negative reviews, maybe wait for it to hit Red Box, but give Red Riding Hood a shot - in my extremely critical opinion they've earned it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Whoever thought of putting modern twists on classic fairy tales was very clever, and this film is no exception. Although directed by the same director as the awful \"Twilight\", Red Riding Hood has the potential to be considered a great movie. Our story begins with a young girl named Valerie who lives in the village of Daggerhorn. Every month, on the full moon, the villagers set out a pig or some kind of livestock out for the werewolf that has been peacefully living around. Then one day, the wolf breaks the rules, killing Valerie's older sister, Lucie, leaving the village angry and fearful. Valerie is betrothed to a man named Henry, but is in love with another named Peter. Throughout the movie, you find Valerie trying to find out the truth behind the wolf, even thinking that her own friends and family are possible suspects. When the villagers are visited by the infamous Father Solomon, he warns them that the wolf can take human form during the day. The movie is based loosely on the fairytale of Little Red Riding Hood; the main character even sports the famous red hood and tells her grandmother \"What big eyes you have,\" to which the grandmother replies, \"The better to see you with, my dear,\" but brings in more of a supernatural feel to it by turning the ordinary wolf into a beast that is part human. The best part about this movie is that it is an edge-of-your-seat suspense; Red Riding Hood is filled with action and romance. It hooks the audience's interest from the very beginning and continues to do so throughout the entirety of the film in conclusion, leaving you wanting more. My personal interest of the movie is that it is breathtaking, the views of the mountains in the background, the forbidden love story between two characters, and of course the non-magical, yet somehow magical retelling of the wonderful fairytale. This movie, along with the book/movie \"Beastly\" by Alex Flinn and the movie \"The Brothers' Grimm\" brings out the child in older teenagers and adults who still enjoy the occasional fairytale story. It gives you an idea of how creative Hollywood can be once given the proper equipment. In conclusion, this is a must-see film for all who enjoy a little bit of suspense mixed with romance and action."

It was meant as a cautionary tale for adults about strangers and trust and the darker impulses of humans. This film clearly goes along those lines and follows the original story quite well.\n\nNow about the visuals - everyone is right to say that the scenery is beautiful, but also people seem to miss the point about the visual of the town. This film might set in a medieval town, but it obviously and on purpose has a modern twist. Therefore this film is never meant to show how people would act, live or dress and they really would have in those times- it's called creative imagination people!

This movie's directing was beautiful. Overall, this movie is really thrilling!"

I wish I would have seen more shots of her in the snow just looking in the distance so I could admire the mother natures miracle that Amanda is."

        "review_title": "bad reviews... or NOT",
        "review_detailed_main": "Well I can see that this movie got a lot of bad reviews, a lot of Twilight \"spoof\" reviews, and a lot of bad criticism. Actually, I can tell you this: it's by far better, wiser, and moodier than the retard reset/retelling of the vampire-werewolf myths found in Twilight. I've read Dracula when I was about 13-14 years old. I've read Frankenstein around the same age. Well, i've been read Little Red Riding Hood when I was 5 or 6 years old, and I remember I bugged my parents a lot about \"Why?\". Why the wolf went for grandma? Why the woodcutter came along (altough in Romanian translation that was a hunter)? Why did he came to grandma's and why did he found that both Little Red Riding Hood and grandma were in the stomach of the wolf... Why did he put a stone in the stomach of the wolf after cutting him open? Of course, at the time my parents got frustrated by my questioning and sent me to bed letting a lot of lingering questions in my head. Time has passed, and by my college years I got the chance of reading some interesting analysis of Grimm's stories. Murder, cannibalism, etc. are quite consistent throughout their works. And for those who don't know it yet, yes, the Grimm's were not \"writers\" but merely collectors of old German myths and stories originating in the \"dark ages\", somewhere between 15th-17th century a.d. Those were not the \"Disney\" stories children of the '90 grow up with. They were \"get spooked\" by the tavern/fire stories, they were oral versions altered with each re-telling of myths, unexplained and out of the ordinary fears of the common people: the woodcutters, the farmers, the lowest and poorest of the citizens. The Grimm's didn't collected stories about queens and nobility, and royalty. Actually people used the upper classes characters for some of their myth's (daughter of the king) 'cause they gave a feeling of comfort first (even the richer have problems), but even more important 'cause such persons were out of the reach and possibility of confirmation for most of the auditorium. Anyway, I've seen the so much praised Twilight. Well, it's a movie for brainwashed teenagers. It lacks consistency, it lacks realism and beside it's somehow good music it lacks almost everything. Every second watching it feels like an assault on my intellect. Not judging by the new trend of \"daylight vampire walkers\" (and yes i saw and enjoyed Blade) I can tell you this: every scene of Twilight it's so much romantically exaggerated that it made me want to puke and comment on the unrealism of every word spoken by the characters/actors. Even \"Titanic\" is less romantic than Twilight, and after seeing the later I find the first admissible.\n\nThose being told, let's get back to issue at hand. Myths, especially oral myths change with each retelling. And, if from the original (my country, my culture, my myth) Romanian \"Flyer\" myth, Bram Stroker derived Dracula and the world got the vampire myth, then maybe somewhere around the history my beloved countryman the vampire got the ability to day walk. Watching Little Red Riding Hood was a revelation. It translated the childish story into a coherent \"you get your answers\" story. It kept the original \"script\" intact and yet it delivered a mythical creature, that would make it a \"spooky by the fire story\" people would try to pass on orally when they lack the means to write it down. Wolfs were pretty common in Germany of the 15th century (and feared I might add) and although I am pretty sure the initial happening was of some poor old woman and girl getting eaten by one (or miraculously getting saved) the film was awesome. It delivered. And given the fact that the ulfhednar was an ancient Germanic tribe type of warrior I wouldn't be surprised if initially even the Grimm brothers thought about a werewolf when they collected the story... That's something to take into consideration... The film might just be the most consistent with the initial story retelling and the Grimm's might just got it wrong in the first place.\n\nI give it a 9 of 10. I would go for 8 (due to some cheesy moments and undoubtedly XXI century electrical music) but the \"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in\" line just deserves another point.\n\nThank you for reading."

        "review_title": "A tremendously underrated film",
        "review_detailed_main": "After reading (MANY) negative reviews, I went in to see this movie expecting it to be a mediocre flop. It's anything but.\n\nHowever, it's not without its (really) bad points. Let's get them out of the way before we move on.\n\nFirst, there's no doubt that some of the acting is TERRIBLE. I cringed whenever Max Irons came on screen; he didn't even have that much to say and still managed to do a crap job (I know I'm not the only one who laughed when he threatened to kill Peter). Shiloh Fernandez was slightly better but not by much; Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman were really all that held the script together.\n\nSecondly, the script was mediocre to above average at best and could have done with more intelligent dialogue to complement the awesome plot (a little humor never hurt anyone).\n\nThe healthy appearance of the village & villagers ticked me off. Call me a perfectionist, but I've seen far too many medieval-era movies to believe that the people in this movie are naturally squeaky- clean, their hair perfectly styled and coiffed (I'm looking at you, Valer- no, wait, that's everyone), have a vast array of colorful clothes, etc. This is a SECLUDED village in a forest in the MIDDLE ages. These people do NOT live in luxury. They deal with filth and grime every day while toiling their ass off to make bread for their family. NOBODY looked the part, and I kept getting disappointed whenever someone came out of a fight with nary a smear of dirt on their face.\n\nA point about Gary Oldman. His character started off as a bad-ass werewolf hunter but swiftly deteriorated into a crazy old man with \"the end justifies the means\" practically stamped across his forehead. Despite the death he deserved (sigh, Hollywood. How you've brainwashed your audience to WANT the death of a human life) I was sorry to see him go.\n\n***\n\nOn to the good stuff!\n\nThe end twist is fantastic, simply brilliant! I never suspected who the real culprit was even though I'll probably see the hints when I do a re- watch (in which I will skip all the parts Max Irons is in).\n\nI also immensely enjoyed the scenery. The helicopter flyover shots of the forest are mesmerizing (this is the ONLY similarity to Twilight). The village scenes are back-lit in such a way that create a fairytale- like atmosphere which was initially distracting, but eventually I came to appreciate the blend of colors - and after all, the story IS based on a fairytale.\n\nIn addition, the couple I was rooting for get together. I'm a sucker for romance and I was glad some people in this movie got a happy ending after so much fear and sadness. Hollywood is by no means over the happy ending clich\u00e9, but lately I've noticed that it tends to be bittersweet, which although not completely satisfying is more realistic.\n\nI LOVED the soundtrack, and although on their own I probably wouldn't enjoy them as much, the songs work brilliantly in the movie. I didn't even notice them while watching, too busy focusing on the scene being emphasized. Great choices, and my only criticism might be when the villagers are \"celebrating\" the death of the werewolf. The eerie song had me thinking that the dancing and reveling was more suited in another movie with weird cult rituals.\n\nAs aforementioned, \"the end justifies the means\". I was intrigued how the movie brought up the ethics of this issue. How far is enough before you stop? Apparently, when revenge is meted out and Gary Oldman gets a taste of his medicine when he's bitten by the wolf and killed by his henchman (satisfying, but bloodthirsty, Hollywood. Bloodthirsty.)\n\nAll in all, Red Riding Hood is a great modern retelling of the fairytale it's based on. Even after a day I'm still thinking about it and recommending it to my friends. I'm sad to say most people over the age of thirty wouldn't enjoy this, because despite how much I liked it, in the end it all comes down to it being a teenage mock-horror movie. However, if you're willing to forgive a bit of terrible acting, then go ahead and watch it. Be warned though: you're going to have to forgive Max Irons a LOT."

I watched this film yesterday and I feel that this is one of the best films I have seen. It's not meant to be a film that jumps from all sorts of various sets, it's just a more adult, modern version of the original story and as people know thats not all full of action! Seyfried (Valerie) is a very good actress who plays Red really well! You would never guess who the werewolf is and this film keeps you on your toes throughout the entire length of it allowing the audience to suspect all kinds of the cast, it allows you to be misled I would never have guessed the ending.\n\nTherefore I would really recommend this film to anyone and think people should watch this film and give it a chance rather than judge it because of some bad reviews :)"

Her performance in Red Riding Hood was nothing short of amazing. Julie Christie was an amazing choice for the role of Valerie's grandmother! She was so sweet but yet so mysterious. Now, when I think Gary Oldman, I think of kindhearted, protecting Inspector Gordon from Batman. In Red Riding Hood, he was cold hearted, demeaning and a superbly complicated, intricate, supernatural hunter named Father Solomon. Max Irons & Shiloh Fernandez totally pulled of the whole \"She's Mine and YouCan't Have Her\" thing. Kudos to all the aforementioned actors & actresses who pulled of AMAZING performances with an okay script. The movie's visual effects left nothing to be desired. The sets were particularly interesting, very intricate in detail and very believable. {I especially liked Grandmother's house!} The animation of the Werewolf was striking and yet still subtle... I absolutely loved the choice of tree for the woods surrounding the Town & Grandmothers house, they were beautiful in a menacing sort of way. I think this movie is well worth the price of a movie ticket. Its a film that can stand on it's own without being compared to Twilight! Seriously give up your preconceived ideas on how this movie should measure up to Twilight and just sit back, relax & enjoy and enjoy the show!!"

She lives in a medieval village, and she is torn between two men: her parents had promised her hand to the wealthy blacksmith's son Henry, but she really loves the woodcutter Peter. What to do? Peter and Valerie were just about to run away together when a werewolf began terrorizing the village, and a witch-hunter known as Father Solomon was called on to track the wolf down. Well, that's all I could tell you, folks. You will have to see the film for yourself to see how it ends.\n\nSo anyway, that is all I could talk about, and I really love this film."

Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons have done great job too.. Lukas Haas have done good performance. Well if I compare Red Riding Hood with Twilight then must say that there is something missing. There is one thing which i could not understand is that Valerie doubt on peter and she hurt her childhood love with Knife as she knew that whatever happens Peter can't hurt her..

        "review_detailed_main": "In the movie Red Riding Hood a girl living in a town haunted by a werewolf falls in love with a woodcutter although she is supposed to be with someone else. The movie is set deep in the woods in a medieval village. Usually the werewolf doesn't attack the villagers but one day he attacks the sister of Valerie, the protagonist, and kills her. Fear spreads far and the werewolf hunter Solomon gets called for help. Valerie the pretty girl, learns that the werewolf might be someone she loves. The movie is written by David Johnson and produced by Catherine Hardwicke in 2011. My rating for this movie is an eight and a half. The movie keeps you in suspense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's a horror movie and I admit that there were times where even I freaked for a second. I would recommend it to others who like mystery movies but don't get scared easily. Red Riding Hood is well structured not giving away the main point of the story until the end and then you realize that during the whole movie there were always scenes that helped form a picture that in the end was the answer. So my opinion is that this movie is a very good movie and I encourage anyone to watch it."

Let's face it, Hollywood doesn't know what to do with itself\u0085\u0085\u0085 witness the constant remakes and horrendous comedies that come out of there. And, now they are going after Fairy Tales. Didn't they see that The Brothers Grimm bombed? Apparently not.\n\n(Okay, why then did you watch this?) I wanted to see who was the Werewolf, of course. (Did you guess?) No, I was completely fooled.\n\n(Well, what did you like?)\n\nI liked the red cape. Need to get one for someone I know. I'm sure I'll find it somewhere online. I liked the CGI when the Werewolf made his appearance, however, those scenes went by too fast to be sure you didn't really see too much, still it was okay. I did like the celebratory music when the townspeople thought the Werewolf was killed and they could breathe easier. Kind of catchy. (Anything else?) No, that was about it.\n\nThe acting performances were.....um okay, except for Gary Oldman when he had to address (as the character Fr. Solomon) the town folk. He is very good when he doesn't have to raise his voice, but when he has to do that he's lost if it's not in anger. Seemed too forced and out of place with an almost German accent.\n\nWas kind of disappointed in the cinematography as I expected more than what seemed like still photos in black and white. What an opportunity for some really good landscape scenery; hey, they are in the woods with big trees, mountains all over the place and snow on the ground. Didn't happen to my satisfaction.\n\nThere were some references to the original fairy tale (while Valerie \u2013 Seyfried -- was in a dream state): Why grandma what big eyes you have, what big teeth you have and so on.\n\nThis was watchable, but if I wasn't held to find out who the Werewolf was, I wouldn't have bothered. Still, I do like that red cape\u0085\u0085..with a hood too.\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

They casted a perfect RED who is mesmerizing and slowly unraveling her past. She is not your typical female victim which is refreshing. Gary Olmin is also casted perfectly in this role. He doesn't pick duds. I was able to keep watching without having my husband guess the plot, which is a rarity. This doesn't end until the lights go on. This movie proves you can still make a great action, thriller, horror, romantic movie without outlandish sex scenes and realistic violence. One of my top picks."

It does contain a bit of the lines form the nursery story, but overall, its just totally new. The twilight saga does come in mind during many moments but that's OKAY since now all the werewolf movies will remind you of that.\n\nThe village is being haunted by a werewolf. Father Solomon comes to its rescue but not before The Red Riding Hood (Amanda Seyfried) loses her elder sister to the wolf. Just like Twilight, there is a love triangle but this time, there is no vampire :-).\n\nA must watch for a change in the all-romantic movie season."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not innovative because it was similar to the fairy tale. The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were interesting, well-developed and some of them were likeable. The casting was nice and their performances were descent. I have to admit, it was a kinda creepy movie and there were some predictable jumpscares. The killcount of the movie wasn't bloody and most death scenes were done off-screen. At least, it was an intense movie and there were some action-filled moments. The opening scene was predictable, but it was nice. The ending reveal was kinda predictable, but it wasn't as shocking as I had expected. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both great. By the way, the werewolf's appearance was kinda terrifying and I wish he had more screening time. Overall, \"Red Riding Hood\" was an enjoyable film, kinda intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This artistic masterpiece is unfortunately undervalued. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. Entertainment does not know its worth, and due to their lack of interest in it, it has become obscure. This artistic masterpiece must be revived again. Warner Bros. Entertainment must do this, just as 20th Century Fox did when it released two improved releases of the Titanic movie in 2003 and 2012. Who would believe that a movie released in 1997 is now available in 4K quality and 3D technology?! Warner Bros. Entertainment must re-release the movie trailer in 4K quality as a first step to correct its course, and launch a new strong marketing campaign for the Red Riding Hood movie, just as it launched a strong marketing campaign for the Barbie movie that does not deserve it. They should do this for the movie that deserves it, not the opposite. Essentially, the reason for the lack of fame of the Red Riding Hood movie was the failure of Warner Bros. Entertainment in its marketing campaign for the movie, as it was a very weak campaign, in addition to its excessive pursuit of the PG-13 age rating instead of accepting its R-rating, which led to changing the ending for the PG-13 rated cut. The reason was not the movie itself or the director Catherine Hardwicke. In fact, Catherine Hardwicke directed the movie in an unimaginable way, especially in the unrated original cut of the movie known as the Alternate Cut. The existence of a rated cut without additional terms such as (Alternate Cut) does not necessarily mean that it is the original cut. In fact, the original cut is the one that was not modified to fit the PG-13 age rating. The original cut is the one that was released as is without modifications. The original cut is the one that the MPAA did unrate, so you always find the word Unrated next to it. The original cut is the Alternate Cut, and it was not named Director's Cut because Warner Bros. Entertainment changed the ending of the PG-13 rated cut to fit the PG-13 age rating. Therefore, it is no longer possible to name the original cut as Director's Cut, as this title does not include the change in the ending. Therefore, they had to name the original cut as the Alternate Cut to include the change in the ending. As you know, production companies do not like the R-rating because it narrows the audience range, which reduces revenues. Therefore, Warner Bros. Entertainment pressured Catherine Hardwicke to modify the movie to be released with a PG-13 age rating instead of an R-rating. This explains why the ending was changed in the rated cut compared to the unrated original cut. In my opinion, both cuts are successful artistic masterpieces, but the original cut is more artistically successful, and I loved it more. My rating for the rated cut (modified) is 9/10, and my rating for the unrated original cut (Alternate Cut) is 10/10. It is the best and greatest of all time in presenting the story of Red Riding Hood, and no movie surpasses it in presenting this story. Thank you, Catherine Hardwicke, for this artistic masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a nice update on the \"Little Red Riding Hood\" fairie tale. Instead of a wolf terrorising the local village we have a werewolf. This adds the dimension of mystery to the tale for who could be the dreaded werewolf. The writer David Leslie Johnson and director Catherine Hardwicke do a fantastic job of playing people off people and putting them into situations where you can never quite figure out who the killer is. This makes for quite an enjoyable movie which the audience can have a stake in; there's not many of those around today.\n\nI also liked the fact that the writer and director kept the story in the faerie tale spirit. The setting of the Ye Olde Village is brilliant, it gives a close knitted community that, pretty much, lives in each other's pockets. So when it's revealed by Solomon, played by Gary Oldman, that the beast could be one of them a personal fear and distrust of neighbours starts to spread. There is something very haunting about the village and the surrounding forest as it stands upon a bed of snow, which constantly falls from the overcast sky. All of this just adds layers upon layers to the film making it stronger.\n\nOn the whole, I loved this film, though there are a few drawbacks which made it drop a few points.\n\nI don't understand why Oldman tried to do a German / Bavarian accent as the rest of the cast didn't bother. The worst of it was, his accent kept slipping and this became annoying.\n\nMost of the cast were excellent in their parts giving believable performances. Though there were times when both Max Irons, who played Henry, and Julie Christie, as Grandmother, came across as lacking in substance... sometimes Henry just looked doped up... and Grandmother was as wooden as her luxurious forest home.\n\nThen there was the music at the celebration of the killing of the beast. We heard modern rhythms and instruments (especially synthesisers) when the musicians were playing horns and drums. Also, the dance we see between Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) and her friend Prudence (Kacey Rohl) wouldn't be out of place in today's nightclubs... but probably not for a religious community.\n\nLastly, the main sections of the story that people know and love - \"Oh Grandma, what big eyes you have\" and the wolf in grandma's clothing. These are taken as two separate scenes, which I can understand, though they appear to have been thrown into the story and film and this is a waste as they are pivotal to the original story and should have been used better to draw the audience further into the tale. I hate waste and this was an extreme waste of a good idea.\n\nThis is a beautifully written, shot, and acted film that I would recommend to all as there are elements of mystery, thriller, horror, and fantasy, as well as a pretty decent love story. Worth a watch at least once."

However, several reviews persuaded me to give the movie a shot.\n\nI had low expectations for this movie ever since I first saw the trailer, because it was yet another werewolf movie.\n\nSurprisingly, Red Riding Hood kept me entertained. There are most definitely flaws and awkward points, but the plot and the neatness of the quality and graphics made up for it. The acting in this movie did not seem very dull or unacceptable to me; the lines were spoken to keep the mood.\n\nRed Riding Hood should not be compared to Twilight because of its director. I personally did not like Twilight the movie, except for the scenes with \"action\".\n\nThis film may not have been excellent, but it appeared to be quite enjoyable."

Or make it more like a horror/ drama.\n\nIt does remind me of twilight, but the love stories are not to bad. Great looking guys as well. I did enjoy the movie. Part two is a must. But this time, needs more action and better story line. But All In all it was a good movie.\n\nPART 2 Please !"

Nothing special in the story nor in the performance delivered by most of the cast, but certanly better than what Disney offers us nowadays. A twisty plot, a love triangle, an otherworldly beast and lot of potential for a tv series are some of the main topic developed with this movie, and I think it's not that bad.\n\nAmanda Seyfried gives the best performance here, one of the few to really believe in the project, but lacks of chemistry with her main costars, while Billy Burke reprises his role as the thorned dad of the heroin previously held in the Twilight Saga.\n\nOverall I must say that, at that time, I would have expected more from everyone and probably I would have rated this 6/10. But, considered the most recent times, I think that this film is really something more that what we are used to watch, so I can easily give it a better rating, I liked it.\n\nFinally, I suggest to take what's the best in here and develop a Tv-series on the same subject, it could be great (maybe for Warner Bros, HBO or the like)"
