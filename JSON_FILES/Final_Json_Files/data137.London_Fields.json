Some scenes looked nice. However...\n\nAs soon as Keith arrives, the film becomes unwatchable. The plot vanishes, the story telling is nothing short of a fiasco, it really does become a self absorbed mess, I applaud you if you see it all the way through.\n\nTheo James by contrast is very good, he's a fine actor, but the damage had been done beyond belief by the time he arrives.\n\nDidn't enjoy it, 3/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Struggling writer Samson Young (Billy Bob Thornton), sleazy darts player Keith Talent (Jim Sturgess), and well dressed man Guy Clinch (Theo James) are in a dive bar when Nicola Six (Amber Heard) walks in dressed in sexy mourning. The clairvoyant femme fatale can see the deaths of people. In that moment, she realizes that she has seen her eventual murderer. She lives above Samson and is a character in the story he's writing.\n\nIt's a disjointed mess. I like a few of the surreal touches but dislike a whole lot more other ones. The Enola Gay makes Guy look stupid or is the writing stupid? Or is the writer's expectations of the audience is too low? At least, the story could be about Bockscar and Fat Man. It just makes the movie stupid overall. Next, Samson Young is an unreliable narrator. He's a sleepy unreliable creator. It makes everything in the movie unreliable. In addition, Amber Heard is nothing but sex. She's an empty character. There is no motivation. She is a figment of Samson's imagination. She is a surreal fake creation of the male libido. She's a sex robot bending to each male's fantasy. Finally, there is Jim Sturgess contorting his face unnaturally beyond camp. It's completely ridiculous. With the darts playing, it reminds me of The Big Lebowski but in a bad way. There is no loveable character. There is no fun. There is no enjoyable quirkiness. This is a mess waiting for the reveal which I don't care about with characters that are not compelling."

She sashays and vamps around valiantly, but cannot pull off the film noir vibe. Heaven only knows what Jim Sturgess thought he was doing. I would like to say he chews up the scenery, but I doubt his crack-head yellowed teeth would be up to the job. Billy Bob Thornton is, well, Billy Bob Thornton, only sleepier than usual. The only high spots are the few appearances by Johnny Depp as a cheerfully villainous Cockney gangster, but he is uncredited in the final product. One can only presume he did not want to be associated with this abomination.\n\nPretentious, badly acted, boring tosh. Total waste of a good book and almost two hours of my life! Awful.

        "review_detailed_main": "Two versions of London Fields are currently playing in theatres. The film most theatres are showing is the producer's cut, but select theatres are showing the director's cut instead.\n\nIt's amazing how two different edits of the same film can make such different movies. Yesterday I saw the producer's cut of London Fields and today I saw the director's cut, and wow THE DIRECTOR'S CUT IS SO MUCH BETTER! Why isn't this one the main cut? Here the bad CGI'ed skies are substituted for tension, mystery, emotion, and a plot that's easier (plus more interesting) to follow; as well as a whole new score and different takes that bring out better performances from the actors. Every emotional beat is so much more powerful, which makes the mystery of who will kill Nicola Six that much more suspenseful and engaging.\n\nTHIS is the version of the film that should be playing everywhere. The producer's cut honestly shouldn't even exist; it just doesn't add anything to the film. It's no wonder the director sued the producers over this. According to him the \"main\" cut released is a cut he hasn't been involved in for over four years.\n\nIf you had any intrest in seeing London Fields I would 100% recommend seeing the director's cut, and if you liked the producer's cut then you'll love this one even more! It's still not a perfect film, but THIS one is more entertaining, engaging, suspensful, and overall just a better film. I really hope both cuts are released on the DVD to compare them even better; I find the whole thing so interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "'London Fields' begins with two fiction writers embarking on an apartment swap. Struggling scribbler Samson Young vacates his squalid Hell's Kitchen den to stay at the opulent Notting Hill residence of successful Mark Asprey, who departs for New York City. The duo's names give the game away - the swap signifies a personality split rather than any geographical re-location. The symbolism of Young's moniker and his home base are fairly obvious while Asprey's initials echo those of London Fields' novelist Martin Amis.\n\nThe film follows Young as he slots seamlessly into Asprey's social milieu. He focuses on documenting the anticipated murder of his upstairs neighbor, a movie star called Nicki Six, who has predicted her own death at the hands of an unknown killer. The prime suspects for this future homicide are a darts player and a city wheeler-dealer - soon to be joined by Young himself. Nicki has affairs with all three, goading them to kill her through jealousy, so that her prediction will prove correct.\n\nThis extravagant plot might be manufactured by Asprey's fevered imagination, but unfortunately the film itself also looks like the product of a mind in disarray. The movie shows the potential dangers of getting a music video director to film the adaptation of a fairly sophisticated narrative - the end-product might be be garish visuals at the expense of characters' personalities and their environment. Compounding the catastrophe, the actors deliver theatrical performances which destroy any chance of taking the proceedings seriously. By the time the climax arrives with its predictable twist, it's hard to believe anybody still cares about the fate of these cornball caricatures."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not going to write much in the defence of London Fields (even though I gave it a 6/10, you'll understand why in the next paragraph) but when I review bad movies, I always start with the positives. I was intrigued by London Fields for around the first 10 minutes. The dialogue by our narrator Samson Young (Billy Bob Thorton) is heavy handed but they know how to setup a mystery. Its obvious that the story will have a different kind of slant to it (both by the beginning flash-forward and the bizarre notes about the current global climate within the story) and it caught my attention. The movie very quickly went off the rails with the introduction of Keith Talent (Jim Sturgess) and Guy Clinch (Theo James) but I have to admit, I was interested for a short period of time. The other note I'll make is that Amber Heard was appropriately cast as Nicola Six and she was trying so hard in this. She couldn't save this train wreck of a movie and I felt bad for her because of how desperate the team behind the camera are to remind you of how hot she is in every single moment she is on screen (I appreciated how beautiful she is but a lot of her steamy scenes border on porn and I doubt she consented to that). I wouldn't define this as an award-worthy performance but when the rest of the cast is so out of whack, she's at least playing in the appropriate area and she fits the part.\n\nSome movies are made for the uninitiated and some are made for the fans. The plot in London Fields must require you to be familiar with the source material because it is so scatterbrained, I don't know if I could have wrapped my mind around it with a second viewing. London is in crisis, people have fled the city, are we offered a detailed explanation why? Nope, just go along with it. Our narrator Samson (a terminally ill writer) is dying of an unspecified illness but he's resigned and almost nonchalant about it. Why is he dying? Why is he okay with it? Never mind that. Why is he interacting with all the fictional characters in his new book? Why is he seen by some and ignored by others? How is Nicola able to see the future? If she's aware of what will happen, why doesn't she try to protect herself? There were answers offered to some of these questions but none were satisfying or made much sense. Compounding on this is the ridiculous dialogue which is okay at best and at worst just awful. I got plenty of laughs from this movie but I don't think any of them were on purpose.\n\nThe supporting cast is either at one end of the spectrum or the other. They're either underplaying it so badly that you can imagine them asking for their lines after every take or they're chewing the scenery with such an over-the-top bravado that it left me howling. On the under-performing side, we have Billy Bob Thorton, Theo James, Jaimie Alexander and Cara Delevigne (who is only in the movie for about 5-10 minutes). Thorton is a good actor when he's committed and while I'm almost certain he was directed to be this way, boredom radiates off his performance. He's sleepwalking through this and I don't think there was much he could do. Theo isn't a terrible actor but he's normally a little bland and this is definitely more of that. On the other side, we have Jim Sturgess, Jason Isaacs and Johnny Depp who are all swinging for the fences. Sturgess is overdoing his character in an epic sense here, I was laughing at him every time he was on screen. Between how ridiculously sleazy his character looks to his mind-blowing delivery, he was hitting Sean Penn from Gangster Squad levels in scenery chewing. We also have Depp in a pretty small role, he's at least fun in his small bits but its a lot like his shtick in Mortdecai where its too cartoony to even be in the same ballpark as reality. We also have Isaacs in voice over, he's so sly and scummy in this that his voice is the embodiment of the cat who ate the canary. There's only 1 other movie that I can think of that features such a wide range of laughable stuff from the cast (I'll be talking about it in the closing paragraph to this review).\n\nI started out laughing, then I slipped into being dumbfounded and by the end, I was a mix of being in awe and snickering under my breath. The twists and character motivations in this movie are so hard to determine even though if you diagrammed the plot, it would be so simple. Through the perspective of Samson, there was a lot of potential to really play with the style the movie was being filmed with (e.g. the movie Limitless where we see the effects of the drug) with Samson drifting in an out of sanity or \"the real world.\" But while the movie isn't without any style, there's very little here that's going to be memorable or that's going to catch your eye. I know the budget was modest but if you don't have the material to carry the movie, do something else that's going to elevate it.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes notes about London Fields paint an accurate picture of how much of a misfire this is. But I couldn't turn away from the screen or even stop giggling at the gigantic mess London Fields is. I think this would make a great so-bonkers-its-good double feature with the 2018 release Terminal. Both feature a stylized attempt at noir with some Guy Ritchie style sprinkled in and they both miss the boat completely. Both feature a gorgeous and talented lead actress who are trying their best but the movie drags them down like anchor tied around their ankles. Both feature a supporting cast that is so all-over-the-place that you can't pin them down as disinterested or way too committed. Lastly, they also both have an ending twist that attempts to shock the viewer and doesn't quite get there (admittedly though Terminal wins this category hands down). Terminal is the better movie but London Heights made me laugh more. I'm sorry that Heard and Depp were fighting constantly while this was going on but London Fields falls into the so-bad-its-entertaining category for me. If I were a real critic and I had to grade this seriously, this is a 3/10 but I'm bumping it up to a 6/10 for the entertainment value I got out of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is so bizarrely constructed and the editing is so bad, one can easily call it The Snowman of 2018.\n\nWhile that failed venture was your standard police procedural made into a woeful example of outsider art through bad luck, this film aims for some near incomprehensible labyrinthine parody of every postmodern thriller made since Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects.\n\nThe closest that can be described to being a serviceable plot is that a slinky sexy woman named Nicola Six (no seriously that's her name) is blorn with the uncanny gift of premonition. And she guesses her murderer upon entering a sleazy London pub and being courted by a series of strange or suspicious characters. In between that, there is a lot of overwrought narration by a bored Billy Bob Thornton; a darts competition; and panoramic shots of what seem to be the Apocalypse.\n\nIf it had an inkling of self-awareness, it may be a spectacular example of stealth trolling pretentious film snobs and industry insiders everywhere. But given that this film stars Amber Heard (the poor man's Nicole Kidman) and rejected leading men like Jim Sturgess and Theo James, that seems unlikely.\n\nAmber Heard is a beautiful sexy looking woman. But she does not yet have the screen presence to convey the aura of mystery or raw sensuality that seasoned pros like Sharon Stone or Angelina Jolie or Diane Lane could have done in their sleep. Theo James is slumming in a post-Divergent paycheck role that leaves nothing worth remembering. The worst offender of the main cast is Jim Sturgess as a gross looking barfly with a preposterous cockney accent and rotting teeth. This guy's performance is so ridiculously over the top that Nicolas Cage would be chastising Sturgess to tone it down.\n\nThe sole bright spot among the main cast is surprisingly enough the most controversial, Johnny Depp. No, seriously, Johnny Depp is in this movie and he's actually pretty good. It also helps that Amber Heard gets naked alot in this so at least there's that.\n\nBut unless you fancy yourself as one of those pretentious hipster schlock enthusiasts (such as myself ;).) I cannot recommend viewers to seriously consider watching this."

The Director's cut is sexy, thought-provoking, surprising, beautifully filmed and full of moments that will pop up in your head in the best way for the next few days. I don't think Amber Heard has ever been captured this beautifully, and this will probably be her best movie, ever. The rest of the cast, especially BBT and Theo James, is great too.\n\nLocation, details, choices of images and where to push makes this more than a movie, it's an excellent piece of art for this time. Finally, the MUSIC is unbelievable. I must get my hands on this album! So beautiful. And if I understand everything correctly, the music (or most of it?) is exclusive to the Director's cut!

JD is his usual weird persona that he's so good at playing.\n\nOverall, a high quality movie, with style, beautiful shots and artistic note. I had fun watching it, and recommend it\n\n7/10"

She is playing a dangerous game, dating a small-time (married) gangster and a wealthy businessman in an effort to con them both. A clairvoyant, she has premonitions of her own death, at the hands of one of the three men she is involved with.\n\nThis film had heaps of potential. The plot is initially very intriguing and the atmosphere is dark and stylish, sort of neo noirish. With the style and the English gangster setting it initially feels like a cross between a Guy Ritchie film and a Frank Miller graphic novel.\n\nHowever, the wheels come off after a while. The plot becomes random and unfocussed. The writer and director add layers of complexity that seem just there for complexity sake as they don't add anything to the movie. Jim Sturgess's performance as Keith Talent is painful to watch: massively over-acted and forced.\n\nThere's enough intrigue to keep you watching but sadly it's all in vain as things don't get much clearer by the end.\n\nUltimately, quite disappointing."

I don't believe it should be getting all these bad reviews, I thought it was amazing! As did everyone else in my theatre. The social media reviews are off the charts and on Rotten Tomatoes it's going to go over 90%. Also there are some really good plot twists that will catch you by surprise. The writing, acting, and editing were all great. Overall its a really cool movie that will put you in a good mood. One of my top Must-Sees for 2018."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't remember the last time I saw a film this disproportionate in terms of the quality of the cast and the poor quality of the film. Make no mistake, 'London Fields' has an amazing cast. Sure Amber Heard in the lead role isn't much of an actress (although she somehow manages to maintain a fair bit of star-power) but outside of her there are great actors everywhere. Even Johnny Depp has a decent amount of screen time. Sadly though these actors aren't even close to being able to save what is one of the worst films I've ever seen.\n\nThe film tries to be a mystery but there are a few problems with that. One is that we the audience simply don't care by the time the conclusion finally rolls around. We have been bored out of our mind for 90 minutes and we simply want the film to end. Secondly, all the characters are basically the exact same person. Which character did the deed makes absolutely no difference to us in any way. Whether is it a, b, c or d through z doesn't alter the film in our eyes one bit.\n\nThen the film tries to impress us with its arty narration. It is trying so hard to be 'Fight Club' by having memorable quotes left, right and centre, but I can assure you none of them land. Instead the narration is just annoying and weird. The film has some of the most bizarrely shot darts scenes as well. We are never told what is actually happening and apparently professional darts players are capable of missing the board entirely? Who knew? 'London Fields' needs to be avoided at all costs. It is an abomination."

I guess that's the biz of showbiz, this movie is bizarre enough for me to believe that they could not find anyone who wanted to distribute it.\n\nThis also explains why Amber Heard and Johnny Depp are in the same movie. In 2015 I think the two were still together. They did not share any scenes in the movie (Maybe they had to reedited so that was the case explaining the long delay of release).\n\nLondon Fields love itself far too much that it's not listening to anyone telling it how dull this is. I will say this, I did not see the ending coming of this mystery because of the oddness of the film, which I can totally respect.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton plays a washed up writer from Hell's kitchen who switches homes with a hot shot writer from London in hopes he can write his next book and he gets and idea when he discovers his next store neighbor, Amber Herd has predicted that someone will kill her and has agreed to let the writer observe to see how it will lay out.\n\nThe film looks beautiful and gets you in the mood of the Murder Mystery. I found it interesting that I could not tell what time period the movie falls under. I think it's a near future, that has better cell phones then we do now, but I'm not sure. Amber Heard does help in the beauty of this film as it's definitely her purpose in the film to play that classic Femme Fatale.\n\nI like Billy Bob Thornton and he was interesting enough, although his narration of the film did not get me into the story. This is true of most of the male cast members including Depp who quirky behavior was just corny. I say don't see it."

And, the narrative is poetic.\n\nIf we're talking about the safe jibing of all losers of our perpetual society, we're treading into new ground with our blanket of love, sensitivity, borrowed wisdom and social security.\n\nMatthew Cullen makes his point by being out rightly judgmental as he interferes strongly towards the final part of the script.

The movie the Godfather had only one producer and that turned out very well. In my humble opinion.

        "review_title": "SEE THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - NOT THE BUTCHERED THEATRICAL VERSION",
        "review_detailed_main": "Up until a few weeks ago, I had no idea about Mathew Cullen's new film, the much discussed, often maligned, and barely-given-a-chance London Fields. I had no clue about the behind the scenes issues (Cullen battled the producers over his final vision with a compromised cut recently getting released in theaters on a semi-wide platform), and regardless of those various problems that the creative parties had with each other while making and finishing the project, I don't care about any of that stuff - I care about the movie in question. So when the opportunity presented itself to view Cullen's personal director's cut, I jumped at the chance. Cullen, founder of the visual effects company Mirada, has a background in commercials and music videos, and got his chance to play with a massive piece of storytelling for his feature debut, and I'll be curious to see what he does next, especially if he gets the chance to make a film and not become entangled in production nightmares.\n\nSo while I can't compare the director's cut to the producer's cut (or the novel which the film is based on), what I can state is that I very much enjoyed watching Cullen's preferred vision of London Fields. It's got a stunning sense of visual craft, with textural compositions that are strikingly bold and frequently eye-blazing, and the film's noir-esque plot of a distressed writer (Billy Bob Thornton) trying to make sense of his reality and the story he's in the midst of writing always remained interesting and unique. It also helps when ultra-eye candy actress Amber Heard is the femme fatale (in more ways than one); ever since Pineapple Express she's remained a most alluring screen presence, and it's clear that Cullen knew what he had on the other end of his viewfinder when he was setting up his mise-en-scene. Throw in a totally bonkers if slightly grating performance by Jim Sturgess and familiar faces like Jason Isaacs, Theo James, Jamie Alexander, Cara Delevinge, and an uncredited (and sorta hilarious) Johnny Depp, and you've got a starry cast that really brought the juice.\n\nGiven that original novelist Martin Amis co-adapted his own book (with Roberta Hanley), I can't imagine that he'd work to sabotage a filmic version of something he initially created, so I'd have to assume that the busy plot of the film follows the exploits of the book to a certain authentic degree. The dialogue is over the top and purposefully rosy, with the actors clearly having fun delivering their lines. Toydrum's musical score is brazen and fully alive at all times, and the sometimes surreal juxtapositions of archival footage mixed in with glossy cinematic artifice keeps the viewer disoriented and wondering what might happen next. Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (Desperado, Jackie Brown, Pan's Labyrinth) really earned his paycheck on this movie - every shot is luscious. The film's credits list a staggering number of producers and production companies who were involved in getting this project to the big-screen. For some, London Fields will exist as a cheap and easy punching bag, but for others who can separate business from art, and if you can see Cullen's director's cut, many will find a very entertaining and conceptually wild movie that's just waiting to be discovered and embraced by a cult audience."

How can a girl like her possibly be sexually interested in a low-life like Keith? Is it because she deliberately set out to drive those men to kill her? Then again, is a woman actually murdered in \"real life\"? Or does the whole thing just take place in a novel? And if so, who is the novelist?\n\nRead the book and watch the film - or watch the film then read the book. Or just watch the film with an open mind, without expecting your standard cinema fare of good guys/girls vs bad guys/girls, requiring no intellectual input from the viewer.\n\nNo spoilers here. The whole point of the film is to get you guessing - and you'll still be doing that after the final credits."

She embodies the blonde bombshell they were going for, but her performance is lackluster.\n\nThe plot... oh the plot. This is where things get messy. Sex, murder, extortion, writing, and darts? With a dash or clairvoyance.\n\nSo the gal walks into a dingy bar in full retro funeral attire (black veil included) and leaves after a few brief interactions. She's trailed by the local handyman who happens to be very good at darts (and owes money to several loan sharks). A handsome upperclass gentleman who inexplicably was also at the dingy bar follows the two and is trailed by the writer for whatever reason.

The acting varies upon the actors and the story is seemingly convoluted and a mess in terms of storyline. It is confusing at first regarding Billy Bob Thornton's character and his narration. It seems more detailed and feels like it tries being smarter than it actually is.\n\nA lot of criticism is about Jim Sturgess' characters. His over the top acting is noticeable as he takes up a lot of the film, pouncing around pulling faces pretending to be cockney. Theo James play the more straightforward yet sensitive likeable character. Thornton seems to be sleep walking as his character appears to be simply a figment of imagination. This wasn't exactly clarified specifically the ending. Amber Heard isn't the strongest actor but she has a great presence on the screen. The hate for her in this film is vastly overblown and most definitely seems to stem from her personal life.\n\nPositives about this film is the cinematography and scenery. The visuals make the film look very stylish and more watchable. However the story of the love triangle drags on at certain points and is somewhat predictable and becomes boring. Somewhat anti climatic and the twist type ending was quite predictable. If one could look past its flaws there is definitely a watchable factor as it's not as bad as many of these reviews claim."

A film that should never have been made. A film that should never have been greenlighted. Or funded. Or distributed. Or seen. Not because it is so bad. Lots of bad films out there. Tens of thousands. But because it is such a waste. Of talent. Of resources. Of theatre space. London Fields is a perfect example. The concept -- a heroine who can forsee her own death, and an amoral writer more than willing to exploit that -- might have worked in more capable hands. But here the audience is the victim, not the fictional character. The creators even managed to take one of the most likable actors in Hollywood, Billy Bob, and make him cringe-worthy. Extraordinary achievement.

I guessed guessed the second half of the story including the end, fairly easily, which means it did not offer anything different from other such genre movies."

It's sad that many people will miss this very entertaining film due to petty reasons.\n\nI'm not picking sides on the personal stuff, because none of us will really know.

Many comical moments that wouldn't be as good if it wasn't for him. Big bravo for this movie."

Alas, it didnt and when i read about what had happened, i realised why.\n\nIt has been classed as one of the worst films ever made and was hardly seen which when you see the huge cast that's in it, is amazing on its own. So bad was it received & reviewed that Amber Heard won a razzie for worst actress. However, that is the \"producers\" cut. However, when i heard that there was a one off screening of the \"directors\" cut in London and that Matthew Cullen & Jim Sturgess were going to be there, i had to go.\n\nYes, its based on a Martin Amis story and is probably the only film you will ever see about love, jealousy, murder & darts but Cullen & Sturgess were here on hand to tell the truth about what actually happened.\n\nThe film ran into huge financial difficulties & the producers decided that they didn't want Cullens original cut but they wanted their own version which went for sensationalism over story, and this is the version that got panned. Most of the actors disowned this version & in the case of Heard, she tried to sue the producers for breach of contract, stating what they had made abused her personally with regard to using body doubles for the extra nudity in this version stating that she did it and this was not what she had signed up for. Apparently this producers cut has images that are offensive to everyone with refs to 9/11 etc. So Cullen financed his own directors cut and im told its completely different from the other version.\n\nI can tell you now, that although its not the greatest film ever made, its a really entertaining film. Heard is a great Femme Fatale, oozing sex appeal, Sturgess is very OTT in his role and Johnny Depp has a fun cameo.\n\nDont think I want to see the producers cut as this is all thats available, but if you get the DVD/Blu Ray, the directors cut is on the extras!"
