I will give some credit to Natasha McElhone, who does at least try and give a sincere performance, but she was up against it in this dire film.\n\nAt the time the production values were pretty good, so I won't slate it for ageing, but I will slam it for being a terrible film, that makes no sense at all, it never decides whether it wants to be a thriller or a supernatural horror.\n\nAvoid. 2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "If the survival of horror films depends on titles such as this \"FearDotCom\", we are indeed facing the downfall of the genre. This is lame, uninspired and repetitive garbage that irritates you from start to finish. Director William Malone's idea of suspense exists out of underexposed and fuzzy images of murders edited together in boisterous flashes that actually show you NOTHING. Add a poorly written script about a murderous website and completely unconvincing characters to this and you've got yourself one of the biggest cinema-turkeys since the new millennium. If the premise of this film rings a bell, it means that you recognize it from the Japanese cult hit \"Ringu\"\u0085. Or the slightly inferior American remake \"the Ring\". Only, the videotape has been replaced by an internet website and the poor victims have only 2 days left to live after being exposed instead of 7. Typical for an unscrupulous rip-off\u0085Faster, louder and modernized! The elaboration is a mess: weak dialogue, plot holes all over the place, no style or atmosphere and very bad acting. I can't believe class actors like Udo Kier and Stephen Rea were talked into accepting roles like this? Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times. Stephen Dorff and the leading lady deliver lousy performances in roles that really don't fit them. Dorff as a tough, experienced copper? Doubtful\u0085 Perhaps what annoyed me most about the cast (shallow, I admit) is seeing how one of my all-time favorite B-actors, Jeffrey Combs, is given such a small and insignificant role! That's Doctor Herbert West from Re-Animator we're talking about, dammit! Show a little more respect, Malone! If you love horror, you should avoid \"FearDotCom\" at all costs! It's bad for your nerve system."

A film so awful that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic.\n\nIt's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup. Don't go alone into an empty building. Have some common sense! Unfortunatelt, all the characters in FeardotCom, seem to have been born without the common sense gene.\n\nI could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the killer get increasingly closer. . . I could even suffer through poor acting in a horror flick if the plot is entertaining and at least scary.\n\nBut, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie: FeardotCom"

The film manages to maintain its unwatchability for over an hour, but by that point the viewer will probably have already logged onto www.feardotcom.com in hopes of ending the misery. If I had been able to give this movie less than a star, I would have done so in a heartbeat. Do not make the mistake of renting this movie; there's a small chance it may scare you, but the odds of that happening are not worth sitting through 90 minutes of some of the worst examples of film-making."

Considering I was one of about 4 people in the whole theater I jumped to the conclusion that this movie was bad, and was it. The whole movie is very dark in scenery and in acting.\n\nThe movie is about a website (feardotcom.com) that if you go there some dead chick asks you if you want to play a game, and then eventually kills you. Behind the website is a snuff film maker that shows footage of him killing people 'erotically.' The director of this movie must has some screws loose in his head. It's like a cheap cheesy very poorly done 8mm ripoff.\n\nI'm all for movies in the 'Bottom 100' of IMDB. I enjoy movies that the critics hate.

I do not know if I blindly bought it, was given it as a \"gift\", or if someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it, but whatever way, it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago, expecting it to be decent enough, entertaining at least, because I really liked the tagline and the premise seemed fun, though I have learned to stay away from a lot of \"technology killing\" horrors over the past few years now, and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the first time I watched it, a lot, and it was very negatively reviewed as well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.\n\nThe film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and \"thrills\". There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel creeped out or enticed in any way, and the whole film is a joke within itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists, and also the way the story was executed in a poor manner, not being able to stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying to watch the plot, what plot there is at least, unfold. The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled \"Ringu/The Ring\" an awful lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it.\n\nThere are many noticeable errors and plot holes, the dialogue is, for our inconvenience, not as laughable as one would hope, but corny enough to get a few giggles now and then, especially some of the deliverances from the female lead, and the climax/ending is not anywhere near heartracing or interest sparking, just bland and hardly tolerable. There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer, which was not accomplished in my situation, and a lot of material is just thrown in there randomly, which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and everyone away from this movie, unless you are a masochist and want to be put through this pain."

The cinematography for Fear Dot Com contains one of the darkest looks that has been seen for quite awhile. Even daytime sequences have a moody overtone that give off the feeling of a different world. Everything is very dark, and very blue. This adds to the surreal, sinister, melancholy atmosphere of the film.\n\nSort of a cross between Seven and The Ring, along with a dash of the soon to be popular 'torture porn' sub-genre, Fear Dot Com has a reputation as a really bad movie, which may be one reason why it's taken me until now to watch it, but within just a couple of minutes the movie didn't seem that bad at all and I was onboard. The storytelling is incredibly chaotic, and yet I quite enjoyed Fear Dot Com. Maybe some of that was due to me expecting the worst, but its surreal and dark atmosphere gripped me. The flick dealt some heavy freak out moments done with some fine dramatic no-holds-bared acting. A stand out moment from actress Amelia Curtis (Denise) as she descended into total and utter madness as she looses mind in epic fashion. This scene is worth the price of admission. Some very good macabre stuff in this film. Fear Dot Com makes you think, after the first time you've seen it, that you've seen a considerably more brutal film than you actually have, and director Malone, deserves credit for going down this trippy path.\n\nWith great sound, lighting and camera work that opens a door way to the surreal . Some very sick and disturbing images . Strong dramatic acting from Dorff and the lovely Natascha McElhoneand (Solaris 2002). Add for the horror buff Jeffrey Combs puts in one of his always fun appearances. Fear Dot Com poor reputation isn't to me really deserved. It was a trippy, dark and intense film. I found it to be freakishly entertaining. 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Feardotcom might not be a masterpiece by any means with its weird supernatural plot, at times cheap special effects and wooden actors and actresses but it certainly doesn't deserve the loath and ridicule it has received upon release. The story revolves around a dynamic police officer and a clever researcher who investigate a series of strange deaths that have occured after the victims visited a website depicting voyeuristic torture murder. It turns out that the website is haunted by one of its victims who is seeking for vengeance. The police officer and the researcher attempt to find out more about the victim's case to stop the haunting and arrest the serial killer behind the website to put an end to the violence.\n\nThe movie's main flaw is that its generous budget of forty million dollars hasn't been used very efficiently. The special effects are average at best, the actors and actresses are at times misplaced and the director failed to make a dynamic, fluid and emotional movie out of the script. It isn't hard to understand why this film became a box office bomb.\n\nHowever, the movie isn't without its merits. The atmosphere is gloomy from start to finish. The dirty locations blend in perfectly. The lighting techniques and sound effects are employed with care. The idea to show the dark side of the internet back in the early years of the millennium wasn't completely new as it had been portrayed in Pulse, Ringu and Videodrome before but said intention was nevertheless already ahead of its time.\n\nIn the end, you will enjoy Feardotcom if you are looking for a very atmospheric supernatural thriller with some grisly violence. The movie is stylish, gruesome and entertaining. If you are however looking for high-quality special effects, a clever plot and gifted acting performances, then this movie and genre simply aren't your cup of tea."

However, they realize that all the victims have visited an Internet site called 'www.fear.com' forty-eight hours before dying. A further investigation shows that there is a ghost on the web killing its users. Meanwhile, Detective Mike Reilly is also investigating a murderer called Alistair Pratt, 'The Doctor' (Stephen Rea). This movie has good and bad points. The story is plagiarized from the excellent and original Japanese 'Ringu', but the American 'The Ring' was a copy and became a success. There are some flaws along the confused plot. But there are also interesting points. For example, the dark and rainy atmosphere recalls 'Seven'. There is a sort of contrast between the modern (computer, Internet, cars) and life in the 30's or 40's (old buildings, classic costumes and furniture), recalling a film-noir, with a beautiful photography and style. There are also some reasonable special effects. The cast is slightly above average, with Natascha McElhone, Stephen Rea and Stephen Dorff. Therefore I dare to say that it is a watchable movie and I do not agree with the User Rating. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): 'MedoPontoCombr' ('FearDotCom')"

I wish I saved the $15 for my wife and myself, but it has been a awful summer for movies. 3/10"

Basically it's Ringu/The Ring (1998) just with tweaks. Sadly those tweaks aren't very good and the movie has come out as a bit of a confused mess.\n\nI get what they were trying to do and disagree with other reviewers that the film didn't make sense, it really did. It just wasn't very good and it felt like such a great cast were thoroughly wasted on this, especially considering it's a blatant ripoff of The Ring which had its US remake the very same year this came out.\n\nBad film? Absolutely. One of the worst? Hardly.\n\nThe Good:\n\nNatascha McElhone and Jeffrey Combs\n\nThe Bad:\n\nStephen Rea and Jeffrey Combs feel wasted\n\nPlot falls apart\n\nTakes a lot from other films"

This film, however, was THE closest I've ever come to walking out. For those of familiar or unfamiliar with the plot, while investigating the ghostly visage of a little girl (dressed to the nines in her Sunday best, complete with accompanying bouncing ball) our protagonists track down the girl's mother. While interviewing this pinnacle of parenthood, the mother explains that her daughter was (1) a hemophiliac that (2) used to play, alone, dressed in her Sunday best (complete with her Wilson) at (3) the old, abandoned steel mill that was (4) conveniently located a mere mile away from the perfect suburban neighborhood. WHAT?!?! First, most female hemophiliacs don't survive past puberty (for hopefully obvious reasons). Second, what mother of a child in such a condition lets her daughter play in AN OLD ABANDONED STEEL MILL?!?!?! I've seen some mighty far-fetched plot contrivances in my day (e.g., the wolves in Day After Tomorrow comes immediately to mind) but this was terrible. I actually groaned. My displeasure was abated, however, by the rest of the audience (outside of me and 3 friends, the audience consisted of 4 other people -- opening night) revolted! That's right we no longer \"watched\" the movie as atomistic movie fans. Oh no. We banded together to fight back this cinematic horror MST3K style. So, for all those willing to sit through one of my Top 5 Worst Movies Ever, go for it. Just make sure you have plenty of friends around to mock the movie with. Its the only appropriate response to this piece of crap."

OK, one should not expect too much logic from a horror movie, but the rest is poor quality as well - bad acting, a lot of cheap violence, and very little real thrill. There is some hidden quality and good pace in the filming, but it gets lost because of the lack of coherence of the story. Avoid this film, unless you are one of these guys who never lose any horror movie. 5/10 on my personal scale."

But, of course, give benefits to the voice of the people, because this is one hot mess, flawed on every level.\n\nA New York City detective investigates mysterious deaths occurring 48 hours after users log onto a site named feardotcom. 'Nough said. Story-wise, \"Feardotcom\" reminded me of J-horror, finer examples like \"Ringu\", \"Ju-On\", \"Pulse\", etc., all starts with mysterious deaths, all seems dark and grimy, mystery needs to be find out, and there is almost always a scary (little) girl involved. \"Feardotcom\" has all of that, but to no success. A familiar plot is continuously sabotaged by a gloom-doom-overkill cinematography and darkly messy visual depiction of New York City, silly, often highly expositional, point-out-the-obvious dialogues, sub-par acting, eyebrow-raising and overcooked action sequences with odd editing solutions, and so and so forth. Worst of all, the film takes itself dead seriously, and possesses little to no wit, so the product turned rather preposterous. Stephen Dorff grunts his way through, Natascha McElhone delivers a funky performance & Stephen Rea is maybe a little creepily amusing as the over-the-top torturer. Whatever potential \"Feardotcom\" had, was buried early on. It does look better than it feels, it is an expensive movie afterall (40 million, what?!).\n\nIf you feel like You might watch this, be sure to gather some friends, grab a few beers or hit a doob, because it will be a bumpy ride.

Among the many problems here is the story itself is pretty weak, with the main point serving between the evil spirit and the website, as the film really has two separate plots that are put together in one of the most confusing ways possible. While the first half is a nicely drawn-up detective story about a possible killer virus, the later search for the website and its resident ghostly haunting is completely nonsensical and doesn't offer up much of anything really coherent about the connection. If the entire purpose is to find revenge on the perpetrator of her crime, which this one is certainly striving toward, then the need to haunt the website rather than go straight for the source utilizing the power of the internet seems like a waste by killing those who log on who have no connection to anything. It makes no sense at all, and only results in more split hairs trying to connect the dots of what was at stake by being so disjointed and completely out of sync. There are some rather nice moments here and there, though, that tend to make this enjoyable. The biggest plus here is that there's a couple of really decent suspense scenes along the way, from the opening in the subway station where one victim sees a young girl playing with her ball on the tracks as a train approaches, jumps down to the tracks to try to save her but disappears at the last second and he then tries to avoid the train by plastering himself against a wall. A later scene where a man goes out to his car only to find the young girl playing outside the car and it to then turn into a self-controlled vehicle that delivers a devastating crash nearby is rather enjoyable, and t he most inventive one is when a character becomes paranoid while walking up a stairwell and suddenly sees a small ball that then melts down into a ball of cockroaches that begin chasing her around the apartment in a truly creepy, frenzied scene. That all of these rather frenzied and chaotic scenes work is due to the nature of the ghosts throughout here which has a rather creepy vibe placed here that manages to overcome the somewhat obvious CGI nature of the effects and becomes quite enjoyable throughout getting that on display. Coupled with the intriguing premise and nice gore throughout here, these are enough to hold out but not to overcome the flaws.\n\nRated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Nudity."

Actually, it deserves a half point for showing boobs and another half point because Natascha McElhone gets hotter as the movie goes on (BUT THIS IS NOT NEARLY A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO WASTE ANY TIME ON SEEING THIS MOVIE!!!). So, I rated it as 1 out of 10.\n\nSeriously, it depresses me that scripts like these even get read all the way through. Who approves the making of a movie like this? I can't believe that any of the actors'/actresses' careers are that bad that they would agree to acting in something like this. In fact, anyone trying to further their career by taking a part in this movie may have set their career back considerably. Trust me, if I had anything good to say, if there were any redeeming qualities (besides for the boobs and Natascha, of course), I would gladly point them out.

I have many times thought about signing up so I could post comments but never really had the desire. That all changed after I saw feardots**t. This movie is so incredibly bad that i felt obligated to warn others. When i tried to rent this the guy at blockbuster said dont and told me that it was a terrible, terrible movie. Being the idiot that i am, i rented it later from a different blockbuster and lost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back. The movie does not make any sense what so ever. My friends and I were literally on the floor laughing when the mother said that her daughter used to play at the abandoned steel factory. Of course every character in the movie logged onto the website even though they knew damn well it would kill them. Please, if you havent seen this movie and are thinking about renting it please dont. Not even to make fun of it or see how bad it really is."

Well I'm almost 30 now and rewatching this with my bf because it's October and we've been having scary movie marathons and this one came to mind and I haven't seen it in so long! Besides the nostalgia it gives me I still appreciate it for its uniqueness I think it's ahead of its time and gave one of the memorable horror movie scenes that would terrify anyone if it happened in real life. Yeah I'm talking about the scene with the roaches! It also has a fantasy element and a dark aesthetic to it which I love and again it makes it different. It's still very entertaining even if it doesn't all make sense lol."

This film falls into the category of \"RIPOFF\".\n\nAfter seeing the opening scene I know that this movie would be average at best....I was wrong, it was below average. If you have a choice of this or the ring...make the smarter one, and see the ring. Or better yet, go and see Ringu, it's atmosphere and creep factor outshine both of these films. Notice I'm talking about other films, other then FEATDOTCOM, that's how bad it is.\n\nLet's judge the similarities shall we?\n\nPeople die after seeing web-site.\n\nPeople die after seeing a video.\n\nThe lead female discovers a dead body in the water.\n\nThe lead female discovers a dead body in the water.\n\nThe dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.\n\nThe dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.\n\nAfter they're dead, they have a terrified look on their face.\n\nAfter they're dead, they have a terrified look on their face.\n\nShould I tell you which scenario is from which movie...does it really matter?\n\nAt least Dorff entertained me for a little while, but please kill everyone else in the damn movie. Even the great Combs was underused and abused.\n\n\"I think your perfect for the lead role, come with me\"\n\n\"well, I don't know you, and you look kinda freaky, but what the hell, I'll go with you and tell no one, and surely sign my death warrant\"\n\nWell, maybe that last bit wasn't in the movie but it might as well should have been.\n\nPLEASE!!! This movie is really really terrible, I can't stress this enough. I found myself trying really hard to like it, and ended up hating it even more and who the hell at the age of 5 plays at a STEEL MILL??? Let alone a blonde girl with a white ball. The script and directing in this movie really brings it down because it has no idea what's it's doing. It seemed like they watched the Ring and decided to bring it into the new generation of viewers and make it the internet. It has nothing going for it, besides the cool looking box-art, which we see once or twice in the movie."

The point of horror is to escape reality and watch something totally off the wall and out there. If you want logic, watch gone with the wind. Want to be entertained, watch this movie. The acting was good, pacing was good, pretty gruesome, and had a killer ending. I suggest people that get queasy fast, don't watch this, go rent The Ring."

This film did seem to be 2002's punching bag from everyone but give it a watch and see how you feel.

Despite the fact that it shares many aspects with \"Ringu\" and \"The Ring,\" \"FeardotCom\" has qualities those movies do not. The entire movie is shot very dark and gray; and this gives the viewer a subtle dread throughout. The suspenseful moments, horrific scenes, and sudden frights build on this dark setting, and create a truly creepy, scary film. Because the film focuses on a website, something modern and real, it can afford to (with a little artistic license) intermingle the paranormal with crime scene investigation\u0097and it does this quite nicely. Also, as the web is anonymous and pervading, the hopelessness factor, an effective tool a lot of horror films use to create panic in their viewers, is increased. The film's plot, without giving any of it away, has enough twists and turns to keep one interested\u0097there is a lot of mysteries and detective work. The acting in this film is generally on par with other films of its genre. In many ways I enjoyed this film more than \"The Ring.\" I recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed \"The Ring\" or \"Ringu,\" and to anyone who likes creepy or disturbing horror films."

Don't get me wrong I understand it was corny in many areas and some of it didn't add up but the overall story made it way better than the rating 3 and I feel like some people have horrible ratings on this site as there are several movies that are decent and have horrible ratings and horrible movies that have decent ratings. To finish this off I would recommend this to watch with a younger audience if you were to want scared reactions and I do not mean children. Movie was a 5 on my list out of 10 because it was very corny and predictable but the storyline was similar as \"The Ring\" if you have watched horror you know what the movie is."

A train approaches but despite not being struck he dies with a look of terror on his face and blood coming from his eyes. Detective Mike Reilly is given the case and, because it is feared a virus may have caused the victims bleeding, he is helped by Terry Huston from the Department of Health. Inevitably there are more victims; each found bleeding in a similar way. Together Mike and Terry work to discover a link between the victims... the only connection appears to be that they died forty eight hours after visiting a strangely disturbing website that depicts torture and death. Mike is also loathe to give up on a serial killer case that has been taken over by the FBI; it involves a killer known as 'The Doctor' who tortures his victims until the beg to die.\n\nWhile I don't think this film is as bad as many reviews suggest I certainly wouldn't claim is its particularly good. The plot is a bit of a mess combining fears of dangers on the internet, the supernatural and a serial killer. There are plenty of plot holes although I won't list them to avoid spoilers. It isn't particularly scary but does have some disturbing moments. The cast is okay although those I recognised have all been in better things... most obviously Stephen Rea and Jeffrey Combs... I kept waiting for the latter's character to become more important but he never did. Overall I'd not really recommend this; it is just about okay but nothing more."

I don't understand it in a story sense AT ALL, but my God if director William Malone doesn't make it beautiful.\n\nThat portion of the movie is part Tarsem Singh and part Quay Brothers, and I don't think the movie gets the credit for having the balls to do something like that in a fairly mainstream horror title.

The only reason I watched \"Feardotcom\" is that it's currently #53 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...the 100 worst rated majoy release films. I enjoy watching many of these films because they are unintentionally hilarious.\n\nThe story begins with a very white little girl luring a man into the oncoming path of a subway train. He, of course, is killed and the credits begin to roll. So much for hilarious. Soon other folks die or are drug into the police station...screaming and with bleeding eye sockets. Eventually, they are able to determine the common thread...they all went to the same website...a website with a torture porn game. And, after watching, they die within 48 hours. If it all sounds familiar, it's much like \"The Ring\" but much more brutal and violent....so much so that it was disturbing. Not good or well made....but disturbing that so much torture was put in the film for the amusement of the audience.\n\nOverall, watching this film was a chore, as it was so nasty and repulsive. It was scary...but also as much fun to watch as an autopsy. Well made mind garbage."

For instance, one can't understand why both main characters decide to check out the website, while they know it's killing people. If I were on a website that welcomes me with my own name, I would throw my computer out of the window!\n\nMovie is also suffering from some bad acting, in particular by McElhone who plays Terry.

It isn't worst movie I've ever seen but it most definitely is top 3.\n\nWhere do I even begin on this trainwreck? First of all its incredibly low budget. I obviously took some consideration since the movie was made in earlys 2000's and isn't new. But even for that era the visuals were just bad, and the camera work was even worse. Second the acting in this film was brutal. From the corny faces to the choppy dialogue. It was almost like watching a middle school play.\n\nLastly the plot and direction of the film is confusing, incoherent, and silly. The shame is in beginning it was decently interesting and then it all just came completely apart. Oh and I forgot to add that movie is very draggy as well.\n\nAvoid this movie at all costs!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is amazing how similar films get released so closely together. You can recall when Armageddon came out, Deep Impact beat it to the punch. When Tombstone was released, the makers of Wyatt Earp claimed that they copied their idea and then hoodwinked them. Same can be said for the body switching films in the 80's and so on and so on. However, with Feardotcom and The Ring, I have a theory that may not so flattering to Franchise Pictures.\n\nThere are too many consistencies, similarities and flat out duplication of the plot between these two films that you have suspect foul play here. Two films cannot look so similar without there being some sort of sabotage. And if you ask me, it went something like this. Keep in mind that this is all my own theory and I have nothing to corroborate my story.\n\nWhen it discovered that Dreamworks had interest in the Ringu, other studios probably got interested as well. After all, Ringu was one of the biggest horror movies to hit Japan in decades. And when DWSKG secured the rights to the film, it may have left rival studios p***ed off and thus the wheels were set in motion. Someone had to release a film very similar to the Ring, only a bit different. So they threw a script together, hired a second rate director and got a very grade D cast and made this film and then laughed as they beat SKG to the punch by about 6 months. Thinking that they had won the battle, they forgot a few important things. One being that the story was not as intriguing or as well thought out or as conceivable as the Ring was and the other thing that they didn't count on was that The Ring would clutch the collective psyche of North America the way it did. FDC left the theaters in a matter of weeks and went on to make a few dollars where as the Ring shocked a continent, made people afraid of their TV's and made stars out of Naomi Watts and will probably have a few technical Oscar nods thrown their way.\n\nI loathe films like FearDotCom because they are not creative enough to come up with a story of their own and to say that one of these films did not borrow aspects, and a lot of them at that, from the other film is myopic and silly. Every major plot theme in The Ring is in FDC. You can go right down to antagonist being a little girl that didn't deserve to die, to discovering that little girl preserved in water, to technology having something to do with the deaths, to the disturbing contents of the film, to the time that they had to live and figure out the mystery to the reason why they had that time. And since Ringu came out in 1998, I'm going to have to go with FDC being the culprit here in the infringement game. This is abominable when you look at what they have done, hoping to catch the nation sleeping and make a few bucks doing it. But the joke is on them. Not only is the film a box office bomb, it is one of the lowest rated films in imdb. That is about as low as you can go.\n\nHaving said all that, there is something redeeming about FDC. That is to say that I didn't hate it. I can't say that I liked it but the film got underneath my skin and it made me very uneasy. Director William Malone is definitely a man that can milk a scene for all it's worth and just as he showed us in The House on Haunted Hill, if he is just given the right material, he may be inclined to do some great work. Because as it stands, this film made me uncomfortable and it was borderline too disturbing. The last film I saw that bothered me this much was Last House on the Left. That was Wes Craven's sick sado-masochistic rape/revenge film from 1972. FearDotCom almost duplicates that with it's sick nature and twisted plot pieces. So if that is your niche, if you like to see sick pictures like that, then this is something that you will enjoy. There is also some twisted scenes that traduce the victim down to a generic slab of meat that will either keep you awake at night or entertain you with it's macabre story. Either way, this film is not for the faint of heart.\n\nFearDotCom is a well made movie in some aspects. But it is also a Xeroxed script that the producers should lose their producers hat for. It is not an entertaining film but it will appeal to those that may like watching what it is like to suffer through the ultimate iatronic transgression. I cannot recommend this film, it bothered me too much. But you may have to decide for yourself. Just remember to check out the superior Ringu when it comes out on DVD and please, please watch The Ring. It is the best horror film to hit the big screen in 18 years. As it stands, FDC is just a pale imitation of it.\n\n5 out of 10"

It is such a shame that the execution was as bad as it turned out.\n\nThe best thing about Feardotcom is Stephen Dorff, he was quite decent in his role. Gesine Cukrowski also brings a touch of creepiness to her role but is not in the movie anywhere near long enough to save it. The rest of the acting is terrible, with Udo Keir and Jeffrey Coombs completely wasted and to say that Natascha McElhone's atrocious here is being kind. Stephen Rea is a very anaemic villain and didn't seem very involved, this did hurt Feardotcom a lot because it focuses a fair bit on him(too much perhaps) and not enough on anyone else. And when the villain fails to grab you, that gives you an idea of how painfully underdeveloped and unconvincing all the characters were, some even came across as pointless.\n\nStory-wise, Feardotcom had a good idea going for it, but is let down by it being structured in a very jumpy and borderline incoherent way, a number of scenes where very little happens and went on too long and a complete lack of suspense scares or atmosphere. The music is little more than a stereotypically loud drone that crescendos in parts meant to be scary or suspenseful, which dilutes their impact and makes them predictable instead. The script is weak, structurally it's confused and it does little with giving personality to the characters, some of the dialogue is forced it's enough to make one cringe and induces unintentional humour in a number of places. The movie neither looks great or cheap, there was clearly effort into making it but it came across as the director/photographer trying too hard to please, some of it looks garish and blurry in alternative to clear and a lot of the camera work is incredibly random.\n\nOverall, not as bad as has been said here but a very bad movie all round apart from Dorff that wastes the potential that it had. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

They make a professional effort but the material casts a thick pall over everything.\n\nI saw \"FeardotCom\" a few years ago, before \"Saw\" and \"Hostel\" were made. I haven't seen those films and maybe \"FeardotCom\" is tame in comparison. . . .\n\nIn 2002, when this movie came out, Western audiences had begun to pick up on an innovative new wave of Japanese Horror (J-Horror) movies that had been coming out of Japan since the late 90s. These movies explored the fright potential of audiovisual media and the Internet. The title \"FeardotCom\" kinda suggests an Internet-inspired spook fest along the lines of the Japanese film \"Pulse\". What we get here is a muddled plot and, more to the point of it all, lots of dehumanizing sadomasochistic imagery. The word \"misogynistic\" is often overused, but in this case it applies perfectly."

To redeem this mess, the first thing to do IMO would have been to decide WHAT the main concept was supposed to be. Was it all about what motivated \"The Doctor\" (with apologies to Tom Baker), or perhaps his first victim? Was it about the possibility of a complex electronic network gaining the ability to store mystical \"energies\"? Was it about the relationship -- such as it was -- between the two main protagonists? Was it about the sinister side of voyeurism? Was it about pushing people to the point where they beg to be killed? Any of those things might have been worth building a film around -- but NOT ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME. Where was the emotional center of this film supposed to be?\n\nI like some of the actors in the film, so I hate to put it in the bottom 100 of all time, but it really is very much a mess.

It was lurking on the Bottom 100 movies on IMDb, and even though it's off the list right now, it still has a very low score (as of this moment, it's 3.1). I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else. Granted, the film is no masterpiece, but it's actually a pretty good movie.\n\nDetective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) is tracking down a sadistic killer who calls himself \"The Doctor.\" But more importantly, is a series of mysterious and gruesome deaths which may or may not be a disease. The latter possibility attracts the attention of Terry Huston, from the Department of Public Health (Natascha McElhone). Their investigation leads them to a connection between The Doctor, the deaths, and a website called \"FearDotCom.com.\"\n\nThe synopsis I gave doesn't make much sense, I know. But if you watch the movie, it is actually pretty easy to follow. Unfortunately, the editing, particularly in the beginning, is a hackjob, which makes the story sometimes border on the incoherent. But if you pay attention, it's relatively easy to piece together.\n\nThere are a number of terrific qualities about the film. First and foremost, is the cinematography, credited to Christian Sebaldt. The setting of \"FeardotCom\" is grim, dark and raining. In other words, the perfect place for a horror movie (I immediately thought of \"Seven\"). Second, are the special effects. If you read Roger Ebert's review of the film, he noted that the special effects are so good that \"this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see.\" Indeed, this is true. But when I say special effects, I mean the setting and how the film is shot. The story gets us from one intriguing image to the next (albeit not very well), but they are so visually interesting that they make the movie worth seeing. It also helps that the atmosphere is effective enough to generate a few chills, something many horror films, even the most critically acclaimed, cannot do.\n\nHowever, the acting doesn't really hold up to the visuals. Stephen Dorff plays Mike in a low-key manner. In a film where the atmosphere didn't call so much attention to itself, it might have worked. But here, his performance seems lifeless. Natascha McElhone is bad. She has the acting chops to pull off her character, but she speaks so slowly that it's almost as if she's reading off cue cards. British character actor Stephen Rea is not as chilling as one hopes he would, but he has his moments.\n\nWilliam Malone directed the \"House on Haunted Hill\" remake, which I hated. I guess he had to have the right cinematographer. This is an effectively made film, although the editing is bad, and the story is stolen from better movies (\"The Ring\" in particular). Yet I still liked it, and as long as you understand how to watch this movie, it's a solid choice to watch alone with the lights out."

It is less then par for most of the actors. The directing is not done very well as is the editing of the movie and the cinematography of the movie isn't done well either. I wouldn't buy this movie if it was the last movie ever made. It isn't worth the 20 bucks for it or even 1 buck for it. If you havn't seen it stay away. It isn't even worth watching it on TV. If you do have to watch it please rent it and not buy it because you will feel that you have wasted your money. I was going to buy it and then a friend let me borrow it to watch. I'm glad I didn't buy it because I would have used it as a coaster.\n\nI give it a 1/10"

No wonder the lighting was so dark, they didn't want you to actually see what's going on, because the filmmakers feel ashamed.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film hardly merits a review of any kind. It is even difficult to begin writing about the myriad atrocities of film that are present in its cinematic putrescence. However, a few notable flaws can be mentioned. The storyline is far from cohesive. Characters simply pop out of nowhere and are instantly forgotten. It is not clear who we're supposed to care about and who we are supposed to despise. The entire premise of the website is dubious and confusing up until the conclusion of the film. Are we to pity the dead girl or fear her ability to indiscriminately destroy anyone who haplessly visits the website?\n\nThere could have been some promise in the idea of unexplained energy existing over the internet. However, the concept is resigned to a single conversation and adds nothing to the overall understanding of what forces are at work. It is also unclear whether the filmmakers were intending to shock the audience into submission or to create a jump-out-of-your-seat scare fest. Thankfully the film's gore never gets nauseating due to poor editing during the exploitative scenes of female torture. Admittedly, the imagery is inventive and has potential fright value, but the cheap scares are so separated by vast expanses of trite boredom that they fail to deliver at all.\n\nDismal acting and conventional characters. The lunatic doctor is a serial killer, why? The cop who falls in love with a coroner in a span of a day somehow arouses her utmost devotion and concern. Stephen Dorff's acting career went from the toilet to the sewer with this film, and rightly so. Director William Malone has obviously studied the dark crafts of David Fincher, but his ineptitude at producing even cheap carbon copies of thrillers is aptly demonstrated with \"FearDotCom.\" Consequently, this movie makes \"Saw\" look like \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\nIn short, the editing is terrible, the acting rank, the cinematography recycled, and the continuity is out the window. Why movies like this are allowed to be made on such budgets is beyond me. Skip this one at all costs."

Nothing tremendously pervertial, but makes a little bit uncertain about being brain-washed as well. No women been cut actually! :) Malone's movie concentrates mostly on contrasts of psychedelic visions victims experience, caused by their \"infected\" minds, not the actual detective line outlay. That makes a movie a bit slowish for those who expect much of intrigue and a step-to-step dog-hunt for a bad guy. That's a problem which burdens the high minds of professional movie reviewing - the division of a movie into 2 parts - COP part and VISION part.\n\nBut if the movie keeps up the pace it loses its originality every second it turns into an action-thriller. In fact, what begins as a cruel game with YOUR brain, ends up as a stupid version of a cop-thriller, but it IS worth watching. P.S. - It seems American nation is much succumbed for pathetic HEROIC makings and sissy comedies, and a light thriller with women screaming make them sick."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Feardotcom\" is an interesting movie - the premise was rather original, the title was great, but the movie was a letdown. The film is about a New York detective, Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff). After some strange deaths occur within the city, Mike is one of the primary workers on the cases. He meets a health inspector, Terry (Natasha McElhone), and the two team together on the case. It seems that a new virus may be spreading around the city. At least, that's what they think - until they discover one thing that all the victims have in common. Each of them died 48 hours to the minute after they logged onto this bizarre website, \"Feardotcom.com\". Meanwhile, a psychopath (Stephen Rea) who runs feardotcom is kidnapping young girls from supposed acting auditions, and torturing them over his website. After Mike views the site, he has 48 hours to solve its mystery or he will become its next victim.\n\nI have to admit, I liked the idea of this movie. It was fairly unique and I think had the potential to be alright. But unfortunately, this movie fell flat on its face. The movie becomes tiresome as it goes on, and it gets more and more dull until the viewer is hardly coherent by the time it reaches the bizarre (but visually appealing) showdown with The Doctor. The plot is confusing and it fails to make sense on many occasions. The whole subplot with the Doctor's daughter was flat-out weird, but the daughter character herself was undeniably horrifying (her face is featured on the film's poster). The acting was competent and the performer work well with what they're given\u2014 Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone play their roles believably. The acting is probably the strongest thing about the film, along with the glossy visuals and slick, flashy camera work.\n\nThere are plenty of disturbing and very scary visuals throughout, which seems to be a trend in Malone's work. I'm not complaining, because his style and spooky imagery works wonderfully. The whole atmosphere to the movie was very dark and grey, all of the sets reminded me of something from the 1940s New York, which made for a spooky atmosphere. Even with these minor strong points, this film still lacks a lot, mainly because of the story, which was potentially good. I enjoyed William Malone's previous \"House On Haunted Hill\", but this film is nowhere near as good as that film was, in my opinion at least.\n\nOverall, \"Feardotcom\", visually, is an interesting movie. Otherwise, the plot defies any and all logic, and it becomes uninteresting by the middle point of the film. The sad thing is I think this had some potential, but it was very underdeveloped and needed work. You could probably pass on it, but the great imagery makes it worth watching at least once. Visually, it's complete eye candy, but story wise, it's weak. I'd say it's just a point under average. 4/10."

'Power Of One' child actor Dorff puts the C in cool, in a strong and interesting 'tough guy' character performance, where a dim future awaits. He's accompanied by a very well played lead, where you hope, a sexual fling or relationship will develop. The film is ultimately bad and comes across as ludicrous, another malfunction of a film. There's hardly any violence on the whole, again a 'high level violence' warning as in how it's displayed, is a joke. The film comes up short on many things, and this one, on the latest view around, surprise surprise, I didn't like it anymore, as I liked it last time. Sadly it's Rea, who you only see in a number of scenes, who lucks out, in this with a genuine evil performance, with a voice to match. It's a performance that will go unnoticed or be forgotten, cause of the film's stuff ups or dislike for it. Yes, it's a site you don't want to visit, or the movie itself too."

They were working on Great ideas!! Real Alien type horror! Not to mention his skin crawling \"Tales from the Crypt\" and \"Perversions of Science\" episodes. I was curious to find out why in gods name he chose a film with a title like this!! Especially since he was unhappy with \"House on Haunted hill\". He told some of us at the screening, that after HOHH it was the only script (fear dot com) he'd gotten, where the producers weren't suggesting having the writers of `Friends' do rewrites, or wasn't a remake of Frankenstein filled retard CGI like \"The Mummy\" remake\n\nSo anyway on to the film... I was really shocked!!! I had prepared myself to start cheering when each lame teenager, who logged on to the internet, was killed off... BUT NOT ONE TEENAGER!! Not one person under the age of probably 25. Not one joke! This movie easily could have been `I wish you'd kill me this summer' meets `scream'. This movie was cool! Some very sick and disturbing images though. It's not really a scary movie though! I don't think it's suppose to be. More like Seven, meets Jacobs Ladder. You just feel sort of uneasy. I suppose one could focus on just the web stuff, But I found it more about the serial killer torturing women. It was really a dark intense film and a lot of FUN! I hope this guy gets to make the kind of films he wants after this!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Setting out to make a statement against violence while dealing in graphic violence itself is a trick that few filmmakers have pulled off successfully: Stanley Kubrick might have made the definitive comment/satire with \"A Clockwork Orange\" in 1971, with David Cronenberg (\"Videodrome\") and Michael Haneke (both versions of \"Funny Games\") following up with pointed analyses of our own traffic-accident fascination with torture and murder, attacking the subject with intelligence and no small amount of sociological savvy.\n\nBut given that triptych's enduring, thought-provoking power, just as many filmmakers botch the commentary\u0096or worse, merely use it as a flimsy pretext\u0096and simply revel in violence, hoping the audience is too dumb to notice. Notorious examples include \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (a gratuitous Video Nasty whose leering, hypocritical eye failed to convince me that it was really against the violence\u0096both real and staged\u0096that it was perpetrating), the controversy-courting \"Natural Born Killers,\" and the ugly, exploitative \"15 Minutes.\"\n\n\"Feardotcom\" fits into the latter category of failed efforts, though I would say it transcends the examples I cited (which really isn't saying much), if only because it sits comfortably in the insulated sewer of horror-genre conventions and clich\u00e9s that provide a suitable reprieve from the stabs at social commentary (and, if the trailer is any indication, the film wasn't marketed as some mind-blowing statement against consumer-grade electronics influencing homicidal behavior, anyway). While the film has one of the horror genre's most creative stylists at the helm and major-studio support, \"Feardotcom\" quickly becomes an absurd, narratively rickety slog through tonal inconsistency.\n\nFirst things first: I think William Malone (the remake of \"House on Haunted Hill\") is one of the most under-appreciated directors working in the genre today\u0096while he deals in the same quick-cutting and ultraviolence of the \"torture porn\" school, he imbues his imagery with a palpable conviction that is by turns artistic and visceral. With \"Feardotcom,\" he exhibits the same fascination with different film stocks and effects in an attempt to create a visually arresting experience\u0096unfortunately, the drab color schemes are so desaturated that the film often had me squinting to make out what was going on through the omnipresent darkness.\n\nThe plot\u0096in one of many echoes of \"Videodrome\"\u0096revolves around a string of deaths seemingly caused by viewing a snuff website (the laughably redundant URL is \"feardotcom.com\"), presided over by disgraced-doctor-turned-serial killer Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea); bitter young cop Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) has the typical bad history with the killer, and is aided by Department of Health inspector Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone); also, the restless spirit of Pratt's first victim is apparently inhabiting Cyberspace and wants revenge on the good doctor.\n\nIf nothing else, the imagery (that isn't shrouded in darkness, at least) is stylish and effective enough to hold your attention, but the other aspects of \"Feardotcom\" are so staggeringly uneven that the film winds up a muddled hash. The performances have an oddly detached quality, and the characterizations poor; McElhone's line readings are so off-center that the character becomes an outright distraction; and Dorff lacks the driven intensity to truly bring Reilly to life (the relationship between these two is frustratingly ambiguous). The supporting performances of Rea (doing a gloss on Kevin Spacey in \"Seven\") and Jeffrey Combs are considerably better, but given their limited screen time, are hardly enough to redeem the film. Basically, without a single character worth relating to, \"Feardotcom\" fails to connect.\n\nWith a better script, Malone's direction might not have been wasted on an undeserving film, but \"Feardotcom\" comes off as a rushed, confused cash-in on technology that, at the time, was becoming a dominant American standard\u0096the supernatural angle might have paved the way for some deeper metaphysical meditation, but the end result is merely a silly, tedious revel in the grue-stained trough. Eat 'em up, kids.\n\n4.5 out of 10"

She seems to giggle her way through the film and makes facial expressions that dont fit the moment.The horror is tame and the story has more holes in it than a fishing net.

        "review_detailed_main": "Feardotcom is indeed comparable to the Ring. However, if you look at the recommendations for Feardotcom, the Ring is not one of them, nor is Feardotcom recommended for viewers of the Ring. Neither of the movies share a single recommended film. When I was watching Feardotcom, I noticed immediately it's similarities to the Ring which turned me off, but I also noticed that I was enjoying it more. When I think back to when I saw the Ring and compare it to my reaction to the other William Malone (director of Feardotcom) films that I saw that year, House on Haunted Hill, I came to realize that had I seen Feardotcom that year, it would have scared the pants off me. The Ring was simply a freaky thriller, while Feardotcom is a thriller that inspires real fear through terror. I wouldn't even be comparing these two films if all of the other critics out there hadn't constantly compared it to the Ring in every single one of your reviews. Do you honestly think that the writers for Feardotcom ripped off the script for the Ring? They'd be sued for sure. I also noticed that Feardotcom is a much more sophisticated film. Especially because It actually makes sense. Part of Feardotcom is a murder mystery that leads up to an explanation that is easy to understand. So, I conclude, that if the Ring deserves 8 stars, then Feardotcom at least deserves 10. Not 3, which you would clearly see if you actually took the time to watch the film instead of turning it off at the first Ring similarity that you see."

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a Website called FearDotCom and anyone who visits it and accepts its challenge will die 48hours later. After someone dies of strange circumstances detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) gets the strange case and a Health Inspector (Natascha McElhone) is brought in too, as they think that they might be dealing with a new virus. Though, soon later the two come across the Website and race against the clock to solve the mystery before they become a victim of the site. While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities?\n\nDoes this idea ring a bell, it sure does. Flimsy rip-off comes straight to mind while watching this very bland and trashy film, despite director William Malone's best efforts. Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills. The deaths scenes and torture moments are unimaginative and rather tame.\n\nIt's glossily executed, but illogical and flat sums it up."

As he did with his 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill, director William Malone favors Tripp atmosphere at the expense of acting, character development, and plot. Belatedly jumping on the Internet-thriller bandwagon, the film follows a brooding detective (Stephen Dorff) and a public health inspector (Natascha McElhone) as they investigate the deadly influence of the titular Web site, which channels the innermost fears of its visitors until they die of fright 48 hours later. Why 48 hours? Don't ask; Josephine Coyle's screenplay is as incoherent as Malone's grasp of narrative momentum, leaving Dorff and McElhone with little to do but look frightened and doomed. But Fear Dot Com has its moments, especially after mad doctor Stephen Rea's gruesome villainy is fully revealed, and the proceedings take on the monochrome pallor of silent German expressionism. Too bad these fantastic visuals weren't servicing a better movie."

I NEVER want to see her again. Stephen Rea is just as bad as the killer (believe me, I'm not giving anything away). He keeps babbling away in a thin, reedy voice before killing his victims. Most of what he says is the worst dialogue every written and he says...it...so...SLOWLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!

Take this as some kind of nightmare with the same kind of logic (almost) and you will probably like it a lot more than if you expect a linear plot and nicely rounded up ending. Director Malone sure has plenty of style to spare...the question is WHO'S? There are shades of several other movies here like \"Seven\" (a lot), \"Silence of the lambs\" and Adrian Lyne's \"Jacobs ladder\" along with the influence of other directors (like italian horror maestro Dario Argento and others). The movie sure looks great! And it's entire atmosphere is heavy with a sense of doom and evil. We get some truly disturbing images that flash before our faces. On the bonus side is also a very good score by Nicholas Pike.\n\nBut the script and some performances are less than noteworthy. Once the whole gimmick of the plot is settled we are not granted any surprises at all and many things are left unexplained. There are plot holes big enough to drive trucks through!! And most of the actors are sleepwalking for their pay-checks, but somehow think that this was director Malone's intention just to match their mood with the environment they live and work in. Only Stephen Rea manages some sort of \"real\" acting and even he is not up to his usual standards (but admittedly he has very little to work with and develop). At times I thought that some of the actors were dubbed...at least there is something not quite right here (the movie was shot in Luxemburg apparently).\n\nA rather ambitious movie, but there were just a little more talent needed in the script to pull the whole thing off. But I don't think it's all that bad as some people here are thinking...quite the opposite."

What is offered is classic horror images of ill-lit rooms, mysterious corpses, and the cliched, yet determined detective. The director's love of random montage, smoke-and-mirrors, sado-masochistic sequences is so overused as to lack purpose in plot development or even visual interest. It is a shame, as the concept is there and Stephen Dorff can be a most volatile and interesting performer, but the tension is never really built up enough due to the film's focus on superfluous, aesthetically random scenes."

Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building. The story ultimately makes no sense, really, and it's just yucky. I don't mind gore one bit, if handled well. I even stomached stuff like DAY OF THE DEAD back when it first came out and people were hurling in the aisles. But feardotcom was so distasteful, so indulgent in its love of the gore (mild though it was) that I mostly felt a little dirty for watching, kinda like I'd watch a snuff film. And no filmmaker should actually want you to feel that way, but the movie is so amateurishly made that you feel like you're watching home movies of these brutal acts. Sounds good and edgy, some might think. But if you like something resembling COHERENCE in your movies, guess again. It was momentarily amusing to see Jeffrey Combs (he of the unusual but entertaining performances in REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND), but in the end, he was pretty darn bad. Natascha McElhone, whom I usually like, generated no heat whatsoever. And I can only believe that it was actually Geoffrey Rush's untrained twin brother who acted in this movie and not the real Geoffrey Rush himself.\n\nNever have I wanted my money back more. Do NOT, NOT , NOT see this film!!!"

Why these people were dying made NO SENSE AT ALL. It boggles my mind how such a poorly written film can get made. I pray to the highest power that screenwriter Josephine Coyle never works in Hollywood again. Her script is full of moronic characters and awful dialogue that makes soap operas seem like Hemingway.\n\nThe talents of everyone involved were wasted, especially Udo Kier, whose only line was, \"Nooooo!\" I was looking forward to this film because I enjoyed director William Malone's House on Haunted Hill. I think Malone was asleep behind the wheel during production on Feardotcom. The lighting was hideous, the pacing was sloppy and logic was nowhere to be found.\n\nIf the killer of this film were to treat me like his victims and torture me, all he'd have to do is strap me to a table and force me to watch Feardotcom."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wonder sometimes, when I see a movie of such little quality, if the filmmakers actually WANTED it to suck. I have a scenario playing out in my head, it takes place at one of those oft rumored closed-door Hollywood meetings where a series of executives are worried that audiences will catch on to the pattern of crappy movies that are filling the multiplexes. As an offering, or maybe a sacrifice, what have you, they green light a script with a director and a cast that is guaranteed to be so bad, to be the UBER-CRAP film of the year, that the rest of the cinematic fodder will seem mildly acceptable by comparison.\n\nThe UBER CRAP here is most definitely FearDotCom. It is so void of all original ideas and logical thinking, that such a void must have been created deliberately. From the script, to the casting, to the camera work, to the editing, even the special effects, all had to have been planned very intricately to provide us with a movie so very, very bad, Ed Wood is laughing in derision. This black hole is so dense, that surrounding theaters showing mildly entertaining movies actually lost some of their potency to entertainment.\n\nThe plot itself is so overly done I don't know how anybody could have thought \"Yes, this will be cool.\" It involves a website that makes your eyes bleed, and yet there were no dancing hamsters anywhere on the site. After 48 hours from viewing the site, you die by your own worst fear. But these fears have no creativity or style. On guy is afraid of `car crashes' but we don't learn that until much later. Others include water, bugs, sharp things, and to fit this pattern I guess there has to be a guy afraid of trains, but if this is true, what the hell was he doing at train station? The main characters are a police officer and a public health worker trying to discover how the site works.\n\nNow I didn't know enough about computers or the internet to scoff wildly at the screen confidently, but I still scoffed, knowing that ACTUALLY GOING TO THE SITE YOURSELF is probably the WORST IDEA EVER. Imagine a room with a hyena: anybody that goes in that room gets eaten. Says the police officer \"I wonder why . . ?' and goes into the room himself. My opinion? They all deserve what they get at this point.\n\nBut the script isn't done being . . . well, stupid. It also involves a completely different website, where a serial killer broadcasts the murder of his victims. For about 90% of the movie there is absolutely no relation between this guy, who is essentially Hannibal Lector Lite, and all the victims of the OTHER website. It feels like you're watching two movies that have been spliced together, one accentuating how bad the other is like it was a science.\n\nMy only hope is the dolts in the closed-door meetings have had their laugh, and will soon go back to making bad movies by accident. Doing it on purpose seems to be the only thing they're good at."

A police detective (Stephen Dorff) and a health inspector (Natascha McElhone) try to fine a deranged serial killer known as The Doctor (Stephen Rea). Which The Doctor was an ex-medical student. The Doctor murders his victims on-line but there is something on that website. That is more dangerous and deadly than the serial killer.\n\nDirected by William Malone (House on Haunted Hill-Remake) made a clever, sometimes visual impressive supernatural horror thriller. Dorff and McElhone try their best in this extremely flawed, empty but an interesting mess nonetheless. Rea is wasted in a supporting role. What redeems this film is the slick camera-work by Christian Sebaldt, the editing by Alan Strachan and a good music score by Nicholas Pike. FearDotCom uses elements from Ringu (Better known as The Ring), the strong Japanese horror film.\n\nDVD has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. There is a good commentary track by the director and the cinematographer. DVD has an five minute featurette, a deleted scene-introduction by the director, photo gallery, cast & crew information and an trailer. Jeffery Combs (From The Re-Animator Trilogy and The Frighteners fame) has an supporting role as a cop. Udo Kier has an cameo in the opening scene. The visuals of this film is so creative that the movie is so bad that is actually worth seeing. Ambitious, Off-Putting but Intriguing nonetheless. Super 35. (*** \u00bd/*****)."

Although the acting was not of the highest order it was not bad as some have suggested. Overall though there was not anything that really stood out about the film, so I WOULD NOT recommend it as something you must buy, however if it appears on TV or you have seen everything else available for rent then you could do worse than this reasonable little thriller (Hollow Man 2 for instance, which somehow has a higher rating).

Jeffrey Combs, Michael Sarrazin, Nigel Terry and Udo Kier lent a great amount of character to the film and it was great to see them all still acting and enjoying what they've done for so many years. Amelia Curtis as Denise, the forensic programmer was very memorable, as was Gesine Cukrowski as Jeannie Richardson, the Doctor's first and favorite victim. I watched it twice when I rented the dvd and I am seriously thinking of buying it on dvd so I can watch it again. The locations were extremely dark, dank and creepy. I checked as the credits rolled and noticed US, UK, Germany and Luxembourg in them. I haven't checked filming locations on IMDb yet, but I knew the film had a foreign air to it, which I feel lent to the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed it, myself, being a horror/scifi/fantasy/film noir addict all my life. I recommend everyone into those types of movies to rent it and give it a chance.

It is certainly at least as good as some others around the same time (remake of 13 Ghosts for instance). While the story line was similar to The Ring (which I suppose is a \"remake\" of Ringu), I still think it was original enough to not call it a copy-cat (even though the release date for The Ring was after FearDotCom, I have no idea which was actually in development first).\n\nEither way, it has a fairly descent \"creepy\" factor, and enough little shocks & gore to certainly make it better than one of the bottom 100 movies rated on IMDb (as of June 2004)."

(Actually, I voted it a three, though I meant to give it a two -- go figure! I must have been possessed by the spirits of the damned souls who had to market this garbage, let alone watch it.\n\nSpeaking of \"Spirits of the Dead\" (the omnibus film of Poe stories from the mid-'60s), did the visual trope of the child with the white ball lifted from \"Toby Damnit\" irritate anyone else? Is it supposed to be pleasing, lifting a cherished image created by the master filmmaker Federico Fellini and plopping it down in this garbage? What about the gloss on \"Brazil\" in the climax, where the doctor is caught in his torture chamber? Once again, the purveyors of \"fear dot com\" have glossed modern classics and far better filmmakers in the service of dreck, leading one to ponder a question for our age: Has film school destroyed creativity among directors? That's about as interesting an angle as I can make from this mess.\n\nPity poor Stephen Rhea, \"one of today's leading actors\" according to the movie's web site. His performance as the doctor makes Bela Lugosi in \"Bride of the Monster\" seem like Olivier's Hamlet by comparison! Watching him, a far far long way from his Oscar nomination for the Crying Game, I actually began to visualize him cashing his pay cheque while trying to maintain some kind of dignity; I feel that likely he failed, and the face he presented to the bank clerk that day must have looked as forlorn and ravaged as the visage presented here in this film. The only reason I can imagine the producers hired Mr. Rea is that they didn't have to pay for a fright wig to costume him with, such is the quality of his own coiffure, which along with the Brobdingnagian bags under his eyes, are about all that passes for characterization on his part IN THIS PART.\n\nBrad Dorf and Natascha McElhone are too WASPY, too California good looking-youthful vitality to be convincing as New Yorkers, let alone New Yorkers working for the NYPD and health department, respectively. Dorf is too young and doesn't \"look Irish\" to play Doghouse Reilly (when I heard his character's surname, I thought of fellow WASP Humphrey Bogart's joke, calling himself Doghouse Reilly to the little sister in Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\"; Dorf as a mick detective is a joke, though less funny.) McElhone looks like a fashion model. When she says she doesn't go out much, it was another unintended joke; a gal that looks like Natascha wouldn't be begging for male attention -- she'd be able to make a living as a kept woman, to put it less vulgarly. Both the leads just don't look right for their roles. In addition, the \"New York\" of the film is so patently false that they could have filmed it in Uzbekistan for the lack of verisimilitude.\n\nI went to see this turkey 'cause the L.A. Times critic said it was so bad it was funny. Well, it was as bad as the critic said, but aside from a couple of belly laughs triggered by some unintentionally awful lines, this wasn't enjoyable like \"Plan 9 From Outerspace\" or \"Bride of the Monster.\" It just plain was AWFUL.\n\nI ought to sue the Times for journalistic malpractice!"

As with that earlier effort, Malone has given us a film containing several frightening images, but a plot that is sorely lacking. Most people will not be satisfied with the picture as a whole, but some of the scenes we see may pop up later in our nightmares.\n\nThe film basically centers around a website where unlucky voyeurs can witness a man known as \"The Doctor\" torture and murder victims. Anyone who chooses to officially enter the site will die of their greatest fear exactly 48 hours later though! Gasp! They won't actually die of what they fear. The fear itself kills them... or something like that. The plot is a bit muddled, but all we know is this is a site you don't want to visit. Some people do, however, and our heroes Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone are out to find out what killed them. He's a cop, and she's some sort of public health official. At first they think some sort of Ebola-like virus is killing the victims since blood gushes from their eyes. It's not long before both of them are trapped and forced to play by the rules of this website.\n\nAll I can say regarding the plot is forget it! There are too many loose ends and contrivances for anything to possibly add up. We are never even sure who's in control of the website. Is it the doctor, or a young woman he tortured to death years ago? If the site is in fact a way for the young woman to seek revenge against voyeurs who want to watch sadism, then why does it star the man who killed her??? There are other problems besides plot to focus on. The acting is not particularly outstanding. This may be due to some of the European actors struggling to sound like Americans. Also, I know this I a horror film, but many of the scenes in this film are badly under-lit. Much of the dialog is sub-par, as well. The gore was trimmed drastically after this film was threatened with an NC-17 rating. Only in the last half hour does the film seem to find the right note. The dialog is toned down, and Malone gives us some dazzling visuals as our heroes enter The Doctor's lair to rescue a victim. The color is absolutely amazing in these late sequences.\n\nThe verdict: 5 of 10 stars. The film is creepy to look at, but that's about it. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this film would be to turn the sound down and have it playing in the background of a Halloween party. Now there's an idea! The Hound."

And very, very good.\n\nTrue, it's ruthlessly unpleasant to watch (in this regard, the comparisons to Se7en are very accurate) but the visuals are brilliant and the film succeeds in creating a true atmosphere of suspense that relies on genuine terror rather than cheap sound effects for its scares. The script is amazingly well written and demands as much from the viewer as the generally more sophisticated _One Hour Photo_.\n\nThe downside: although the actors are effective, the leads leave something to be desired. Some of the lines were grating and flat, leaving me to wonder if the Mr. Malone was actually instructing them to act badly. The bad acting doesn't really get out of control though, so the movie maintains cohesion.\n\nAll in all, a really good ghost story that is really closer to _What Lies Beneath_ than _House on Haunted Hill_. Not everyone's cup of tea, but you won't be indifferent to the experience."

Why then was this film so utterly panned by the critics and 'The Ring' so universally applauded? I, personally, do not get it. Each works in the universe in which its own rules apply, and niether is so outlandish in its execution as to warrant ridicule because of a weak plot line.\n\nGranted, 'The Ring' is much more subtle, and less graphic than 'FearDotCom', but the former is more of a Thriller, while the latter took the Horror route. This film is indeed graphic, actually showing the scenes of horror and torture, while 'Ring' typically implies these until the climatic ending.\n\nHerein may lie the answer. Both films are beautifully filmed with repetitive surreal thematic scenes recurring throughout each. Each has monochromatic artistic portions that blend in well with the rest of the film to give a bleak, dreary outlook of the worlds in which thier events take place. However, since 'Fear' has chosen to show the blood and viscera, it has earned the reputation as a \"slasher flick\"- a genre that has long since fallen into disfavor with critics and thier following of minions. Who could critically laud another \"Friday the Thirteenth\" regardless how good it was.\n\nI challenge you to watch both movies again and make your own comparison. Try a viewing without any preconceived bias against this film...I feel it will stand up to an equal comparison to the critically lauded 'Ring', female-lead acting notwithstanding. 7 out of 10, IMHO."

Unfortunately, this movie wasn't quite what I love.\n\nThe gore in this isn't blood-spattering, like in the remake of \"TX Chainsaw Massacre,\" which I was thankful for--at first. Instead, it's a cruelly sadistic enjoyment of torture and death for their own sakes. That made me uncomfortable, but I sat (or squirmed, rather) through the movie anyways. On the plus side, this movie *did* scare me. It scared my sister's boyfriend, too--we watched the 10:00 showing of it along with my sister, and the two of us were paranoid the whole night. My sister laughed at us--she thought it was decently spooky, but nothing that great. Since that first viewing, I've watched Fear.com twice. I don't know why I did it, but I continued to get just as scared. That's why I gave this movie a rating of 6/10--it scares me, and that's the point of a scary movie.\n\nAs for the intelligence I love so much in movies... I think that Fear.com was trying to be smart and unique with its premise. It succeeded, but only for a few seconds--I enjoyed the young couple with the camera for the way it was shot, and the idea of the little girl with the white ball was nice as well. Everywhere else the would-be intelligence failed. You thought things were explained, but then matters changed and more confusion came in. Just who is the lady that asks \"Do you want to play,\" and why wasn't she satisfied with being found? Why tell us that the male detective knew the killer from a previous case, only to completely ignore that until the last few minutes of the movie? Things pulled together about mid-way, then unraveled horribly. I was left confused, but in a bad way.\n\nLike I said, I gave Fear.com 6/10 points, but that's only because it scared me consistently. I think that's because I'm constantly online, and the idea of an evil, deadly website--however improbable and silly that seems--terrifies me at some basic level. For people that only use their computers to check e-mail and type up school reports won't have that problem, and a lot of the scare-power will be gone. For them, I give the movie pretty much what its IMDb rating is--a 3/10."

I enjoy high-brow and low-brow, expensive and no-budget, classic and modern. I have seen thousands of films and I can say, unequivocally, I have watched at least a dozen worse films. Okay, that was a little facetious. The movie wasn't too bad though I think it proved that horror movies should be made with budgets far less than 50 million dollars. You start throwing money at it and it ends up looking like a government project. You spend it because you have it, not because it needs it.\n\nTo begin, it is truly atmospheric. It's use of darkness and shadow is commendable in spirit though in practice it somehow misses the point. With almost 50 million dollars spent you do think that you should be able to actually see most of the movie. This isn't Orson Welles doing \"War of the Worlds\" on radio, this is a visual medium so lets see just a little bit of what is going on.\n\nThe characters: Does the actor say, \"like maybe I could be this world weary 32 year old cop with a three day growth of beard and a melancholy tone in my voice?\" Come on, unless he is working vice or undercover his chief is going to have a serious discussion about his personal grooming. And let's add about 15 or 20 years to his age if he is going to be that weary. A horror movie by nature gives us permission to set aside the concept of rhyme or reason, but please, give us a couple of believable, non-method actor's interpretations of the real thing.\n\nA health department official in the middle of a murder investigation? O.K., after all, Kelly McGillis was a civilian combat flight instructor in Top Gun so I can let that one slide.\n\nJeffrey Combs is totally wasted as is Stephen Rhea. I guess that when adding names to a high dollar film you inevitably waste a few good actors along the way.\n\nModern technology meets a fabricated 40's Noirish world, that is New York as portrayed by Luxembourg, in a cyberspace that takes suspension of disbelief to a new level.\n\nThe director was obviously influenced by Ringu/The Ring as well as by Italian horror by directors like Dario Argento. Throw in a dose of \"M\" with the the little girl and the bouncing ball and a small dose of \"Saw\" for a bit of B-movie flavoring. Of course if you are going to be influenced by the masters then at least use some of what you learned. Where is the gore? Color is made for mayhem. I guess it was lost in the blackouts.\n\nWas it a waste of two hours? No, but it isn't a two hours that I would nostalgically relive either.

The movie has tended toward the monochromatic all along, but now it abandons all pretense of admitting the color spectrum, and slides into the kind of tinting used in silent films: Browns alternate with blues, mostly...\".

Well, I guess \"those\" people were right! It's a nonsense movie and it does not scare ONE bit! It's also a waste of talent and money. The movie has good production values and the atmosphere it creates is full of doom and gloom (it reminded me of \"Bladerunner\" and even \"Seven\"). The story line is really annoying and confusing. We never know where the \"bad\" guy (the doctor, for those of you who've seen it) came from or what were his motives for killing people, \"snuff\" style on line. The thing about the \"ghost\" on line wasn't too convincing, and, near the end, all the visuals and make up effects scenes look like they're left overs from some Marylin Manson videos (the S&M costumes, the goth make up, the little girl with the \"shivering\" head, etc.). The director could easily do a Manson video with outstanding ease. And the acting was unconvincing to say the least. For a horror/Sci-fi fan like myself, I was thrilled to see the likes of Jeffery Combs (Re-Animator), Udo Kier (Dracula) and Nigel Terry (King Arthur in Excalibur) in minor roles, but their talents are shamelessly wasted with unimportant scenes and characters. And why Stephen Dorf accepted this is beyond my reasoning.\n\nIn short, a bad movie with a good budget and production and a story that won't scare a fly away. Maybe next time...."

I think it was ok.\n\nMaybe it's because I've visited here before and saw this bad rating before I've watched and it surprised me that it didn't suck at all.\n\nThe computer and audio effects were nice.. the only thing that I didn't like was its ending.\n\nMaybe the ending is the reason why it has such a bad rating. Anyway... this should at least be rated as 5.0 !!! I guess just because new thriller/terror movies use so much computer and 3d effects, doesn't make it can't be a good movie.. sure the storyboard most of the time isn't very good, but I don't get it.. '13 Ghosts' is another one that uses lots of effects and it's not really rated well in here. Both movies don't sound that original to me, but I enjoy watching it.. I wouldn't buy them on dvd though."

Make sure to throw in the old double-standard of \"sadism is bad but you can't get enough of looking at it, can you, filmgoer?\" and imagery lifted from \"Ring\" and \"The Cell\" with a nod to \"Se7en\" and you have this tedious, unfrightening exercise in \"film\" making.

Seriously?\n\nThis was made by someone who loved A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Ring, Seven and the Hellraiser direct-to-video sequels. In fact, I'm shocked this wasn't somehow turned into Hellraiser: Hell Online.\n\nTruthfully, I never had an interest in seeing this unless I had an urge for a bad movie night. My favorite YouTube channel covered this for their podcast so I had to subject myself to this mess. Now, I can listen to said podcast and it better be worth it.\n\nAnyone who visits, haha, fear dot com dot com, has about 48 hours before they perish and it's up to one terrible detective and the worst-ever Department of Health employee (who somehow got promoted to detective) to solve who's behind a bunch of deaths linked to this fear dot com dot com. Oh, and sleepwalking Jeffrey Combs is here to collect a paycheck.\n\nThe first half of this movie wasn't great, but not the worst I've seen. Somewhere in the middle this spiraled out of control and I have no idea how they could've messed this up any further. It just goes from bad to terrible and worse, this is probably 25 minutes longer than it needed to be.\n\nYes, this was made when the internet was still a baby and not everyone knew that much about \"logging in\" or \"being online.\" Of course, Hollywood (and definitely Japan) would capitalize on that as they did with many more movies made about the net and even VHS tapes. Mercifully and probably the only positive I could find: it wasn't really THAT dated, aside from a few small floppy disc moments and how they perceived subscribers.\n\nThere is zero reason to log into fear dot com dot com. Unless you're like me and needed to get the scoop before logging into Dead Meat's Podcast channel.\n\n***\n\nFinal Thoughts: You could have a drinking game with how Loosey Goosey the \"Department of Health\" takes potential virus crises. My favorites: the Health Associate's boss casually asks if what she found at a crime scene was Eboli and she just says no. \"Whew!\" solved. This and her swiftly jumping into a body of water that screams disease."

The actor of the doctor didn't look like he had any bills to pay, but at least Natasha's McElhone's acting was pretty well.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me the most were the plot holes.

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this when it first came out. I walked away not knowing how to feel about this film. I wanted to wait a long time before viewing it again. I just sat down and re-watched it after some 8 years. The film that left me confused, I then realized had haunted me over the years. The images and feelings were always in the back of my mind. There's a tone or feeling that I get when I think about this film that is soaked in a creepy melancholy.\n\nI wanted to know why this film gets such a bad rap when clearly it's well put together. After re-watching it, a few things became clear. First, the plot is a bit convoluted and requires that the audience pays attention to what's exactly going on. I don't think most people get that there are two websites. One that Alistair (the Killer) now runs called \"Distressed Furniture\" which is a \"Snuff\" website and one of his old websites called Feardotcom which he has abandoned so as not to get caught. The old site is now seemingly inhabited by a ghost or a residual evil in the wires. It is suggested in the story that possibly the internet has taken on a life of it's own as a Neuro-Net and that Jeannie (one of the killer's victims} is now become part of the internet's programming . An interesting, if Sci-Fi, idea for a horror film.\n\nAnother fault (not really) is that the film's morality is one of attacking the \"watchers\" of the killing of Alistair's victims. In some respects, we too are the watchers and revelers of the pain and suffering. Something that most audiences don't want to have to think about. The filmmaker has also chosen not make us feel all cuddly and fluffy in the end of the movie by rewarding us with a happy ending. There is a genuine sense of loss of life and innocence. I can easily see why the \"let's see some naked cheerleaders and slashing\" crowd would be pressing the #3 button on this film. The ideas in this film are actually quite interesting . All in all, a much better film what they would have you believe. I think this film is really an 8 but I gave it a 7 because I can't actually recommend it to general audiences or the \"Hockey Mask\" crowd."

They lined up a bunch of scary looking pictures and flashed them across the screen on a regular basis. By the end, I had no fear of \"The Doctor\", and the two main characters had somehow developed a relationship without me knowing it. There was no development of the previous murders and websites, or Dorf's pursuit of the Doctor. It was just BLAH.

Twenty years later, I gave it spin, hoping the techno themes would have become hilariously dated. It may not be everything I bargained for, but it did manage to hold my attention.\n\nThe concept of \"what if the internet, but like, evil\" is as ludicrous today as it was in 2002, and while they may lack flat screens and social media, the technology on display isn't as laughably archaic as it is in say, Lawnmower Man.\n\nThe film is surprisingly high budget, so it gets more things right from a production perspective than you might expect. Still amazing though that even with 40 mill in their back pocket, they still couldn't land the rights to the fear.com domain, making for a good laugh every time a character types out feardotcom.com. (Side note, fear.com does seem to be available right now, in case there's a remake in the works, haha)\n\nThe plot is all suspiciously familiar, but when you take the time to examine the timeline, the film can be forgiven, somewhat. It merges together several common 00s ghost horror tropes with a bit of a torture porn feel at times. While this owes an obvious dept to Ringu and Se7en, it also manages to predate both the American The Ring remake as well as Saw and Hostile. So it kind of sits at ground zero of two horror genres that would be driven into the ground over the coming decade.\n\nWhether it's a trailblazer or a copycat, it's still painfully predictable. The human antagonist is a stupidly over the top, Dr Giggles like character with none of the campy charisma, and the effects are a similarly try hard graphics overload. You may be able to have fun with this if you know what you're in for, but I can't say I disagree with the near universal disapproval."

This movie wasn't horrible, but it was so lack luster and lame that it wasn't fun in any way. I can appreciate filmmakers making bad movies and people having fun with their films because they're bad, but this wasn't really bad enough to make fun of.\n\nThe plot is that people are logging on to a snuff web-site. Two days after logging on, they die very horrible deaths. Stephen Dorff is a cop who is trying to track down the killer running the site. He's assisted by a health agent who is assigned to find out if this thing is a virus or what. They find out that one of the killer's victims (her ghost) is using the web-site to kill anyone who looks at at. There's some German kids, Udo Kier (who was probably thankful for a small, non-speaking part), and Stephen Rea as the killer.\n\nI'm not sure this deserves to be on the bottom 100 because it actually did have some budget. The plot was somewhat cohesive (even if incredibly lame), and the acting wasn't the worst I've seen. The film's major downfall is that it wasn't interesting or even fun to watch. I'd rather sit down and crack jokes at \"Giant Gila Monster\" for the 7,000th time than sit through this film for a second time. Unfortunately, it seems that the movie business has gone away from making films that are so bad that they're actually good to making movies (like this one) that just plain suck."

In addition the end-sequence offers one of the most beautiful artistic visual effects scenes for a long time, even if the ending comes to quick and leaves many questions open.\n\nDorff and McElhone, taking the lead of this movie, deliver nothing spectacular, but just the right performance for this kind of movie. Jeffrey Combs only appears a few times but it's always a pleasure to see him in a movie.\n\nBeing an experienced computer and internet user I usually don't agree how movies handle pc's and cyperspace because they generally do this in a ridiculous way. Fear.com however finds the right way to believable (although not realistic) add the internet into the movie, even if it doesn't come anything near Avalon's way of making a movie around computers.\n\nI didn't see the final cut and therefore I don't know what will be changed until its official release, the movie makes a perfectly finished impression and maybe could make it into the topten of the US boxoffice... maybe even topfive if the marketing is right.\n\nAlthough this is a movie you will have forgotten by the end of the day, you certainly won't do anything wrong if you are going to see this movie as long as you like dark and scary thrillers. Expect a well done frightening movie nothing more..."

During most of the movie I was incredibly distracted by the fact that it was impossible to see the characters. Once or twice this worked to frighten me because I was concentrating so hard to see the movie that when a sudden, disturbing, image popped up I was startled. Overall though, it was just highly frustrating. Perhaps they tried to save money by cutting out the lighting department so that they could afford the few special effects in the film.\n\nI watch a horror movie in an attempt to be frightened. This movie did not frighten me in the least. Yes, I screamed once, but that fell under the category of sudden, surprising, disturbing image. And yes, the sudden startlement passed after only a few moments.\n\nIf you wish to see a movie that will truly frighten you, watch Ringu, if you have a few hours with nothing better to do...this movie will suffice. I did not want my two hours back after watching it, but I must admit that it left something to be desired.\n\nAnd, in closing, I cannot stress just how frustrating the dim lighting of the film was. If it was not for that single fact, I might have truly enjoyed the movie."

It's sort of like a big, shiny car with no engine; it looks nice, but doesn't go anywhere. Maybe the problem with the film is that the premise is never explained by a better source than a drunk in a bar (seriously), or that it wastes so many talented cast members, including Stephen Dorff, Natasha McElhone and the great Stephen Rea, with it's incredibly inane dialogue and baffling scene transitions. Or maybe it's the fact that it's a horror movie with JEFFREY COMBS!!! (if you don't know who that is, you deserve this movie), and he's not in a starring role. But I think the main problem is that it's just a big tease; everything that portents terror turns out to be merely boring. The only scary thing about this movie is that someone, somewhere, might have enjoyed it."

What you need to do is most gingerly and carefully, take your head out of your own @ss, wash your face & hair, and watch 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL {1999} and 'PARASOMNIA' {2008} And then, if you don't like them, I will gladly put MY head up my own @ss...)\n\n(Do we have a deal...?)\n\n(Man, I'm getting WAY too snarky here - too much caffeine or Crack I think; or maybe putting too much caffeine IN my crack, I don't know...)\n\nGeez, what a way to start... Well, this film is honestly no 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL' or 'PARASOMNIA', but I truly felt that Malone did a fairly decent job with it. Look, maybe I'm a bit biased, but I would watch a frigg'n LEXUS commercial if Malone directed it! (Well, that MIGHT be pushing it just a bit... :)\n\nIt's been a while since I've read about this film, but I THINK I remember that it was the usual MINDLESS producers interfering with Malone's 'vision', if you will, that likely watered down the effectiveness of 'What Could Have Been' with this movie (how MANY times have we heard that?) Even the MASTER Del Toro got his frigg'n nuts handed to him the first time around by the ever-so-brilliant Weinstein Brothers when he directed his first excellent U.S. film 'MIMIC' - THANKFULLY, with his current stature, he was able to go back and re-edit it, so it is even better now. Even the great, ESTABLISHED Terry Gilliam had a creative board shoved up his @ss by the Weinsteins on the very entertaining 'BROTHERS GRIMM', but it still turned out pretty good despite their meddling.\n\nAnyway, back to THIS film, sorry... PLEASE try to give this movie a decent chance. Because, despite the Studio's interference and it's flaws, I honestly feel that Malone was able to do a lot in the way of creating effective visuals and a fairly decent mood that makes the movie just good enough to enjoy..."

So, of course when a horror movie comes out in the theaters, I flock to it.\n\nFearDotCom, sent to us from the same folks responsible for the disasterous remake HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, has a great scary basis for a plot. The plot really pulls you along, however, you cannot help but to feel disgust. The movie, like HAUNTED HILL, is overly graphic and is too much into the perversity of the supernatural (i.e. naked bleeding creatures, a doctor who strips down his victim and the filmakers allow us to view her in many uncompromising positions). What could have been a truly scary and mysterious movie, the filmakers had to go and screw it up by adding a strong, unecessary sexual factor.\n\nThe movie had a dark tone, however, it made no sense. The acting was off the wall and the characters were each confined in their own little square and could not push the borders. The scary scenes do for the most part scare you, but after the initial jump scene you are left uneffected.\n\nThe ending is also a major disappointment as we are left without a clue as to what happened to anyone. I was overall left very disturbed and uncomfortable, and I couldn't help but to wonder what the filmakers believed they were achieving with this film.\n\nBig screw-up once again by the filmakers of HAUNTED HILL, only because the movie did have me trembling at certain times, I rate FearDotCom a 3/10"

So, I was at the Pasadena Fangoria Convention this weekend and they were awesome enough to give us free passes to FearDotCom. I was stoked.\n\nUntil I saw the flick.\n\nThe plot is vaguely similar to The Ring (Ringo), but in the most basal, and dull, ways. Summarily, a dead female wants revenge on her male murderer and goes about it in the most silly of ways: via an Internet game.\n\nIf there was ONE second of clever dialogue or visuals, I may have melted and gave this more than a 2 out of 10. Too bad.\n\nI really dug House on Haunted Hill (except the crappy ending), so I know that William Malone can do better than this and Creature.\n\nI'm SO, sorry folks. I am such a big fan. PLEASE see Frailty, The (new & original) Ring, May, Ginger Snaps, and Dog Soldiers.\n\nBut FearDotCom is CRAP.\n\nWhy can't we get groovy horror flicks from big studios that aren't crap? Are they afraid of scaring us? Are they afraid of acknowledging our intelligence? Are they THAT scared?\n\nPlease give us fans good horror, but stop assuming we are morons."

It will make you appreciate Melanie Griffith's acting. This absolute muddled mess of an excuse of a joke of a film feels so recut and re-edited as to make any possibility of coherency moot. The film (shot in Luxembourg, doubling for New York) is laden with rotting European buildings and bizarrely accented supporting actors. The plot (ha!) deals with a serial killer who broadcasts his murders live on the web but can never be tracked down because -- get this -- he changes servers every time. One of his victims' ghosts takes over the internet in an effort to wreak vengeance on her killer. Which begs any number of questions: why doesn't the ghost go after the killer directly, why does the ghost kill cops trying to catch the killer and why doesn't the ghost -- who has the power to communicate over the net -- simply reveal the killer's whereabouts to the police?\n\nOh, that's right. There wouldn't be any movie if it made sense."

I went into the theater with semi-high hopes because the trailer sold me. But after I came out, I was repulsed and severely disappointed. To this day, I have to ask what I did to deserve watching this 'film.'\n\nThe makeup was interesting and the cameo by Udo Kier was cool, but after that, it was just two hours of let downs, fake scares, and an unapologetic look at extreme tortures done to women for people with a sick sense of entertainment. The dialogue is so banal and pointless that I felt like an eight year old wrote this. And also, the plot is incomprehensive. They say that many, many, many people visit this site and yet, only a few have died. Shouldn't the death rate in America in this film be at an all-time high because of this website?\n\nIf you want scares, rent The Ring. Rent the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Just rent something that isn't fear dot com. If you have a brain or a love of real horror, just slowly back away from this tripe and find something else."

Was I supposed to believe that Stephen Dorff(Mike)and Natascha McElhorne(Terry)had become so enamoured with one another (in a matter of hours) that they were willing to risk life and limb to save the other?

Unlike The Ring, though, this story is pretty messy and in all honesty I thought it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. It just ends up jumping about from one scene to the next and for me it just loses track of itself. Even Stephen Dorff as Detective Mike Reilly couldn't save this from going down the pan. In fact, none of the main stars are really that good in it. Natascha McElhone, as Terry Huston, is quite dire (but she was excellent in Ronin) and even Stephen Rea, as \"The Doctor\" Alistair Pratt, is as bland as a weak cup of tea.\n\nAll in all, this is a very disappointing movie and if you haven't seen it then don't worry because, believe me, you're not missing much at all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nobody liked this movie a bit. All the reviews were bad, and the staff at the video store tried to talk me out of renting it. Agreed, it's an unsuccessful movie, but dozens of bad horror movies come and go without arousing such widespread and vocal opposition. But the criticism was irrelevant because nobody reviewed it in terms of what it was trying for. The evident aim, and certainly the result, is a fusion of Asian horror film and European horror film, with a little horror anime thrown in: `Ring' meets `Suspiria' meets `Serial Experments Lain': an industrial-Gothic phantasmagoria; and the story and the visual design achieve it. But the music, which could have done it best, is just conventional horror-movie music, the script is patchy, and the direction is ham-fisted. The images which are disturbing are edited and scored so badly as to rob them of their effect. Whoever laid out the story must have seen every horror movie ever made and has swiped from a lot of them, in particular New Wave Asian (`Ring,' `Pulse,' `Cure,' `Evil Dead Trap'). The actors look inept (except for Michael Sarrazin, impressive as a cyber-prophet in decline) but, again, were evidently working toward a distinct style which didn't come off. Stephen Rea performs in exactly the same camp-Gothic manner as Geoffrey Rush in the director's last horror film.\n\nThe tv ads for this film, like those for the film \"Pet Sematary,\" suggested that it was about something other, and scarier, than what it's actually about. The ads suggested--and at the outset the film promises--a story about a violent and perverse web site that so corrupts its users as to infect them physically. I suspect that the unusually hostile reaction to this movie had a lot to do with an unwillingness even to consider the idea seriously. But the actual story turns out to be about a serial killer who sets up a live webcam feed of himself torturing and killing his victims: a disagreeable but scary idea, and one that someone was bound to stumble on sooner or later. And there's more: the ghost of one victim is haunting the website and, having died in the way she feared most, is taking revenge by doing the same to the site's users. This is an okay premise, and her inner child makes a good ghost (and a scary image). But it works only while we take it to be a pedophile image from the site; once we know what it is, it stops making sense: why would her unspoiled child-self look like something out of kiddie porn, and why would it be that side of her that leads people to their doom? And another thing: if, as it seems, her image on the site which interfaces with the users is her ghost, rather than what the web-designer-cum-serial-killer put up originally, how is it that he isn't on to this himself? We know he has the site up for viewing because in one shot he points at what is presumably a monitor and in the next shot we see the counter on the home page ticking off the number of subscribers. Which they're not, incidentally: people get into the site by clicking on a couple of buttons, not through CCBill. How does the site operate normally (so to speak)? Which of the things on it are the killer-webmaster's work, and which are the ghost's? We never know. And there's a lot else we don't know. A less opaque script, or more articulate direction, could have really made this into something."

Of course the man tries to heroically save the child only to be predictably run over (well, more pushed to the side strongly than run over) by the train in a lousy edited and acted sequence.\n\nSo, what about the plot? I won' t start going into it but let' s just say that this movie borrows more than a little from Ringu (wich as already been remade in the surprisingly effective The Ring): a female spirit exerts vengeance via an electronic medium, this time being the internet, people dying 2 days after seing what was not to be seen instead of a week. To solve the murders, 2 people are put on the case, Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone, and as the nemesis behind all the madness, Stephen Rea. One note about the acting: it is completely and utterly horrible!! How could talented actors be wasted this way??!! The acting is so bad, it' s like watching headless chickens running around screen for a hour and a half!! Man! Stephen Dorff has seen some better days (his Deacon Frost in Blade was pretty effective) but I am totally shocked to see Stephen Rea and Natascha McElhone make complete fools of themselves in this trash!! And they' re American accents are actually funny to hear!Especially Rea for putting too much of a southern twang on it! Only the always reliable Jeffrey Combs seems to have fun with his role.\n\nThe director, William Malone, does a overblown attempt at conveying a creepy atmosphere, mostly by underlighting everything (even in broad daylight) and by shooting every scene \"music video\" style. It almost worked before in his last movie, House on Haunted Hill, a movie that I enjoyed a great deal more than Feardotcom because it didn' t take itself too seriously in the first place (come on! Chris \"Corky Romano\" Kattan was in it!). It's true that the script really is not the greatest material available (from an original story by Moshe Diamant, producer of countless Van Damme movies: that tells you about the quality at work here!) but come on, really, how can a director can expect us to be scared by a scene in wich Dorff tries frantically to close a elevator door because a bouncing ball is coming fast towards him??(I'm not making this up!)\n\nSo, in the end, if you are a serious film buff, avoid at all costs, but if you are like me and are a fan of bad cinema and want a good laugh, Feardotcom is worth it! It' s so bad, it is good! I particularly liked how the love blossoms between the 2 leads: McElhone asks Dorff to promise to not go see the damned internet site, then he comes to hug her, dissolve to McElhone asleep in a bed, Dorff getting up and going away, but not before looking at her in a caring, loving way (well, as much as he can portray!). And before that scene, there was no real sign of the two of them being attracted to one another! This scene is priceless I tell you!\n\nOh, and if you plan on watching this with your buddies, I have got a good drinking game associated with this movie: every time McElhone says \"Oh my God!\", everybody take a shot! You' ll be pretty drunk by the end!"

The actors did a nice job, the story fitted and was very original, the images were nicely filmed and did really create a strange sphere, which brought the 'fear' into the living room. At least, that is what I think. We used this movie on a \"horrornight\" with a group of fellow movie fans, and they voted an 8 for this movie, just like I am doing now. I think that's a very reasonable number.\n\nGreetings from Belgium, Thomas"

I think they may have been going for something similar to Se7en in tone but fell very, very short of the mark.\n\nThe one redeeming feature of this film is its internet naivety - its set shortly before the whole Web 2.0 thing and because of this the titular scary website appears to be hosted on an angelfire or tripod site which I found amusing.

        "review_detailed_main": "i think this movie is better than se7ven and ringu combined. the tone and atmosphere are like in se7en and ringu and the plot is remotely similar to ringu ( i saw ringu in china in 1998 and i know that ringu is banned in usa to protect the box office sales of the 2002 american remake called the ring, which is inferior to the original. ) i don't know why feardotcom is rated so low here. is it because feardotcom is produced in europe? again, feardotcom is unfavorably edited in usa to be not in conflict with the ring. two foreign movies were butchered to guarantee the success of an american film?\n\nthe special effects makes this film dark and gritty. the real life images were desaturated and hallucination sequences were heavily colorized. this film has surpassed both se7en and ringu in this department.\n\nas for the total degree of thrill, this is also a winner. it is hard to find a horror movie that really scares you, taking for the recent \"jason x\" and \"scary movie 2\" for example. yet, my heart is pumping and blood is rushing to my nose while watching this film.\n\nthe only persons that i would not recommend this movie to are people with cardiovascular or neurological disorders. there might be a risk of life. other mature minds shall all go and see it.\n\n9/10 and the missing one point is for the not so original plot. otherwise a perfect horror movie."

        "review_title": "A great psychological horror film. If you see the right version.",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are two versions of this film. One is the R rated US version, they had to cut out quite a lot of important plot points to get it down to an R. That version is why there are so many bad reviews. The 18 certificate UK release, and versions in other parts of the world doesn't have nearly as many cuts so it makes sense. This version is a great film.\n\nFirst off this is a dark film noir horror. It's not a slasher or a creature feature. It's closer to something like a Hitchcock slow burn but with more violence and gore. The noir aspects just add to that. There is a science fiction element to the plot as well, it takes a scientific concept dials it to 11 so it reaches the edges of implausibility, if you enjoy a lot of Sci/Fi you'll have not trouble with that.\n\nOf the cast Natascha McElhone is the stand out. She isn't a scream queen or a victim. She is a competent professional woman who holds it together under extreme duress. However she isn't pushy or overcompensating. She has inner confidence and it makes for something very different.\n\nBecause of the butchering by the MPAA this film was DOA. Yet the alternate cut available in the UK and elsewhere shows that there is a great film in there, and it has a cult following. However even then this is a film for grown ups. It doesn't spoon feed you, you have watch and you have to think. If your idea of a horror film is a PG-13 teen scream then this isn't for you. However if you want something that looks unique and makes you think then you should hunt down the uncut version.\n\nIn a just world there would be a Directors Cut available. However that Weill likely never happen."

        "review_detailed_main": "True. It has flaws beyond bad or anything known as bad within this dimension within time and space we live in. But you know what? For a film as bad as Alone In The Dark (AITD movie has a 1% on Rotten Tomatoes), it probably comes nowhere as near or even close. True, this movie is very bad and literally has a mixture of too much plot with absolutely no plot at all, has literally either too many clich\u00e9s or beyond too many for that matter, the acting,writing, and screenplay is sometimes very,very,very poor for a movie that made on a \"very unquestionable budget of $40M-42M dollars\", and yes, in itself, this is a horror movie, like The Fog remake, that has really questionable quality, and that this movie is a rip-off of Se7en, The Ring (both the original Japanese 1998 movie and it's American remake which came out the year this one came out), Kairo, Videodrome, and last but not least, the 1998 movie Strangeland. But do you want to know something? For a movie that seems to have 0% genius, this movie is as if it were made by someone who was just maybe, just maybe a genius, during the silent era, or at least the German Expressionist era. I guess this movie does seem to at least have some genius. 4.0 would probably be a better rating for this on this site."

        "review_detailed_main": "FearDotCom is a thoroughly lazy, deeply awful hunk of excrement. What makes it so bad is the sheer potential of its concept, squandered on a brain-meltingly generic serial killer story that we've all seen hundreds of times. After a rainy prologue (the whole thing seems to take place in a perpetual monsoon) involving a short lived and painfully underused Udo Kier, we're told that multiple victims have begun to disappear 48 hours after logging on to some freaky website called fear.com. The rest of the film could have gone a bunch of different cool and inspired ways, but nooo\u0085 instead it plods along with a Detective (Stephen Dorff) and a sanitation worker (Natasha McElhone should know better than to take a second look at scripts like this) as they hunt the proprietor of the web domain, a nasty yet ultimately boring murderer played by Neil Jordan's thespian of choice, Stephen Rea, who also should know better than to wander into this mess. Now, all that could be forgiven, seeing as how potential is pisssed away every hour in Hollywood, it's just par for the course. But where the film really, truly messes the bed is it's DVD art. I remember specifically avoiding the aisle that housed this flick back in the days of blockbuster, because the images on the cover were so uniquely scary. There's a horrific looking mannequin girl, dead bodies arranged in a way that would give Dali nightmares and just a general uneasy look to the box. Thing is, none of that stuff actually shows up in the film anywhere. It's either a con job, butchered editing or the industry's hugest distribution error. For years I was petrified by those images, only to finally get a chance to see the thing, and go: \"This?! This is the film that that wickedly memorable horror show of a cover advertised!? Weak\u0085\" All we get out of it is a dour, boring, barely conscious bottom of the barrel shocker outing that leaves no lasting impression whatsoever. You're better off buying the DVD, whipping the disc off your balcony like a frisbee and framing the cover on the living room wall to freak your kids out."

I seen it around that time so that could be a reason why I give it a good rating. It is just one of those movies that has stuck to me through the years.\n\nThe film is about people who log onto Feardotcom.com and end up mysteriously dying 48 hours later. A detective and a woman who studies viruses team up to stop the girl behind the computer as they logged on.\n\nOne thing that always gets me is how this movie actually isn't any more popular due to it coming out when computers were getting big. I find the film haunting beautiful since it is shot in a rainy New York scene for all of the movie. The woman portraying the girl on the screen is good at doing a seductive killer who is haunting yet beautiful. I will say the acting is good but Natasha slightly lacks expression. If you know me, I am a big Stephen Dorff fan and this is just another movie he has excelled in."
