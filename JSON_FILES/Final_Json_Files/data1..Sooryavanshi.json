Sooryavanshi and his team are in charge of neutralizing this havoc. Will they succeed? If yes than at what cost?\n\nCinematography & Direction: Average (Typical Rohit Shetty). A power pack entertainer which most of people would enjoy.\n\nActing (& music): I am not great fan when these things come. For example, we see Javed as comic artist so his portrayal failed. The comic nature of Vanshis to jumble up names is far away from fun. Vanshi aka Akahay looks old and comparison with other officers like Javed feels desperate. I liked Simmba's part although where he explains the consequences. Music was average.\n\nFinal Verdict: Singham and Simmba were better movies. I can't believe we waited so long for this movie. Disappointed."

A few car wrecks, slow motion walking, sunglasses wearing top cop who single handedly destroys a network of terrorist sleeper cell. Wish combating real life terrorist were that simple. To top it up the movie makers prey on people's patriotism and emotion by seemingly dedicating the movie to the brave men of law. Wow quite a scam to get money from your wallet to their coffers. Akshay Kumar should know it takes more than just hanging from helicopters, making snide remarks and belittling others in a movie to be respected as an actor. Katrina presence was barely felt in the movie. I guess at 38 her days as a leading actress is winding down. Ajay Devgun and Ranveer were thrown into the pot just in case the audience got tired of Akshay's antics. Folks this movie didn't work for me."

The fourth instalment of Shetty's Cop Universe, it stars Akshay Kumar as Anti-Terrorism Squad chief DCP Veer Sooryavanshi opposite Katrina Kaif with supporting cast of Jackie Shroff, Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Niharica Raizada, Vivan Bhatena, Sikandar Kher, Nikitin Dheer and Jaaved Jaaferi. Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh in extended cameo appearances reprise their roles of Singham and Simmba from the franchise's previous films.\n\nKumar's character was announced towards the end of Simmba that served as a character introduction of Sooryavanshi. Initially locked for theatrical release on 24 March 2020, it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The film was scheduled for theatrical release on 30 April 2021. In April 2021, the release date of film was postponed indefinitely due to the rise in COVID-19 cases and lockdown in Maharashtra."

We need something new and different, even though I'm sure these movies are bringing in box office numbers so I doubt it'll change.\n\nThe dialogue wasn't as cringe, though there were many unfunny moments. The Tip Tip Barsa Pani song and overall romantic storyline with Katrina felt out of place; the movie could've done without it. The story brought in Ranveer Singh and Ajay Devgan for that blockbuster cast - but this movie could've done without them.\n\nOverall, it was a good action movie - didn't have high expectations and wasn't disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sooryavanshi review :\n\nFinally something for the theatre owners to cheer about. Also for us, the audience!!\n\nThe first major Bollywood theatrical release since March 2020 (Baaghi 3 was the major release just before Corona struck us); Sooryavanshi can be called an ideal festive dhamaka to pull back the audience to cinema halls which have sadly, been shut or running empty since then...\n\nRohit Shetty's cop universe extends to Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an ATS officer, who along with Singham (Devgn) and Simmba (Ranveer) take on the terror group (Jackie Shroff and company) planning to blow up Mumbai once again. \u00c0 la March 1993.\n\nAkshay is in top form again after Bell Bottom (2021) and the Bangkok action stunts are a treat to watch reminding us of his daredevilry in Sabse Bada Khiladi (1995). Katrina Kaif, playing his wifey, sizzles the screen in the remixed 'Tip tip barsa paani' number from Mohra (1994) though I preferred Raveena's sensuous jhatkas from the original. Yea, the plot is typical '90s stuff but cleverly updated to present times.\n\nInfact, the first half is a breeze watch with all the action, emotions and drama unfolding at a super fast pace. Rohit even brings a secular touch in a particular scene where Muslims help Hindus to take Ganpati idol from Mandir to a safe place in course of a terror strike even as a remixed \"Chodo kal ki baatein...Hum Hindustani\" song plays in the background. Pop bhaichara, indeed!!\n\nPost interval, the film dithers and withers a bit as the screenplay appears to be in a tearing hurry to introduce its two main cameo characters - you know who!!\n\nRanveer Singh and Ajay Devgn make their grand entry and then, Shetty completely lets the action department take charge. Which ain't a bad decision at all as the stunts are imaginatively executed. Notably, the continous shot of Ranveer bashing up a dirty dozen is superb. Taalimaar!!\n\nThe dialogues are massy, the technical aspects are okey dokey and the end finale promises to carry forward the franchise with a Singham sequel. Clearly, the focus is to entertain. Nothing more. Nothing less. And that is important...in the current times when audience hasn't been to theatres since early 2020. In that sense, Sooryavanshi truly achieves its objective. And thats why it should be seen. Only in theatres please!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

Honestly the hand to hand combats is one of the good ones that came out from Bollywood in recent times.\n\nAkshay, amidst all biopics, managed to do a good action film and thanks to Shetty, the scenes are pretty good.\n\nAlthough it was fun to see Singham and Simba since multistarrers are always a welcome idea, Ranveer Singh has reached the time where his 'pseudo hyper' behaviour has become irritating. Forgivable here since Simba is a character, but he isn't entertaining anymore.\n\nKudos to shetty for improving the quality of film making post Dilwale and other pile of forgettable craps. If he keeps up to rational zone in stunts and comic scenes, he can very well helm a Mission impossible like film soon.\n\nCons- Plot is predictable Story is cliche.\n\nTried too hard to white wash govt moves and forced scenes on 'Hindu-Muslim' unity. Why?\n\nAkshay looks really old especially on side shots of face.\n\nMovie could ve been a bit shorter.\n\nKatrina Kaif was wasted for just 10mins of entire movie, failed to create an emotional attachment to characters.\n\nPros- Good action scenes on Bollywood standard.\n\nDecent CGI.\n\nCasting is real good esp Javed Jaffrey.\n\nSome jokes work.\n\nIs it bad? Not as previous shetty movies.\n\nIs it good? Maybe.\n\nIt sure is entertaining."

Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is handled the mission by his superior Kabir Shroff (Jaaved Jaaferi), who though was the star of solving the '93 bombing case but he still regrets some of the choices he made.\n\nSooryavanshi, along with managing his family issues with wife Riya (Katrina Kaif), investigates the missing RDX which, they get a leak about, could be used for multiple bomb blasts in Mumbai. With help from his old colleagues Simmba (Ranveer Singh) & Singham (Ajay Devgn), Sooryavanshi races against the time, hoping to stop the ticking bomb avoiding a lethal disaster.\n\nI expected from this year's biggest hit movie that it will be successful in giving good comedy and action. But despite being a mass entertainer, the film does not get any kind of entertainment. There was no crispiness in the action scenes. The very important helicopter chase scene's VFX looks straight out of a low-budget-high-ambitions movie.\n\nThe only good thing about the movie was Singham's entry.\n\nPostive -\n\nLittle Bit Comedy Singham's Entry\n\nNegative -\n\nStory Horrible Direction Overacting and lack of acting Poor Vfx."

Katrina Kaif's performance is okay and of course not to forget about Simmba and Bajirao Singham. Their performance in the climax was the main highlight of the film. Action sequences are breathtaking and realistic, cinematography is top notch, the songs remind us the nostalgia and freshness and visuals are next level.\n\nAn out and out next level Rohit Shetty style action flick and he kept our promise by expanding the cop universe series.

And has the wait been worth it? It has for Akshay Kumar's character but not so much for the trio; which is why I left the theatre less enthusiastic than I entered it.\n\nVeer Sooryavanshi is a part the Anti-Terrorist Squad. His team has been trying to track down 600kgs of explosives that was buried someplace in India after the 1993 blasts. When they arrest a sleeper cell agent, a chain of events unfold potentially putting the nation in danger.\n\nAkshay Kumar returns as Veer Sooryavanshi after his character was teased at the end of Simmba. Akshay's police avatar is the most believable of the lot (among the three) given that he performs most of his stunts and they are less over the top. Also, it is always a delight to watch him onscreen especially when he seems committed to the role. Co-star Katrina Kaif doesn't have much to do (that was a given). Ranveer Singh & Ajay Devgn, who reprise their roles from Simmba & Singham enter the film only during the climax. This doesn't give the trio sufficient time to bond and their scenes feel rushed. Would have loved to see more of them together. Devgn also explicitly announces Singham 3.\n\nThis is the first film in the Shetty cop universe that has an original story. And this works in the film's favour to an extent (better than the other three). But the plot is mostly the same: old- terrorists with unfinished business, religious divide, the hero preaching to anyone who will hear & some harmless work banter. Nevertheless, it is a mass entertainer and it is the perfect excuse to return to the theatres."

She's a -4 when rated out of 10.\n\nThe only bright spots in the movie are probably the scenes with Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. The movie picks up post Ranveer's entry and Ranveer's brilliance carries it through\n\nI wonder if these \"Established Actors\" actually read and study all aspects of the movie before signing them.\n\nMy rating is only for Ranveer Singh's part and that of Ajay Degvn's."

It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible."

In my opinion whole movie is forced just to announce Singham 3. Rohit sir we know your love for ajay sir but this is not the way.\n\nMost disappointing thing is the song 'Tip tip barsa paani' there was never a need for this song in the film. Singham's entry was too hyped but couldn't deliver upto the mark, Although i enjoyed simmba's comedy, it was not needed in the climax scene.\n\nThe only good thing about the film was the temple scene, where the Hindu-muslims harmony can be scene. The bangkok chase scene was just not needed.. they should learn from 'DON 2' how to present a good chase scene. Although i didn't liked the film, my friends loved it.\n\nI can totally understand why they loved the film. Its not a good sensible movie but can be enjoyed with friends & family. A typical mass entertainer for audiences who love to whistle in theatres. Katrina's acting was pathetic, it's been 19 years and she still can't act.\n\nAkshay kumar can't even cry perfectly, he's just made for comedy movies and he should stick to that. Have seen every akshay kumar films and can say for sure he can't cry in screen. First half was very slow & dull, never for once felt excited before interval. 2nd half was decent.\n\nOverall it's a decent one time watch for mass audience and everyone should watch it once to support our theatres & bollywood. Expected more from Rohit sir but it's okay he is also human. Waiting for Singham 3 and hope it will not disappoint us.\n\nMy ranking (4/10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, perfect Bollywood masala movie to pull crowd for a theatrical release.\n\nPositives - 1. Akshay Kumar has aced the portrayal of a superhumanly police/army/intelligence officer in typical big budget patriotic/cop movies, hence he nails the role of ATS officer Veer Sooryavanshi.\n\n2. Well paced story line and very few unnecessary sub plots.\n\n3. Adrenaline pumping background score specially during chase sequences, goosebumps can be felt.\n\n4. Effective communication of communal unity, patriotism at multiple instances.\n\n5. Worthy acting by supporting cast and antagonists.\n\nNegatives - 1. Poor comic timing and overacting by Ranveer Singh. Why on earth a cop would crack PJ while diffusing RDX explosive about to burst in 1 min. ???\n\n2. Unnecessary sub plot of Sooryavanshi's love life. To be honest, the love story adds nothing to main plot and serves no purpose in pacing the track of movie.\n\n3. Illogical action and chase sequences which defy all laws of nature. Rohit Shetty needs a mature approach to direct action as audience are not living in 2010.\n\nSummary - Decent one time watch provided you don't think too much about logic.\n\nJust chill, relax and enjoy the adrenaline rush !!!"

It's not a very complex story; it's rather easy to follow and enjoy whatever the film has to offer, ranging from the stunning action sequences to music to bits of humor. This is a proper \"mass\" movie designed for fans of escapist cinema and especially the action genre aficionados."

In the last two years of pandemic we have seen much better Movies on Netflix,Amazon Prime and Zee. Just because it has a big star cast doesn't makes it a good movie."

Director has done a great job for this movie. Akshay Kumar , Ranveer Singh , Ajay Devgan, Katrina Kaif all made this movie perfect. Because there were so many popular actors in this film, it was not boring at all. It was my best time spent watching movie after so long. It just refreshed me and my family. Hope Bollywood will produce this kind of movies more in the coming future. And if you are reading it upto here and haven't watched the movie yet, then I highly recommend you to go and watch this film."

I wish they had stuck the first part's theme & tempo.\n\nAK is the lead and fun to watch. KK is attractive as usual & not required to do much acting (which is good). Ranvir Singh's entry marks the downward spiral of the movie. His Simmba role continues and is not really funny or thrilling. Jackie Shroff is impressive in his role and a relief from Rohit Shetty's corny dialogs and the usual distractions for communal harmony and what not.\n\nWorth watching one time."

It's an improvement and his best film post Singham (2011).\n\nSongs were decent except the romantic number.\n\nSome dialogues were really good and impactful.\n\nOverall from a movie point of view 6.5/10 Entertainment value - 8/10\n\nA superb commercial entertainer after a long time."

The movie is recommendable, but action in the end was prolonged a lot, which robbed us of some charm and time. The main reason for recommendation is the relevance of the topic and its subtle noble message for which we need to thank its producers."

Alas, that's probably my mistake. The 2nd half is a big let down.\n\nFor the sake of it, they had to add an item song. The action scenes are over exaggerated and the story goes down the drain too. Most of the 2nd half is used to sensationalize the protagonists.\n\nThe one thing the movie does absolutely right is in choosing the actors for negative roles. There are more than one negative characters in the movie and all of them are brilliant."

We are informed that this is a \"cop universe\" and hopefully more movies will follow. This is a typical Rohit Shetty movie providing never ending full on masala entertainment. So get your popcorn and settle down to see some jaw dropping action, cars crash landing or getting blown up and general mayhem. Not a scratch on our heroes, the hair and goggles in place even as they bash up the baddies and as they jump up and somersault they keep shooting them down with alarming accuracy. Yes there is a story but who needs it anyway. Its all been done before. We are given an elaborate introduction by way of visuals of the 1993 serial blasts and 26/11 attacks before being informed that some strikes are planned by terrorists which must be quashed. So Suryavanshi to the rescue. He is not only daring and brave but also smart and diplomatic as he lectures a hostile crowd on the difference between good and bad muslims thus convincing a Maulana to permit him to arrest the criminal. Since the terrorists are in good number, Suryavanshi takes help of Simba and Singham to eliminate all of them and both willingly oblige. Akshay Kumar will thrill the audiences as usual. The movie provides \" no questions asked\" entertainment for the masses. The bonus is a sizzling dance number by Katrina Kaif."

The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother Sooryvanshi is good but it is not upto the mark the way we audiences were expecting it .But it was good to be back in theatres after Covid-19."

Movie starts well with good visuals . The director introduced all the characters in starting of 15 minutes and builded a base for the second half. The first half started well but going on it could make you feel bore in some scenes and the first half will be end with a mass interval . The second half is so gripping that you won't know how the film has been completed. Akshay kumar and Katrin kaif scenes are well developed and asusuall Ranveer singh and Ajay Devagn completely pulled their characters .\n\nThe drawback of the film is songs. I think there is no need of having songs in this film . Except Aila re Aila . This song is a eye feast for all Akshay kumar fans . The highlight of the film is Background score which totally makes you get goosebumps in action sequence.\n\nThe story is quite old but the execution and development is good . Overall you can watch a perfect movie with your family for this festive season."

And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!\n\nThe film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An eye for an eye, makes the world blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The sequence where Akshay is chasing John (Sikander Kher) is a visual delight.\n\nAkshay Kumar delivers a knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots -- he justifies her super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large."

At one point they'll be on an extremely impactful and distressing scene making you feel sad/enraged and in just the next scene the characters start throwing cheap jokes and gags as if they didn't just witness gory murder right in front of them seconds ago. The movie has no sense on how to transition from a sad scene to one with lighthearted comedy and often mixes the two which clearly shows how insensitive the writers are. Around 30-45 minutes of screen time is wasted on unnecessary sermons on religious peace and virtue signalling on how people of different religions should interact. The songs in the movie are absolutely unwarranted for, they appear out of nowhere and with zero conjunction to the plot. The soundtrack is extremely loud and out of sync with the scenes. The writers also do a terrible job with antagonist's backstory, the way they portray the wretched psychopaths makes you feel like the writers want you to sympathise with them. Don't even get me started on the endless plot-holes. Having liked the movie Singham a bit, I felt I could go and watch this movie for the pompous and exaggerated fight scenes, however I couldn't be more disappointed. This movie doesn't have a single decent action sequence, all scenes are gunfights with the main characters having 100x plot armour. Overall this is probably the worst movie I've ever watched and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a functioning brain."

        "review_detailed_main": "Its a typical Rohit Shetty movie. First half has story while the second half has non-sense level action. Its way too loud with the title music. Ajay Devgan cameo is disappointing, although Ranveer Singh's cameo is refreshing. Katreena Kaif is forgettable. She is only there for the \"tip tip\" song. Its surprising that in 2021 there are two out of blue full length songs in the movei. It breaks the flow.\n\nThe reason I gave it 7 stars rather than 3 or 4 is because of a positive Hindu-Muslim stance taken by Rohit Shetty, This is desperately needed in our country which is being increasingly getting polarized and divided. I truly believe Bollywood can do what our politicians, media and general twitter/Facebook public has failed so far.\n\nThe scene where Muslims help carry Ganesh statue is quite touching. The background score of \"Chodo kal ki baatein kal ki baat purani\" is very apt. Brought a tear in my eye.\n\nKudos Rohit Shetty and more courage and support for others to follow!"

He can do both comedy and intense scenes with perfect ease. To my surprise, katrina kaif has given a nice performance. Her dialogue delivery was pretty good compared to her old performances. The supporting cast is pretty good.\n\nBackground score-what a brilliant background score!! You can literally feel the thump in your heart whenever the title theme plays in the background. Especially, the entry sequemces of the three superstars is epic.\n\nSound mixing-one of the finest sound mixing i have ever seen. Mixing the gunshots with background music is a pretty tough job and they have done it superbly. Impressive!!\n\nAntagonists-when the team of antagonists include stalwarts like jackie shroff, kumud mishra, gulshan grover and all you have to know they are not leaving it easy. A perfect team of antagonists.\n\nIf you try to find logic in it you are searching for the wrong notes. Go to the theatres, enjoy the film and entertain yourselves. This is a proper mass entertainer. I rate it 9 out of 10."

        "review_title": "Akshay Kumar In & As Sooryavanshi Is High On Style, Show And Action Thrills. Rohit Shetty Perfectly Made This For Big Screen !!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rohit Shetty has brilliantly expanded his cop universe over the years - keeping the audience engaged and die-hard fans of the genre on the edge. After the Singham series (headlined by Ajay Devgn) and then Simbaa (starring Ranveer Singh), now storms in Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), amidst much fanfare, drama, and blaring theatrics. Sooryavanshi's character was subtly announced towards the end of Simmba. The film has all the elements, attitude, style, showmanship and heavy-duty star power expected of a Rohit Shetty offering.\n\nSimilar to Simmba, even this cop action saga is narrated by Ajay Devgn, who reminds us of the several terrors attacks which Mumbai has encountered since the 1993 serial blasts to the 2008 terror attack on several landmark locations in Mumbai, including The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). The story in film unfolds as the biggest attack is yet to happen in the city, as some sleeper cells from Lashkar have been activated and it is found that 600 kilos of RDX left over from '93 serial attacks is being used for the purpose.\n\nEnter DCP Veer Sooryavanshi, with a solid mission and a lot of garam khoon to protect the city from another big attack. He is so committed towards his duty that even his family, wife Riya (Katrina Kaif) and son Aryan come second to his mighty task at hand.\n\nWith the cross-border plot, the film revolves around the concept of revenge, 'An Eye For An Eye, Makes The Whole World Blind.' While the story itself plays it safe (basic and predictable), the action is risky and rousing (Rohit Shetty and Suniel Rodrigues). The chase sequence between Veer and John (Sikander Kher) on the streets of Bangkok is a visual delight.\n\nAkshay Kumar delivers a powerful, praise-worthy, knockout performance. From his seeti-worthy entry to the relentless gunshots - he justifies his super cop act. Apart from the high adrenalin physical encounters, there are umpteen high drama chases, with cars, bikes and helicopters as Akshay Kumar displays his unquestionable action skills. Overall, it's an Akshay Kumar's show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large. Katrina Kaif looks stunning on screen and her sensual moves to the iconic song 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' is undoubtedly clap-worthy, but you can't not think of the original 'Mast Mast' girl of Bollywood, Raveena Tandon.\n\nAjay Devgn's and Ranvir Singh's smashing (quite literally) entry in the second half elevates the film and adds the striking punch. As Bajirao Singham and Sangram Bhalerao respectively, the three actors steal the show in the final 20 minutes of the show where they have performed together.\n\nThe ensemble cast, which includes Jackie Shroff as the leader of terrorist gang Omar Afeez, as well as other group members Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh, Kumud Mishra and Nikitin Dheer, makes a substantial contribution to the plot's progression. Jaaved Jaaferi's portrayal of ATS head Kabir Shroff, on the other hand, perfectly plays his serious cop part.\n\nWhile the background score of Sooryavansi sets the mood, the songs are not particularly memorable. The revamped version of 'Najaa' is an earworm, but we don't get to hear it in the film. However, the trio dancing to Daler Mehndi's 'Aila Re Aillaa' is entertaining.\n\nVeer Sooryavanshi, Akshay Kumar has successfully taken over the mantle from his predecessors (Singham and Simmba), and with a generous dose of flying and somersaulting cars, this one is quite a bumper Diwali entertainer for you. And if you are a fan of high voltage action movies, go lap this up!"

But it was worth the wait. What an entrance! That, plus the ensuing action sequences delivered all the over-the-top, just shy of campy, butt-kicking heroics any of his fans could hope for.\n\nProps to Akshay, as well, for his fine job in the fights and chases - especially doing his own stuntwork in the helicopter bit. Jackie Chan would have been proud to have that one on his highlight reel."

It keeps dragging along. So many situations arrive when story could have interesting scenes and build into a storyline. But the director refuses to do anything worthwhile. It feels like Ferrari is being driven on first gear. The story never takes off. However, during last 1/3 of the movie, it feels like the director just gave up and found it too stressful. He just told his crew members that he is going home and bored with this movie stuff and pack off. Movie suddenly goes into comedy mode with the entry of Ranvir Singh and Ajay Devgan. It makes the movie totally laughable and unbearable. It keeps you wondering what's the point of this whole movie? Katrina Kaif pathetic acting and Ranvir's overacting drags it down further."

The whole movie is a scam not a worth waste of time. Watch Eternals atleast they have a better story and action."

Female lead hardly had a strong role or much screen time as in most Rohit Shetty films. Plot was predictable indian cops vs Pakistani terrorists which has been done a million times. Rohit Shetty movies are getting bad to worse as are his comedic references as each movies passes by. I left at the interval thats how terrible it was. Waste of money, pointless, robotic and divisive. Why do opposite countries have to always be enemies why can't they be portrayed as friends instead of us vs them. Ridiculous and horrible. Not worth the watch."

The character , plot driven moments as well as the emotional & humorous moments are really nice & nicely balanced . It also makes an attempt at tugging at your anti terrorism & religious sentiments & rightfully succeeds in that department . Entire supporting cast including @GulshanGroverGG & others really make an impact with whatever screen time them . Nice 1st half even better 2nd half as the ATS are in a race against time to diffuse a bunch bombs . The presence of Singham & Simba in the climax is nicely weaved & is a moneyshot moment that elevates the concluding portions of the movie . Singham's brief standalone moment in the climax is really nice which is a teaser to #Singham3 . This is @iamrohitshetty 's best movie yet I wonder how he'll top it off in the next installment of the universe looking forward to it \ud83d\udc4d"

He is our modern day Canadian Indianised version of Manoj Kumar. Poor plot. Katrina Kaif still cannot act. Movie like Jai Bhim is like 10/10 and this one is not even 1/10. I stopped watching half way. Difficult to tolerate."

Unless you're an Indian nationalist anti muslim Hindu. Then you will love the movie."

        "review_title": "Action getting the better of the content",
        "review_detailed_main": "Sooryavanshi starts off with the right intent, pace, narrative and sentiment. The backdrop is the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai, and the masterminds giving the cops a slip, but leaving a live imprint behind - if 400 kg RDX were used for the blasts, where are the remaining 600 kg? Fast forward to 2007, 40 Lashkar operatives from Pakistan sneak into India and commerce sleeper cells all around the country, awaiting instructions from the chief Omar Hafeez (Jackie Shroff) to start another siege. Advance to the current day, Bilal (Kumud Mishra) the key mastermind of the 1993 blast returns to India via Maldives, releasing the cache of the 600 kg RDX from an inconspicuous house in Sawantwadi, and activates the sleeper cells, under the leadership of Riyaz Hafeez, Omar's son, swearing to burn the nation down. Riyaz has another axe to grind with the Mumbai Police, to avenge the death of his elder brother.\n\nDSP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar) is the supercop with the ATS leading the Intelligence Bureau inputs. An experienced, successful and time tested policeman, Veer meticulously follows through in his swashbuckling style to thwart the destructive attempt. He isn't alone in the fightback, and is ably supported by the NSG, Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Simbba (Ranveer Singh) in this all out action adventure.\n\nThe first half is absolutely stunning. It has the elements of making a well researched, credible and blindingly fast blitzkrieg that makes you sit up. The second half unfortunately has a typical Rohit Shetty film written all over it, and literally tears down, systematically, everything that the story had built up. It turns into an average Bollywood potboiler, with chest beating supercops, overflowing machismo and adrenalin, and mindless, endless action and spraying of bullets from all sorts of machines possible. Starting from NSG helicopters airlifting vehicles laden with RDX, and terrorists laying siege of the ATS headquarters blow the original content into impunity. Add to it some repetitive and jarring comedy about Akshay Kumar's \"disease\" of forgetting names, a lamenting widow's sermonising Katrina Kaif about holding the family together when the former's husband's pyre is burning and a contrived reason behind Katrina taking her young son to \"safety\" from his father make Sooryavanshi's second half rather laughable. Honestly, the serious buildup of Sooryavanshi was decimated the moment Ranveer Singh's Simbba swung into action, and then on, the film almost unstoppably hurtled downhill."
