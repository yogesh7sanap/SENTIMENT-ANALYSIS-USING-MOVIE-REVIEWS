Frequent action sequences keep you hooked and the film serves as a great escapism after craving big blockbuster movies from Bollywood. The film looks track in and out of the film and the film is filled with action sequences that over-crowds the film but the shorten run-time is accepted. Radhe is a timeless watch and serves as a great escapism from the Covid-19 pandemic. Though, it is strictly for Salman Khan fans and Action Lovers alike."

So thank you for adding Randeep Hooda in the starcast, otherwise I would not have gone past first five minutes of the movie.\n\nSalman, your entry scene was just not bearable. I mean WHAT were you thinking? Your body language, dialouge delivery and expressions were so bad. It is as if like you did'nt know how to act or was acting just for the sake of it.\n\nFor me the biggest letdown was not the movie or the script but it was you. You were the most negative part in the movie. Had it been any other actor, or even a newcommer, this movie could have been a bit watchable.\n\nAnd for Prabhudeva, please stop making fun of yourself. You were my childhood hero, had immense respect for you but you are making some crap movie which you should stop.\n\nAnd for Randeep Hooda, the only positive thing about the movie was Randeep Hooda. So these two stars are only for him.\n\nAnd for script, direction, music - Sorry there wasn't any script in the movie and I fast forward all the songs as they were just crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review By Kamal K\n\nGood lord, viewers deserve better than this! The directors that make fortunes off commercial cinema, the actors who we've elevated to superstardom, the producers that hold the power to greenlight projects-they all need to do better. This will simply not do.\n\nNo one's even pretending to act in this sham of a movie. Salman Khan, ageing ungracefully, with a heroine half his age, recycles dialogues from his own movies, takes a lift to 'Galaxy apartments', and looks directly at the screen to wish 'Eid Mubarak'.\n\nThe story is convoluted and disjointed. When the crime rate goes up in Mumbai and young ones are being lured by the drug mafia, the cops decide to call on Radhe (Salman Khan) who has '97 encounters and 23 transfers' behind him. The tired dialogue explains that he doesn't follow rules but can get the job done. Hearing their plea (\"police department ko tumhaari zaroorat hai\"), Radhe takes up the job swaggering, scowling and never in a uniform.\n\nJackie Shroff appears as his comical, insecure senior and Disha Patani, a fantastic dancer with sketchy acting skills, can also be seen in a thankless role that insults everyone's intelligence. Women are usually not given their due in director Prabhu Deva's movies, and here too, we see an objectified, air-headed character with no depth or ambitions/interests of her own.\n\nAfter their meet-cute, when Dia (Disha Patani) asks him what he does for a living, the 50-plus Khan replies that he's a struggling model. Of course, she believes him. She helps him with a photoshoot where he is referred to as the 'new boy' and 'cute boy' leading up to the mandatory shirtless scene.\n\n'Radhe...' is based on Korean film 'The Outlaws'. Judging from the trailer, the Hindi film has twisted the original's premise beyond recognition. Instead of borrowing from their films, it would be wonderful if our filmmakers could take inspiration from the bold strides taken by South Korean cinema.\n\nNot as disastrous as Dabangg 3, this one comes close. Why after that debacle, would the same producer-director team-up for another vanity project is a mystery.\n\nMeanwhile the villains have dialogues like 'Minister ko paisa khila diya hai.' Randeep Hooda as the antagonist is a carboard character but his talent shines through anyway.\n\nJackie Shroff's recent film choices are befuddling. After the Hello Charlie where he was in a gorilla costume for most of the movie, this is another odd choice.\n\nWith decades of superstardom, Salman Khan carries with him the capacity to make a shift in the industry. And yet he chooses to make this. It's disappointing, really.\n\nWe're living in unprecedented, heartbreaking times. If we are to watch cinema, it has to be the kind that feeds the soul. This movie is depleting and leaves you tired.\n\nTo the viewers who are ok going through an unbearable movie for a few songs and a couple of Khan's shirtless scenes, I just have this to say- you deserve better."

        "review_detailed_main": "Radhe is a terrible movie to watch. The movie has a substandard story and a cringy screenplay. This one could have been a fast-paced edge of the seat Entertainer if the makers would have remade Outlaws properly. The story has multiple continuity issues, it is predictable from the start, none of the twist is surprising and you don't feel any emotion from the start to the end. The story has been poorly written by AC Mugil and Vijay Maurya (also the dialogue writer) and even the so called choreographer turned director Prabhudeva has done a horrible job.\n\nThe acting is so poor this time. Salman Khan looked good but there were many factors that have let this act down. Disha Patani is terrible to the worse extent (she can only be cast in Calvin Klein Advertisements). Also, Randeep hooda looked very unconvincing with his role this time. All the three villains are not up to the mark. Jackie Shroff was good in comic portions. Loved his scenes with Salman Khan. But, his mini dress scene was horrible. Poor casting by SKF especially Disha Patani. Except, Title Track, the music is total cringe. Poor, Very Very Poor\n\nThere is nothing positive in this movie to watch. The climax and the end is very much predictable. Also, the Salman's entry to the fight scene is below par. I sincerely request everyone to just avoid this movie. Salman Khan is a brand name in Bollywood Cinema. He does not deserve this type of Prabhudeva's mediocre movie."

Not all movies need a romance subplot to carry the story forward. I would also like too point out that in the movie it has been shown that Disha Patani played the role Song Hye-kyo played into the original movie....but Song Hye-kyo was never in the Outlaws. There were also parts in the film which had no connections with the previous scene, the movement of the lips and the dialogues did not match either.

        "review_detailed_main": "Your \"Most Wanted Bhai\" is here, in your drawing room, waiting to be seen and lauded. Radhe is actually much ado about nothing really. A bad man Rana (Randeep Hooda) is in Mumbai, feeding drugs to the youth, driving them nuts while the deadly chemicals consume them, and Mumbai Police must stop him. Rana has a few henchmen with him all the time, and together, they create mayhem wherever they go. So, Radhe (Salman Khan), suspended from his duties (we don't know why, but gauge it must be for his violent encounter specialisation having gone a notch worse than usual) must be recalled to confront Rana and \"clean up\" Mumbai again.\n\nA cat and mouse chase commences, mostly culminating in mire and more violent clashes, involving scores of baddies and gazillions of props and weapons, but Rana remains elusive to Radhe. After a few face offs and near misses, the two men have the final showdown in a helicopter that obviously had to crash land and blow up so that the hand combat leading to the climax can have the audience drooling for more action.\n\nRadhe is at best a mediocre potboiler of a story that has been told a million times since early 1970s by Bollywood about honest cops and dirty rotten drug smugglers, that springs no surprises. It remains immensely predictable and is over the top with poor jokes, puns and gory action. Absolutely no one gets a chance to act - actually, there's neither the need, nor the scope available in the script. Arjun Kanungo (yes, the singer & composer), one of Rana's henchmen did have an opportunity to show some histrionics and he makes an effort, but his role is so minuscule and screen time so limited, that you blink and miss him. Salman Khan and Randeep Hooda do show off a fantastic chemistry yet again, but it remains confined to bloody, unbelievable and repetitive, fiercely fought battles. Disha Patani is at best, wasted. It's sad to see Jackie Shroff in a strange, potentially important role where he has to do things he has never done earlier, like wearing a micro dress and dancing with Salman Khan - the sequence was pitiful. The songs are forgettable, ill placed and spaced, and the music is dreadful. The action admittedly is great and so is the running time of 109 minutes - even that tests your patience as you tend to let your mind wander off. Remember, you were asked to leave your brains behind? No? I am asking you to do so now - please comply!"

Seems like they had someone else in mind and then offer it to Jackie Shroff. It doesn't suit Jackie Dada at all. What people does on the name of Comedy these days.\n\nAnd did Salman watch his shirtless scene? I doubt, if he had, he himself would have said to remove it. It clearly seems fake and doesn't server any purpose.\n\nThe only good point is Randeep Huda along with few side actors. They have made this film barely watchable. A bit of pat on back for action master. Action is bearable and much better than that fake action stunts using ropes and strings.\n\nOverall its only for Salman's fans.

Topsy-turvy narration, cringe-worthy dialogues, and plain atrocities in the name of visual effects ensure this affair to be no less than a torment!\n\nThere was a time, back in the 2010s; Salman was revitalizing his career with consecutive blockbusters such as Wanted, Dabangg, Kick, etc. And pleading guilty, I took pleasure attending them as a kid. Fast forward to 2021, I have grown up and he's still in a similar spot endeavoring with the same old formulaic approach i.e. PLAY IT SAFE, and remain hopeful that his ardent admirers will follow suit!\n\nSalman Sir, I'm afraid to break it to you but things have drastically changed!\n\nThe revolution this film industry has gone through in recent years concerning Content; calling it a phenomenon would be an understatement! And most of all, viewers too have changed their perceptions during this period of transition.\n\nMake no mistake, I'm not the guy who's ill-disposed to 'Masala' movies; In contrast, I do extol what the South Indian film industry comes up with in that context! They produce some of the finest massy projects even to this day but they do so in an appropriate manner!\n\nThat's plenty of my personal opinions, now let us address the elephant in the room, 'Radhe'. If I were to boil it down in a single sentence, I would describe it as \"An awfully executed repetitive piece of garbage that didn't have any clue apropos of its motives and purposes\".\n\nMerely on a technical basis it's got some style, I'll you give you that. But it's all show and no go! Screenplay lacking in continuity and above all, key developements in the storyline come to pass without any prior build-up ahead of their revelations! And the Music being largely futile as they entirely appears to be forceful inclusions rather than obligatory constituents!\n\nAlbeit there is a naive incentive about educating the audience about Drugs and the harm and distress it brings upon the people who suffer. But that too felt shoddily lumped together! As there aren't any sincere attempts being made to set up its base! Being used solely as a backdrop for our Main lead to beat up some bad guys! That's it!\n\nDefining the performances, Disha Patani is despicably squandered. Simply put, she was extremely irritating. However, Randeep Hooda on the other side did what he could with such prosaic script in hand. He was probably if not the only saving grace in here! Speaking of Salman: well! You know, he's just being himself for the umpteenth time!\n\nAs we finally arrived at the point of conclusion, I just wanna finish with giving a piece of advice to the creators. There's still time, alter your manifestos and your way of thinking as this type of works do no good for the Fans or the medium of Cinema in general."

        "review_detailed_main": "Radhe (2021) : Movie Review -\n\nSalman Khan is struggling with Eid releases since 2017 as his last huge hit came in 2016 which was also his last good film on Eid. With Tubelight (2017), Race 3 (2018) and Bharat (2019) he made a hat-trick of craps on Eid and that's the main reason why these 3 films couldn't emerge Clean Hits in India. 2020 went without a Eid release but in 2021 he came back again on his favourite festival but unfortunately the streak of bad films continues. Korean crime-action drama The Outlaws was a big hit there and it's a good entertainer even though it doesn't have anything extraordinary. It is a simple film where a cop is set to demolish the drugs racket. It has typical Korean style action and also focuses on regional gangwars. Radhe makes a massy version of it by destroying the simplicity of The Outlaws and then additional factors like unmatched romance, outdated vision and cheap humour takes away all the chances of making a decent flick.\n\nRadhe (Salman Khan), is an outrageous cop who doesn't follow any rules is appointed by seniors to stop a harmful drug racket in the City. He claims to clean the city but he's unaware of a new drug dealer Rana (Randeep Hooda) who is an little extra evil kind of guy. Disha Patani plays Diya, a love interest of Radhe and also a sister of Radhe's senior officer Mr. Avinash (Jackie Shroff). The storyline is 90% same as the The Outlaws with exact situations being recreated while the Romance and other entertainment elements are part of additional changes. Actually, these additional factors have destroyed the screenplay because then it had to compromise with the essence of the story. At the same time it tries so many forceful and unconventional theories just to make the film look massy but then it turns into pathetic childish affair.\n\nRadhe has a basic story which makes a good sense for youth audience, however, the screenplay forgets to make a speech on it while taking too much care of machoism and hardcore scenics. For instance, the entry scene of Salman. He jumps into the room by breaking the whole big glass, spits a piece of glass on a man but guess what, the in incident happens in silent atmosphere. Can you believe it? Breaking a glass without making any noise?? It doesn't end here, there are at least 10 to 12 scenes in the film which goes on like this without making one percent sense. See, i don't expect an intellectual Cinema like Satyajit Ray, Bimay Roy, Bergman or even massy film like Rajamouli and Rohit Shetty from Salman, I know his and Prabhudeva's limits so i expect a decent film and not a single penny more. I mean he had made good films like Wanted, Dabangg, Sultan and decent/average films like Bodyguard, Ek The Tiger and some more but this is just too degrading. I mean the entire idea of making a commerical entertainer is completely lost.\n\nActing wise, Radhe is a big disaster show. The only guy who has done some Acting is Randeep Hooda, rest all are hideous. Radhe is somehow lifted by Action scenes coming at right time and Salman Khan- The Superstar but downgraded by Salman Khan-An Actor. He is so absurd at so many occasions. Disha Patani and Jackie Shroff looks totally clueless throughout the film. Prabhu Deva's B Grade direction and outdated vision are the two big reasons why Radhe fails to make a decent version of a good flick. The time has come to quit direction, I don't think he will ever be able to make fantastic mass films like Wanted and Rowdy Rathore (both are simply copy-pasted) in future and anyhow continue using the same methods he used for these two films won't save him for sure. Overall, Radhe has little fun here and there but more boredom. It's nothing but a Race 3 version set in Cops World.\n\nRATING - 4/10*"

        "review_detailed_main": "Why does this movie exist? It doesn't have a story, any artistic philosophy, or any kind of substance whatsoever.\n\nSalman Khan, the incredibly talentless actor, singer, producer needs to retire from the world of cinema and focus on anything else he's good at- running his car over homeless people, hunting protected species, wooing popular beauties and dumping them, or even, pretending to do social work. He does not belong in movies, he could just resort to TikTok if he plans on selling horribly shot and edited collection of videos in the name of cinema.\n\nPrabhu Deva, the incredibly talented dancer has once again proved that he has zero knowledge of filmmaking. More disappointing is the fact that he still portrays our women as mere objects to complement undesirable hooliganism and toxic patriarchy.\n\nThe glamour bunch of Radhe must have been focused on making the viewers get away from the harsh realities of everyday life for 2.5 hrs. What they missed out is the fact that Radhe actually messes up every remaining ounce of peace with its problematic everything. Such movies are probably made to lower the IQ of the viewers of India so that people can continue to worship flag bearers of nepotism and fake aristocracy that dominate Bollywood today.\n\nEven if we can get to the roots of \"why,\" it is impossible to answer how can they make such a worthless production in the name of cinema. It's truly one of a kind in an extremely negative sense."

We all have the reach of the Hollywood movies and other international content in our hands so this type of scripts don't work anymore.\n\nAlready Dabang series has been ruiend with dabang 3 lousy script and poor acting and now Wanted is ruined. 2008 wanted was such a delight woth good songs, comedy, action and Radhe is vomit.\n\nSalman looks very tired now ,take rest,take a break and then come with a bang but don't give us these garbage.\n\nPlease Salman choose good scripts and good directors.\n\nWe want bajrangi bhaijaan, sultan, tiger scripts with energetic performance."

This is not a new phenomenon. Almost every Salman movie follows a similar pattern. No story but full-on Swag mantra. However, you end up enjoying his swag but here, there is no relief.\n\nHe looked tired. Not a single dialogue or expression or his moves are good enough to charm you. Further, Disha is the absolute right choice for a role that has no meat. She is perfect. There is no other name to replace her for this 'good for nothing' role.\n\nJackie is wasted as well. It is embarrassing to see him in such a bad role. The action scenes are boring. The villain played by Randeep Hooda is a disaster.

Action sequences 3. Support from side characters 4.villian(Even dominated salman\ud83d\ude33)\n\nMinus points: 1.over the top scenes 2.seetimaar 3.

These few 5mins make the movie more of hawabaazi in the middle.\n\nVFX and Action scenes could have been improved. The hand combat scenes were just perfect but not the car chasing scenes or the helicopter one.\n\nHumour comedy was not upto the Salman Khan standards as we've seen in Ready, Wanted or all his movies."

His onscreen chemistry with Disha Patani is too cute and romantic which adds more masala in the story.\n\nBeside Salman's star power in Radhe, another factor which makes this movie worth watching is the presence of Randeep Hooda as a drug lord and the main target of Radhe. At many points Randeep overtakes Salman with his punchy dialogues and serious facial expressions. At some points, they remind of their confrontation scenese in Kick movie.\n\nDirector Prabhudeva deserves appreciation for his returning point as a masala entertainer with Radhe."

If you're looking for an action masala entertainer, this will let you down. Director Prabhu Deva failed to recreate the magic of Wanted (2009).\n\nThe trashy writing doesn't do justice to Salman's stardom. He still holds the charisma and always looks terrific while doing action & punching the baddies. But his charm cannot rescue this misadventure.\n\nIn the acting department, Randeep Hooda is the better of the lot. Although, his character has no depth still he manages to essays the brutal character efficiently. Disha Patani in skimpy clothes and hot pants adds plenty of glamour to the scenes but it doesn't always work. Jackie Shroff is wasted because of the poorly-written role and his attempt at humour falls flat due to the humourless dialogues. Other supporting casts fail to leave any impact.\n\nThe background score by Sanchit and Ankit Balhara is loud but adds to the impact. Editor Ritesh Soni has done a fine job by keeping the film's runtime to 114 minutes. The cinematography is decent and action sequences are well executed in the second half. But the washroom fight sequence seen in John Abraham and Emraan Hashmi starrer Mumbai Saga was far better. The climax is not as exciting as we have seen in many of Salman's films in the past.\n\nRadhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai Movie Rating: Direction 1/5 Acting 1.5/5 Editing 2.5/5 Story 1.5/5 Screenplay 1.5/5 Overall Hit ya Flop Rating: 1.5 out of 5 Stars (Not Watchable)\n\nRADHE is strictly for Salman Khan fans. There is absolutely nothing in this film to recommend it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Radhe this is not wanted...\n\nThe hype that is created was demolished drastically. No screenplay, Story, and predictable plot repeated or borrowed scenes. No music.\n\nThe entry of Randeep is awesome in the guise of the brutal bad guy in the black outfit which is like that of Hollywood gangsters. He is cruel, brutal, and never leaving his enemies. Dialogue delivery is fluent but bad writing spoils the show.\n\nDisha is used as a showpiece and love interest of Radhe without which Bollywood can't survive and go ahead. Just for showoff glamour and dances. We have seen it umpteenth times.\n\nJackie was just wasted. He should stop playing such cheap roles which are forced on him, In the name of comedy they are serving vulgar scenes. He is creepy and pathetic.\n\nEntry of Radhe is forced to be larger than life person. It is illogical that no sound of glass shattering was heard by the person and he gets injured. Also carrying of one man with one hand.\n\nActions scenes were so boring as these seem taken from Baaghi 3 where the hero jumps to a helicopter and dhobi ghat scene from simmba. Flying motorcycles in the climax or helicopter being crashed on land.\n\nThe screenplay is boring and predictable. It ends the franchise of Wanted just like Dabangg 3. No storyline no drama just plastic faces moving. Dialogues are awful no sense and forced. They are written in lockdown mind. The direction sucks grow up Prabhudeva or just go to choreography. Why destroy other's careers and Image.\n\nThe movie is shot in lockdown as it shows empty roads of Mumbai and liberty is provided to the hero to ride even on the cycle.\n\nAerial views suck as they occupy most of the screen time. We know India has one sea link and many movies were shot on this link. Why repeat.\n\nMusic was zero and one song Dil De Diya is also cut short why only hope for the movie also reduced.\n\nNo novelty is used in the movie. Waste of time and money. The persona of Salman overshadowed the Radhe. It is so dull that Salman sleeps with his eyes open in one scene.\n\nArjun Kanungo is fine in his first outing but used for a limited time.\n\nIt is dull and hilarious, moronic, mess provides for nothing new to watch.\n\nOverall 1 star for Randeep only."

Perhaps , Salman's fan will love the romantic track but chemistry seems lacking.\n\nOverall,It's marked improvement from Race-3 , Dabangg-3 but it's not TZH,KICK. It's more like a Bodyguard, Dabangg-2.\n\nAction film lover and SALMAN KHAN fans won't be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "*Please read carefully*. Whenever a film does not meet our expectations, we tend to say that the film has a disastrous story and has got no plot at all. Same goes for Radhe. However, radhe had the same story as of 'The Outlaws' which was a very successful film. Salman Khan is the most targeted person on the internet. There are people who are always trying to pull this man down. After Race 3, Ramesh taurani said in an interview that there were certain groups that were created just to backlash the man. Although race 3 was not a good film. When SRK or Aamir khan dances, people do not question their dancing skills. But when Salman Khan does the same, there is constant hate. When Salman Khan was standing still in Dhinka Chika and was just moving his pockets, that became a blockbuster. But in Seeti maar he actually put in some effort after wanted in spite of being 55 years old. But the hate has so much risen over the years that whatever he does is constantly criticised and hated. There are few groups on social media who spreads a negativity and the negativity is extremely contagious. Even if a person does not dislike a film, he/she will say negative things just to be among the 'hating club' and will go along with the trend. Radhe is a film where you never feel that it is slow and boring. Yes there was 2 dialogues which were disappointing. And yes the production value should've been better(Car scene and helicopter scene). Otherwise the rest of the action was amazing. The comedy scenes were amazing unlike dabangg 3 or race 3. Like Salim Khan said, it wasn't a great film. But it was not a bad film either. Seriously guys? 173k voting on IMDb for a film? That is like the most number of votes you have ever seen for an Indian film on IMDb. So you're telling me people found it extremely important to come to IMDb and spread awareness of how bad the film was? Like dude. Give me a break. Salman was always targeted. But he has always made a comeback like no one else. And he will soon come back and rise like never before. This is a fun film to watch. A good popcorn flick. However, not the best."

Villain was brutal and Randeep made justice to his role. Jackie shows his comic timing and disha just a glamour part but she good for romance. There is no extra stretching scenes included . I have not bot bored for second . If you want to Radhe so just become Radhe urself and imagine urself there and see you gonna enjoy movie every bit. I want to hit badly criminal like these gangs. Salman he justifying his character and this movie is relief for people whom having lot stress and bored at home at this pandemic situation. So just go watch it and like it."
