        "review_detailed_main": "A Gen Z update to Kathryn Bigelow's 1991 cult classic, this remake is essentially an episode of Fast and Furious in which the vehicular exploits have been replaced with an assortment of extreme sports sequences. Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clich\u00e9d stinkers like \"the only law is gravity\" and \"everyone dies, it's just a matter of how\", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis. This modern update boasts a handful of genuinely fantastic action sequences, yet they're not enough to warrant a recommendation in what is otherwise a limp and incoherent thriller."

The good thing about the movie are the stunts and the nature shots. But it was just not enough to make it a good movie. It's an average movie with special effects that could have been much better when you see the budget they had. The acting was just okay without being great. It's just the story that was lousy written. And that's the most important thing for any movie. If you don't have a good script you don't get a good movie. That's a fact."

This is where the second coming of Point Break truly excels. When it hits just the right velocity, it's bloody breathtaking. Unfortunately, the narrative is not only poor, it nearly sabotages the movie like a broken parachute.\n\nStory revolves around Utah (Luke Bracey), an FBI trainee as he investigates a series of heists and their connection to a group of athletes led by Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez). As one might expect, it follows the same trail that Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze has placed. The new leads do what they can, although it's better to watch this without comparing, because it certainly doesn't have the same caliber of star or chemistry.\n\nThe plot then dives head first into uncharted territory. It's littered with so much \"save the planet\" preachy acts as the writing struggles to place FBI agent in the hippie nirvana angle. The motivation is just a mess of random vague one-liners, even the on-screen characters are perplexed by it. There's a romance subplot, but this is mainly to show the attractive Teresa Palmer as eye candy for several short scenes.\n\nThe movie is actually better when they just show the crazy sequences instead of forcing its lackluster story. It has plethora of impressive feats, from high heaven wingsuit flying, the climb on hazardous urban streets and natural cliffs, to the surfing of gigantic waves. This is the level of stunt choreography xXx and Fast and Furious wish they had.\n\nWhen camera pans into the right angle and lighting, as the sounds is muffled by throbbing tune of the fast music, Point Break reaches the zenith. It's miles beyond what typical action flick could offer, but sadly it's repeatedly interrupted by the shoddy story, which feels like an excuse to fly across the globe to do random cool tricks.\n\nIf viewed only on the grand mix of cinematography and choreography, Point Break is exquisite, this would have been a great documentary of extreme sport. However, as action movie, the story is so pretentious, it simply serves as speed bump to hamper the thrill."

I'm amazed that it was allowed to be put out to the cinema in its form. Nobody but the stunt team can get credit here. Similar stunts can be seen in a more realistic form by a simple You Tube search. Please don't watch this. The lines in this movie are so bad you would laugh if you were not so angry. I can't believe it obtained a rating of 5 on IMDb. 1 at best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Solid and incredible thriller -though very inferior to original (1991) from Kathryn Bigelow- with spectacular scenes about surfing and skydiving. FBI agent going up against a group of bank robberies and other crimes. A young FBI agent (Luke Bracey) infiltrates a team of elite athletes suspected of carrying out a series of unusual and sophisticated crimes. The agent is hot on the trail but he's sucked by a kind of guru, Bodhi (Edgar Ram\u00edrez), a leader of the beach subculture, a fun-loving with destructive ways who plays cat and mouse game with the Feds. Meanwhile, Luke Bracey falls in love with Teresa Palmer, a beautiful member of the adventurous band. Point Break: 100% Pure Adrenaline!. 100% Pure Adrenaline..\u00a1 Anything to catch the perfect wave! The only law that matters is gravity !. Find your breaking point !. Make your getaway !. Crime has no limit !. Justice has no limit !. The FBI doesn't train agents to do this!. No rules !. No limits !.\n\nThis is a story of surfers and skydivers including noisy action, thrills, adventures, risk sports and breathtaking outdoors . Undercover FBI agent Luke Bracey strips for action and gets into some serious male bonding when he infiltrates a youthful fraternity in search of a gang of robbers. During the course of his investigation is seduced by spiritual surfer Edgar Ram\u00edrez and becomes addicted to the adrenalin rush of life on the edge. So Edgar Ram\u00edrez's reckless craving for danger filling an elemental void in Luke Bracey's hollow soul. Despite the theme of redemption, the distinction between good and evil is far from black and white. There are times when the dialogue is a shade comic, others when the brilliantly staged action set pieces become almost abstract. However, there's much plausibility and predictability, and there's precious little to be found here. Even so, there's enough high-octane, heart-racing excitement for a dozen films. Impressive scenario and there are enough dazzling surfing and airborne stunts to keep you amused. Luke Bracey as an astute agent and Edgar Ramirez as a thrill-seeker guru, help raise potential action-adventure story to a higher plane. They repeat roles from the really superiors Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. Along with Luke Bracey and Edgar Ram\u00edrez appear other familiar secondaries giving functional interpretations, such as: Ray Winstone, Teresa Palmer, Delroy Lindo, Matias Varela, Max Thieriot, Nikolai Kinski, Glynis Barber, Steve Toussaint and James Le Gros\n\nIt contains a pulsing and moving musical score by Tom Holkenborg or Junkie XL). The motion picture was professionaly photographed and directed by Ericson Core (Togo, Invincible, Of Kings and Prophets, Still star-crossed) , but with no originality because it mainly copies the elements already developed in the much better classic cult movie (1991) directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Point Break(2015) rating: 5.5/10, acceptable and passable, it has an assured direction which keeps this movie on the edge of your seat. Nostalgic and new surfers will enjoy this ode to the beach and mysticism and seeking the perfect wave."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Point Break\" is what \"Crusty Demons\" ought to be. Unfortunately, it is not what \"Point Break\" ought to be.\n\nIn fairness, the extreme sports scenes are pretty awesome. The cinematography is crystal-clear and the exotic locations are picturesque. As an extreme sports video, it excels.\n\nAs an action movie or caper, it is less impressive.\n\nThe greatest problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable or charismatic. Personally, I think one major problem is the horrendous tattoos that most of the central characters sport over much of their bodies. Having worked as a photographer and cinematographer, I am no fan of tattoos. To me, they suggest low-class, criminal background, lack of self-respect and many other negative character traits. There are some tattoos that are inoffensive, even impressive \u2013 but not in this movie. When I see these tattoos, my first reaction is that I have never been that drunk or that stupid or uncultured.\n\nIn the original, Bodhi's crew had goals and motives that made sense. Here, we have a group of athletes with improbable skills, all of whom share an exotic philosophy and a disdain for profit. The surf Nazi red herrings are gone, as is Utah's need to acquire skills in order to join the group. The whole Utah-Bodhi bromance seems less credible and less compelling. The antagonists are cast as eco-warriors; however, somehow it doesn't make them sympathetic. They are financed by an eccentric multi-billionaire, which seems more contrived than organic.\n\nAt one point, the FBI had very strict standards for its agents. They were expected to dress and conduct themselves in conformance with relatively conservative standards. The notion that the FBI would accept a long-haired, extensively tattooed candidate stretches credulity to the limits, as does much of the rest of the film. However, as a direct-to-video extreme sports video, it would be quite impressive."

His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like Robin Hood robbers.\n\nUtah believes that the group are taking part in the Ozaki 8, eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies. Utah infiltrates the gang which is led by Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez.)\n\nIn its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of CGI enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk. The film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller. The colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations.\n\nThe original Point Break directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who would go on to become the first female Oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of Generation X sports action thriller with well staged action sequences. Although not the greatest actors around, Bigelow got charismatic turns from Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and sturdy support from Gary Busey as Reeves FBI boss.\n\nThe remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction. I tried to give it a break and approached it with an open mind but alas it is a poor film."

They are fantastic and i found I couldn't take my eyes off the screen while they were happening. Unfortunately after a stunt scene comes dialogue which with its bad timing and believability pulled me straight back out of the film, I do honestly think they should have taken the Point Break elements out of this movie and just called it something altogether fresh, then I think I would maybe hold this film a little higher. But even with all this I do think this movie was very, very enjoyable and if you just want to kick back and watch a mindless action movie this is a brilliant choice. I give Point Break (2015) a 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Former extreme sports athlete Johnny \"Utah\" Brigham (Luke Bracey) following the death of his friend on a motocross run leaves the extreme sports world for the FBI. After attending a briefing on a gang of thieves who've been hitting various locations around the globe connected to Multi-National Corporations with American interests by base jumping off skyscrapers or doing heists in mid-air but never keeping the money, Utah shares info that the thieves are basing their heists around the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. Utah is assigned to the case to work alongside Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone) an FBI agent based out of their London offices, and Pappas and Utah head to France for rare surfing conditions that are part of the Ozaki 8. Once there Utah rides the wave and faints but is rescued by another surfer Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez), and is introduced to his team Roach (Clemens Schick), Chowder (Tobias Santelmann), and Grommet (Matias Varela) at a party hosted by their sponsor, Al-Fariq (Nikolai Kinski). Eventually Utah joins up with Bohdi and his crew and Utah finds himself torn between the case and the rush of Bohdi's lifestyle.\n\nBased on the enduring cult film and action classic, Point Breaks, the long in-development remake of Point Break was eventually willed into existence as an international co-production among American, German, and Chinese film producers. Helmed by The Fast and the Furious cinematographer Ericson Core who also directed Invincible, Core pitched his take on Point Break as a large scale tentpole movie which was instrumental in getting the film made. Written by Kurt Wimmer who also wrote the 2012 remake of cult classic Total Recall, the movie was released on Christmas Day of 2015 where it garnered horrendous critical reception and audience indifference accumulating a paltry $28 million stateside against its $105 million budget, though thanks to international revenue the movie squeeze out enough revenue to get to $133 million though when accounting for marketing and distribution costs that doesn't even come close to success. At least with Total Recall you could at least make an argument for \"going back to the original book\" (not that they did) so there are grounds and justification for a remake. But Point Break was a smaller scale movie filled with strong characters and personalities which has now turned into a large scale behemoth where the characters might as well be stick figures.\n\nEasily the biggest drag on the movie is Luke Bracey stepping in for Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah (sorry, Johnny Brigham because Utah is a nickname from YouTube). While Reeves has been mocked for his somewhat stilted delivery as an actor with the stage show Point Break Live! Using that stiltedness as an enduring part of its appeal, there's a passion, energy, and charm that Keanu Reeves exudes that draws you to him as an actor even in his lesser films like Johnny Mnemonic or Chain Reaction. When we see Luke Bracey in the opening motocross sequence, Bracey doesn't carry himself like a leading man and is a charisma vacuum where in later scenes if he's in a room with other people you'd be hard pressed to say he's the lead in this movie. But it's not like Bracey's the only bad point in this movie. Bodhi is played by actor Edgar Ramirez, a strong actor as seen in his Carlos the Jackal biopic and the police procedural exorcist film Deliver Us from Evil, but here Ramirez doesn't have that laid back charisma Swayze brought to the character in the original film. We also have the very strange casting of English actor Ray Winstone filling in Gary Busey's role as FBI agent Angelo Pappas, and not only does Winstone sleepily grumble his way through the film, but FBI agents are REQUIRED to be U. S. Citizens even in international offices of the UK in one of many hiccups from Wimmer's script.\n\nSpeaking of Wimmer's script, if surfing is no longer integral to your story like it was in the first film, why is it even called point break (a surfing term)? Well I guess even Wimmer realized that, so Wimmer's bent and twisted it into a stupid exchange with the line \"The Point at which you Break\" around the halfway mark to give some level of justification for the title. While the original Point Break didn't have airtight logic, it made up for it by the fact that it never took itself too seriously with lots of humorous and or charming exchanges between Utah and Pappas, Utah and love interest Tyler Ann Ednicott (we'll get to her), and Utah and Bodhi that engaged you. Point Break 2015 takes an almost comical level of stoic seriousness to it characters and delivery and everyone just seems bored as a result. And then we have our revised version of Lori Petty's Tyler with Teresa Palmer's Samsara...I want to preface this by saying Palmer's a good actress as seen in the zombie romantic comedy Warm Bodies, but you would not know that from this movie as her relationship with Johnny feels very ancillary and she and Bracey have the chemistry of a wet sparkler. Palmer's role is basically \"she's there\", and because \"she's there\" she and Utah get together only for it to not really affect much of anything (especially with Wimmer's inclusion of a stupid non-twist).\n\nI will say the action is large scale and the locations are varied, but the action is also overly clean and bereft of tension. The filmmakers have taken away the plot point of Utah's injured knee which gave him vulnerability and relatable as a hero and instead make Utah completely perfect with regards to every sport he does. This has been a recurring problem in Wimmer's work dating back to 2002's inexplicable cult film Equilibrium where every action protagonist Wimmer writes is pretty much nigh invincible and Utah is no different here. The original Point Break placed Utah in danger many times such as the Bunker Weiss shootout, the skydiving scene where Bohdi packed Utah's chute, the footchase between Utah and Bohdi. All the action is large scale but there's no tension mined from the premise so it's less Point Break and more Extreme Ops or xXx. It's also a very ugly movie with much of the film carrying this unappealing bluish green filter that washes out the colors from every locale and makes everything look visually unappealing.\n\nPoint Break 2015 is a pointless remake of a silly but enjoyable action thriller that had a strong action director and many charismatic actors. The new incarnation of Point Break with its bland characters, uninteresting action, and general boredom feels less like it wants to be Point Break and more like it wants to ape The Fast and the Furious."

These are the sacred nature of our planet, the need to follow your destiny and the incredible power of the moment. Flash forward to 2015, our planet is in even more serious trouble. Life is tough, people are tougher. Bodhi is now more of a man of action than previously. He still has a devoted team around him that believe in what they are doing. Almost like a crew of Vikings about to sail off the known edge of the planet. The actions scenes are out of this world, no doubt about it. I was reminded of \"Riding Giants\", \"Storm Surfers\" and \"Sunshine Superman\". These scenes make the movie and you wish you could join the athletes. Samsara is the more mystical of the crew and offsets the hard edges of the film."

This poor take on the classic is a complete travesty in every way possible; essentially it's a shameless extended Red Bull or GoPro commercial. In every frame there's an outdoor equipment or extreme sports brand in full view, front and center. There's really no plot to speak of, I think there's something about an FBI agent trying catch some bad guys, and that's about it. Even the main character seems to forget WTF he's supposed to be doing. For a bit in the middle I really did forget what the hell he was supposed to be doing. It's really a poor excuse to film beautiful young people doing dangerous sports. The acting is nonexistent and even when there is some acting, it's horrific to say the least. Now I know why Edgar Ramirez doesn't get much to say in whatever movies he's in because the guy is just terrible, he's as stiff as the rock that he throws over the cliff. To be honest I don't understand the hype around the guy. The lead guy - I don't even know who TF he is - playing Utah is an insult to the great Keanu Reeves. The lines are completely laughable, they're like lines ripped straight from Robin Sharma's The Monk who Sold His Ferrari - just some voodoo, mystic mumbojumbo about being one with the earth or some BS like that. Which is sort of ironic because they spend most of the movie ripping the earth apart with motor bikes, guns, bombs and whatever they can get their tattooed hands on. Completely pointless, avoid at all costs, watch the infinitely superior original and forget this tosh ever existed."

It manages to break the action point based on the Ozaki Eight's fictional sets of highly dangerous attempts of worshiping the nature but fail in achieving several other points, most obviously when it lacks of engagement in between the characters while the existence of political subtext and the crime concept seems to be meaningless. Performance from the casts are overall fine but the decision to focus on the extreme adventures have totally neglected the potential of some supporting characters and the emotional development that cause the romance and friendship seems to be superficial. Visual effects are environmental breathtaking and stunning, the scores by Junkie XL are strong and inspiring yet all of these are insufficient to provide additional thrills to make the film superior than the original cult in 1991."

I very seriously doubt that after two hours from getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even remember the name's of the central characters in this film. Why, because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt people for their quality work involved, but stunts don't make a movie. A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters' world is what makes a memorable film. I'll stick with the original \"Point Break\"."

The story differs from the bank robbing of the original film as extreme athletes look to complete the Ozaki 8, extreme death defying events that harvest the earth, wind, rain, fire, all while liquidating companies of money, gold, diamonds.\n\nThe acting was extremely poor, characters did not develop as in the original, they fell flat and stale throughout.

Furthermore, changes of position of camera between plans lead to the feeling of being lost. Filming such amazing scenes in a more simplistic way would have been beneficial to the movie.\n\nThe storyline could have been more interesting. One interesting idea is the one to save the planet as the \"bad guys\" are green fighters. It creates an ambiguity as whether to consider the bad guys as bad people or not. However the effect is partially lost by the clumsiness of the screenplay. As such, the dialogues are full of lines without clear meaning.\n\nThis movie will clearly entertains action movie fans. It will definitely not fit to people with bad heart conditions and/or looking after the meaning of life."

The action was immersive. I didn't even think about CGI in any scene. It all looked real & like the guys were really in it.\n\n* There's a variety of great locations & panoramic shots I really enjoyed. Epic vistas.\n\n* I liked the different kind of chemistry portrayed by main characters - it seemed more guenuine, - there was earned respect & trust but always tentative at the same time. They were always reading each other. IMHO - this kind of guy relationship was more real & had deeper meaning than a 'guy-crush-bromance'.\n\n* It is not a vehicle for any 'over-used celebrity'\n\n* I had never seen the actor who played Utah - he reminded me a lot of Heath Ledger . . .\n\n* It's rated PG-13\n\n* It's a decent action & popcorn movie night.

        "review_detailed_main": "Trying to retain or emulate the high standards when doing a sequel or a remake is a tough task for even the most proficient of film crews. With so many variables within a production to consider, there is bound to be some kind of dilution of quality in regard to things such as character development, dialogue, scene transition/flow, adaptability and so forth along the way. Take the Rocky franchise for example: we get a black and white and deeply gritty insight into the main character's life from the outset, one that allows the viewer to get a solid understanding of the struggle from which he was building from. From here we are then taken on a journey of further struggle across two further films, and this is used as a tool to develop the bonds between characters develop and mature them as the story progresses. The turmoil, defeat, resilience and successive euphoria, all bring the films together in kind of perfect cohesive union. But, the franchise stumbles by trying to draw this pattern out across successive films after this point, and it fails miserably (which even Stallone himself admits by the fifth instalment to be true). But in some instances, this dilution doesn't take place across multiple films, it can actually occur in as few as two. An example of which Point Preak (2015) rightly shows. Granted it's not a sequel, and we have only two film to compare, but it is a remake of a classic which has cemented itself amongst the action movie gods, as well as giving it cult status. So you would expect the retention of at least some semblance of quality original...\n\n1991 was a busy year for the action genre. The directing behemoths of cinema were facing off as we saw the release of Terminator 2, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Backdraft and Thelma and Louise all within a very busy window of summer. Added to this list was the original Point Break movie, a film directed by Kathryn Bigalow whose attention to detail, respect for the world of surfing, and her ability to tie-in exactly the right supporting cast made sure it stood out amongst the rest. She put Swayze and Reeves on the top billing, guaranteeing high tickets sales in theatres across the world (2nd only to Terminator 2 for ticket sales on the opening weekend). She drew in a supporting cast that have connections to the world of surfing: Gary Busey, for whom Point Break would be a second outing in the surf-film world after Big Wednesday, and BoJesse Christopher and John Philbin - actual pro surfers, who were surprisingly good at acting . Throwing in Anthony Kleidis for a little rock-star cameo was also a great move for the musos in the audience. Added to this, Bigalow even gave nods to surf legend Bunker Spreckels, and she also subtly dropped in references to Swayze and Reeves' back catalogue (the lines that included: 57 Chevy, Johnny Unitas and Patrick's Road House...). This tightly woven fabric of experience, attention to detail, twinned with the perfect soundtrack and one of cinema's most unforgettable foot chases, gave it a guaranteed recipe for success .\n\nFast forward to 2015 though, and we see the remake of Bigalow's masterpiece fall on it's face in comparison. Yes, it is a phenomenally good action film for those who like a non-stop adrenaline feed from the word go. Skydiving, surfing, base jumping, dirt biking and snowboarding all make for brilliant viewing, and the camera work is impeccable in these sequences. But that's where the quality stops. What you're watching here is essentially a well-shot extreme sports advert with flurries of acting dotted here and there. Both Luke Bracey and Edgar Ramirez have very little rapport on screen. The attempt to make Bodhi seem as laid back as Swayze's version, has quite the forced feel to it, for which there really in no excuse as the running time for the film is only 6 minutes shorter than the original. When there is an extended period of dialogue, it seems rushed and only seems to serve as breathing space between the action scenes. The attempt to bring veteran actors into the fray such as Ray Winstone doesn't really add any weight to the film, however Delroy Lindo does save the day from complete collapse with his trademark chisel-jawed, Gone-in-60-seconds authority figure role. The return of BoJesse Christopher and James LeGros to the Point Break franchise as FBI employees has a certain sadness to it. Surely it would've been more appropriate (and relevant) to drop them in alongside Laird Hamilton in more surfer-relevant roles, rather than goon them up as government hacks.\n\nPoint Break (2015) successfully sacrifices dialogue, character development and cohesive scriptwriting, upon the slab of extreme. It doesn't even try to convey the bonds between characters that we saw in the 1991 original, nor does it endeavour to give the storyline any weight apart from the endless homage to extreme sports and in ignoring these it has diluted the original to the point of being unrecognisable. Ericson Core has made a fast-paced, cerebral, Michael Bay-esque film here, and if that what you want, you can't go wrong. If you're looking for a memorable piece of cinema, you certainly can."

        "review_detailed_main": "Obviously a lot of people hate this for being a vastly inferior remake to a beloved 90s classic. To be fair, I don't think it's as utterly terrible as most reviews here are making it out to be. That said, it's not that great either.\n\nThe common complaints I see (aside from just being offended that the film was remade at all, and to some extent that's a fair complaint, but I don't think it really has a place in any serious analysis of the film) are that the writing is poor, the characters suck, the action is just a bunch of GoPro extreme sports stunts, and that the actors cast in the principal parts are not very good.\n\nOf those, I definitely agree with the writing being poor. I so appreciate that they didn't try to exactly duplicate the original premise of the criminals being bank robbers. The basic re-imagining of the crew as eco-warriors I actually thought was mildly interesting. But the writing on the whole is mediocre at best, and the dialog is fairly poor. Some of the characters are indeed rather lame versions of the ones from the original film. Utah's boss in the original is a delightful a-hole, and here he has no discernible personality whatsoever. Papas, played by Busey in the original, has a very reduced role here, and when he is in the film his parts are again uninspired, despite being played by the very competent Winstone.\n\nIn terms of the action, I actually liked the extreme sports footage. Yes, I can see why some people were unenthusiastic about it and consider it a poor substitute for the more gun-oriented action of the first film. However, I think to be fair, there is not really anything special about the action sequences in the original. Even though it's different, I thought the stunts here were really well filmed and had a good intensity.\n\nI also somewhat disagree that the principal actors themselves were bad in this movie. Again, let's be real: Keanu Reeves is a pretty flat actor. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of his, but at the time of Point Break, he still hadn't really developed much as an actor, and in fact one of the things that makes the original fun is how dorky is performance is. Luke Bracey is fine in this, maybe even more classically \"good\" than Reeves in the original, if we're defining \"good\" as having any perceptible emotional range. Ramirez, likewise, is an OK actor. The problem here is that he is replacing Swayze and that's a harder act to follow. Whereas I think Bracey is maybe more dynamic than Reeves, Ramirez is definitely less dynamic than Swayze, and that's kind of not how it should be.\n\nAnyway, as I said, this film isn't all bad, and there are worse ways you could spend two hours especially if you like cool sports stunts. If you want a really well-written story with rich character, this isn't going to be for you. If the very idea of them remaking Point Break pisses you off, don't waste your time. You could watch it intending to hate it and then be mad about it afterwards, but you really just played yourself."

That automatically makes this film at least a five for me.\n\nThere are so many boring comic book films with special effects, as well as too many zombie and Dracula rip-offs that put me to sleep in fifteen minutes. This film did not bore me in the least. It was fast-paced, beautifully photographed, and had an excellent sound track. If based on those variables, the film would have been a ten.\n\nBut, the actors, dialogue, and plot, unfortunately, did not measure up to the technical aspects of the film. I found the Utah character interesting, because we know a little about his background, but we know nothing about the background of any of the thrill-seeking gang. I am giving this film a 6 because it is the ultimate in eye candy without special effects. I go to the movies to relax and I enjoy a good adventure on the big screen (among other venues). This film fits the bill for that and I would recommend it (even if it is a little preachy).\n\nArthur H Tafero Senior Reviewer AskMrMovies"

This is a boring, unengaging movie in every way. The two leads are lacking in any charisma or appeal. They are both just so dull and lifeless I cannot begin to understand how they were cast in an action movie, let alone a remake of a superior action movie with two leads that played well off each other. But these two being so boring fits the tone of the film, one of the more unexciting excuses for an action movie I've ever seen. The original Point Break was a fun movie. This thing is dire and seems to believe it has a message, which makes it even worse. It's really just a lackluster movie all around. I guess the one positive it has over the original is that Teresa Palmer is nice to look at and the original movie just had Lori Petty."

I remember 1991's version with fondness and I was not looking forward to the remake, but remakes happen in Hollywood. That's how it's been since its birth. What I will give this remake is that it did a good job of not being like the original.\n\nThe basic plot is the same. A young FBI agent is assigned to go undercover to find a group of action sports athletes committing crimes.\n\nWhat's the difference? the big difference is the sure epicness this movie tries to put down on you. It's scaled to the max. The original basically took place on a beach, but the remake takes place on some of the biggest most beautiful mountains around the world. Bohdi and his band of misfits go from being surfer bums to globe trotting thrill seekers. The big budget is definitely the sign of the times we live in and helps raise the bar. some of the action sports sequences were amazing to look at.\n\nAnother sign of the times was how they tried to give the characters more depth. The bank robbers seem to be more spiritually incline, stating their actions are for a good cause bigger than themselves and that they are actually liberating the money.\n\nThough the action sequences are...nice to look at, I was not really buying the righteousness of the villains. It makes the movie cheesy.\n\nPlus the new guys they got playing Johnny Utah and Bohdi are no where near as compelling as what Keenu Reeves and The late great Patrick Swayze did with the roles. This is where the movie really does not hold a candle to the original.\n\nI'll give this movie credit. It's called Point Break, but it stands on it's own and for the most part it does a good job of it. The action is bigger, but only decent, and I don't like what they did with the characters this time around."

Surfing has been replaced by extreme (to the point of being implausible) sports, the plot is close to non-existent and the characters have no substance.\n\nIt's pretty much just one long ridiculous-action sequence, with the occasional piece of clumsy, contrived dialogue thrown in. Performances are hammy and weak - even Keanu Reeves looks like Marlon Brando compared to these guys.\n\nAvoid."

        "review_detailed_main": "Again like other remakes of days gone by, they have to be more bigger, and livelier, and in some case, more unbelievable. This remake, made famous all those years, by the very cool 1992 original, I still enjoyed more, and seriously that was a better movie. But if you go into one, in 3D, too, PLEASE, get ready for a cool ride, with awesomely breathtaking stunts, one involving our foursome, partaking in a lengthy paragliding sequence which was just riveting. It's like watching 4 bats, or those futuristic jets in those latest science fiction-Terminator/Transformers flicks. What I also liked about this, was the change of story, highly original, where this two our posse of robbers are not stealing for themselves. There a couple of familiar moments of cool agent Utah (Bracey-Home And Away material) shooting a score of pointless gunshots off skyward, or the end too, (bigger, and more spectacular). For this one, you have to leave your brain at the door, and surrender to the escapism, much like the last Fast And Furious flick. Why was I disappointed though?-sorry to be a pain, but plot development was really needed here, where from watching the trailer, I was expecting much more, in terms of that. I loved Ray Winstone's performance, for what screen time he had, replacing that of Busey's from the first (I like this Pappas character better). The delicious Teresa Palmer was of course, Teresa Palmer, only appearing in a number of scenes here and there, one of course, having to be a sex scene, where she was totally wasted. This time, Utah, not having an a..hole of a boss, was played by Delroy Lindo, who did the role solid. This was a remake I did like, for a few different reasons. It's much different, refreshingly different, and it really succeeded here. Ramirez giving a different take on Bohdi, was one I liked, where I really wanted him to walk away, or surf away. Quite a bit of the stunts are just unfeasible, and it's explosive tragic start, you will learn from, or question why you would risk such a stunt, in the first place. This remake will teach you, not to do stupid s..t. The waves too, are bigger, much bigger, as everything else. The day party scene on the water with a sea of hotties and the male race, familiar to that of the first piranha. Though, this is such a fun ride, and I demand you do see it, for the experience, I will still opt for the original, any day."

Too much to complain about, and I am usually very forgiving., but this movie just plain sucked. I'm glad Patrick Swayze wasn't alive to see this pos re-make.\n\nFor one, the plot doesn't even come close to the original - just a few sad, lame-ass attempts to link it to the original classic 1991 film in order to call the movie by the same name, such as stealing and inserting scenes like: - re-using all the main character's names - Johnny shooting into the sky when he fails to kill Bodhi - Bodhi escaping and having to die by a monster-wave at the end.\n\n\n\n... there is so many more example of this it is ridiculous.\n\nSo other than calling this flick by the same name of the original classic, and inserting these stolen scenes and names from the original, the movie is something, but it isn't POINT BREAK.\n\nIn the end, it's just an excuse for some self-serving, over-rated, uber-tattooed actors to get a woody playing extreme-sport idiots, and some adrenaline-junky film makers to get their rocks off filming stupid stunts in exotic locations.\n\nIf your an extreme sports fanatic and don't give a crap about plots, themes, or just a decent action flick, then grab your favorite power-bar and energy-drink and watch it while downing your steroids.\n\nBut is you are a true fan of the original Swayze-Reeves 1991 classic POINT BREAK, and were hoping this might be even half the movie the original, you will very, very disappointed.\n\nThe studio execs should have just called this mess NO POINT or GIVE ME A BREAK, because there is absolutely no point in watching this piece of crap excuse for a film."

A lot of people don't appreciate it, but it is one of the few movies in the world that tries to capture the feeling of being fearless. It succeeds on multiple fronts for me, and the cinematography and timing is superb. You get to go places that you probably will never go in your life time. I think people who are used to sitting on their couches and critiquing movies are making the reviews. You should not listen to them. This movie is a must-see, an experience of things few people will ever do in their lifetime, and yet... there are people doing them.\n\nWhat does it feel like to be truly free? It requires not only the external circumstance of being able to do \"what you want\" to do. It requires physical fitness, stamina, and your own inner choice to be free, regardless of the constraints of society. Doing what you believe and choose against all odds, taking the consequences for your actions, and then to know what it is to live without fear. FEARLESS.\n\nHow many fearless people are reviewing this movie? There are few in the world, my friend, and I am one of them. This movie resonates with me for that reason."

My advice is: Don't compare it to the original, because it's not trying to be the original, just enjoy for what it is. Why? Because it has some great action scenes that couldn't have been easy to film and clearly required a lot of effort, thinking and planning. Visually, it's quite stunning and captivating. Seeing the characters just living life and doing all these cool things in all these exotic places made me dread going back to work. Nothing beats the original, but this is also a cool movie that I'd rewatch again for the overall vibe it has and the feeling it gives you and leaves with you. Same as the first one in that regard, but minus the legendary bromance between Keanu & Swayze. The creators of this movie wouldn't have made this without being huge fans of the original, so they knew full well the task they were up to. Bottom line: Solid remake with its own cool vibe, just enjoy it without comparison."

That said, this 2015 version isn't bad at all. It doesn't capture that free- spirit aura that kinda had first movie, and it isn't that involving but i have to say i kinda enjoyed it, at least for the first hour. The first hour of this movie was very good until the gold mine scene, from there this movie kinda lost it's track. Later there were also beautifully photographed scenes which unfortunately didn't ad up.\n\nActing was OK by everyone involved. The real star of this movie is the nature itself and how it was photographed - there are some truly stunning images in this movie, and you can clearly see why this movies budget was more then 100 mill. $. Shame that they didn't spend it one script, which feel kinda broken during second part of this movie.\n\nOverall, if you are hoping that 2015 version of \"Point Break\" will capture the same guilty pleasure of it's proceeder, you won't find it here. On it's own this new movie isn't bad at all. Unfortunately second half of this movie is very inconsistent, with characters popping up in places at the same time that would be impossible. That said \"Point Break\" 2015 as a whole isn't not bad flick to see it once, but after seeing it you won't ever gonna want to come back to it again, opposite to first movie, which kinda watch in a couple of years again and again."

This contemporary movie lacked the in-depth passion and devotion of Keanu Reeves firstly by the leading role Luke Bracey. Secondly, it is not a perfect thriller nor action or adventure by category. Rather it is a mixed up of all these categories so that, it does not fall appropriately into any of these categories. Thirdly, protagonist character of positive side is much more blurred than the protagonist negative character which was seemed not the utmost intention of director or script writer. Finally, the climax was very much hurried and was unable to cope up with the continuity of the entire film and it would be rather judged as a very poor climax."

        "review_detailed_main": "Point Break of 2015 could have been called anything else and it would have been a better movie. So, let's get going on this.\n\nSynopsis: A young FBI agent infiltrates an extraordinary team of extreme sports athletes he suspects of masterminding a string of unprecedented, sophisticated corporate heists. Deep undercover, and with his life in danger, he strives to prove these athletes are the architects of the mind-boggling crimes that are devastating the world's financial markets. Starring: Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey Director: Ericson Core\n\nHere's where the problem lies with this movie: Because of the name a lot of people compared this movie to the original. My thoughts on that are the fact there have been other movies out there that have used the same story line. A rookie cop goes undercover to try to stop a bunch of robbers committing crimes. Hmmm? Wasn't there a movie that came out in 2001 with that same plot line? You know, one that involved cars? There's like eight of those movies now. They just keep getting better. I can't remember what it's called though.\n\nSo, anyway, jokes aside. The movie wasn't a bad movie. It seemed they just sort of said towards the end, \"Well, I don't know what to do here.\" The ending had no excitement to it. It was the biggest let down to the entire movie.\n\nThe actors didn't do too bad for the type of movie it is. There was no way this movie was going to get Oscar worthy performances, and I wasn't expecting anything. I wish they would have gotten the original choice to play Bodhi in Gerard Butler, but Ramirez did okay. Again, it came down to everyone comparing actors.\n\nNot only should they have changed the name for the movie, they should have changed the name of the characters. This movie was doomed in a lot of people's eyes before it even came out.\n\nThe best part of the movie was the practicality of it. Ericson Core made a decision to use real locations and little to none CGI in the movie. It worked for the movie. Probably extremely dangerous, but it worked. Sure it may have been a bit expensive, but it made the movie better. A lot people would use substitutes for locations, this movie made it so you could understand the beauty what the guys were trying to do.\n\nFinal Thoughts: All they had to do was change six characters names and the name of the movie. It would have been at least a star better.\n\nRating: 6 out of 10"

But if you think lame motocross related deaths and dodgy eco warriors are the worst of this films problems, then think again.\n\nDirector Core and his team seemingly sat down at a table and in the space of 30 or so minutes designed a serious of supposedly breathtaking stunts that span the globe and while they look great in a location sense, the actual transpiring of events are so downright unbelievable that any sense of fun or excitement is taken away by the fact it's just too daft to care.\n\nFrom downhill snowboarding, random unnecessarily dangerous rock climbing, perfectly used wing suit fly byes, an exploding rock strewn mountain face and perhaps worst of all, a reimaging of the wave clad finale of the original, Point Break seems intent on becoming some type of hybrid of Fast and the Furious but forgets to make sure that the occurrences happening here are indeed fun and frenetic, rather than overdone and frequently unengaging.\n\nAt the end of the day one could go on and one about the many failures of Point Break but none of it comes as a surprise, as from the moment this remake was announced and then from the very first glimpses of the films atrocious trailer no one expected this waste of $100 million dollars plus to be anything more than a disposable piece of Hollywood trash. With no heart, no soul and with a bunch of uninvolving characters, this film is a waste of time that gets a bonus mark for its intrigue factor as a solidified sunken ship, it's just a shame it took down two up and coming Australian actors in the form of Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer with it.\n\n1 mink blanket out of 5"

Getting shot at and took one in the gut? take off your helmet. no need for that shiz when you're a hard as nails extreme sports athlete.\n\nAnd whats with the chick 'roofy-ing' this dude, every time he had an emotional/sexual encounter with the chick, he woke up the next day disoriented and just cruises on with the fact that he had just been possibly date-raped against his will, seems to me like they're trivializing the rape game, and only because its a reasonable looking girl she gets away with this devious crime unpunished.\n\nThe saving grace was the bad-as-s' cliff climbing sequence which had me shitting my pants with anticipation, solid stuff.\n\nbut back to the 'bullshiz', opening scenes, who the hell packs money for international shipping just with a net over it, seems a bit susceptible to the average baggage handler pickpocketing himself a nice wad of cash, but made it much easier for them to waste countless dollars cutting the net thousands of feet up in the air where it would blow all over the godda mn rain-forest and lost forever with the few little settlements getting a little sprinkling of that paper goodness. Surely the 'should've' let the crates fall as a whole, so it would be in a concentrated area, further portraying these 'extreme dudes' as small minded 'dumbasses'.\n\nAgain with the gold heist, wasted into nothing in that rock-slide scenario. and with dropping the diamonds out of an airplane into a dirty little shack village in the middle of nowhere. 1 the majority of those diamonds would be lost forever in the mud and 2 how the hell are these poverty stricken peeps supposed to have a diamond trader in their network of mates.\n\nCoupling those oversights with the ridiculously superhuman feats of extreme sporting, from taking 100m drops on dirt bikes after half a mountain avalanches behind them to falling of what seems to be at least a 250-god-damn-metre-high waterfall, dudes are built harder than wolverine for gods sake. also their methods defy rational though but yet they manage to pull it off in this movie, i.e jumping off a moving fisherman boat (driving out to sea) into a 100ft wave moving the opposite direction and making it look like 'child's play'.\n\nTo sum up, good for a light watch if you love picking apart impossible feats of extremeness, with pretty bland acting and no 'hot chicks' to distract from it, I would give this a score of 3 buckets of bullshizzz out of 5 and 4 knickerbocker glory moments of averageness out of 10. Apparently the original is much better according to a ginger dread-lock 'rastafari' next to me, but that remains to be seen."

The characters are weak and the story is badly written coupled with the weak acting and an over reliance on not very interesting extreme sports this movie was always doomed to fail. The original is a classic heist movie this one is a lame advert for extreme sports. There is very little plot in between the all the crap I keep expecting to see red bull adverts everywhere lame lame lame"

Hollywood enough is enough be original. If you really have to make a remake at least just do a sequel and leave the original ALONE. Sorry people my rant is over. The only good thing I can say about it is the action which there was a lot of and that's it. In my opinion they destroyed the memory of the original and made a whole new generation of people miss out on a classic because after seeing this they won't watch the classic version"

The extreme risks these guys took to film Alone was worth 10 stars. The story was typical and plain, and the acting from Utah and Bodhi were Good. If you want to see Breath Taking scenery like NOTHING ELSE, with the plot to Point Break thrown in the middle, go see this. Just don't go in with expectations, except for Tons of adrenaline junkie sports and amazing shots. It's a fun movie, and a fun ride, nothing less, nothing more."

This formula won't work all the time like '300' and 'Fury Road', but it's really good for watching in digital 3D.\n\nThe story was kind of sameness, but slightly altered, especially about that 8 ordeal and stunts were obviously freshly designed. The graphic works were weak in some parts, it failed to give a natured effect. Yeah, I think CGI is the issue, the movie relied on it for everything.\n\nThe cast performances were fine, but a big star in the lead might have given a different result. It's entertaining, but that was not enough these days, especially for a cop movie we expect details, not just physical tricks. IMO its a one time watch movie, or better try the original.\n\n6/10"

It began as FBI agent Johny Utah, played by Luke Bracey, chasing after a team of sport extremists around the world.

It just seemed that Utah was no longer with the FBI, and it was if he never was.\n\nThere was a poor attempt to reconnect Utah to the FBI before the ending, and it really did not make up for the middle half of the movie.\n\nThis movie had some awesome concepts to it, but the lack of a concrete story killed it."

Unfortunately, there was no real storyline that connected the characters to the whole point of the movie. And I think this was in large part to all of the amazing physical stunts involving snowboarding, skydiving and parachutes, etc... Because they tried to fill up the movie with amazing stunts, they forgot that for the movie to be good, it was going to need a storyline. And this movie didn't have one.

But the basis is only that the characters have the same names. Point Break is an action film best suited for testosterone-charged teen boys. The plot goes nowhere. The acting is weak (at best). The film's attempt to attach a philosophy to the extreme sports is juvenile at best. Point Break is too loud. There were too many tattoos. The FBI does not really run independent international operations. On the positive side (yes there is one--barely), the 3D photography is spectacular. The extreme sports scenes are impressive. If it weren't for the photography, I'd rate this film 0. The last 3D film I saw was Friday the 13th, Part 3. It's plot was no worse than that of Point Break. The real star of the film is the 3D photography. It is a shame that a better plot could not have been found.

Most of such productions do not appear as very original nor extraordinary. Although, from time to time, we can also find some surprising scores, wchich rebuild our ruined fate in greedy Hollywood producers. They go down into our memory. Many times, we want to re-watch them again, again and again one more time. One of such movies is Kathryn Bigelow's \u0084Point Break\" from 1999. Unfortunately, same words can't be said about the Core's\n\nNewest \u0084Point Break\" by Ericson Core is such a schematic and predictable, as every movie created only for visual effects, wchich have been so important for screenwriters. However, the plot seems to be only a minor supplement. Who cares, right? So, what do we get here? A threadbare story, wchich tries to stole as much as it's possible from the original. Young FBI agent, with embarrassing past, must infiltrate the mysterious organization suspected of many crimes, committed with the help of their amazing sport skills. Do you fill familiar with this description? By replacing some words, you could easily come with a conclusion that many action movies are the same, for example \u0084The Fast and the Furious\" and also Bigelow's \u0084Point Break\". Thanks to the forceful action sequence pictures and technics how they were taken, we may partly forget about mediocre plot. It looks like, Core hasn't known about that. And he probably still doesn't. Because of that, his \u0084Point Break\" is more condensed around crass plot, rather than around extreme sports.\n\nSuch things like crazy and dangerous stunts on surfboards and snowboards, motocross rides and jumps from planes have been reduced to minimum. These are a few scenes, wchich have turned out really all right. It shouldn't be a big surprise, because Core was a director of photography at such productions as \u0084The Fast and the Furious\" and 2003's \u0084Daredevil\", what gave him a necessary experience in this field. Although, it doesn't mean, that he should have neglected all the other features of the movie like good plot or characters. All of these features are only the caricatures of their archetypes from 1999, without any natures, starred by the stiff actors. They look more like the sect of insane ecologists, rather than a division of athletes.\n\nNew version of \u0084Point Break\" ignores every kind of basic elements of good movie: well-written plot, interesting characters and most of all a dynamic action. It's one of the worst kind of productions, wchich creators hopped that, a few good action scenes would build up the whole film. Unfortunately, they were mistaken. It doesn't work like this."

Then there was fragile Lori Petty who played \"the girl\". All 4 of these actors did memorable jobs in the 1991 version, but here in 2015, only Ray Winstone adds a bit of showmanship.\n\nThe current version instead of being US centric is Euro centric, which I guess someone figured out might make more money but doesn't make for a better film. The film's star and most of the cast were unknown to me, which isn't necessarily bad if they bring something to the table. I thought they didn't.\n\nBut worst of all is the editing. What must have been incredible stunts are reduced to edited pieces so that the true nature of the stunt is never captured. By doing quick edits the story lacks the true impact of the stunts, and could have been done on a sound stage in some cases. Here is one film in which long takes would have been mandatory, but they are rare."

        "review_detailed_main": "My attitude changed very quickly watching this \"remake\". First, I was surprised (pleasantly) with some new fresh faces on the screen. OK, maybe they don't have their full acting \"chops\" yet, but they do a very nice job of building decent characters and showing the tension and caring in their relationships. Luke Bracey, does a nice job with Johnny Utah and is sure to be the new heart throb for the ladies. I have a hard time with Edgar Ramirez, who struggles a bit with Bodhi, but he comes across well when it counts.\n\nI thought the storyline actually tries hard to provide a fresh take on the original, but it probably tries a little too hard. The plot gets outlandish in places and veers away from the original, but gets a B+ for making the effort and ties it up OK at the end. It's pretty much what you would want in a hard core action movie. I will say there are a couple of romantic twists and turns that prove eventually to be fairly arresting.\n\nBut there is one area where this movie just blew the original away. The extreme sports scenes are almost shocking. One scene literally felt like I was in it and had me totally freaked out it was so frightening. Let's just say it's a skydiving sequence that unless you are an extreme athlete, you think something has gone very, very, wrong. The surfing scenes may be the best thing about the movie in itself. There is something about 80 ft. waves and those that ride them that evokes a kind of primal majesty. And then of course there is a rock climbing scene that is still giving me nightmares.\n\nThe bottom line here is that this Point Break is it's own movie. Yes, it borrows from the original, and uses the name, but that really doesn't even factor in here. This is Point Break for 2015 and it works for me. The new actors and the insane extreme sport sequences taken together puts it's own shine on what we remember as a great movie, and makes it better."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1991, Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze gave life to Johnny Utah and Bodhi, respectively, in the movie Ca\u00e7adores de Emo\u00e7\u00e3o (Point Break, 1991). Twenty years later, Ericson Core directs the new remake of the movie Ca\u00e7adores de Emo\u00e7\u00e3o: Al\u00e9m do Limite (Point Break, 2015), bringing back the characters that marked an era in cinema, now as Luke Bracey and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez.\n\nThe feature tells the story of Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey). A radical sportsman, he enters the FBI after trauma in his past, and infiltrates a skilled team of adventurous athletes, led by Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez). They are the main suspects in a wave of unusual crimes: the group robs large corporations and distributes the loot to the poorest, escaping in impossible ways.\n\nThe group aims, through its crimes, to complete a series of extreme challenges to connect with nature and return to it part of what the human being removed and destroyed.\n\nThe film fulfills what it promises, with extreme sports as the focus of production. There are dozens of action and adventure scenes performed by elite athletes, such as giant wave surfing, wingsuit, snowboarding, free rock climbing and high-speed motorcycle racing. The footage is excellent and steals the breath of adventurers and sports lovers.\n\nDespite the good action scenes, the plot behind it is quite fragile. It is difficult to swallow the justification of connection with nature or the incarnation of a wingsuit Robin Hood. Often, we have the feeling that the script is a mere justification for filming some extreme sports shots. The central story is left aside so that top athletes can shine.\n\nThe performances are satisfactory, but the group has little chemistry on the scene. Especially in the forced romance between the protagonist and one of the members of the gang, which could easily be dismissed, as it adds little to the script or the evolution of the film. The highlight is Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez), who manages to interpret the role of the vigilante villain well.\n\nCa\u00e7adores de Emo\u00e7\u00e3o: Al\u00e9m do Limite is a grandiose production, full of the most diverse radical scenes. The film is worth it for the beautiful footage and for lovers of extreme sports, and can be a good choice for unpretentious fun."

Complete lack of pacing for character development, i'd argue that character development was just slapped on for the hell of it.

He wants to become a part of it because he suspects that they are sophisticated corporate heists. Since he is going to be undercover for this mission he tries his very best in order to be accepted from the team and gain their trust. His life will be in danger and he has to prove to these athletes that he is one of them since they hunt the legend of the Ozaki 8 and are ready to do anything in order to achieve this goal.\n\nI liked this movie because it had a very unique and interesting plot. It was a very different crime movie from all the crime movies I had already watched because a lot of sports were involved. I liked the direction which was made by Ericson Core and I believe he did a great job on it since he combined very well many action scenes with sports and also the connection between the characters of the movie was very well placed. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I liked the interpretation of Luke Bracey who played as Johnny Utah and Edgar Ram\u00edrez who played as Bodhi.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to say that \"Point Break\" is a nice action movie with a decent plot and some good interpretations. If you are a fan of action movies then you should watch it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you are going to have a lot of fun.

It was quite an enjoyable caper.\n\nWhy this thing was re-made is a mystery; I can only speculate that someone, somewhere, told TPTB that 'I kind of liked Point Break back in the day. I remember that movie.' And because Hollywood is barren of any new ideas/terrified of not making enough millions to support their trophy wives and coke habits, they figured, 'yeah, people kind of liked Point Break back in the day, it's gonna be a sure thing. I mean, it's got Hawaii and water and a bank heist caper. What could go wrong?'\n\nIt doesn't matter. The story doesn't matter. The scenery doesn't matter. The extreme sports or whatever doesn't matter. People aren't going to flock to this thing because of any of that, yearning for a remake of a brilliant brilliant work of art.\n\nThis movie doesn't have Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, in all their young smoking hot glory. This movie lacks the 'ho-yay' element with its cast of nobodies.\n\nThat's my opinion. Look at it if you want, but if you've never seen the original, it is lacking. The remake is a timekiller and nothing notable."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original Point Break was an American story. Although there wasn't much background information on the characters in it, you got the sense that the gang knew each other since high school. Meanwhile the cop had been a college football hero.\n\nThe new Point Break goes \"Euro.\" The characters have accents and the setting is in Europe for the most part. Also, in the original there was a group of guys robbing banks to finance their endless summer and the leader had some vague philosophy about living life on your own terms and showing the world that \"the human spirit is still alive.\" But they weren't trying to change the world.\n\nIn the new one the guys do crimes that have a huge impact on the world. They also believe that their work is of monumental importance, and they make some effort to help the poor along the way. *But most importantly the difference is that in the old one, they did their crimes for the money itself. In the new one they don't need money, because they have a financier.\n\nI felt that both main characters had engaging looks and personalities. There are a few super awkward moments where Luke Bracey tried to basically imitate Keanu Reeves. I understand that they were paying respect to the original, but that was lame.\n\nIn the original there was little or no dialog about the morality of what the gang was doing. That was a big hole in the screenplay. In this one, there is a line or two about potential hypocrisy.\n\nThe girl part was so awkward in this new one. All we know is that she had been adopted by some freaky Japanese adventurer. No one even explains her accent. Supposedly she has known the gang leader since childhood, but he is more like a brother than an ex-boyfriend.\n\nIn this version, the cop figures out the plot from the very beginning, before even meeting the guys. Then he goes directly to them. In the original there is some confusion and a red herring.\n\nThere is no charismatic older partner cop in this one. This guy is just some old European with few lines. The original had an eccentric Vietnam veteran with great lines and a sense of American humor. Also, in the original the commanding officer is an idiot and unsympathetic. In this one there is a black guy who supports our main character from the start. (There were no black characters in the original either) The action scenes are spectacular. That includes the photography and timing. But ultimately the whole thing is just an excuse to show these scenes. I'm not complaining. I enjoyed it.\n\nI think the next step should be to make a \"prequel.\" You could have one for the original and one for the remake. I need to know how these people became who they are.\n\nOur philosopher leader in this one must be in his late 30's and he's from Venezuela. What the heck has he been doing for the past 20 years and how did he become so good at extreme sports without any fame? Who the hell are his partners and how did he meet them? Why are all of them so skilled at extreme sports? All of the gang characters are much older than the gang in the original Point Break. These guys are grown men pushing 40. That in itself makes the feel of this one quite different.\n\nCheck it out. It is worth seeing for the action sequences. Don't expect it to stick to the original plot. Just accept it for what it is and enjoy. Don't listen to the reviewers who hated it, because they are judging it as purists, instead of as action fans."

Ignore the 5* ratings.\n\nAMAZING FILM."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the summer of 1991 when we saw to reach movie theaters an irrational but refined, surprising and addictive action thriller that challenge gravity, we knew that we would have a 123 minutes runtime project full of beautiful sequences of action but with an argument too empty. How wouldn't it be exciting to see Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze acting against good and evil at the same time? Infiltrate a band with eccentric masks and exposure to thousands of dangers?\n\nNow, then, Why do a remake which did not have any impact? Surely it is because we are in the Decade of remakes to revive old films and turn them into masterpieces of genre (Mad Max: Fury Road) as perhaps all this was not the case.\n\nThe new version had the opportunity to change this bitter taste that left the first and in order of quality, obviously achievement it. The film had two choices, let yourself go by the absurdity of the original and pass without rhyme or give us a good project with a delicate picture and keep in a new line of action and adventure.\n\nEricson Core opted to mix all the above mentioned, reducing that bitter taste that left the delivery number one. A risky man Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) full of strong tattoos and a powerful look comes (no reason, or if a reason is to be youtuber) the FBI to dismantle a group of apparent thieves that affect the entity. After his operation, meets the man leader Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez) a Monsieur Hood of the topicality. What new is see in a 3D aesthetic a motocross race, a beautiful caused collapse, a spectacular flight and each of the 8 extreme challenges that truly are presented in a majestic way.\n\nBracey or Reeves? Australian decided give it a touch more staff to Utah and its similarity to Utah is very unreasonable. Ramirez actually feels the character and dazzles us with his team at their extreme tests. Palmer is inconstant and is not permanent in her performance, ending in a way too clich\u00e9.\n\nPoint Break's powerful emotions believe achieve fill a small argument with intense and dizzying risky scenes, that are aesthetically eye-popping, a white of snow in the mountains or a vehement sequence in Venezuela (seriously, almost vomiting, for the dangerous and influential images) or with the participation of personalities such as 'Teresa Palmer' or 'Steve Aoki' himself. Action events are never lost and they gain the continuity necessary to impact the audience easy. These are points of beginning for future projects within the type.\n\nThe game Bracey - Ramirez is late and too reckless. Utah occasionally is congruent but is Bodhi who actually with his dystopian attitude and lack of character manages to establish the relationship. \"Point Break\" enters this time perfectly, with interests and political issues that strike with what will happen soon. in the film they reminded it again and again \"Isn't it beautiful?\", more and more insistent. It is magnificent and is entertaining but directly not precise and briefly makes us imagine that we are back in the thriller in 1991."

I'm not as extreme as these redbull athletes are but I know and understand what goes through their minds and why they do it. Normal people just won't understand. That's why this movie is so awesome! It really pays respect to different extreme sports. It's more a tribute to all extreme athletes. There were so many in the film including Chris Sharma. This alone already makes this film super awesome! Those who rated it bad either don't know those athletes or just plain puss***."

The cinematography is laughable and the character development.. there is not character development. A geico commercial has more dept and value, that kinda says it all.

Are committing crimes, it just for make any sense whatsoever. Laughably superficial and generally weak, only some cool action scenes can save it from absolute mediocrity. Still, the fake surfing scenes look like crap and are downriinsulting to anyone that loves surfing. Another lesson on why we should just leave the originals alone and avoid remakes. Especially with weak directors and actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, so last night was the annual Lucia Movie Night here in Sweden, where SF (Swedish Filmindustry) do their part to keep the kids away from the streets during Lucia Wake. They do this by having a drug- and alcohol free all-night event at their cinemas all across the country. For 295 SEK (app. $40-45) you get popcorn, soda, a few other refreshments AND three undisclosed previews of films yet to open in theaters. Where I live, in Ume\u00e5, they NEVER tell you the name of the movie beforehand. You have to wait and see for yourself when the title pops up on the screen.\n\nYou can bet everyone wanted Star Wars, but everyone also knew that wasn't going to happen.\n\nThe last film of the night, starting at about 05.15 in the morning, was this one, Point Break. I was all excited when I realized what it was (which was right at the start, when one character calls another character 'Utah'). But my excitement checked out and went home to catch some well needed z's pretty quickly.\n\nThe plot is somewhat different to the original, mostly the changes revolve around the bad guys and their reasoning for doing what they are doing, but also around the character Utah, and his background. It is also glossier (if you know what I mean), much of this is due to the 3D-effect, which is prominent and very much in your face - but also creates a feeling of nothing being done for real...something I know isn't true. A lot of the stunts were if not 100% real, then at least close to 100%. But the 3D makes it all look fake somehow... I tried removing the 3D effect occasionally - by closing one eye - and it really did look a lot better without it.\n\nThe biggest change from Kathryn Bigelows modern-classic-original however is the fact that this version doesn't make me care about the characters...at all! It borrows a few iconic scenes (most prominently the \"angrily shooting into the air\"-scene and the ending...sort of) and it makes no excuse whatsoever about cramming these images into the film. It tries SO hard to make audiences go 'Ooo, did you see what they did there! That is from the original that is!', but as this film is so infuriatingly inferior (say that quickly five times) it only makes me a little bit angry, that it didn't even have the guts to stand on its own two legs as a modern day action movie.\n\nIf you plan on seeing this in the theater, but have never seen the original, Make sure you do see that one as well! But in this case I dare to say it doesn't matter if you see it before or after you see this remake, because no matter what you WILL see that this is nothing but a cash in on on of the best action movies of the 90's."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm cutting this movie some slack and giving it a 7 even though it probably deserves lower. The reason is that for all it's bad acting and poor writing, I liked the general concept of the movie - it had the germ of an idea. So what went wrong? As mentioned in the top review on this site, it was obviously a \"Gen Z\" re-make of a film from an era where actors were not afraid to smile and have some character. This helps in relating to other people, including the audience. But it all starts with actually liking people better than computers and video games. None of the characters in this movie were at all likeable and all were humorless. On the other hand, I found it a bit refreshing to see a movie where the treasure sought was not money or gold but rather the treasure of nature. This concept could really combine well with extreme sports and more or less living off the land, which they did when they were not partying on a yacht owned by another non-person or smoking dope in an abandoned warehouse admiring their tatoos. Serious \"too cool for school\" concerns in this movie. But you look at other franchise re-boots like Bond and you see the same issues - anti-social behavior of Gen Z actors, no humor, frenetic action and poor writing and character development. There also seems to be a fundamental problem of combining extreme action with actors who one can identify with - they seem to be stereotyped as dead serious. The last problem with the movie, and the one I think that really killed it was that the cult leader was unconvincing. He looked like a coder. An artsy Val Kilmer type channeling Jim Morrison playing with torches and really whipping it up would have gone a long way to making us believe in the movie. But that takes a BA degree, not computer science. The film also failed to educate the viewer about the Osaki 8 etc. What the ineffectual protagonist says is hearsay to a skeptical viewer. Obviously, at the beginning of the movie there should have been a flashback scene showing Osaki but instead we get this cheap McGyver like beginning with motorcycles. What did that have to do with the plot of the movie? They could have worked that scene in elsewhere, maybe as a task. I could have titled this review \"Pointless\" - just don't see why anybody would want to re-make a classic movie. It's like trying to re-paint the Mona Lisa. Make your own damn movie."

They only spent 15min trying to develop relationships between the characters. The plot was ridiculous, Geen Spiritual warriors on a quest to make rich corporations pay, meanwhile randomly killing innocent workers. A few good action scenes cannot hold up an entire film."

I generally rate Bond movies 6 to 8. This Point Break remake is at least as good as Bond action and better in some ways - mainly it's a bit more plausible. Instead of a super spy and diabolical bad guy both with unreal tech tools, it's 'sort of real' extreme athletes doing radically dangerous action. Just enjoy the scenery and stunt action."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Point Break\" (2015 release from US/China; 113 min.) opens with a crazy sequence, where we see a couple of bike riders attempt an outrageous stunt, only for it to end in tragedy. We are then told \"Seven Years Later\", and our hero is now in the FBI Academy. Before we know it, he is off to infiltrate a group that is, well, I'm not going to tell you. At this point, we're 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.\n\nCouple of comments: first, while there is of course a plot that guides the movie (and the plot is only in spirit connected to the original Point Break), I have to say that the plot doesn't matter in the least. Why? Because let's face it, we are here to see what crazy stunts the film makers can pull off, while making us believe that they are real. And do they? Yes, they certainly do, although I can't tell to what extent the stunts are real or fake. For example, the free solo rock climb at Angel Falls in Venezuela: if that was real, that was pure insanity, period. Second, this movie is mostly by a no-name crew. The only names that jumps out to me include Kurt Wimmer, who wrote the script (and previously wrote the script for Salt and the remake of Total Recall), and Junkie XL, who composed the movie's score. Third, this is a US-Chinese co-production, as in: the Chinese (through DMG China) put up a lot of the money for this movie. When you watch the film, it was clear this was an expensive production (filming in India, Italy, Austria, Venezuela, Tahiti, Hawaii, Utah, and other places), so curiosity got the better of me and I looked up what this movie cost. I almost fell out of my chair when I read that the production budget was over $100 million (and that's not counting the marketing budget). Did anyone even ask for this remake?\n\nI was on the fence about seeing this,but curiosity for the action scenes got the better of me so I went to see it during the New Year's holidays. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Fort Myers was attended okay but not great. If you are a sucker/addict for extreme sports, you may want to check this out. If not, there honestly is no reason whatsoever to see this movie."

This is not Shakespeare, so I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances. It delivered what I expected, and even found a way to keep the ending of the original film intact and even more visually stunning. Despite the similar story and wider array of stunts and extreme sports, this version was able to deliver a more family friendly film than the original. The original will always be a classic.

The action scenes for this one were over the top... yes it's extreme sports but it's too extreme that it's not believable. Rock climbing without safety gear? Seriously?! There was no chemistry at all between Johnny and Bodhi.. or even Bodhi and Sarah (or should I say Samsara as what they call her now) in this remake. If you have not seen the original, maybe you will find this one decent enough. But if you have watched the Keanu vs Patrick Swayze version.. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"

Delroy Lindo, Ray Winstone did a good job. So did Teresa Palmer and Matias Varela from the bad guys gang.\n\nOn the other hand Bodhi was a miscast for me. While I liked Edgar Ramirez' type, he clearly doesn't have enough Charisma for the role. Compared to Patrick Swayze he was just a 0815.\n\nAlso Bodhi and Roach looked too similar. I kept confusing the two. That was not ideal. For me Bodhi should clearly stand out from the male baddies. In this case Clemens Schick as Roach stood out instead.\n\nSo why not cast Schick as Bodhi. He has much more Charisma than Ramirez. Then for the role of Roach, a different type could have been chosen.\n\nOr someone like Scott Eastwood as Bodhi. And Schick could be kept as Roach."

Yes the story is ridiculous and the characters are paper cutouts but that's not my beef.\n\nReason 1: The only female characters in the movie are babes in bikinis populating the raging parties, or one huge-jugged space-eyed girl who utters a few lines, has sex with the main character, and is never heard from again. Out of all the significant FBI characters, and the four members of the extreme athlete group, not one is female. This is America. It's 2016. Give me a break. This movie perpetuates the message to its young viewers that men are the great athletes while women are peripheral, staying home to party and make salad and screw the men.\n\nReason 2: The athlete group follows an extremist ideology that they will wantonly end innocent human lives to advance... hmmm sound familiar? In the present day with ISIS at large and abortion clinics getting blown up, it is totally outrageous to make us root for characters who are basically terrorists. And of course we root for them because they are hot and have awesome powers and we all vaguely agree with their goal of \"giving back to mother earth\".\n\nMedia shapes people's opinions; this movie has two main messages for the American public: Men do great things and women shake their asses. And, it's OK to kill innocent people who are associated with an institution you oppose, as long as you have a sexy accent and rippling muscles.\n\nTotally, completely offensive and anger-making."

As the title implies, it's all about taking it all to the max - taking each challenge to it's most impossible and dangerous. If you like watching YouTube clips of people doing these kinds of stunts in real life, then you'll enjoy this movie. The action is very well shot and the backdrop for many of the scenes is stunning.\n\nUnfortunately there's more to a movie than just action. The plot is ridiculous and, to be honest, a bit too fast paced for it's own good. It goes from one thing to the next within seconds, with no buildup in between. We are teleported rapidly between scenes and it just seems a bit too much - they've just tried to cram too much into the movie to make it coherent. On top of this the character development is extremely limited and the characters' motives are completely nonsensical.\n\nOverall, though, it was a decent enough watch and I certainly don't regret spending the time to view it, but I am left disappointed by the whole structure. As we have seen with the Mission Impossible and James Bond franchises, there is a way to weld together great action and an excellent storyline, but here the latter seems to have been pushed aside. For me, it feels like unfulfilled potential. They did the expensive bits right but forgot about making them work together. Bit of a shame, really."

Even the most Spectacular of Earth's Visual Vistas are Presented in what Looks Like High-Def Plastic. It has about as much Artistic Resonance as those Old 3-D Postcards, just not as Fuzzy.\n\nThe Acting is Atrocious, the Action Never Feels Threatening, although the Stunts certainly were, and that's the Failure of the Film. It doesn't even manage to make the most Stupendous (some say Stupid) and Scary Extreme Sports Stuff seem Threatening.\n\nThe Original \"Point Blank\" (1991) was only a Slightly Above Average Movie, but has Gained a Cult Following over the Years (the reasons are none too clear), but this Reimagining is just Slight."

The reveal of Utah as a cop was also very weak, when you see the original it tends to leave you on the end of the seat in that department. You also expect Utah to do more at the end of the movie, while that's not the case which was a big let down. The ending was very weak and probably ruined the movie for more people. Next to that, the shots were very good and the directing was very good. Personally I liked the story, but not for this type of movie. I'd rather see a sport/adventure movie in a story like this, completing 8 heists doing the most dangerous stunts, something like that. I give it a solid 6,5 though, it kept me watching."

However, this version has a harder edge than the original and some dark turns, to its detriment. Nor are parts of the storyline believable, especially toward the end. At least twice during the movie the protagonists should have died violent deaths, but lucked out. That's a lame crutch the producers didn't need to use--but then the stunts couldn't have been quite as outrageous.\n\nIt's also a little like those extreme sports commercials with lots and lots of action, but it's well filmed, well edited, well directed, and enjoyable. Kind of like a bottle of cheap vodka, whereas the original is a fine wine.

Going into the movie, I knew absolutely nothing about the story, and had never seen either this movie or the original. Perhaps that was the best way to do it, because I had nothing to compare it to, and only judged what was right before me. If you've seen the original, watch this one with new eyes, and if you haven't seen the original, give this one a look.

The closer he gets to Bodhi (Ramirez), the leader the farther he falls back into his old ways and the line between agent and criminal begins to blur. This is a hard movie to review. Mainly because other than awesome stunt sequences the movie didn't know what it wanted to do. The original had an actual plot that involved bank robbers that were surfers. In that movie Utah infiltrated the group in order to stop them. This movie started off with the robbery idea, but quickly tossed it aside and forgot about it. This movie tried to become Fast and Furious, but again the plot got lost. It seemed to me the filmmakers wanted to make a movie about extreme sports and didn't worry too much about what happened in between the stunts. It did borrow form the original movie, but more in the way a book does. By that I mean you need to see the original to fill in the massive plot holes in this one for any of the story to make sense. Overall, watch it for the stunt sequences, especially neat in 3D, but if you're looking for a story you won't find one. I give this a C+."

Everyone looked like they had the flu most of the time. The stunts and location shots were pretty cool, but wasted on a film that desperately needed more substance if it wanted to prove better than the original Point Break. The acting was flat and the storyline was paper thin in my opinion.\n\nYES, I love the original, but I gave this one a fair shot in hopes that it would impress me. It didn't.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well this film had everything (almost everything) to be a great action film. The premise is far from being new, but i could generate a million different plots and stories, some of the most beautiful settings ever seen on screen, super cool thrilling extreme sports, and millions of opportunities to make the most daring thrilling action scenes ever made. But... It just didn't happen.\n\nThis film is truly a wonder, why? Because it has one of the most beautiful cinematography and visuals ever, a 105 million budget, and at the some time a b movie feel.\n\nThe film has a ton of mesmerizing settings around the world, that provide endless opportunities for thrilling action, and yes the film has great action scenes, but they are overall wasted because the director doesn't seem to know how to dramatize the action. The camera moves and shots never really take advantage of the action, and while i usually hate the lack of big shots in action films, here i hate the lack of close ups, since most of the time you never know who you are watching. The action feels too cold and many times, rushed.\n\nA great example of this is the opening of the film, which is really disappointingly lackluster.Characters die unceremoniously without a touch of drama. It all feels like a bunch of things happening, The best action scene probably is the surf one, really great, but then again it could be so much more.\n\nAs i said, the cinematography is stunning, i think i never saw this kind of style. Then the visual effects are really amazing, they look super real. But the editing is quite bad. The continuity is awkward, rushed, feels like there's parts missing. Most of the action scenes for example are too short because its like this thing, that thing, instead of a continuous scene of things. Then the sound mixing is terrible, there's some good effects, like the waves, but everything mixed, the dialogue, the score, the music, the effects, seems weird.\n\nThe voices are like voice over, with a strange auto tune effect. It seems like everyone just recorded their dialogue in a studio and then someone just placed that recordings on top of everything. The music choices are weird. But the most disappointing thing, to my surprise, was the score by junkie XL. It is probably the most out of tone, out of place score i have ever seen. Its like he made the score without seeing the film. And the score is not bad on its own, but it is nothing more that a rehash of Hans Zimmer's scores, like inception and man of steel, but without the things that made them what they are, and with a ton o cheese, and the volume upped 1000x all the time.\n\nAnd the script, which is by far the worst of this film. There's almost no plot, but the one there is could be great, but i wasn't. It's just something cool to show cool extreme sports. The dialogue is not a total disaster, but like its script is right there on the verge and you wonder how someone can write this and think its good. And there's some very weird moments. The end is also so strange!\n\nThe cast is what it is, and they do the best they can with what they have, and the two leads are fine, but the film could have benefited from some bigger talent.\n\nThe film has great style, which is the best it has to offer, with some good action scenes, but they never live up to their potential. There's almost zero drama or thrills, because this is nothing more than an elaborate excuse to show extreme sports. The frustrating part is that behind the elaborate excuse stands a huge potential for a great, thrill ride, filled with high octane drama. A good writer and director would have done wonders with all this ingredients. Truly a waste of potential."

The message is a little eschewed from the original movie, but hey, you have to change the appeal a little bit when you're dealing with a different generation. The message of searching for ones path and the blurred lines between right and wrong, good and evil. Life and living. It can be told a million different ways, so there is no right way to explain this. The only problem here is this movie lacks the balance to explain. It jumps and hops around like the various stunts it attempts and can really lose the story at times. Other than all that, it's a good watch. There is some replay potential here. Enjoy it without holding on to the original cult-classic. Otherwise you may disappoint yourself."

I get it, fans of the original will want to see it therefore income for the movie is greater however, to do this shows total disregard for the original Point break fans.\n\nAll of the characters were substandard, I mean who even were most of them?? And the supporting actors you do know (like Ray Winston) have no substance any more from numerous poor movie castings, I see pay cheque over passion, have some integrity guys! To have made a worthy remake extreme care should have been made when casting. Yes, Keanu's lack of charisma in the original is undeniable, but this only adds to his believable character as an FBI agent and creates some great character development. The main character in the remake is unconvincing, I mean - an ex-motocross rider with total disregard for safety who basically killed his friend does not strike me as someone who would want to be a police officer. He's already portrayed as a bad-ass (unconvincingly) so has no development through the movie and the acting left me with a hollow feeling of disappointment.\n\nBodhi - new vs old: \"Bodhi\" was a word that, when heard, sent me to a warm and comforting place with memories of Swayze, with his sun bleached hair striding through hot desert, or everlasting quotes like \"Yo Johnny, See you in the next life\", life changing! No, really, this character changed my life, he is the ultimate anti-establishment bad-ass! Now, not so much. Thank you arrogant French sounding nobody for ruining my life! This may seem like a bitter slating of a movie based on my feeling for the original, it is. Now understand where I'm coming from here, if it was a movie released independently of the original I'd probably see it worthy of 4-5 stars however, as soon as you call it Point Break you HAVE TO LIVE UP TO THE ORIGINAL, otherwise this happens \u2013 you disappoint on a cataclysmic scale.\n\nI must leave now, I have a suicide journey planned to Angel Falls so I can kill myself like that David Guest looking bell end. \"If you want the ultimate, you've got to be willing to pay the ultimate price. It's not tragic to die doing what you love\" and I f'ing love to hate this movie!"

The action scenes made it watchable but it was just a really good bad movie with these actors. So unfortunately they wasted the opportunity to remake a good 90's action film.

Utah believes these extreme athletes are also performing the Ozaki 8: extreme feats to honor nature and some say that once completed the participants enter a state of Nirvana. You buy that?\n\nNow, let's get real. The only reason to watch this movie is to watch the stunts whether in real time or CGI because they are truly unbelievable and there are many of them. All this may be movie magic, but WOW! Hope you are not afraid of heights as we see many beautiful scenes in extremely high mountains, and of course we see all this from the tops of these mountains. Hope you are not one to get dizzy.\n\nWhat we see: Surfing with almost 80-foot waves, snowboarding down a mountain side, parachuting into a huge hole in the ground, outrunning a rock avalanche on a bike, flying down mountains in flying body suits, bike-riding on the edges of mountain-top ridges and a car chase on a very high and narrow mountain road.\n\nThe story of the FBI going after these criminals gets lost in the stunts as we are relegated to philosophical discussions about honoring Nature via the Ozaki 8. A lot of the movie is somewhat preachy regarding honoring Nature. There is a shoot-out later on at a bank because the funds were cut off from these athletes and they need money to continue their \"heists.\"\n\nThe leader of these extreme athletes is Bodhi played by Edgar Ramirez and he does a credible job. He and his fellow daredevils are decked out in tattoos from head to toe as is Samsara (Teresa Palmer) the love interest for Utah and we can only hope those tats are washable. Yes, Utah also has a lot of tattoos as movies these days seem obsessed with them.\n\nRay Winstone does a very good job as Pappas, an FBI Agent, who is tasked with keeping an eye on Utah as he works his way into the daredevil group. Delroy Lindo as FBI Instructor Hall I s also very good.\n\nYou keep asking about a twist. Well, there is none, but the ending will have to suffice as it goes where you don't expect it to go. Or is it exactly right? Hmmmm\u0085\u0085\u0085 (7/10)\n\nViolence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

Utah somehow convinces his instructor that he knows the motive, to why these robberies are being done. Utah is paired up with an older FBI agent who acts as a baby sitter for the green Utah.\n\nUtah believes the robberies are being done by the perpetrators to complete 8 extreme tasks, to give back to the Earth and to gain self enlightenment. Utah goes undercover and becomes part of the group of extreme perpetrators. Utah joins in with the challenges, and forms a bond with some of the extreme group.\n\nThe locations and scenery is good, and the action is wild. But the extreme sport action scenes are really hard to believe, as it is pumped up to ridiculous proportions. Unfortunately it's hard to like any of the characters in this movie, they have no depth or personality. A huge dose of \"suspension of disbelief\" is needed to get through this movie on a number of levels.\n\nThis movie uses the basis of the 1991 Point Break movie, so its hard not to do some comparisons -\n\nPoint Break 1991 is a more believable story, than Point Break 2015.\n\nThe stars/characters of Point Break 1991 (Reeves, Swayze, Busey and Petty) are far more charismatic and likable than the stars/characters of Point Break 2015 (Bracey, Ram\u00edrez, Winstone and Palmer).\n\nPoint Break 2015 is more heavy on the environment stuff and self enlightenment than Point Break 1991 is.\n\nPoint Break 1991 is a far better movie than Point Break 2015."

The movie takes the core concept of extreme sports enthusiasts moonlighting as criminals and amplifies it to a global scale, offering some breathtaking stunts. From wingsuit flying to big wave surfing, the film excels in capturing the intensity and spectacle of these activities.\n\nWhat it gains in adrenaline, however, it loses in character development and story depth. Edgar Ramirez (Bodhi) and Luke Bracey (Johnny Utah) do their best, but they lack the chemistry and magnetism that Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves brought to the original. The script feels a bit thin, relying more on action than emotional or philosophical exploration, which was a defining aspect of the original.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, Point Break (2015) delivers on its promise of high-octane, extreme-sports-fueled action. If you're looking for a mind-blowing visual experience and edge-of-your-seat stunts, it's definitely worth a watch. Just don't expect the same level of heart or depth as its predecessor."

        "review_detailed_main": "Memories of an 80's or early 90's cult classic can often cloud your judgment when a reboot or remake comes on to the scene. I have to be honest with myself, the original isn't a work of art and it doesn't age well. After recently watching the 1991 version, it was obvious that my memory of the movie was way better than the actual thing. While the campiness and bad acting might have worked when I was a young teenager, it now feels like a self-parody. Let's jump to present day. It's apparent from the opening scene that the new version of \"Point Break\" is trying to have it's own identity. The motocross scene immediately grabs hold of you and squeezes till your left breathless when they make their jump of the cliff. Knowing that this is REAL stunt work and not special effects is what really makes this a fun action movie. It's the same reason why we watch Jackie Chan movies because we know he's putting himself on the line in his fight and stunt sequences. People often compare fight sequences as a dance / art. I believe that it's the same for surfing, motocross, snowboarding and wing suit flying. And the great cinematography really amplify those moments in the film. When it comes to the story, I expected as much as an action movie was going to give. I will say that the new version of Point Break tries to create layers that were not in the original film. But the bar is low enough that practically anything is an improvement from the original storyline. But regardless, it kept me interested since I already knew how the movie was going to end. The journey was slightly different for the characters so it was fun watching a new take on it. As for the acting, they aren't trying to reinvent Reeves or Swayze. While that is a good thing, it also has it's drawbacks. Perhaps because I am now \"grown up\", I don't care for the campiness and less-than-stellar acting of the original. The new faces in this version of the movie do a good job but they don't have the same dynamic or charisma as Reeves or Swayze. But what they do establish a thousand times better is their kinship. The bro-love of the original feels paper thin but in the new movie feels organic and realistic. Overall, this is supposed to be a fun movie to sit down with your popcorn and just go along for the ride. I don't want it to be the original \"Point Break\" but I'm not expecting Citizen Kane. It's an action movie that entertains. Watching the stunt sequences alone was worth the price of admission. When I'm watching a movie like this, I want to say, \"Whoa\" out loud during action sequences and this movie does not disappoint."

The plot is a fair one, it doesn't make much sense but then it doesn't need to do so. The token woman interest is laughable. The lead FBI agent reminds me of a girl i broke up with at college who wouldn't leave me alone, it is really cringe worthy to watch him in the film. I have lots of tattoos and i'm guessing whoever in this production made sure that almost every actor is covered in tattoos doesn't have any themselves other they would understand that it does not automatically make you cool?! The ending is just plain awful, in fact i am watching it again whilst writing this review and it is unbelievably daft!\n\nOK can i compare it now to the original Point Break, i can't resist. Putting aside that the actors playing the two leads of the new version didn't stand a chance pitted against Swayze and Reeves, as i said the portrayal of Reeves in this version is cringe worthy (poor actor) but Swayze's character in this version is actually a good portrayal to some extent. The stories are basically the same, apart from a couple of small changes so i have no idea why people are saying that this remake is not a remake?! The problem is with this version of Point Break is that they try to hard, the original was quite basic and actually somewhat believable but i expected them in this one to be flying into outer space at any moment.\n\nAnyways it's absolute rubbish, if i was 20 years old and had not seen the original i might be arguing with me until i saw the original then i would agree. Worth watching if you are doing something else whilst doing so. If you are going to watch this film on a night in and expect to be entertained then think again, unless you are on the second bottle of wine and it will be OK."

In general, I urge people to check movie review and rating before purchasing tickets. Nowadays, many poorly made movies can attract customers by great poster, good looking and popular actors and great preview footage, which shows very different quality and impression to the entire movie."

It's not only completely unrealistic, it's also stupid and deprived of basic logic. Oh plus the acting is really bad, apart from two actors, \u00c9dgar Ramir\u00e9z and Ray Winstone.\n\nThe basic idea of the movie it actually cool, so I believe it could have been a really good and entertaining movie, if the acting where good, the script was good etc. But trust me this movie ain't even worth a free download on torrent sites!"

As a Patrick Swayze and a Keanu Reeves fan back in the day I was much in approval of their combining forces to make the original film, and when I heard about a remake I thought we would be going down that old route of second time round becoming rather second rate. I'll stop right there.....this film was very much it's own man!!!!! True we had an FBI agent infiltrating a gang to stop a major crime wave but the the similarities pretty much ground to a halt, unlike the film. Where the original was only centred around surfers, this latest offering was focused on many extreme sports and extremely well focused too. My idea of an extreme sport would be ironing in the garden, but here we are treated to different ways of getting down a mountain, leaving a building when you're over 100 floors up, and my worse nightmare, jumping from a perfectly serviceable aircraft (especially galling when it was a C130). Point Break this time, was grittier, darker, more daring and more dangerous and even when my stomach was churning at everything these guys were doing, I loved every minute of it. My hat goes off to the stunt men, I'm sure there were more than a few bruises to go round. But the script writers too deserve some applause as the story kept going throughout. Don't treat this as a remake, it's a new film and it's great!!!"

In fact there was no reason to remake this movie in the first place! The original was far better and had a solid story with solid actors. This awful remake used amateurs who couldn't act in the first place (BODIIIEEEEEEEE bang bang bang bang - argh CRINGE!) or good actors who were so non-invested in the story they couldn't be bothered.

Its a bit like they thought of the stunts and then somehow had to figure out a story to connect the dots. It is that obvious\n\nYou do not really get to see any character development at all. To me the biggest loop hole that you just cannot ignore is that the main protagonist is established as a great free style motor cross driver however when needed he is also somehow a pro surfer, wing-suit specialist, free style snowboarder, naked (no rope) cliff climber. Sorry - you do not just need an absence of fear to do some of those activities you need quite a bit of training and preparation. Naked cliff climbing requires tremendous upper body strength you would definitely need to do a hell of a lot of climbs to achieve that.\n\nIn summary this film is a great excuse to show some daredevil stunts and amazing locations with a bit of product placement to boot. However today most of this can be found on YouTube - For Freeeeeeee"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's one thing to make a soulless movie, it's another to do so in a remake of a movie that was so FULL of soul - it almost seems intentional. The Ex-Presidents in the original really felt like a tight-knit brotherhood; in the remake, they appear to have decided that simply slapping some tattoos and scars on the characters and having them hold hands around a picnic table, hug each other a few times and fortune cookie-philosophize is enough to paint that bond. It isn't. Ramirez had a hard act to follow with Swayze's original Bodhi (one of my favourite movie characters and Swayze roles) and was never really given a chance with such a weak script. As a screen presence he had some of Swayze's zen vibe, but again it is as if the writers and director intentionally sucked all the soul out of his character by giving him nothing to work with. The whole eco-warrior thing really didn't work either; you care more about the Ex-Presidents who were simply about not being part of the system, following the waves and stealing to fund their travels than the tree-hugging crew who aren't in it for the money in the remake. The one way that the remake could have improved on the original was to cast the lead with an actor who can actually act, Keanu Reeves standing out in the original as his usual wooden, cardboard cut-out of a character, Ted Theodore Logan packing an FBI badge this time. But...no. They cast THAT guy, I don't even recall his name, another lifeless cut-out with acceptable surf-hair being sufficient, I guess. With a decent Johnny Utah this time round you could at least say they did THAT right, but again, it is almost as if they wanted to miss on every level. Ray Winstone is a great actor, but yet again, he was given nothing to work with, whereas Busey's Pappas was a larger-than-life character who actually had a role to play, not just there as the cut-out's ride. Lori Petty was the love interest in the original and had a fleshed-out character that you gave a damn about, whereas, yet again, Teresa Palmer was given a character who simply spouted a few hippy-dippy lines and was thrown in to simply look good in a swimsuit. John C. McGinley was fantastic as the FBI chief in the original and despite having less lines, stood out far more than Delroy Lindo's version. It actually hurt me to see James LeGros cameo in this remake because it was a physical connection to the original - there should be no connection at all, this is an insult to the original. Hot Fuzz pays proper tribute to the original and its homage to Utah emptying his gun into the air as he lets Bodhi escape garners the appropriate reaction, a grin, as opposed to the grimace it causes in this remake. I won't even bother commenting on the actual plot or meat of the movie, it really doesn't matter, it's just filler between the stunts. Other reviews put it perfectly, that this remake is just a bunch of Red Bull extreme sport YouTube videos pieced together and called a \"movie\". If you haven't seen the original, watch it. It might not hit you the same way as it did someone who saw it back in the day (for me, I saw it when it came out in 1991 when I was a kid) but you will hopefully appreciate it for a solid, entertaining action movie. Kathryn Bigelow is a legit director who knows how to inject soul in a movie - see Near Dark too, another one of her earlier movies that really shows how she can paint a picture of a tight-knit unit. I haven't seen any of Core's other movies and will actively avoid them after watching this empty Extreme Sports commercial shamelessly disguised as a movie."

You have no empathy for any of the people in this movie and as a result one is just watching scenes of random action that look like cuts from other movies. The acting, like the tattoos, are bad... nay, very bad.\n\nIn addition, the plot is kind of given away in the first 10 minutes of the movies so there is absolutely no build up. It's like, here is the cool good guy and here are the cool bad guys who are really not bad but more like robin hoods of \"extreme sports\" (yes they use that word). The point that Bodhi was an anti-hero, someone that you hated but loved at the same time is lost here completely. This kind of screws up the dynamic of the Utah and Bodhi in the remake completely. Finally Samsara's character has absolutely no dimension to it other than trite-it- girl-tattoos! she doesn't say much and is basically just the \"hot chick\" in the movie.\n\nWatch this movie, it will make you love the first one even more."

He gets help from Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone) and infiltrates a group led by Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez).

In this one, the movie grinds to a halt whenever there is no action. Also it's hyper-unreal that Utah keeps finding these people in the vast ocean. Realism is not expected but some of the unrealism is oddly annoying."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first mistake in the recreation of 'Point Break' is the startling realisation that Hollywood actually thought it was a good idea for a remake to be produced. Surely these fools have enough original material to stay away from projects like this. The second mistake is the absurd amount of money committed to the production of this bland, eco-environmental crime thriller, if in fact that is what it can actually be called. In saying this though, the cinema was at capacity for the reinvention of Kathryn Bigelow's original edgy crime thriller that quickly became a cult classic upon its release back in 1991. Most of the audience were there on the pretense that they were about to witness a crafty update packed with plenty of glorious thrilling action. What you actually get is a misguided film that preaches its obvious left wing message and forgets to develop any bona fide relationships between the cast. As one women stated as we were all leaving the theatre, \"I almost fell asleep\".\n\nLet me start with what was right with the film. There is no doubt that the incredible locations used as a driving force to create an authentic sense of extreme, is a total eye opener. This is where the greatest slice of the reported $105 million budget has gone to. It's a National Geographics where's where of tremendous locations, showcasing the wonderfully powerful forces that mother nature has at her disposal. The audience is treated to mammoth middle ocean surf breaks, stunning scenes of snow covered mountains, and superbly scaled shots of cliff faces rising out from South American jungles. The film is NOT a wildlife documentary and this is where Director, Ericson Core, has failed in his attempt to deliver a production that has any connection with the audience. Core has been too busy in his persistence for shooting the impossibly outrageous stunts than trying to develop a consuming story. Kurt Wimmer's screenplay is not totally weak, doing its best in inviting the audience into the narrative but it just isn't strong enough to balance out the blatant overuse of the death defying skills. Unfortunately 'Point Break' just cannot make it past the first twenty minutes before you realise that this is as good as it gets.\n\nCore's 'Point Break' focuses on the world of extreme sports. Motor Cross daredevil, Utah (Luke Bracy) joins the FBI after a tragic accident sees him walk away from the sport that he loves. He is recruited by his instructor, Hall (Delroy Lindo) to infiltrate the world he once belonged to. His task is to identify and investigate a gang of extreme athletes that have been responsible for some truly impossible heists that has resulted in the loss of billions of dollars. This crime gang has disrupted major American interests but any attempts to catch these fearless criminals has proved fruitless. In his investigation, Utah comes across a man of interest who goes by the name of Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez). Like Utah, Bodhi is highly skilled in all things dangerous and it isn't long before the two form an unusual bond. The young Fed becomes fixated on Bodhi and his crew and when their plans are revealed, Utah must choose between the life he once knew and the life that he wishes to pursue.\n\nAlong for this pointless ride is Ray Winstone as Pappas, Utah's handler while he is on assignment but it becomes obviously apparent that Winstone seems out of place in the whole context of the story. He just doesn't need to be there. Even more confusing is the role that Teresa Palmer plays. She is Utah's love interest, Samsara, but all she seems to be is a stoned hippi who has been carelessly written into the script. While the cast have tried their best to engage with their characters, none seem to have any special attachment to the other. For 'Point Break' to seize the attention of the audience, Bracey and Ramirez needed a certain chemistry to give the film an authentic feel. It all seemed too laboured. It lacked the star power of a Swayze or a Reeves to navigate the narrative through the feeble dialogue.\n\nThe remake of 'Point Break' didn't need to happen. If you plan to see this film based on the presumption that it could be a riveting criminal action film you will be disappointed. The stunts are spectacular and the locations are worth a look but a good reinvention it is not."

Kind of like those \"I read the book so I will automatically trash the movie\" people, cut from that same mold.\n\nMake no mistake, this movie is awesome.

Indeed a fair portion of it is dedicated to and consumed by the portrayal of spectacular yet improbable scenes of these thrill seeking sports. I must say that the visual effects are great, but the story line is glaringly deplorable. And to add insult to injury, the unfitting sudden end of the film certainly confirms its consummate deplorableness. On the whole the film wasn't worth either our time, let alone our money!"

        "review_title": "The \"Point Break\" redeux throws in some great extreme sports scenes in place of much of what made the original film work so well.",
        "review_detailed_main": "When a movie works, it's due to a combination of great writing, directing, casting, acting, set design, make-up and hairstyling, costuming, lighting, cinematography, visual and sound effects, music and mood, not to mention factors like effective marketing, the timing of the film's release, and even luck and other intangibles that are virtually impossible to predict or control. When enough of those elements produce a film that most people like (or, a few people love), it's like a bit of magic. Trying to duplicate that feat is extremely difficult, yet filmmakers still insist on remaking movies that came out well the first time. Remakes rarely, if ever, recapture that magic of the original film. After a quick IMDb.com search of titles from various genres and decades that have been remade, I found very few remakes which rate higher than their predecessors. I believe that 2015's \"Point Break\" (PG-13, 1:53) similarly falls short.\n\nIn this movie, as in 1991's \"Point Break\", a young guy called Johnny Utah goes undercover for the FBI to try identifying and catching a group of mysterious adrenaline junkies committing a string of crimes. But the similarities don't go much farther. Even the title means something different here. Rather than using the phrase as the surfing term that it is, this movie contains dialog that twists it into meaning something more like \"breaking point\", as in an individual's personal breaking point. That's because the 2015 update changes the gang that Johnny's investigating from surfers into the most extreme of extreme sports athletes. These guys are supposedly attempting a completely fictional list of extreme sports challenges called the \"Osaki 8\". These \"ordeals\", as the script refers to them, have new-age-sounding names like \"Emerging Force\", \"Life of Wind\" and \"Master of Six Lives\" and are supposed to lead to spiritual enlightenment. But who knows if that's true? No one has yet survived all eight parts of the challenge! 2015's \"Point Break\" is like the 1991 version on steroids\u0085 and speed\u0085 and more adrenaline\u0085 and whatever else you can think of. Luke Bracey plays Utah, a former high-speed motocross star who left the sport after an especially dangerous ride goes horribly wrong and is now a trainee with the FBI. Delroy Lindo is the instructor who expresses doubts that Utah has what it takes to be an agent. When a small group of daredevils pulls off a series of highly expensive thefts around the world (each heist coupled with a different death-defying stunt), Utah's instructor turns to him for help and sends him undercover to identify and catch the bad guys. Aided by British agent Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone), Utah catches up with the gang at a huge surfing party off the coast of France. A spiritual rebel called Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez) apparently sees something in the fellow extreme sports enthusiast who just showed up out of nowhere because Bodhi befriends Utah and makes him part of his inner circle, which includes the beautiful and equally spiritual Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer). What follows is some very extreme rock climbing, wingsuit flying and snowboarding as Utah tries to prove that this is the gang of criminals that he is pursuing, even as he bonds with the members of Bodhi's group. All the while, the scenery is more beautiful, the stunts are more dangerous, the action is more intense and the plot is more violent than last time. While this movie's visuals are considerably more spectacular than in the original, 2015's \"Point Break\" lacks the colorful characters, sense of fun and marginally believable logic of that 1991 version.\n\nSome may think it unfair to compare this remake with the movie that inspired it, but 2015's \"Point Break\" seems to beg for the comparison. The new version reuses the names of the main characters from the first movie and even recasts one of the original actors (the FBI director who played \"LBJ\" in the earlier version). The 2015 film also pays homage to the 1991 film in other ways, such as the inclusion of a surfing scene. That, however, feels more like an obligatory nod to this movie's origins rather than a heartfelt honoring of the original because the remake changes almost everything else about the plot, the characters and their motivations. Without the name \"Point Break\" attached to it, this wouldn't be much more than a second-tier action movie, an ungrounded film with little reason to exist on its own.\n\nVery little of this \"Point Break\" overhaul works. The actors aren't believable in their roles, their characters act inconsistently (and even non-sensically) and the script puts dialog in their mouths which often sounds dumb. Here's one example of that last point: When Utah cautions Bodhi saying \"You're gonna cross a line you can't come back from,\" Bodhi responds, \"That's the difference between us. All you see are lines. We see the truth.\" To quote another character later in the film, \"What the hell does that even mean?\" The only thing that makes this movie special is its fantastic stunts, the impressive cinematography that captures them and the spectacular landscapes in which they take place. Those scenes alone may make the film worth seeing for some Movie Fans, but for most of us, that won't be enough to redeem a remake that's otherwise pretty dumb. I enjoyed those scenes but the main thing they did for me as a reviewer was keep me from giving this movie the lower grade that the rest of the film deserves. Yes, I happen to be a big fan of the original \"Point Break\", but even judging the 2015 version completely on its own merits, it falls short of what I would consider a quality action movie. \"C\""

A story that is totally implausible, and devoid of substance. Not at all sticking to its roots and contorting the original beyond limit.\n\nWhat was a complete disaster was the direction bit. Frames would jump to an unprecedented area almost abruptly, chipped right in the middle of a conversation. It is a poorly made flick that just crawls on without a point and breaks often too.\n\nThe only good thing about the movie was the stunt bit. All stunts were inscribed under nature's aegis. A lot of time was spent on the waves, in the mountains, mid-air, skiing that manifested sheer nature power. The eight ordeals the team was pursuing were given plenty of screen time. But it was extended too much to cover up holes movie bore throughout. Sure thing Luke Bracey looked phenomenal with his tattoos and Edgar Ramirez coolly played Bodhi to impart a different outlook to his perversion, but there was nothing they could do to uplift the poor editing and direction of Point Break.Befooled by the trailer that showed rad incessant stunts, the movie doesn't cash in on them properly either. The skydiving stunt that was sold in the teasers ends up in mediocrity. Thrilling were the afterthought shouts that would complement the uplifting music. Inclusion of Delroy Lindo seemed like an exercise in futility. If you try to look at the screenplay, there are two or three lines in the movie that are good but have been reiterated quite many times for emphasis.\n\nIn a nutshell, it looks like a discovery channel documentary of people that are good in extreme sports. It was more like a Pointless Break!"

But instead of Bank Robbers and only surfers, this time it's more than just heists and it also features all kinds of other extreme sports activities from motocross to wingsuit skydiving to snowboarding to climbing angel falls, and the team is headed by Edgar Ramirez's character who's determined to reach spiritual enlightenment. And at one point, Luke Bracey's character also fires his gun to the air out of frustration, Keanu probably would look at that version and go, 'Really?!' Again, it's been a long while since I watched the 1991 film, so I won't make the comparison here, but what you need to keep in mind is that this POINT BREAK is style over substance. It's all just about looks and daredevil stunts, there's nothing about the story that anchors you in, the performances of the actors are mediocre, it's one of the most badly-written films I've seen all year, and watching this film would be the most time-wasting way to spend your holidays. Not to mention the film leads to a pointless meaningless ending. So much for that search for enlightenment. The only winners out of all this are the stuntmen and the green screen background."

And this one was a huge production judging by the length of time the credits over dramatic music went on afterwards.\n\nTruly, the movie is a beautiful mounting, although I felt the color tones were a bit depressing. I'm sure that was a choice but, again, had I had the no-doubt monumental initiative to have become the director, and had I been the director, I think I would have gone with something a little brighter no matter how bleak the story.\n\nI was looking forward to seeing the original Point Break redone, not because I expected there could be any improvement to the classic with the unbeatably hot Keanu Reeves nailing something of a debut as the opposite of an airhead, but just because it would be interesting to see how the 1991 film would be revisited 24 years later. I guess that's what goaded the filmmakers to give the movie a new story, and, you know, you have to admit, robbing banks in Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon masks probably wouldn't resonate as much today. As it was, the movie did give a nod to those famous scenes when the antiheroes rode around on little motorbikes that made me wonder if they might be able to fold them up and put them in their back pockets, with masks that, if they did not recognizably mock famous people, were paired with signs such as President Obama's campaign cry \"Yes we can.\" Yes we can was a funny take on the so- called criminals doing exactly what they weren't supposed to do just as, in the original, the filmmakers had fun with Nixon's cry of \"I am not a crook.\" Though the current filmmakers apparently couldn't figure out how to work in Bill Clinton's \"I did not have sex with that woman.\"\n\nThe \"Yes we can\" referred to something else, though ... what these new quasi-criminals dared to do in the execution of and mostly the getaway from their, I guess I'll call them exploits because, more than in the original, the question was if they really were criminals. The problem with the newer story was that there was not much, er, point to this. If you're a fan of American Ninja Warrior or the original American Gladiator which seems to have spawned such shows then you might enjoy what ensues ... extreme sports. If you enjoy watching a string of challenges which have little to do with conflict, go for it. That kind of falls into the James Bond reason for being in my mind, at least of yore; the Daniel Craig ones are more complex, have more character development, as English students always say. With the Bond movies, people were fascinated with the spyware. But if you don't want a plot that is just an excuse for such a showcase, in this case of physical courage, turn away now. I did like how the main roles were cast against the types, Reeves and Swayze, whom we remember from 1991. Luke Bracey is hot ... you'll remember him from November Man but not know it. I guess the guy can act. But now I'm going to go and rewatch the original to see why it worked."

I will list these principles and how this movie measures up in each of them\n\n1. Acting- Acting brings you into the story and make you care about the characters and the story. In this movie the acting is cool and stale. You don't care about these characters and the larger story because of there poor acting. I see better acting in video game cut scenes regularly.\n\n2. Plot - Point Break has an interesting story-line but the story telling is hindered by the acting and the pure focus on action scenes instead of character development. The original Point Break was good because philosophically there were no bad guys and seeing either side \"lose\" in a way made you feel bad. In the end you don't pay attention to this 2015 version's dialogue enough due to the bad acting to feel anything or understand the philosophy fluidly as the movie progresses\n\n3. Visual - This movie is visually stunning but that does not make a movie it makes a good commercial, documentary of extreme sports, or a good demo video for new Digital Video Display Technology. But in modern Hollywood visual excellence is probably the easiest thing to get right so in my opinion it is clearly over rated in its impact to this movie's average rating on IMDb.com.\n\nSummary, this movie is a total waste of time and Hollywood resources. Without the visual impact this is a walk out worthy movie. If truly want a great visual experience only then it my be worth your time but there too many other great movies, documentaries and other media sources that provide an equally great visual experience. Exhaust those other options before wasting time watching this."

        "review_title": "Terrible Remake! 3/10",
        "review_detailed_main": "Review: I've always said that some films should definitely not be remade, and this is definitely one of them! Luke Brace (Utah), definitely didn't have the screen charisma as Keanu Reeves had in the original movie and Edgar Ramirez (Bodhi), was not in the same league as Patrick Swayze. The storyline was also pretty poor but I liked Ray Winstone (Pappas) and Delroy Lindo (Instructor Hall), even though they wasn't in the film that much. The director seemed to concentrate on the stunts more than the actual storyline and the film lacked emotion and purpose. As this movie went down well with audiences on it's first release, making nearly $85million at the box office, the director should have used A Class actors, except for these unknown actors, who weren't that great. On the plus side, some of the stunts were original and executed quite well, which did bring some intensity to the project but Bodhi seemed to waffle on most of the time and Utah wasn't a convincing adrenaline junkie. I personally think that most of the money that was made at the box office, was basically due to the popularity of the first movie, and not because this movie was any good. Anyway, I did have high hopes for this film but like many other remakes, it just turned out to be a big let down. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up: This movie was directed by Ericson Core, whose only other credit for the big screen is Invincible in 2006, starring Mark Wahlberg. You can tell that this movie was made by a director who hasn't had that much experience behind the camera, because he didn't bring important elements to the movie, like suspense, drama and a couple of twists, which this movie certainly needed. He is known for his cinematography skills, in movies like Payback, The Fast and the Furious and Daredevil, and you can't fault the cinematography in this movie but the script needed a lot more work and the actors didn't do it for me.\n\nBudget: $105million Worldwide Gross: $134million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their sport/action/crime movies starring Edgar Ramirez, Luke Bracey, Ray Winstone, Teresa Palmer, Delroy Lindo, Matias Varela and Clemens Schick. 3/10"

There's no character development at all. Unlike the original, you don't find yourself rooting for either the good guy or the bad guy, but just waiting for them both to die. And I guess there's a new law that you can only do extreme sports if you have at least 10 really bad fake-looking tattoos. This remake has really nothing in common with the original except the name, and the character names. There was no plot in this film. I really can't believe they spent $100M making this film! They could have just spliced together some cool stock footage from GoPro and done much better for a whole lot less. Even if you don't care about the lame plot and lack of acting, and you think you want to see it just for the action, STILL skip it! Spend the 2 hours watching YouTube clips of sport stunts instead, and you won't want to kick yourself 2 hours later."

Imagine making a film about a Russian immigrant that opens a pain meds clinic in the United States and calling it Doctor Zhivago. You get the idea. Neither of the ideas that I have listed here is inherently terrible, although neither one would probably be a masterpiece. The problem with these two ideas is that I have taken the title of a previously made film that was of a very high quality and a classic and grafted it onto my so-so film ideas. That is the problem with the 2015 \"remake\" of Point Break, a film released in 1991 about a group of extreme sports aficionados that finance their globetrotting pursuit of their hobby by robbing banks. That film was filled with imaginative storytelling and great action sequences and is the kind of film that you can watch over and over again.\n\nHere's the thing. The 2015 version of Point Break is about a group of extreme sports aficionados that commit crimes not to finance their lifestyle, but as part of some high minded mumbo jumbo filled spiritual quest. In itself the 2015 film is not completely terrible, it just seems that way because the creators decided to graft the title of a really great and memorable film onto it and doomed it to being compared to a much better film. They should have called it Spirit Quest. I give it 4 out of 10 stars."

One reviewer said that Luke Bracet made Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis.....never a more true word said. The plot was generic and although the action sequences were good it wasn't enough, and the 'firing gun in the air' was best done in Hot Fuzz. I could go on but I suggest watching the original as for watching this....well....ahem.......that would be a waste of time....lol.

Mainly all the action is practical and stunt work and it shows some of the best stunts ever put to film just such a shame there isn't much else. I wish there was 30 minutes added scenes fleshing out some of the characters giving Ray Winston more screen time and more to do more scenes of the love interest making her more relatable also more dramatic scenes between Bodhi and Utah and showing him conflicted. I really feel if there was a directors cut with 30 more minutes of story it would been up there as one of the best action movies of the last decade. What we got is still worth a watch for the stunts alone."

        "review_detailed_main": "I once told someone that I hadn't seen the original 'Point Break' film, and they acted with utter shock and disbelief that a film-buff like myself would not have seen that film. It appears that the original has quite a passionate fan-base. I decided to skip the original and just go straight to the remake. It would appear that may have been a bad idea. This was a pretty dreadful effort at making a film. The problems were abundant. The acting is bad, the story is bland and completely lacking in creativity, and the dialogue is poor and often feels like it has been written by a teenager (at best). It also spends too much time simply trying to look impressive, with long drawn out \"action\" sequences of people surfing or free-diving. The only problem with these sequences is that nothing of any importance is actually happening during them. We might as well be watching clips of random people doing the same things on Youtube. I get the strong impression that this film is very far from the quality of the original, because there's no way the original could have achieved a cult following if it was as bad as this film.\n\nI actually really wanted to like 'Point Break'. It started out alright in the first ten minutes or so, while the story was being set up, and I thought to myself wouldn't it be a nice surprise if the critics were completely off base with this one and it turns out to be a diamond in the rough. Sadly, it wasn't to be. Soon after, the whole thing fell apart and never recovered. It's a shame too, because it sounds like a lot of effort went into making the film. It took nearly a year and they traveled all over the world in an extensive shoot. If you're going to go to that kind of effort, you're going to want a script that justifies it. That wasn't the case here."

But in other two categories: action and crime - it's pure 0 points. The characters are dull, the \"action\" (what action?) is there to kind of glue the sports scenes. Nothing more. IF you want to get bored or just \"watch the movie\" with your gf (if you know what I mean) that would be probably a good choice, as it will not keep your attention, and missing plenty of minutes doesn't change anything."

The new film, is an emotionless void. We had been sold by the build up, directors telling us they wanted to commit to film the best extreme extreme sports action sequences possible. They failed. We heard how they were committed to using real athletes to make the scenes as authentic as possible. They needn't have bothered when they are using so much CGI anyway. Take the wingsuit scene for example. The crack is one of the best known lines in the sport, and a quick 5 minute search on YouTube will fine you dozens of clips of many different people flying that exact same line with better cinematography, filmed by their mate with a GoPro on his helmet. The film instead cuts in CGI close ups which absolutely diminish the incredible skill of the pilots who flew the line for the film. Aside from that, the plot is weak, the acting is wooden and you don't care about the characters at all, but that's not why we went. We were sold on the promise of the best extreme sports scenes ever filmed, and what we got was a complete mess, full of the CGI we were hoping to be absent."

The movie includes snowboarding, sky diving, rock climbing, motocross and surfing. The story is about a group of guys that steal from rich corporations and give it to the poor and want to complete 8 extreme challenges. The story really did not make a lot of sense and the dialogue is extremely clich\u00e9d and poorly written. I really felt like I had wasted 90 minutes of my life after watching this movie."

Due to the remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth and nimble perception as if reading a well descriptive prose novel. This team went well and beyond what is standard film directing; and the results produced something Definitely Cool, Narly and Rad! lol.... It bespeaks to us here today, of something greater than ourselves - it picks up where its predecessor left off and as it should, a sagacious writer of the seminal persuasion really hit home with this really cool idea. In time immemorial, we go into journeys to personal enlightenment whilst touching on the plight of modern society in a foretaste to the folly of man and its attendant pitfalls looming darkly over the crimson wavelet cresting over the vast planetary skyline. Whilst the latter, this one here today, is more of an explosive in your face all out worldly blitz of manic clusterF high intensity pure lunacy! There is just not enough time to really build characters and their attendant relationships, but in the nonce, when the world is barely hanging on the fulcrum of its natural axis, it is impossible to maintain any normalcy while cultivating healthy relationships. And if we are to save this planet, our planet from spinning off its axis, caroming into some other dead world whereupon a massive megaton explosion and off the entire universe with which we threaten all of vast tenebrous darkly space with our toxic noxious pollutant disgusting human remains, we need to definitely do something and do it now, like for example, recycle, eat less meat, stop procreating, read a lil' more classic literature and work on new fuel sources, now this might not seem as titillating as flying out of stuff and dive into planetary holes and Then engage the parachutes without dashing thy heads against the retaining trackless walls. I don't know, we all have to do our part and I'm a lil' afraid of heights.\n\nThat is to say, Here and now, 20 something, all around us, all about us, we exist in a ClusterF of chaos. We simply do not have the luxury to luxuriate in any personal journey for we have brought our very planet of bliss to a veritable graveyard resting on the rocks of a sickly charnel house as we float with indifferent despair to our imminent doom. Our chance is now, our domain hangs in the balance, our every choice verily affects whether we live to see tomorrow or we all collectively bring mother nature crumbling to a world wide cataclysm so severe it will make the great flood look like \"The small wavelets next to the big Bowdie big boy waves in the first point break\" lol. When our hedonistic f-all attitudes come to head to head at the bloody pernicious confluence with the Terminal End. But luckily we have a few young men fighting for a chance at achieving 'The Big 8' and expose the error of our selfish ways as we plunder blindly through the vast stratospheres of our ether sucking, and drinking, and warring and Fn our way into a dismal future for a non-existing posterity. ON the whole with a theme nearing a propinquity to that of Armageddon (Although a lil' obfuscated as to how they are going to show the world their legendary prospects with no camera) But OK, I buy it anyhow, Trust me, under the severe theme or plot or both, there is a really cool, fun, narly flix here. It tears through conventional action scenes with its supersonic, flying in the face of the inextricable yoke of the humdrum redundancy which has plagued the creative world since the dawning of chalk or a stick in the sand, it simply kicks major ass and does it with style. I will say, the film needed to be a lil' longer, probably a series, to really build on each character, define the dangerous prospects, reach out to us with the feral of inter-connectivity with which we weave in and out of the filaments of relationships, in order to keep us there, with the true meaning of the theme, which would thereby bring about a tremendous feel for the amazing awesomeness of this \"Sequel?\" For this flix truly was awesome, totally! Hey, Bowdie could have swam back from that big wave way back when perhaps, came out in a younger format, with an accent, maybe? I don't know...."

        "review_detailed_main": "POINT Break Review \u2013 Jack Fitzpatrick . In general, point break is sort of a mess. The characters are empty vessels, their motivations are sort of silly and how we are meant to feel about them is downright confusing. Truth be told: the movie wasn't THAT bad.\n\nIt was\u0085 Fine.\n\nThis movie follows a character by the name of Utah, an ex- famous athlete who is now making his way into a career with the FBI. Utah gets a big chance to work on a big case; Following a group of seemingly professional athlete criminals. Utah soon falls undercover so he can gain the trust of this group of people, find out the information he needs and take them down. The thing is, it's not really done right\u0085\n\nAlright, well I'll start off with the positive; To put it simply, they do some cool stuff. This movie basically felt like a YouTube video that RedBull or some other extreme sports channel would have to offer. The film is an extreme sports advertisement, and hey, some of it looks really cool. The action was shot exceedingly well.\n\nFrom the opening scene with some sweet dirt bike action to the unique and odd looking act of Wingsuit Flying and the intimidatingly dangerous view of gigantic waves pursuing to crash over you while surfing. The movie did make me want to go out and try some of this stuff and was successful in making extreme sports look both dangerous and fun. Making these scenes even better is the fact that most of this stunt work was shot practically. Which seems to be a thing falling into fashion nowadays since films like Mad Max: Fury Road. Crammed between the action scenes however are our obligatory pieces of exposition. And this is where the film really begins to fail. The problem is that you just don't care. You don't care why the characters are doing what they're doing and you don't really care if they even make it out of these situations that they're trying to explain to begin with.\n\nReally the main problem with this film was its characters. I have seen the movie and I still don't understand who these people are or why they are doing the things that they do. Our protagonist is a boring cardboard cut-out \u2013 Doing what he needs to and nothing more, and the antagonist is just as charmless, just as dull and lacking in any sort of personality. As well as a few side characters put in there for no real purpose, such as \"The girl.\" Who is there solely to be \"The Girl\" of the movie.\n\nThe most offensive part of this film is that this is supposed to be a character piece. This is supposed to portray a compelling relationship. It is supposed to divide the Utah's Morals, but instead he stays completely good, we have no doubt in our minds that he is on the right side of the law for any moment. He is not seduced to a life of crime at any point.\n\nOur antagonist Bodhi is just as nonsensical. The film attempts to make this character appear as some sort of deeply spiritual man, with a heart of gold who just happens to do bad things. He believes in this borderline religious belief about committing impossible acts as a way to gain the ultimate experiences\u0085 And then he must also commit more impossible acts but commit crimes these times to give back to the world because the first ones he did were gifts\u0085? Look, the point is it's pretty ridiculous. The film should have had this character either just be a criminal because it's fun and for financial gain or they could have messed around with this idea without trying to make the character seem real cool and edgy. He didn't have to be so \"Zen\" is all I'm saying. He comes off as too preachy and too perfect. It's like the film wants you to root for this philosophically illogical guy.\n\nVisually, this film is rather pretty. The cool colors of the environments surrounding our characters throughout the film drown the screen in profound blues and green. Scenes involving large oceanic waves, deep green forests and unfathomably tall mountainsides covered in pure white snow and jagged rocks are simply beautiful to look at. This is where the cinematography and framing really excels in the film. The film's camera work and editing is passable. It feels both professional and modern, it doesn't bring much that's new to the table however to be fair not many movies do or even can and the work put into the film visually should still be appreciated.\n\nThe acting is OK. There is nothing to stand out but it, but it the actors get the job done. The writing is FINE, but ultimately uninspired and comes off as a failed attempt of being overly spiritual and profound. (This is most apparent during Bodhi's dialogue especially.) Ultimately, the whole movie is nothing more or less than average. I'm not angry at the movie, I wasn't TOO bored, but I didn't love it and I wasn't\u0085 not bored either. All in all, Point break is acceptable and nothing more or less.\n\nPoint break is the definition of 'Style over Substance.' With an uninteresting 'Romance,' some clich\u00e9 'cop moments' and a laughable redo of a classic scene from the original - Point Break mostly fails. But it's still far from the worst thing I've ever seen.\n\nIt's entertaining enough if you have nothing to do and it's got some great action. This is the kind of movie to pop on, half-watch and enjoy some thoughtless action, and to be fair there is nothing wrong with doing that every once in a while. If you can let the 'Remake Bias' go, and keep your expectations low, this movie's fine. 5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm sorry, there must be tonnes of reviews out there that have used the 'pointless' pun. I couldn't help it. It's just too obvious. In case you didn't know, 'Point Break' is a classic action/cop movie of the nineties. Therefore, because of its 'classic' status, it was deemed 'remakeable' by our good friends - those wonderful Hollywood executives. Now, I like to think I'm not a 'remake snob' \u2013 there are arguments for remaking a film, normally if you have a fresh take on something, or if the film was made so long ago that people have practically forgotten the original. However, 'Point Break' was only made in the nineties and is still pretty dear to many people \u2013 namely me. I may be able to forgive this new version for anything other than a cynical cash-grab if the original source material was particularly outdated, but unfortunately the sad fact is that the (dare I say 'proper?') 'Point Break' still looks as good today as it ever did.\n\nIn case you don't know, both 'Point Breaks' are about a young FBI agent (Johnny Utah) who has to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers led by 'Bodhi' who indulge in extreme sports, in order to gain their trust and catch them, obviously. Whereas the original had Keanu Reeves playing our FBI hero and Patrick Swayze as the lead robber, the new one has\u0085 er, actually I don't know either of them. I like to think I'm reasonably good with actors, but I've never seen either of these two in anything! But, I won't hold that against them. I'll save my disdain for the chemistry between pretty much everyone on screen. Everyone just seemed to be trying too hard to steer away from what we already know about the film, but never really achieving it. This new 'Point Break' incarnation is like a meteorite that's got hopelessly trapped in a planet's gravitational pull and is fighting against the odds in a losing battle to escape.\n\nThe new 'Point Break' does its best to try and create something new. The bank robbers don't just surf like they do in the original and it's set across multiple locations around the world, rather than just a single beach in America, but it's simply not enough. I've briefly touched upon the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, but this really becomes obvious when they try and throw in the obligatory 'love interest' in there for Johnny Utah the 2nd. It's truly painful. Almost as bad as watching (the usually awesome) Ray Winstone as Johnny's partner Angelo Pappas. It's just weird hearing these names again, only seeing different faces associated with them.\n\nBelieve it or not, I didn't hate the remake. It's a decent enough film and, if you're into anything from extreme sports to cops and robbers films, you'd probably get some entertainment out of it. But there's a MAJOR but. This only applies if you've never seen the original. If you've watched that you'll be crying out for a slice of Reeves and Swayze. So, if you haven't already seen the original, go and watch that \u2013 it's a true classic of its time which still holds up today. Let the remake be a message to Hollywood that we're not interested in seeing all our favourite movies redone just to make a quick buck."

It had the signature trademark of a brand of Hollywood films which are shallow and which focus on sexy girls and being \"cool\" and \"dangerous\" but in fact, none of the characters were believable or authentic and there was no character build-up and no sense of empathy for them. Without giving a spoiler, the \"bad\" guys that the FBI agent is trying to expose actually have a good reason for what they are doing - but it is completely misplaced in the plot and it has nothing to do with the original thematic thread of the original make of this movie. The lead actor simply doesn't act. He's just a sporty-guy. There was some good extreme sports scenes, but nothing more than one might find on YouTube, otherwise, bad acting, boring and trite plot. The original make of this movie with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze was the cream. Too bad because there are a few decent names in this new rendering. Anyhow, I hate to be so negative about it but I literally couldn't watch it anymore after about 40 minutes into the film and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have enjoyed watching this reboot of a classic film. I like both films, but I tend to be much more of a \"both/and\" kind of film aficionado than an \"either/or\" type. The actors all knew their lines, spoke with the sort of authority of those who have become their respective characters wholly, passionately and very convincingly. It is a brave film. The world has always been a very violent place. \"In a world where anything goes, judgement is everything.\" One of my favorite high school counselors imparted that wisdom to me in 1983 when the school we both served in was stunned by a movie about the nuclear destruction of the world. Many teachers presented and discussed it; and counselors and additional professional people were on hand to provide solace, clarity, comfort, and advocacy. The film dramatizes what is humanly possible in terms of mind/body and soul. Socrates insisted and I still insist that \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" Ideas don't hurt people; fear of using our God given critical thinking gifts is what produces a Charles Manson, an Adolf Hitler, or a Boston Marathon fanatic.\n\nI love experiencing something via a book or a film, a lecture, anecdote, or reminiscence that vicariously imparts to me important truths; whether to accept or reject them is not up to a producer, director, or the performers. However, just as I would not attempt to explain the workings of a reciprocating engine to my new grand daughter, not every work of art is ready to be viewed, understood, and appreciated for what it is and what it is not.\n\nThis film or clips from it would have provided a novel, sensory, discussion-worthy prompt for a film class, a creative writing group, or any audience that appreciates expanding their experiences in life.\n\nWere I still teaching Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition to high school seniors, I would couple this movie with the original 1991 \"Point Break\" along with \"Donnie Brasco\" for students to fully explore in a scholarly essay investigating synonymous, antithetical and synthetic parallels."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once, years ago, I have watched the original 'Point Break' with slim Keanu Reeves and extreme Patrick Swayze and, as always, the remake news made me shiver. So, trying to get enjoyment from the movie I have decided to block all the past memories and that's what happened.\n\nGenerally speaking, the ideas intersect but many points are different that earns respect for creators. Love that here the main drug for the criminals, the fuel for endeavors is adrenaline. This allows us to be witnesses of wild tricks that make your hands and back sweat like crazy. The intensity delivers the approach of the breaking point where mind sends the signals to stop but the blood rush forces you to continue.\n\nThe plotline itself let me down by being kind of chewed: the scenes seems to be in chronological order but then suddenly the scene pops without any sufficient justification just to show yet another high morale talk with charming ambiance.\n\nReturning to an elephant in the room. Although the struggles were made to avoid shot-by-shot remake a bit of iconic moments jumped into the frame and my brain screamed: \"It is dumb to put it here!!\". Not only scraps of scenes visited us from the past but also the characters with their names freshened the spirits of old times.\n\nHonestly, nobody would notice the name change - meaning that every fan would appreciate a difference rather then not a good tribute. I am not talking about Luke Bracey and Edgar Ramirez because they did quite a good job, however, the latter could have been less philosophical. I was underscoring Ray Winstone's Pappas that in my opinion was a bleak reminiscence of Gary Busey.\n\nStill shaking from the enormous bursts of adrenaline I would say that the remake as expected didn't work out in a good way but presented with more than formidable extreme portrayal of action that deserves an applause. The problem is that I would rather find the compilation of the tricks on YouTube that rewatch the movie."

I never though I'd say this, but watch \"The Fast and the Furious\" instead. It's the better remake.\n\n3/10"

This action film will have you wanting to look away but forcing you to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Following the mission of FBI agent Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) to capture a group of extreme athletes, eco-warriors and take-from-the-rich Robin Hoods, Point Break mixes NCIS, the X games, and Greenpeace promotional videos. Reminding viewers of a Red Bull YouTube real, nearly 75 professional extreme athletes and stunt performers \u2014surfers, climbers, snowboarders, divers, proximity flyers, motocross racers, long boarders, and more\u2014 work together to contribute their skills to make intense scenes all over the world. Professionally and tastefully captured, these scenes cause viewers' hearts to leap and their stomachs to drop. In one scene Johnny Utah and Bodhi (\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez), the athletes' leader, perform a suspenseful free climb, no ropes, to the very top of beautiful Angel Falls. Upon reaching the top, Utah reprimands Bodhi for the laws he has broken and tries to arrest him. Bodhi responds, \"The only law that matters is gravity\" and jumps off the cliff. However suspenseful and intriguing, if looked at as a re-boot of the 1991 version of Point Break the film falls extremely short, ignoring nearly the entire original storyline and plot to create something new yet extreme. Although Point Break (2015) may disappoint fans of the original still remains an awe- inspiring, adrenaline rushing, must-see film."

My expectations were dashed, I can forgive it for wandering from the plot into a new 'Ozarki 8' legend, but the whole story was a bit weak to be honest. None of the actors really stood out, but their exploits wing-suiting, and snowboarding and dirt biking make it worth watching. For a new generation it's still a movie deserving of an audience."

I had read those before I finally decided to see the 2015 version anyway ...\n\nGREAT how Bodhi and his team made their statement to society by their thrilling robberies. BUT, after those robberies the amount of \"irrelevant\" action gets out of balance with the story. Although the action is astonishing I was glad that I remembered the story of the 1991 version because otherwise I might have been lost. At that point the 2015 version felt like watching a movie based on a book that I read before watching the movie; that can be pretty disappointing. Overall the 2015 version lacked the feeling that I have when I watch the 1991 version.\n\nBUT (again) ... the 2015 version is significantly different! We're almost 25 years ahead of the 1991 version and times have changed. The 2015 version is more bombastic and even more sentimental. It becomes shallow due to the amount of irrelevant action scenes. STILL, the story of the 2015 version actually has more depth than the 1991 version. The story of the 1991 version is actually a bit shallow; it's about a couple of guys living it up, and stealing from banks to finance their fun (and some spirituality). The banks get paid by the insurance companies and nobody gets hurt and in a way \"everybody\" seems to win. This is typical for the beginning of the nineties. However, simply \"living it up by stealing\" doesn't suffice anymore. We really DO need to care about nature and our environment! Bodhi was inspired by his spiritual leader to do so. And with that in mind it explains why he's more serious and grim than the 1991 Bodhi. SUPER!\n\nAt home I watched the 1991 version again and I must say that the quality of the way the story is presented is more appealing to me. Possibly it's my age and because I cannot get into the use of social media such as twitter and Facebook. The 1991 version tells a story by the dialogues between people. The 2015 version provides an impression of a story by TWEETS between allegories.\n\nAll in all I do recommend to see the 2015 version, especially when you've seen the 1991 version. It's a roller-coaster and the essence of the story of the 2015 version is actually a lot better. It shows spiritual growth on one hand and on the other hand, a lack of growth in relevant use of action.\n\nAnd again ... the action is fantastic!"

What is most noticeable, is the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, that was so carefully constructed, between the undercover Reeves and the thrill seeking, criminal Swayze.\n\nJust as absent, is the well developed storyline, that, in the original film moved gradually to a worthwhile climax but, in the remake, looses its momentum and fizzles out, in the closing scenes.\n\nThe acting is nothing special either. For the most part, it feels like the actors are going through the motions but not really handing in anything that looks like a good let alone outstanding performance. To be fair, this is partly due, to rather bland narrative, infected with pseudo religious rite of passage, nonsense, which centers around taking extreme life threatening risks, to become one with nature.\n\nSo if there an upside here? The action sequences and special effects are well handled. There is no shortage of thrills and they are, for the most part, executed in polished fashion. Sadly, that's pretty much all that's on offer here. Watch Point Break for the thrills and spills, by all means just don't expect a lot else here. Five out of ten from me."

At least it looked good for cinema so I thought I couldn't go wrong with it because I'll at least have fun. And I was very pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe original movie is awesome and one of my favorites and good thing about this one is that it tried to be something different so it's not just same thing again. While the original is just surfing and skydiving, this one is focused on extreme sports much more and if you are going to see it for surfing you won't see much of that because it's only in two scenes (but still very good scenes). The movie is very well shot and action scenes are eye candy. Actors are not as good as Patrick Sawyze and Keanu Reeves but they are pretty good.\n\nPeople are criticizing this movie way too much just because it's a remake but there are still flaws. There is almost no character development at all. Maybe just a little with two main characters, but the rest are so forgettable they might have as well put dummies instead of actors. And also a few plot holes, but if people forgive all those ridiculous moments to the Fast & Furious franchise, I'll do the same with this, and also, this is in my opinion a better movie than Furious 7.\n\nThis movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action sequences and it's absolutely worth watching. I will not even call it a guilty pleasure, because I'll always defend this movie when someone starts complaining about it. If you don't mind remakes, you'll probably like this.

Pretty but ultimately boring.\n\nThe characters are very flat and insipid.

But the content is different kind of thing.\n\nNot only the dynamic surf scene, but also the motorcycle action, the sky diving, the snow boarding, and mountain climbing, all are so cool.\n\nThis new ones stunt plying and the camera action are both more exciting than old ones.\n\nThe most different point is the way of ending story. This new one is more shocking, and more sentimental.\n\nThis is the worth to watch in a theater. I watched the 2D version, but that was so good enough to watch this movie."

Personal ordeals and impersonal appraisals of personal warfare as ammunition to boot fast into survival mode can't be dissed as shenanigans of institutional style when participants of motion move war as sports and sports as war in keeping plain sight beyond blind spots of manipulated assumptions of obedience manufactured for obedience manufactured in extreme sports is war of profits and participants can only lie at not being extreme over fait acomplis built into their impending clout impending for clout ignored in participance. The inter-connected coexistence of obedience transmitted under duress then becomes license for a free man free only in the dispensation of thrills as overwhelming conspiracies as oversights in extreme sports."

Plot could use some work, but the visual effects and stunts are incredibly entertaining. The cinematography and aerial scenes are epic and showcase some of the most beautiful global locations.If this was re-released as a search to accomplish the Ozaki 8 this movie would be a hit. I found the story line around the Ozaki 8 to be very entertaining and better suited for the plot and story-line. The association with the original Point Break is unfortunate because it detracts from the amazing stunt work. I really hope more people give this movie a chance."

I love real stunts, real action(besides good acting) and this movie, even if is set in the extreme sports world, feel like a james bond movie.\n\nNot only we have a surf competition, a 4x4 chase, a bike chase, all works. This must be one of the best adrenaline fueled movies ever made.honestly i love the photography and the way the stunts are filmed. You see that everything is real, the old way.\n\nLike the whole spy infiltrate sports underworld is a nice excuse to see great stunts, and a great soundtrack.\n\nBeing miself a fan of those extreme sports, i enjoy it.\n\nYes i know theres another one, but i grew up after 2000 movies, and for me this is my point break.\n\nLike, before all i have was vhs and i found old james bond movies, and cable when i visited family...so this is better than people said."

The premise is so different as are the characters. In this, they're trying to reach enlightenment, not funds to support their lifestyle. There's a deep story to this one. I also enjoyed the lines bit.\n\nYou can't replace Patrick or Keanu but this movie doesn't do that even if that seemed to be The point. The characters were so different.\n\nShould've been its own movie with zero ties to the OG."

        "review_detailed_main": "By no means is this as good as the original, not even close for me. But I gotta be honest I really enjoyed this remake.\n\nJohnny Utah (played this time by Luke Bracey) formerly an \"Extreme Sport Athlete\" is now a new FBI agent. He is assigned a case involving extreme sport robbers doing crazy heists around the world. The FBI boss this time is played by Delroy Lindo. Utah declares that the robbers seem to be doing the Ozaki 8, which is eight extreme ordeals that honors the forces of nature. Like the original Utah must work with Pappas (now played by Ray Winstone) to uncover the case. They go to a surfing party in France where Utah almost drowns when surfing a gigantic wave, but is saved by Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez), Utah being undercover of course requests to join Bodhi's crew, Utah also meets Samsara (Teresa Palmer) who he of course falls in love with. I'm not gonna spoil the whole film but last thing I'll say is that there's a bunch of extreme sports scenes that are awesome to watch.\n\nFirst off again there was no way they were gonna capture the original, the original is a favorite of mine and I knew going in it wasn't going to come close. This remake actually has a lot of differences to the original. There a lot of extreme sports scenes that are nowhere present in the original which I appreciate that director Ericson Core and writer Kurt Wimmer tried some stuff original to their version so to speak. Another difference I really liked was that Utah was already an adrenaline junkie before whereas in the 1991 film he had to learn to do these things, here he's already somewhat familiar as we see in the opening of the movie. Also Utah in this iteration seems more like a tortured man which I thought was a great difference. The cast does a fine job, Luke and Edgar give good performances as Utah and Bodhi, granted they wouldn't be my first picks for the respective parts but for what they had to do they did a fine job. Ray Winstone was really good as Pappas I thought, I wish he had more screen time but it is what it is. Lastly I want to highlight Teresa Palmer as Samsara, her character is completely different then Lori Petty's character in the original, Teresa did a great job considering she had just given birth at the time of filming. The cinematography was once again fantastic and Core actually did it himself which I thought was cool. The soundtrack was also really good, great songs by Andrew Watt and Dig the Kid. Overall I really liked this remake and I don't get why it's so universally hated, it ain't that bad at least to me."

        "review_detailed_main": "People hate on it so much because they expect a copy of the 1991 Point Break. Well, this is a modern version of the original Point Break and it is not meant to be the same. If it was to be the same, why would they even bother to make it? First of all, this movie should be appreciated because of the amazing extreme scenes. I would recommend it to people who really enjoy watching great views and extreme sports. The stupid thing is the banal \"FBI agent\" sh*t but I think I could get over it as it is an American movie, no way it doesn't include the FBI. However, the movie has its charm, and do the characters. The characters of Bodhi and Samsara are intriguing and exclusively charming. I really like how the movie is about spirituality and fighting your own self. But it's a bit saddening if you get attached to the characters and see things sentimentally. You have the typical FBI thing, the extreme sports, the sentimental moments, the parties, the beautiful sense of risking your life to help others and to take your spirit higher. It has beautiful moments of joy, terrifying moments and great scenes. Why would I not like it?"

Its been quite a while since I saw a film like this that was literally breathtaking in certain places. The film is a huge globetrotter which puts Bond film locations to shame with some absolutely stunning imagery and scenery that go hand in hand with the incredible stunt work.\n\nI can understand people not being impressed with Luke Bracey who is a poor replacement for someone like Keanu Reeves. But Edgar Ramirez always has great screen presence and is excellent in the role of Bodhi. He also got the gig as apparently Gerard Butler pulled out due to schedule conflicts, but I'm glad Ramirez got the job. Ray Winstone going through the motions and not really adding anything to the film.\n\nThe stunt work in this is incredible to watch with the highlights set in the Alps and the end rock climbing scene in Venezuela. Also, albeit slightly short, is an incredible shootout towards the end of the film, the likes of which I have not seen since the shootout scene in Michael Manns HEAT. On top of all this was the 3D which REALLY did work for this film. Again this was thanks to the locations it was filmed at.\n\nIgnore ALL the negativity about this film as I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will however buy the blu ray of the original and watch with a fresh mind."
