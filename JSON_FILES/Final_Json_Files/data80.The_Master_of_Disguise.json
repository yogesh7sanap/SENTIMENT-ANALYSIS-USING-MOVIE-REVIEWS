If you are forced to watch this film, that is probably the only time you should waste watching it. It tries to be funny, but fails miserably. I believe one review I read of it said that it disguised its funny moments better than the main character disguised himself. Sadly, that's the complete truth. Adults, you will find nothing here that's amusing, unless you're really into totally lame, flat jokes. Kids, you will neither find anything amusing in the movie, as the actors are not funny enough to entice any one of any age. The direction was also poor, and the crude humor was (as is in most movies) pointless and dumb. I felt embarrassed just watching it. Skip this movie, and you will miss nothing."

He worked great when his movies stayed within the 15-30 demographic.\n\nThen he destroyed his career with the Master of Disguise.\n\nThis 'comedy' was so bad that it made me feel terrible just for watching it. I was embarrassed to be watching this movie in public. There's nothing funny about openly pitying an actor as you watch him force the run time to 80 minutes with jokes so flat they don't even register above the painfully boring dialog.\n\n\"Painful\" is a good way to describe this movie. Nothing works. Sometimes you can't even tell when the jokes had happened. That's how bad they were. I watched this with my brother and found myself asking \"was that supposed to be a joke?\" I guess so, because it happened over and over again.\n\nI don't find his fake Italian accent as annoying as many of the reviewers, but how the hell is repeating the word \"turtle\" over and over again while dressed in a turtle suit to get into a turtle club supposed to be funny, let alone plausible in the plot? Was everybody involved with the film consistently drunk as this was being made? Surely somebody must have said something like \"Guys, this really sucks. Lets burn it and never speak of it again.\" I suggest anybody who accidentally came into possession of this bumbling nightmare do the same, to rid the world of its horrors forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "The reason I saw this film is that it's currently #49 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list....the 100 lowest rated major releases. While most would take this as a sign to avoid the film, I am, oddly, trying to complete the list...mostly because so many of these films are actually unintentionally hilarious.\n\nThe story features Dana Carvey as the cleverly named(?) Pistachio Disguisey, a man who has a strange affliction...he cannot help but imitate those he meets. Not surprisingly, it often results in people disliking him in the film (as well as the audience).\n\nEarly on in the story, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by an evil-doer (Brent Spiner...whose character farted throughout the movie). So, with Grandpa's help, Pistachio learns to hone his skills to that he can be a true master of disguise and have some hope of rescuing his folks.\n\nSo what did I think about this film? Before doing this film, Dana Carvey was a bankable comedian...and throughout he seems almost to be trying to destroy his career. In the film he is thoroughly unlikable and grates on you...with his constant mugging and annoying impersonations. The worst was the turtle character...which was truly horrid to watch. On \"Saturday Night Live\", his impersonations were often funny...here they almost never are and come very fast...too fast to bother making these impersonations funny or hash them out in a meaningful way! Apart from Lucas Cruikshank (who made the horrible \"Fred\" movies), I cannot think of a single performance by an actor that is less likable and enjoyable than Carvey's and it's very easy to see how it made the IMDB list. I'd rather watch 80 minutes of a blank screen than see this sort of film again....mostly because some bad films make you laugh because they are unintentionally funny. This one, instead, is supposed to be funny but it just makes you angry and annoyed.\n\nBy the way, Carvey apparently made this film because he wanted to do a film great for kids. I could only see this if you plan on using it as some sort of punishment. Boorish, awful and easy to dislike."

My wife and I often gazed at each other in amazement during this movie, unable to exactly process that something this truly silly and dumb was made (much less by Dana Carvey and Adam Sandler) and even stranger that others in the crowded theatre were laughing their heads off! We were excited to see Dana Carvey back in the movies, but there was good reason why this movie was not screened for review ahead of time.\n\nTo continue, I should say we had misgivings about seeing the film after the TV trailers that kept showing the \"turtle\" sequence, but decided that part was just silly fun and there's no way the rest of the movie could be so unclever and dumb. To our amazement, that was easily the most intelligent and serious part of the film! Think carefully before wasting your time with this one.. I score it a generous 3/10."

I'd say Bill Murray would be the reigning king and, while I don't get their appeal, Will Farrell and Adam Sandler have managed to make a good career of it as well. Sure others have made it with varying degrees of success but it's usually a story that these people just don't go on to bigger and better things afterwards and nobody seems to show this more than Dana Carvey.\n\nHe had some good skills at making voices, mimicry and characters and so they figured why not build a movie around this and have him take on different roles and characters. But the problem is they forgot along the way that it's not a character that makes a line funny, it's the actor playing the character that does this. And honestly, this failed because the characters he played were just one dimensional and had no point in existing other than to be in this movie to show Dana's range.\n\nIn the end, it's a highly forgettable and very disappointing movie from somebody that could have done a lot better for himself."

The entire film seems to have been haphazardly constructed to string together the many character impersonations he has developed, unfortunately, at the expense of an actual plot.\n\nThe result is a disjointed storyline that even the pre-pubescent target audience must have found confusing, if not down right annoying. Considering that this film was obviously meant for a much younger viewer than the previews would have you believe, I was shocked when at one point in the story, Pistachio is taught that it is wrong to strike someone with a closed fist, but perfectly acceptable to slap them with an open palm, a technique used heavily throughout the film.\n\nUnless you are under the age of six, or just a die-hard Dana Carvey fan who can't miss a single one of his performances, I highly suggest you steer clear of this dog."

Only then did I get to see what attracted me to the movie in the first place, seeing Dana in the different disguises he did, and some that I don't actually remember seeing in the film. The ones they show on the commercial are not that funny when put into the actual movie. Unfortunately, most people get up and leave when the credits start because they assume the movie is over. In most movies the movie is over when the credits start. Here, there was another 10 minutes of footage after the credits! But the plot is stupid, and in the role of Pistacio or whatever, Dana's accent is so fake. It started feeling kind of like a warm and fuzzy Disney movie in the beginning, but then it just goes into Dana's character constantly acting like a jerk. And as for Brent Spiner's characters running gag, it dulls quickly. I would not recommend this one to anyone, save your money. And to Dana, this is not your usual calibre of effort, what gives?"

Must be a lot of dopers out there with ready cash for the movies. Movies like this are the best evidence yet for the long-term effects of dope. Every one of Dana's characters sounded nearly identical to the others; just different clothes and teeth. I think this is also evidence for the huge egos involved not only on the acting side, but also on the production side. The Hollywood producers really must think we're idiots out here in the hinterlands."

The previous review here further cemented my decision to see this movie immediately. What I found, however, left me irritated and empty.\n\nIn short, the only funny parts of the movie were during Dana Carvey's caricatures. The rest of the movie was a sorry attempt at screenwriting. First off, I didn't realize beforehand that this movie could've been rated \"G\" except for one \"nuts and weiners\" joke; thus, most of the humor in the screenwriting was more akin to 8-year-olds than fairly mature adults. But, keeping this in mind, there was still a chance this movie could've been pulled off. However, the cliche-filled plot wasn't even worth following because it had so many holes in it, it was more akin to a collander. Combine that with only passable acting and very shallow character development (especially in the lead woman character, who had a lot of potential that wasn't realized), and what you have is a movie that is utterly pointless.\n\nAnd this is a real, real shame considering Dana Carvey's obvious comedic talent. Honestly, the funniest part of the movie was the credits, with all the outtakes and characters that never made it into the movie. If you're a real Dana Carvey fan, get it on video and fast-forward to his impression-bits and the credits. Otherwise, see something else."

The movie lacked any sort of coherency or point--it seemed to be a mishmash of unfunny spoofs and take-offs of various well known movies, many of which the target audience probably hasn't seen yet. This movie seemed to be an excuse for Carvey to show off his impersonations. They were funny on SNL, but they just don't work on the screen. He says that he designed the movie cause he thought his kids would like it, but that's the problem, HIS kids are the only ones who will probably really enjoy this. This movie seemed to be one big inside joke, and a bad one at that. Plus, the shameless inclusion of well known celebrities was pointless.

Something substantive to say -yeah that's a good story, and a film that cohesively weaves Carveys talents into an entertainment for kids (PG). Unfortunately by the Bo Derrick cameo (what kid of 8 would relate to that, and what would a parent tell a kid of 8 how they related to Bo-D's 10 poster? It could be funny but lacked any follow through and unity, despite the 1979 reference) followed by the never ending slapping, slapping, slapping that ran throughout the film - I felt something was amiss followed by compounding disappointment.----------------- In brief: Disappointed that the Disquisiey family setting lacked warmth and believability, disappointed in the one dimensionality of all the female characters (\"you disgust me\" said grandpa D to Pistachio's assistant after she asks about her new jobs benefits), and the tenets that seeing Carvey gaze into space after being dope slapped (yet another time) is enough to make me believe that this is acceptable because he plays it cute, and in the big picture -substantive enough to carry the thinning story line to its blunt and anti climactic end.---------------- The theater I went to had about 35 to 50 suburban (Colma CA.) kids (ages 7 to 13) in it and the only laughs came from the predictable fart's that the bad guy let go from his own jokes, and excitement (and these laughs were slow in coming i.e., four fart's in). Other wise the theater sat silently.-------------- I'm going to like to think that the outcome of this production this is not reflective of Carveys innate talent, but perhaps it is the result of having been surrounded by a few too many \"yes men, and women\" when putting this one together. --------------"

First off, it has a straight forward, comprehensible story. That's more than I can say for many of the movies coming out today. And it's a joy to see! Its an interesting, original idea too. Also, there's some really great jokes in this movie and they are age appropriate for many kids, which is refreshing to see. Yes, some of the gimmicks and jokes are a little \"immature\", but honestly, they're innocent and I personally find enjoyment in them. There's also a clear character arch and development for pistachio, the main character. The pacing of the film is very good as well. Nothing is rushed or exhausted beyond my interest. The acting is good, I would say. I think there are some performances that lack, but for the most part, the cast is spot on. Overall, it includes a lot of excellent elements to a good movie. Is it the best movie ever? No, but 3.3 rating?! No way. There are way worse movies out there which are rated higher. So, I wonder what went wrong here. Overall, I really enjoy this movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I felt so bad watching Dana Carvey in this series of skits impersonating a film but he was partly responsible because he helped write this script. Story is about an inept Italian waiter Pistachio Disguisey (Carvey) who works with his parents (James Brolin and Edie McClurg) in a restaurant but one day they are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) who was locked up for many years because of Pistachio's father Fabbrizio who was a master of disguise. Then Pistachio's grandfather (Harold Gould) shows up and tells him that his family has been masters for a long time. Grandfather gives him a crash course in disguises and they find him an assistant named Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) who helps him track down his parents. They follow clues and this gives Pistachio an opportunity to use his new skills. Bowman makes Fabbrizio steal famous items for his collection like being disguised as Jesse Ventura and stealing the Liberty Bell! This film was directed by Perry Blake and its his first attempt at directing. Yes, it shows. Blake is really a Production Designer and has worked primarily on Adam Sandler films and here he shows no skill at pacing or editing. The film is a mess. Its just a series a skits and all of them are unfunny. Carvey is a talented performer and during moments in this film you can see his true comedic abilities. My personal favorite is when he impersonates Robert Shaw from \"Jaws\" and you can see that all he needs is a good story to showcase himself. We haven't seen much of Carvey lately and thats due to illness so maybe he needed the money badly. Esposito is very attractive but she doesn't show much flare for comedy except for playing everything straight and reacting to Carvey's antics. This was filmed on the studio backlot and it shows. It kind of reminded me of a \"Seinfeld\" episode posing as New York. The film is slightly over one hour long but the credits and outtakes drag on for another 15 minutes! Obviously the story ran out of steam early and to try and make this movie about 75 minutes they tacked on every deleted scene and actors flubbing their line. It all seems so sad and pathetic. Can somebody please write a good script for Dana Carvey!"

        "review_title": "I really wanted to like this movie, but . . .",
        "review_detailed_main": "Simply put, this movie was so infantile it really was rather annoying. I normally love Dana Carvey. He was great in both \"Wayne's World\" movies, he was one of the reasons \"Saturday Night Live\" became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.\n\nFor those reasons, I really wanted Dana Carvey to make a big screen comeback and have a movie career as illustrious as Mike Myers'. However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because \"The Master of Disguise\" is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.\n\nThat's not to say that Dana Carvey doesn't have some moments of brilliance. His Al Pacino and George W. Bush imitations are both funny and on target, but everything else from his annoying Italian accent to his basic dialogue to his name (Come on, Pistachio?) bury those funny moments like a huge pile of rubble and scrap metal. This movie isn't like a car crash: it's like a wrecker carrying away the aftermath of the crash to the dump, and it's much easier to look away from that scene.\n\nEven though James Brolin, Harold Gould, and Jennifer Esposito obviously did their best with what was given to them, the movie as a whole just suffered. You can't blame them for not trying though. Highly anticipated movies like this usually suffer from a weak script, a disappointing ending, or the primary cast being so eclipsed by their fame and reputation that they show up to shoot drunk and stoned, and their jadedness shows through the screen. Fortunately, the latter wasn't true for this movie, but it still needed some major work.\n\nSince this movie bombed critically and commercially, Dana Carvey hasn't made any public appearances that I know of either in movies or on TV. I have the feeling, however, that the next project he works on, whatever it may be, will truly be a big comeback for him. Ellen Degeneres, Ben Affleck, and Woody Allen are among those who have made noteworthy and surprising comebacks during this decade so far, and Dana Carvey has the potential to do the same."

        "review_detailed_main": "I remember seeing a trailer for this movie several times in 2002, back around the time it came into theatres, and could remember the \"Turtle, turtle, turtle!\" clip more than anything else I saw in that trailer. So, I knew about the film when it was current, but also heard that it was getting really bad reviews. Since then, I have become more familiar with the work of Dana Carvey, who co-wrote and starred in this flick. I have now seen several of his \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, and also the two \"Wayne's World\" movies, for which he and Mike Myers brought their headbanging alter egos from SNL to film, so I know that Carvey can be funny. Nearly nine years after \"The Master of Disguise\" was unleashed upon the world and disgusted many people, I've finally seen it, and am now not surprised that I can't contradict the majority's opinion.\n\nPistachio Disguisey is a young Italian man who is totally unaware of the fact that he comes from a long line of secret agents who have all been very skilled in disguising themselves for missions. His father, Fabbrizio, decided it was best not to tell his son about the family's legacy. So, instead of being one of these \"Masters of Disguise,\" like his father once was but not anymore, Pistachio works as a waiter in his father's Italian restaurant in the United States, where his mother also works. One night, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman, a criminal whom Fabbrizio brought to justice during one of his missions as a Master of Disguise, but this criminal has just gotten out of prison! After this kidnapping, the youngest Disguisey's grandfather comes to him and tells him about the family's legacy, and then trains him to use his Disguisey powers, so he can take on Bowman himself and rescue his parents. Meanwhile, the kidnapper is now forcing Fabbrizio the help him with his criminal activities!\n\nI've seen too many unfunny comedies lately, and sadly, this one is no exception. Like probably most people who have seen this universally panned 2002 comedy adventure film, I didn't laugh at all. Two or three gags did force the corners of my mouth up, with one or maybe two of the slaps for example, but even those aren't usually funny, and perhaps get a bit tiresome. The turtle costume clip I saw in the trailer in 2002 may not have looked so bad, but this part of the movie is a great example of the lameness here, with Dana Carvey as Pistachio trying to be funny, but basically just being ridiculously goofy, and the same can probably be said about most of the other disguises. Many of the jokes in the film involve the lead character's fondness of large female buttocks, and this is never funny. There's also a running gag showing that whenever Devlin Bowman laughs, he is soon silenced by his own flatulence, and this doesn't tend to be funny, even if it ALMOST made me smile later on for some reason. Not only is the humour in his film consistently lame, the plot is also boring and clumsily written.\n\nAfter this film was made, Dana Carvey went on hiatus to focus on his family life, and I can't blame him for that, but this sure was a poor piece for him to leave us with. Since then, he has returned to show business, making several TV appearances and showing that he still has his talent, which is something he didn't show when he made \"The Master of Disguise\". It appears he is also returning to the silver screen in the upcoming \"Jack and Jill\", coming from Happy Madison Productions, the company that was also involved in the production of this 2002 disaster, but no matter how good or bad this movie turns out to be, it looks like Carvey will only have a very small part in it. Well, even if he never plays any major film role again, he has proved to be a talented comedian through his decades in the business, despite this terrible film. I'm not sure if my 2/10 rating is too low, even if most people wouldn't think it is, but now that I've seen it after nearly a decade, I can understand why it was so poorly received."

The editing feels cheap and slip-shod, the colours feel diluted and to be honest gave me a headache and the sets and effects are flat. The humour is also of quite a crude kind, including the idea of the villain breaking wind when he laughs, you can tell these are not the ideas of comedy geniuses. The direction is sorely lacking and Dana Carvey clearly looks embarrassed playing a character that is not so easy to relate to, though in fairness none of the characters are that well written at all. The worst parts of The Master of Disguise though are the screenplay which is very lame, the plot which is barely coherent and the mugging which gets increasingly desperate. In conclusion, very poor. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

The fact is that this movie was not made with an adult audience in mind, and thus appeals much more to kids. I first saw this when I was 8 years old, and I loved it. Watching it again as an adult, I can see why anyone above the age of 12 would not like this movie, but as I said, that doesn't mean it's bad.\n\nThe plot is simple enough; an evil criminal kidnaps Pistachio's (Dana Carvey) parents in order to steal prized possessions from around the USA, and now Pistachio must learn how to utilize his family's ancient tradition of disguise to get them back. As the story goes along, we see Pistachio utilize many different characters to gain access to information, the most memorable being \"Turtle Guy\", and that really is the main point of seeing the movie: It has Dana Carvey doing all sorts of funny stuff. To this day, my friends and I still say quotes from his characters.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from Carvey's performance, the movie doesn't have a lot to offer. Most of the other jokes are very immature and not funny even to little kids, such as a running gag where the main villain farts in the middle of his evil laugh.\n\nFor what it is, it's not worth seeing if you're a teenager or older, but if you have kids of your own, put this on for them and see if they like it."

I still enjoy the \"This is what you're doing...this is what I want you to do\" joke. To put it simply, this is pure stupidity. Now, Dana Carvey is a talented comedian. He was hilarious on SNL and he used to be hilarious altogether. Is he really gonna depend on this dopey movie to make a comeback? Dana is best known for his excellent impressions, especially of political figures like George Bush and Ross Perot. So basically the script (which he co-wrote) enables him to flaunt his abilities as a great impressionist. His impressions are great all right. He just doesn't know where to go with them. In one scene, he does a perfect impression of Al Pacino as Scarface. That could've been a hilarious scene, but instead he breaks into the same mindless schtick. How 'bout he says \"You cockroach!\" or \"Say hello to my little friend\"? Every joke, no matter how silly, has to be based on an element of truth. There are many other mindless bits like the \"Turtle\" scene. In the previews, it looked pretty funny. But in the movie it drags out into a boring, 5-minute scene in which he basically goes around blurting out the word \"Turtle.\" That's the whole joke. When Dana is trained to fight from his grandfather, he teaches him to slap people and say, \"Who's your Daddy?\" Just when did people say, \"Who's your Daddy?\" when slapping people in the face? And finally, there's a running gag involving Brent Spiner (as the villain) laughing maniacally and suddenly farting. That's the kind of humor that can only make the youngest of youngsters laugh.\n\nIf there's anything to look forward to, it's the sultry Jennifer Esposito. But even she's given a thankless role. Come on, she gave up \"Spin City\" for this? \"Master of Disguise\" has some mildly amusing scenes, especially in the first 30 minutes or so, but all in all this is pure silliness. And by the way, Carvey's George W. Bush impression (which I was desperately waiting for) doesn't come until the end. So if you've seen the previews, don't bother shelling out your 8.50.\n\nMy score: 3 (out of 10)"

The family tries to keep this secret from the young Pistachio Disguisie(Dana Carvey) but he soon finds out and then takes it upon himself to also be a `Master of Disguise.' In a movie like this, we really don't care about the plot but we just want to laugh and there are plenty of laughs in this movie.

Overall really begs the question \"how did this get made?\" Worth checking out if you're a very big Dana Carvey fan-maybe. I guess it's a family movie but some of the jokes are just poorly written jokes for adults."

However, when a film is supposed to make you laugh and fails, it's just painful. This movie is the definition of that kind of pain. It's full of awkward, non-funny situations and dated pop-culture references. I have no idea who they thought would enjoy this.

        "review_title": "What a Disappointment!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Being a big-time Dana Carvey fan, this movie was such a disappointment. This movie does even more damage to Dana's poor track record of movies.\n\nWe all know Dana's strengths as a comedian. He is a great person at performing different characters and impersonations. So one would think that `The Master of Disguise' is a perfect forum for Dana to showcase his talents. So what could go wrong?\n\nLet me start. Most have called this a kid's movie. But is it? I think others mistake a movie that is SO STUPID that it must be a kids movie. Let's just say it was a kid's movie. Which I doubt but let's assume that Dana would make the first kids movie he has ever made and let's assume Happy Madison productions decides after about 20 or so movies to make a kids movie. Why the heck is Dana Carvey targeting kids????? Do any kids even know who he is? Do any kids want to go see a kids movie by a guy who was on Saturday Night Live in the 80's?\n\nAnyways, here is my opinion of why this movie was terrible. First of all the main character was a total: imbecile, moron, dufus, man-child, etc. This Character made Pee Wee Herman seem like James Bond. The character was so idiotic that it wasn't funny. It was ok for about 5 minutes but he was that way the whole movie. He was so dorky that I don't believe anyone in the movie theater hoped he would get the hot girl. Of course he did.\n\nEven his disguising wasn't funny. Let me give a few details on the Turtle Man. Here's all there was to that gang. Pistachio (Carvey) found a clue that the bad guy would be at the Turtle Club. So he thinks the best way to get in is to dress like a turtle. When he gets in the club do you think he does anything clever? Of course not \u0096 his character is a moron. Besides standing out like a sore thumb in a high class club dressed like a turtle all this moron does do is say `Turtle' over and over again. That is it. Oh, yes he lifts his head in and out of the shell a few times. Picture this a guy in a turtle costume in a high class club lift his head in and out of the shell and saying: `Turtle\u0085\u0085.Turtle\u0085..Turtle\u0085..Turtle\u0085.Turtle\u0085\u0085.' etc. Is that funny? Sounds like reject material for another Happy Madison movie called the Animal.\n\nThis is what I think Dana should of done to correct the script. Do more impersonations, less of the `turtle guy' humor (which is all you get). He had two somewhat humorous Dana Carvey type parts. One with Dana as George W Bush and another of Carvey playing the Robert Shaw character from Jaws. But even there it could have been funnier. But back to my recommendations: More impersonations (not two). And MOST of all the main character should have been played more straight. Maybe even like his characters from his other movies: Clean Slate or Opportunity Knocks.\n\nIf you must see a Dana Carvey movie see the Waynes World movies or even Clean Slate and Opportunity Knocks were better. Take if from a fan of Dana's from the SNL days this movie was SO DISAPPOINTING."

Well, this film was a horrible mess and a big Horror to watch. I will have to say that Dana Carvey,(Pistachio Disguisey),\"The Shot\",'96 did a great job of acting crazy and I am sure it was not easy to follow the script. Jennifer Esposito,(Jennifer Baker),\"Crash\",'04, was rather cute and very attractive and gave a good supporting role. Last but not least, James Brolin,(Fabbrizio Disguisey),\"A Guy Thing\",'03, added his talents to this picture, but I began to wonder if Barbra Streisand enjoyed this film and her husband's performance.

        "review_detailed_main": "I consider myself a film buff, I write professionally, although only on rare occasions do film reviews, so I feel I have a few more credentials than your average armchair IMDB critic. All that said, I have never seen such intensely horrible IMDB reviews (e.g. `the worst ever') for a movie that actually wasn't that bad. Its no great work of art, but I actually enjoyed watching it through adolescent eyes. It's was intended as a kid's movie for Christ's sake\u0085! Its supposed to be stupid with goofy repetitive gags and lame humor. But done with a good wink and a nod, if anybody was watching. People saw Dana Carvey's name on the label, thought it was going to be the next Wayne's World or whatever, and were disappointed when it wasn't. But Dana's charm is there in spades, I loved all the characters he created in this senseless little movie, and the story actually wasn't much lamer or thin than Wayne's World's 1 or 2 \u0096 if you want to complain about plot within comedy skit-driven movies.\n\nIts also pretty obvious from the brevity of the film (only 65 minutes of movie), and the fact that a heap of scenes in the 15 minutes of end-credit outtakes are not in the film, that this flick is an abbreviated version of what Carvey and director Blake originally intended. Who knows what were the reasons, but I'll bet even money that some cost overrun, studio intervention or other problem resulted in at least a third of this film winding-up on the cutting room floor.\n\nBefore watching this movie, just put yourself in the same mind frame as `Spy Kids', but without all the big budget special effects, gadgets and elaborate sets, and you'll probably have a much better chance of enjoying what you see. I can see why some folks might only give this movie a 4 or 5 (out of 10), but one of the worst films ever? Never\u0085!"

        "review_detailed_main": "What eye-catching opening credits! What a cast list! What marvelous production design, and art direction! I've been well aware of the film's reputation from the time it was released, but I admit some aspects impressed me after curiosity won out and I began watching. The picture is popping with color both literal and figurative in the set design and decoration, costume design, hair and makeup, and lighting. In smaller, more careful moments of interaction between characters, I think the ensemble illustrates some of the acting abilities we know they have, demonstrating some cheeky nuance. Why, as silly as it is, I think the concept has strong possibilities as an outlandish comedy. And the sound design! Even on a basic, cost-friendly laptop, the audio experience is frankly incredible.\n\nI'd love to say that 'The master of disguise' surprised me, and was characterized with still more quality than I anticipated. But that's simply not the case. There are, in fact, some instances where the humor is just right, where the movie achieves a level of farcical energy that earns a laugh or two. These are far outnumbered by instances in which the comedy is hopelessly cheap and juvenile - such as a recurring quirk illustrated by the villain - or outright scatological. Bewilderingly blunt, plainspoken jokes and sight gags, if done right, can add an unexpected cheeky spark to a scene; here, they mostly fall very, very flat. Referential humor is rarely clever, and only dates the picture, while modern pop songs are emphatically inserted at times when they could hardly be less appropriate. The sheer number of costume changes that star and co-writer Dana Carvey has through the runtime is supposed to lend to the exaggerated fun, but that fun is missing in the first place, and the costume changes instead only seem pointless. And then there are the fat jokes, the racist stereotypes, xenophobic caricatures, and sexism.\n\nIn fairness, there's no mistaking that this feature is intended as a kid's movie. The unswerving simplicity of the plot development informs as much, as well as a lot of the dialogue, and no one but an adolescent could possibly find some of the humor here actually funny. With that said - maybe I was just born a cynic, but I recognize in 'The master of disguise' an astonishingly low grade of would-be amusement. I know to a certainty that if I were 8 years old and seeing this for the first time, I would have been altogether embarrassed to watch it with another person, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it any more then than I have now.\n\nThis is well made from a technical standpoint, and I do appreciate the contributions of the cast, but what does this truly matter when the comedy is so abysmal? As if to emphasize the point, the small clips shown throughout the end credits, including bloopers, are far actively engaging than the feature, with more (unrealized) potential for laughs. I gave it a try, I really did - I've watched plenty of films that were not regarded well, only to be delighted by how good I thought they were. This is not one of those films. 'The master of disguise' not only consciously rejects the intelligence we know Carvey is capable of as a comedic actor, but frankly patronizes children with its assumption that only the most base humor will provide their amusement. What value this does possess - and it does, indeed, have slivers of value - is far outweighed by tedious, unfunny pablum. Sure enough, there are worse movies you could watch, but few that are as visible and easy to find as this one is.\n\nNot recommendable, for any age group."

I found little entertainment value, and indeed cringed at the attempts at 'funny'. When the funniest bit in the whole film is a guy farting every time he laughs, the movie needs some serious work and/or revision.\n\nWhat I believe this film suffers from is a case of bad editing, more than anything. I can see where some of the jokes would be funny, some of the pratfalls could have given a laugh or two, and how some of the disguises could have been pulled off with hilarity.\n\nInstead, I saw a movie with heavy-handed attempts at humor, with timing intended for very young children. Indeed, if it were not for the main character's attraction to large butts (about the only sexual tones in the movie), and the drawn-out plot line, I'd say it's a movie intended for children between the ages of 2 and 5.\n\nPerhaps if the time spent trying to make the audience 'get it' were cut out, or some of the over-the-top characters given snappier lines, the jokes could have worked. Then again, it would have shortened the movie to about 30 minutes.\n\nDana Carvey seems to be trying to be like Jim Carrey or Martin Short, which is a shame. I have to ask, when he saw the final edit, did he think it was good?\n\nI have wasted my time on movies before, such as \"Leonard, Part 6\", and \"Ishtar\", and I gleefully toss this movie in that category.\n\nIf I could only get my 2 hours back."

The fact that he masquerades as a lot of slightly retarded and incredibly funny characters is probably the reason why. I look at this movie and I think, now why couldn't I do that? This movie is definitely aimed at audiences who love low-brow, stupid comedy, but for a movie that is aimed at those people, it is actually fairly good. It could have been a lot worse. With quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, this movie redeems itself from the amateur acting, many goofs, and silly storyline. The acting is . . . reasonable, for a movie of this standard, and although the storyline is beyond silly, it fits the whole comedic theme of the movie. So, this movie will be okay for anyone who doesn't mind stupid comedy and is just looking for a laugh."

The film is rated PG-13, and it's obvious because some of the humour is inappropriate for children. Ironically, most of the humour in the film would only be funny to someone under the age of 12. Overall, the film basically feels like a watered down, more childish imitation of Austin Powers. I can honestly see why this film has been long forgotten by the majority of the population."

At least \"Plan 9\" was funny.\n\nDana Carvey is generally funny, and this might have been funny as a Saturday Night Live sketch, but it wears on the nerves. The character played by Carvey comes across as stupid with few redeeming traits that make you want to see his life get better, and for the most part he doesn't get any smarter.\n\nAnd just like a bad SNL sketch, you wish you could fast forward to the next sketch, unfortunately there isn't one."

To many baby scenes like with Dana falling onto his grand papa inside a fat suit that has blown up over it's usual weight. The disguises are all unique but some are too stupid, like take the German with the big teeth! Dana is not funny at all with his stupid impressions and his goofy jokes that are not funny at all. A few scenes are good like the Mr. Peru scene, I liked that which is a homage to Scarface's Tony Montana. But the villain is too predictable and he has a stupid farting problem, his henchmen are to dull, and the whole idea of coloring the movie to match it's main actor for purpose was just too idiotic. Can you kill ninjas by slapping them, can Jesse Ventura steal the liberty bell, are there masters of disguises? NO! This film is pure rubbish, skip this film. You will be happy without it.

The most entertaining part of this movie was the ending credits - not that the credits were bad, they actually were funny, with out-takes and probably one of the longest lingering ending to a movie ever. Dana Carvey really missed an opportunity to write and make a breakout comedy here. Unfortunately, the talent of Mr. Carvey is wasted because of too many silly jokes, discongruent scenes, and a pretty flat comedy movie. There are brushes with attempts at great comedy here, but they are not enough to save this movie. If only somebody had been really serious enough to spend more time with the script and make it into a focussed, thematic, serious comedy attempt, then this movie might have done a lot better. Dana tries some new stuff, but experimental comedy is one thing, but using a feature movie to try it out is another. I made it through the entire movie, including the end of the credits which must mean something, but the movie wasn't as funny as it could have been and some of the characters played by Dana just weren't interesting or enjoyable. This was a kid's movie that tried to be too grown up about it and failed. Five out of ten stars"

Its humour is reminiscent of the Pink Panther scene, where Dreyfus and Clouseau, stoned on nitrous oxide, laugh at Dreyfus's melting face. It is a vehicle for Carvey to show off a parade of weird accents, mannerisms, and theatrical false teeth.\n\nThe running joke is watching people react to Carvey, trying to figure out why he is behaving so bizarrely, but somehow intimidated by his insanity.\n\nI once read that the best way to get a row of seats to yourself in a plane is simply to chew on a piece of string and let it droop out the corner of your mouth.\n\nForget you are a film critic.

        "review_title": "Too bad this \"movie\" can't disguise itself as a comedy.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Master of Disguise\" (2002), this might as well be called \"How Not to Make a Movie\". This \"film\" is yet another one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I remember when this \"film\" first came out, I was in elementary school. Back then, I was kind of interested in seeing it. But, I never got around to it, or even buying it on video. Yep, that was still during the VHS transitioning to DVD era. I never saw it when it was first released, and thank God for that! Just over ten years later, I saw it On Demand for free. So, I thought: \"why not? I think I'll give it a watch.\" What a waste of 80 minutes of my life! I'm just all the more grateful that I didn't watch it as a kid. If I did, it would most likely have taken away half of my brain. Seriously, who green-lit this steaming pile of garbage?! This \"movie\" has a boring story, horrible acting, dated special effects, dull sets/locations, and a cheap generic soundtrack. The \"story\", or lack thereof, is one of the most dull and cliched I have ever seen. When I watched it, there was no laughter, there was no enjoyment, nothing salvageable at all! This \"movie\" is only 80 minutes, so it doesn't sound like it's that long. But when I saw it, it felt like I was watching it for days! Another thing, is that this \"movie\" has an extremely long end credit sequence. For a movie to clock in as a feature film, it has to be a minimum of 70 minutes to reach movie length standards. The \"movie\" ends after 65 minutes of runtime, and then there's the infamous 10 minutes plus end credit sequence, but even that's not the end. After the credits, there's not one, not two, but three post-credit scenes! All three of them go absolutely nowhere, and tie into nothing, just like the rest of this \"film\". However, there are movies where a long end credit sequence can work if it goes along with the context of the film itself. Like, if you want to showcase some bloopers, a behind the scenes featurette, etc. When executed properly, long end credits can be fun to watch! But that is not the case for this \"movie\". One thing to point out, the \"most popular\" scene is the Turtle Club scene. That, supposedly, is supposed to be the comedic highlight. It appeared the most frequent in all the commercials and trailers. Believe me, I know! But, when I watched it, I was very disappointed (big shock). It's nothing but Dana Carvey in a cheaply made costume shouting \"turtle\" over and over again. Boring! As for the acting, where on Earth do I begin? All of the actors do a horrible job, especially Dana Carvey, who plays the main character, Pistachio Disguisey. No, seriously.... That's his name! Before I tear apart Dana Carvey's performance, I just want to say one thing. I don't hate him as an actor overall, Dana Carvey is a great comedian. He has played good roles in other movies, and I do enjoy watching clips of him on \"Saturday Night Live\". Dana Carvey is famous for voice impersonations, and that is the concept idea for \"The Master of Disguise\". Now that's a decent idea, and it surely had potential. But it was just so poorly executed! Dana Carvey gave one of the unfunniest performances I have ever seen. He just smiles with his mouth partially open for 95% of the time. Listen, that may entertain kids under five years old for an hour. But if you're older than that, watching that expression for over a minute will want you to pull your hair out! Don't even get me started on his over the top accent. Wow, as if his annoying expression wasn't bad enough! As far as the rest of the actors and actresses performances go, they all suck pretty much as bad as Dana Carvey's. The special effects are dated, and have not aged well. All of the sets/locations are dull and boring, and all the interior scenes are obviously filmed on a sound stage. Now I don't want you to think I'm against sound stages, when utilized properly, they can look like a real life setting. A movie with perfect use of sound stages is \"Flubber\" (1997). Most of the interior scenes are filmed in a studio, but are properly laid out so it's not obvious where it's actually filmed. Back to \"The Master of Disguise\" review. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's just as cheap and generic as the rest of the \"movie\". Bottom line, there is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. \"The Master of Disguise\" is a waste of cinema, and is not worth watching even if you have an opportunity to watch it for free. Life is too short to watch it, go watch real movies instead. Turtle!"

That's it.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering if the titular master of disguise gets through this movie's feeble length without painting his face brown and doing a truly cringeworthy Indian accent, no, he absolutely does not clear that hurtle."

Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) might be the biggest offender, as his lead performance was nails on a chalkboard, put to film. With even the best jokes barely producing a smile, the majority fall flat in an incredible display as hard to sit through as a bombing stand-up comedian.

He was great in Wayne's World and was probably the only thing that somebody liked about Master of Disguise. Dana Carvey plummeted in this movie, and it is so awful. Who wants to see a guy who farts every time he laughs? I'm not putting down all fart jokes, but that one was just lame. This is the lamest movie that I have ever seen and is good only to use as a Frisbee or coaster, and even then, you will be disappointed by this trash."

When his parents are kidnapped, his grandfather (Gould) shows up and shows him the reason why he is the way he is: Carvey is a master of disguise...he just doesn't know it yet.\n\nWith training from his grandfather (like some old karate movie) Carvey sees the light and becomes the formidable opponent to Spiner, who has blackmailed Carvey's father into stealing precious American historical item like the Declaration of Independence and the Liberty Bell (with cameos like Jesse Ventura and Jessica Simpson).\n\nLike I said, some of the scenes did make me laugh, but the plot is not very bright...I thought my 12 year old daughter could have written a better plot. Out of 10 stars, it doesn't even make average: I gave it a 4, but only on Carvey, not the rest of the film."

These happen to be the moments they found the most amusing. This was disappointment number one for them.\n\nDisappointment two was that the film wasn't that good -- and they barely laughed throughout it. I myself felt lucky the film seemed to only last for about an hour. Then the credits seemed to roll on for almost as long as the actual film showcasing outtakes and additional scenes. It was rather obvious from watching these outtakes and additional tidbits that entire scenes and sequences where removed from the film. Lucky for us they were excised, unluckily they were left in the credits.\n\nThe saving grace for the entire night was that this was a double feature with Stuart Little 2, which they did enjoy quite a bit."

I can only imagine how he must have felt when this wrapped and he looked at the finished product. I can only assume he missed the daily's as any reasonable person would have quit after the first day. That's how bad the film is. There isn't a single scene that isn't embarrassing. The characters are absurd, the acting atrocious, the plot non existent. No question, this movie is a wonderful example of why IMDb should allow zero stars for their reviews. It absolutely doesn't rate the one star I gave it. The idea that people would recommend this movie with a straight face only goes to show what kind of trouble the population at large is really in. I have to think the caretakers of those who enjoyed the movie wrote the review for them because nobody with a IQ higher than 50 could have thought anything other than this movie was an incredible disaster."

I feel directly hurt watching him insult me and other viewers with this Jim Carrey wannabe-crap (remark, I have no problem with Carrey, only the wannabe's!). This man had his own style but he sold out in the very worst way.\n\nThere is no point in this film, it's not funny, it's sad.

In my eleven year old mind at the time, I actually thought we were laughing at the funny scenes. It was literally one of the funniest movies I watched. However, watching it again seven years later as a college freshman, I realized everyone, especially the adults were laughing at the over done gags, poor acting, and really childish style the film was made. Really the previews and TV spots showed all the funny parts and the rest of the film was just as bad as a straight to DVD Disney sequel. There were some scenes in there that I thought was to over the top like changing into a new costume in a matter of seconds even more annoying than the last. Jokes at the start of the film I realized on the second time watching it, were recycled through out the entire film like the villain's constant farts after his maniacal laughs. I didn't even laugh once like my eleven year old self almost died of in the theater. I really was surprised to read that Rotten Tomatoes rated this in the 100 worst movies of the decade, but I guess a lot can change in seven years regarding as to what some sees as funny and over the top. I would say don't even bother renting it, but I see no need because it's nowhere to be found."

It's saddening to see a talented comedian like Dana Carvey stoop this low. Let any of your kids over the age of 5 watch this schlock and they'll probably slit your throat in your sleep.\n\nEverything about it screams slapped together, All of his disguises appeared in the trailers, \"Pistachio Disguisey\". The impressions sounded like something the guy who gets drunk off his ass does at a party. The (thankfully) 80 minutes running time. Don't see this movie, ever.

I can't believe The Master of Disguise got such harsh reviews. It opened in Denmark nearly a year after it did in America so I had plenty of opportunities to read the bad reviews. But I decided to ignore them and to form my own opinion. I went to see it with my sister and I genuinely liked it. Word must have got around, because we were the only ones there, but on the other hand it was one of the smaller theaters in a multiplex cinema on a workday. Actually it added to the whole experience because we could laugh as loud as we wanted. And boy, did we laugh. There were so many funny scenes like The Turtle bit and the all too specific pop-up book, not to mention the slapping dummy. I especially enjoyed the references to other movies like when Grandfather Disguisey shows up Father Merrin style or when Pistachio shows up at Bowman's party disguised as Tony Montana. Another thing I liked was the cameos by for instance Bo Derek. I thought it was a great movie. The characters were both well cast and acted, furthermore I found that all the jokes were well carried out and none of them fell flat, not even Devlin Bowman's flatulence. It's nearly impossible to miss with a good fart joke.\n\nWhat can I say? Sometimes you just can't rely on critics. I can't wait to see Malibu's Most Wanted. I know it too got some harsh reviews but I don't care. I've seen the trailer and it looks good to me. I'm going. Even if it doesn't open in the Danish theaters."

It's clean comedy, so it's not as offensive or edgy as most, but the jokes are funny, and the performances are good. Brent Spiner is quite hilarious as the flatulant evil dude, and Dana Carvy is hilarious at ... well ... being Dana Carvy. I always liked Dana Carvy and always enjoy seeing his impersonations and comedy routines. I felt like they played it a little too safe though. I'd like to see him and Mike Meyers together again. Maybe Austin Powers vs the Master of Disguise or something where they can both play a lot of roles. Sure Austin Powers is much funnier than this, but it's for adults and is allowed be edgier so it's not exactly a fair comparison. I'd like to see Dana Carvy do something a bit edgier. But for now, this film is a humorous way to spend time with the family."

However, there's only one thing that keeps this from being such a movie: Good actors. Sure, Dana Carvey did a brilliant job with what was handed to him and probably deserves praise for his performance in this god-awful movie. Everyone else, though, came across simply terrible in their efforts, which, I would suspect, were minimal to begin with. As a result, there is the sad likelihood that this movie has ruined Dana Carvey's career. I haven't seen him resurface since this movie, though perhaps I am not looking hard enough. However, I would completely understand him not wanting to show his face anywhere after this extraordinarily terrible movie."

And to all of you who honestly thought is was a movie for older people and thought it would have \"adult humor\" how damn stupid can you be. what in the previews or trailers made it sound adult, was it the slapping machine, the turtle scene, the meant-to-be-fake Italian accent, because all those things just scream \"PG-13\". dumbasses. this may seem a little harsh and rude, but from what i've read about this movie and the harsh criticism its been getting, you all deserve it."

It's easily one of the cringiest movies I've seen in my life. Akward acting, very poor duologue, and script that sounds nearly possessed. Aside form that, the plot moves a bit smoothly at a calm rate, the villan isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, and, if you're alone when you watch it, you can actually laugh to the cringness of it. And at least it doesn't become offensive to the point of a PG13 rating. I watched this movie at a very young age, and I loved it. But at least I'm more responsible for this than I used to. So all in all, it's just plain bad."

I must say that I now evaluate everything she says and does in a different light. The whole plot is a series of impersonations and characters that Dana Carvey can easily handle, but this movie's funny points could have been a 3 minute stand-up routine at best. I only watched the whole thing to be able to discuss it with my friend. The highlights were the Robert Shaw bit and a very small amount of the Al Pacino bit. The first time Brent Spiner farted, maybe. But the Turtle Club scene and some of the dialog was so mindless that I refused to let my six year old watch the movie. It definitely belongs in the bottom 100 of all time."

I laughed slightly only twice, and that was during the 16 minute end credits filled with bloopers. Other than that and Miss Rodriguez, this is a waste of time. Lame jokes are half set up and then delivered almost as an after thought. Dana Carvey just doesn't have the star power to carry even a supporting role. It's a good thing he's backed up by such superstars as James Brolin and Bo Derek. It's about as funny as getting poked in the eye. As memorable as a toothache. Less interesting than your last attack of diarrhea. Still, I'd have to say I was more entertained than I was by Attack of the Clowns, not that that's such a hard thing to accomplish. RATING: 3 out of 10."

This film was really a disappointing, considering how much enjoyed Dana Carvey's performances on SNL and in Wayne's World. The only advice that I can give to anyone, is to stay away from this film, as far away as one would try to stay away from Ebola."

Unfortunately he made a poor choice with this movie. I agree with others who have asked why Carvey needed to make a kid's movie.\n\nNothing makes sense in this movie. Why does Dana's character have a heavy Italian accent if he was raised in the U.S.A.? None of the characters are likeable. Dana's character seemed to be retarded.\n\nThe fart jokes were plain stupid. How that got in the final product I do not know. All the actors are known names and people I like but this script and production had them all treading in toilet water.\n\nI hope this movie does not end Dana's movie career. I see Dana making a come back as a vibrant character actor. He will not make it as a lead actor. Also it would be great if Dana could come back to TV comedy with the right vehicle."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a huge fan of Dana Carvey, I just had to go out and see this movie. I wasn't terribly impressed with the trailers, but I just had to see this to support Dana nonetheless.\n\nThe film is most definitely a kids movie. The story is very silly and VERY bizarre at times. Overall though, Dana Carvey does a fine job. Some of the humor is right on, and just hilarious, but at other times it really isn't that funny (but maybe it is to a kid, I don't know, I'm not a kid). Some of the jokes struck me as very odd, here's an example: There's a scene where Dana Carvey is blatantly parodying Al Pacino in \"Scarface\". It's actually quite a funny scene, and he does it quite well, but I can't imagine ANY kids of today have seen \"Scarface\", and I hope they haven't. I myself just recently saw the film. So, jokes like that really struck me as odd.\n\nAll the cast members did a fine job. Dana Carvey does what he does, and does it quite well. I think Jennifer Esposito is reason enough to sit through this movie. She looks absolutely fantastic in this film! The instant her face is shown on the screen, my jaw hit the floor, she has NEVER looked better! I was happy to see Brent Spiner (aka Data of Star Trek) in the film. I've always liked his acting, and he did a fine job in this film. One other notable thing is the slew of cameo's in this film. I won't mention any of them though, I wouldn't want to take away the surprise.\n\nIf you like silly children's movies or just like Dana Carvey or any of the other cast members, then you should go ahead and check this out. If you didn't like what you saw in the trailers, I don't think there is any way you are going to like the film. Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris"

The commercials gave the impression of a very witty and funny Dana Carvey movie that was released about the same time as his friend Mike Meyer's movie, Goldmember. The problem is, the commercials WERE the movie. Any, and all funny material presented in the movie were contained in the 45 second spot that ran on TV. That means 79 minutes and 15 seconds of the movie were a complete waste of time.\n\nSo much more could have been done with the premise of a 'Master of Disguise', but instead they made the movie into a borefest of awful acting, horrible cliches, and a running fart scene that popped up every time the villain, played by Star Trek's Brent Spiner, laughed and lost control of his bowels.\n\nIf you wish to be entertained, I would recommend you watch Tombstone, Saving Private Ryan, or maybe endless re-runs of Lost in Space. To quote Dr. Smith from Lost in Space... \"Oh the pain... oh the pain!\" Master of Disguise rates a perfect score of ZERO in my book."

He talks with a silly yet endearing Italian accent, and he puts on lots of disguises in his quest to save his parents, who have been kidnapped by a bad and rotten evil-doer who wants his father to use his disguise mastery to do bad and rotten evil things, blah blah blah. What else do you need to know? Get some popcorn and make the best of it. It's still Dana Carvey in that turtle suit, after all."

Punchlines are too obvious, these half-baked jokes are unbearable and you wonder if the producers even bothered thinking about how the plot works.

Much of the jokes were references to pop culture, a cheap trick that will date the movie very soon. The only laughs from the audience were the cheaply low reoccurring fart jokes. The plot was incoherent and it jumped around too much the editor must have been drunk. The outtakes and gags while the credits were rolling would make even Jackie Chan woozy.\n\nOn a positive note, this movie was very clean. There were a few minor PG jokes, but this movie could be shown unedited on TV. In an age where crude jokes are the norm to get a laugh, this movie, for the most part, avoided it.

In fact, when I was younger I actually enjoyed it. While it is nothing good, it isn't bad either. In fact, at least it's entertaining for a child.\n\nIt's just the fact that the protagonist is played by Dana Carvey... I didn't know who he was when I was a kid, but I do now and it hurts seeing him reduced to nothing.\n\nIt really hurts... It hurts so bad it ruins the film entirely, as well as my mood when I think about it. If you're reading this and don't know who he is, I beg you to check out his SNL work. He is an amazing comedian.\n\nOverall, this film is nothing horrendous. It doesn't have much of a message, the comedy can only be enjoyed by small children, and it's quite forgettable. But it's harmless entertainment for children. Adults and teens will want to sit this one out... especially if they know who Dana Carvey is."

Dana Carvey stars as Pistachio Disguisey, an Italian waiter who has a strange and uncontrollable addiction to mimicking his customers. When his mother (Eddie McClurg) and father (James Brolin) are kidnapped by a criminal mastermind (Brent Spiner), Pistachio learns with the help of his grandfather (Harold Gould) that he has inherited a magical power that allows him to disguise himself as anyone in the world, which he must use to save his parents.\n\nI don't know what Dana Carvey was thinking when he decided to take part in this film. I believe that it was a waste of his great acting abilities and this has probably ruined his career (in fact, according to his IMDb page he hasn't been in anything since this.) My main problem with this film are the childish, unfunny jokes. There just aren't any laugh-out-loud parts of the film that I can remember. For example, there is a running joke in which Spiner's character has uncontrollable flatulence and it fails terribly to gain a laugh.\n\nI think that they had a good plot line in their hands, but it got lost in the terrible writing. This could have been a classic, fun family film that both parents and children could enjoy and could have made Dana Carvey very well known and more of a household name. It's a shame that this film was so bad because Dana Carvey has so much talent.\n\nThe only good thing I can come up with about The Master Of Disguise is that kids will love it. But, I have to say that kids are pretty god damn stupid.\n\nWith bad jokes and childish humour, The Master Of Disguise is a terrible film. I give it 3/10."

In Mr. Carvey's case, the mistake of being in this film show that making good choices is of paramount importance to those aspiring to move on to the big screen. The movie is never funny and isn't even \"bad\" good. It just stinks. He plays a character named \"Pistachio Disguisey\". COME ON - my 5-year-old nephew could come up with a wittier name, and believe me, he wouldn't laugh at even the most infantile jokes in this flick. I defy any adult to even crack a smile.

I generally like silly humour, but there was nothing here that was remotely risable.\n\nThe impressions were good (particularly the Al Pacino), but some were pointless. What the heck was that turtle thing all about?

Even at just \u00a32.95 on DVD (less than $5 for you American readers) to buy this was a waste of money. The best part of the DVD was the deleted scenes, namely the Mayor Maynot scene which despite being the funniest scene that was filmed by an absolute mile, still managed to end up on the cutting room floor.\n\nI dread to think what was going through the heads of the producers when they were making this.

The only reason it worked in Austin Powers is because they were smartly done. Here most of them are so hammy you can't enjoy them. On a worse note we have James Brolin as the father and Edie McClurg as the mother. It seems like their only purpose is to have two big names. Brolin's performance is so over the top it's embarrassing and McClurg is well... McClurg, she can only do so much. Spiner as Devlin Bowman is a fart happy crazy man who was put in jail by Brolin's guy. And I do mean fart happy. He does it as comedic relief expecting we'll think the joke is funny if done enough. Fart jokes really just aren't funny. So if you want a smarter movie, scrap this and rent the Austin Powers trilogy."

But there is really little here to interest anyone older than that. Carvey's disguises are great, but that's about all there is to this movie. His character is too silly to believe, there is a kid in a superfluous role, the usual babe for love interest, and a lot of general silliness around a wafer thin plot. It's safe for kids if they really want to see it, best to wait for video and save your money."

So I watched it with them again and after seeing it for the second time I remembered some really funny characters Dana Carvey does. The third time I watched it I found it to be extremely funny. It definitely grows on you.\n\nOne of the reviews I read here said that the characters Dana does aren't funny, but they couldn't be further from the truth. He does a character based on Tony Montana from Scarface that is hilarious! He also does a character named Gammy Numnums, which is an older snobby woman and is one of the funniest characters in the movie. The problem is that he does so many characters that none of them last long enough. His turtle-man character is really funny and gets funnier the more you see it.\n\nDana Carvey is an absolute brilliant comedian and this movie SHOULD HAVE been his gateway to super stardom (i.e. Jim Carrey). Unfortunately the movie really isn't very good and it shows upon first view. But give it a chance and watch it with you kids and I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much you like it and want to watch it again."

It has some physical humor and sight gags that almost everybody will find amusing. It is a just a little over 80 minutes long, another plus. It's not like you are investing \"Lawrence of Arabia\" like time into this. It has some mild comic violence, think Three Stooges for level of violence and then crank it back a little bit.\n\nThis movie suffers from what several movies made by refugees from Saturday Night Live have suffered from - it is incredibly difficult to make a full length motion picture out of a three minute skit. Dana Carvey does over the top caricatures familiar to anyone who watched SNL when Carvey was in the cast.\n\nI watched this film several years ago and thought it was pretty dumb. I watched it again with my eight year old grandson and his appreciation of it made me rethink my opinion a bit. It is not a \"date night\" film, for sure, but if you are a babysitter of boys 6-10 years old this will hold their attention and make them laugh."

I've been meaning to watch this movie for YEARS, due to my LOVE of Dana Carvey, but EVERY TIME I reach out for it, I would put it back down, remembering the awful reviews! But I'm telling you here and now that those reviews are WRONG! This movie had me laughing, rooting for Pistachio to get his happy ending, and angry at DATA from Star Trek TNG, which I couldn't believe was possible, ESPECIALLY with those GORGEOUS blue eyes of his! But I digress, this movie tells the story of a inexperienced, socially awkward man, working as a waiter in his parents Italian restaurant, and he's bullied by about everyone in the world, except his Papa, even when Pistachio has one of his \"episodes\" and fades out and starts channeling a customer's voice and mannerisms, his Papa sees what's going on and tells the customer he's not welcome there, and about a dozen diners leave, but his Papa tells him how special he is, and how proud of him he is! At THAT moment, I fell in LOVE with this movie, became personally involved, and without giving away plot details, Pistachio ended up with a MAJOR crisis on his hands, and I just couldn't even pause it to go to the bathroom, I was too personally invested! This is a fun, funny, enjoyable movie from start to finish!!! The ONLY reason it didn't get a 10 was because the script had some issues I didn't care for, the grandfather's \"help\" bordered on abusive and bullying at times, and everyone's seen the \"turtle\" suit art the turtle club because it was on all the commercials, butt in the actual movie, it bordered on RIDICULOUS! He wouldn't shut up to talk to anyone, he just kept saying \"turtle\" and related things... he was sabotaging himself! ANYONE would have seen through that miles away!!! I still LOVED the movie, it was REALLY a feel good movie!!!"

I'm now 17 and rewatched it with my friend, and we both had lots of laughs!! The only thing I could say that's slightly negative about this movie is that you have to have a very specific type of humor to be an adult and really appreciate it. For example, if I saw this movie for the first time when im 20, it would not be too impactful the way it has been since I first saw it when I was younger (and the fart joke becomes a little overdone, but kids seriously LOVE it when jokes are repeated often since they have goldfish-attention-spans!). As a kids movie, this movie is 100% my favourite from my childhood! And since I have the type of humor that this movie consistently serves, it is one of my favorites still today."

        "review_detailed_main": "_Master_of_Disguise_ is a niche market movie made and designed by Saturday Night Live folks of today or recent yesteryear. It stars Dana Carvey and also has SNL Adam Sandler in it and he produced it. But, the movie under credits the other stars of the film and fails to mention in its ads the cameos in it that might bring in other niche audiences other than the SNL audience. Brent Spiner plays the villain, Devlin Bowman, and this is one of his bigger non-Star Trek roles. He seemed to be having a lot of fun in the movie. He gives the character the relish and the glee he gives Lore and some other characters he has also played in the past, but in some ways, it is a new character, but I do see some common denominators between this character and one or more characters he has played in the past. The other actors and people in the film who were playing themselves, seemed to be having some fun with it also. It is good to watch a movie where one or more actors/actresses really seems to be enjoying what they're doing. That often seems to be the case with Mr. Spiner. He never leaves his heart behind, but always includes it in any given role. That's one thing that makes Mr. Spiner different from a lot of other actors - he acts with his heart and not just with his head. One catch in the movie is the Cigar Club Turtles which Mr. Carvey has some fun jokes on and Mr. Spiner's character smokes its cigars. But, there really is a Turtle Club out there. It is a secret society. I hear that Johnny Cash is a Turtle. An ex-boyfriend of mine is a Turtle. I may count as a Turtle, too, because I know the secret answer to the secret question. Anyrate, I laughed all of the way through and saw it 2 extra times for good measure and I don't normally watch SNL because I'm bizzy watching BritComs a lot on Saturday Nights on our local PBS station. But, this was indeed a very funny movie. Go see it, if you haven't. Niche markets that might enjoy the film are: SNL audience, Star Trek audience, other actors/actresses/personalities' fans such as Jesse Ventura, Turtles, Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity (most APOs are usually Turtles also), and ages 10-mid-twenties or whenever most people outgrow bathroom humor. But, older people may enjoy it also. The movie has the added flavor of most of the actors/actresses having had stage experience. There is always a different feel to T.V. and movie stuff when the actors are people who are used to performing live, on stage for some reason. Maybe it is the over-the-top feel which more recent Star Trek series tend to be lacking on. It is your basic silly movie that I've heard Patrick Stewart say is, \"America's gift to the world.\" (our silliness)"

During subsequent viewings (Those with kids know what I mean), I gave up on that, and I too found myself looking forward to each ridiculous Carvey incarnation.\n\nSome of the characterizations are classic Carvey that have been shoehorned into the plot (Al Pacino's Scarface as a disco dancer, Robert Shaw from Jaws), while others are just over the top silly (Turtleman!). But like I said, kids love it. It's the sort of innocent fun that allows you to leave the room guilt free if you don't like Dana Carvey."

But my 7 year old and her friends LOVED it - and she has seen Keaton, Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, etc. and she adores them (and no, I am not comparing for a second Carvey to these legends but there is no way he deserves the crap he's getting for this film). The film is silly, flawed, badly edited but also has some very funny set pieces and some great throwaway dialogue (\"this is what you are doing, this is what I need you to do\" \"Turtle harm\" \"You are the conductor of the potty train\", etc.) Fun for the kids. Plain and simple. But, jeez, compared to some Sandler or Schneider disasters, this film deserves better treatment from viewers."

In fact,\n\nmy 4 year old and 7 year old LOVED it! They watched it 7 times in\n\n5 days! (Please don't take offense at this, I don't usually let them\n\nwatch that much TV, but they really loved it. I probably won't buy it\n\nfor that very reason!) My 4 year old son still quotes Pistachio all the\n\ntime and just laughs and laughs! He keeps asking, \"Mom,\n\nremember that part in \"Masters of the Sky\"?\" So, all you people\n\nwho are dissing this movie, just stop it!

        "review_detailed_main": "For my purposes, this title gets a 8 out of 10. Five for the movie itself, an extra two points for Mr. Spiner's diamond blue eyes, and one for the set designer who had the presence of mind to arrange Spiner's character's color scheme around them. Everything around \"Devlin Bowman\" is blue and white and the effect is quite striking.\n\nThe movie is a ninety minute fart joke. I'm not kidding.\n\nHarold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is). Casting James Brolin in this movie was a definite stroke of completely ridiculous genius. Austin Wolff is, of course, adorable, and Dana Carvey's particular brand of multiple personality disorder is as entertaining as ever (I got a definite chuckle out of Mr. Peru).\n\nLike I said, the movie is a ninety minute fart joke and is quite clearly directed at males between the ages of eight and twelve. If you have a roomful of those kind of people and you'd like them to stop breaking things by playing baseball with the ceiling fan, this movie will at least put them all in one room and occupy them with disgusting noises for about an hour and a half. There's no swearing. The (incredibly) mild \"blue\" content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag, as is the \"violence\". It's supposed to be a silly, sight gag based comedy and that's exactly what it is.\n\nAs for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous. Like I said, the character's entire color scheme is a shade of electric blue that compliments his eyes to the point of being captivating. I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look. The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best \"smarmy/irritated\" act (the one that stole \"Out To Sea\" right out from under two legends). It's amusing and relatively gentle right up until the climax of the movie, where he hits the \"crazy button\" and doesn't look back. Then it's just plain hilarious. In terms of Spiner-related content, I got exactly what I wanted out of this movie and just a little bit more.\n\nBy the way, Classmates.com owes Spiner a big, wet kiss (trust me)."

Master of Disguise is nothing more than a bunch of childish jokes and impressions that are thrown in for no good reason other than to showcase carvie's talent. And guess what? they're hilarious! The best thing about this movie is everyone involved knows the movie is just ridiculous but the cast puts everything they've got into it anyway and play their characters as if they were serious.\n\nI could imagine kids would laugh at this like crazy! I love the joke about how the disguisees only like women with huge hips and in one scene the dana carvie and his uncle are admiring this fat lady from behind, but then the lady turns around and its this fat guy with a beard wearing a dress!!! both of them recoil in disgust! Stupid? yes but it works for some reason. I enjoyed it a lot!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently went to see \"Master of Disguise\", Dana Carvey's new \"movie\". I put the word \"movie\" in quotes because I think the word \"expos\u00e9\" would better encompass the thing that I saw. Countless times during the show I found myself asking \"What the f***?\" Nevertheless, it was incredibly humorous. At times I didn't know if it was a kid's movie or if it should have had a higher rating that it's PG. It left me dumbfounded and confused, yet delightfully elated. I agree with the guy above when he says:\n\n\"One cannot begin to hopefully comprehend or decipher all the psychological & stereotypical boundaries this film breaks. It is a surprise to find this film in mainstream theaters as a film on this level & caliber would normally only be found in the finest arthouse theaters. If you plan on seeing Master of Disguise, I suggest keeping your afternoon free, as after viewing, no after witnessing it, you'll need the rest of the afternoon to invest in deciphering the dense narrative.\"\n\nIf humor is caused by the momentary break down of logic in our brains or surprising results, this movie takes full advantage of each of these. It definitely had the feel of Dana Carvey, reminiscent of his short-lived TV show. I highly recommend it, since few others probably will."

When I first saw Master of Disguise I was a little taken by surprise at the amount of slapstick comedy, and felt it went too over the top at times, as I had had doubts that this film was a little too young for me. But then I watched it again properly and it grew on me. I found that I enjoyed Dana Carvey's performance and realised that this film was funny, better than that. Harold Gould was the balance back from the comedy though also inputted some himself which I found was well put in. Brent Spiner as the \"bad guy\" was a perfect match and played his part brilliantly opposite Carvey, Gould and Brolin. This film was brought to its great level by the story and the way it appeals to children and Carvey's character with his simplicity. I also think this film was one of the great ways to allow Carvey to use his talent of impersonation in the big screen. I had personally not heard of him before this film and am now finding myself looking for more of his work. I have now watched the film quite a few times and still enjoy it. Anyone who has a great and slightly weird sense of humour like me should find it a laugh very enjoyable."

Becoming another person to stop the world's most flagellate man from collecting art in the form of rare political articles seems to be the movies objective.

From his days with Saturday Night Live, when he kept audiences in stitches with his rendition of Church Lady and Hanz and Franz, Dana Carvey is, hands down, one of the best comedians, and this movie has been long in coming.\n\nCompared to the summer's other highly touted offerings for kids -- Lilo & Stitch, Scooby Doo, Crocodile Hunter, et. al. -- The Master of Disguise wins, hands down. Not only was it truly targeted toward its audience with a lack of cursing, but the crude humor that accompanies any SNL's performance was far enough over the head of the kids in the audience that only the parents were laughing.\n\nObviously, the movie wasn't intended to have a plot that will garner any Oscar nominations. That was never the point. It's mindlessly stupid, which is what Dana Carvey is all about. But when you enter the theater, you know that. So you sit back with your drink and your candy, take a deep breath, and get ready to laugh your way through the entire thing, which is exactly what all 9 of us did.\n\nThanks, Dana Carvey, for giving my kids and me one good laugh at this movies this summer before heading back to school."

The jokes are usually immature sometimes and mainly consist of Carvey disguising himself as different wacky characters and doing impressions. Here is where the problem lies. While the impressions range from good (Tony Montana) to hysterically funny (Quint from Jaws) to downright surreal (Turtle Turtle) the plot in between and the actual jokes are a little on the poor side.\n\nThe biggest problem is the editing. The third act in particular seems to have about 15 mins of plot sliced out of it and there are some noticeable holes in the story. In fact the whole ending seems to have not been completely filmed. This makes an already silly movie very difficult to follow at times and the film ends at just under 77 mins.\n\nMany of these faults could be attributed to the fact that the film is aimed at pre-teens, however in this case they have no excuse. Most of the cast are good comedic actors and watching this film you can see the humour trying to get out, you know this film could have succeeded if they had just tried a little harder.\n\nInstead we are left with a film that will make you laugh if you watch it with your kids, but will never fully entertain anyone, not even the audience it was intended for. 5 out of 10."

It's kind of sad when our society needs either foul language, sexual content, or blood and gore to really get them excited(I mean come on, how much more plot and character development does Austin Powers have?) Anyway, some are going to get all upset because, how could I compare Austin Powers to this little movie, well let's see, Austin Powers is mostly about Mike Myers doing his schtick, except he has crude language, sexual innuendo and violence, Master of disguise is abot Dana Carvey being funny with very little sexual stuff(ok I know I know there ARE some scenes, but even that dosen't compare to Austin's blatent stuff) and some slapstick type violence(forgive the pun) Anyway, if you are a kid at heart, are a kid or have kids I think you'll like this movie."

I mean sure, like any other film, it had its rougher elements such as Pistasicios mother who I disliked immensely (and who was a voice in a cartoon I can't put my finger on) but I though this hardly affected the plot. I especially liked the villains' farting jokes (yeah, that's right) not to mention the Lincoln speech, man that bit cracked me up. But what confuses me is that you people couldn't handle the silliness of the film, the weight of your reality has destroyed your viewing pleasure. You might have gotten used to your linear life of work, family, weekend leisure in a constant cycle, but perhaps you don't realise the damage it has done to your mind and soul. Also being your inability to appreciate the humour of a child (I'm 15 so it hasn't escaped me yet fortunately) A good film, not a perfect one mind you yet still worth watching if you have the soul."

It wasn't until years later that I learned how many negative reviews it had. I'm not sure why that is. This movie was made to make kids laugh, and I believe it succeeded in doing that. I still find it hilarious even now. If you watch this movie without expectations, then you might enjoy it too. It's silly, but there's always room for silliness in comedy. I will always consider it a classic. So, make yourself some spaghetti with man-sized meatballs and watch Master Of Disguise right now."

Humor is dead, and everyone is a jaded critic. We sit on our couches and click our buttons to entertain, and then if we feel frustrated or upset about what we've subjected ourselves to then it's off to practice our cynical, hyperbolic ramblings for all the anonymous avatars to like and react. One might argue that in writing said review I myself have engaged in precisely such a hypocrisy. To that I'd reply this is true, however it doesn't count when I engage is such futility, for being the beacon of unbridled truth that I am I am able to throw off all hindrances in articulation of the upmost importance, and declare to you, the reader here in this moment that this is indeed despite all the evidence to the contrary a quality production worthy of the iota of honor and respect that modern man is still capable of giving."

        "review_detailed_main": "This little movie has become one of our family's all time favorites. Honestly, we watch it over and over again, quote it to each other, show it to other people. No, it's not a great movie; but it is a funny movie. You just have to have a taste for silliness, a childlike taste.\n\nWhen the nefarious Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) kidnaps his legendary father (James Brolin), Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) has to learn the ways of \"Energico\" and go to the rescue -- not just of his parents but of numerous national treasures besides. Ably helped by an assistant Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) and his mystical grandfather (Harold Gould), Pistachio slowly becomes the Master of Disguise.\n\nCarvey, who has always cracked me up anyway, whirls through an army of loopy characters -- Granny Num-Nums, Mr. Peru, Terry Suave, Constable Muller, Cherry Pie Man (\"Look! It's Cherry Pie Man!,\" like everybody knows him), and the great Turtle Man. There are also Robert Shaw from Jaws and even President George W. Bush at a crucial moment.\n\nThe DVD (yes, we own it) special features show those weren't all he had in mind -- Mayor Maynot is so well done, but was cut out completely, for instance.\n\nSpecial kudos to Spiner, who was evil, and Esposito, who played along hilariously. And the guy offering hors d'oeuvres to Mr. Peru, just for keeping a straight face.\n\nThe Italian accents are uniformly awful, I'll admit, and the gags are sometimes dopey. But they're funny dopey, not painful dopey. If you're not too sophisticated to enjoy a simply enjoyable movie, rent this movie or pick it up for $5 at Half Price Books like we did. Watch it with some kids, about 10 years old. It will be difficult for you to stop laughing."
