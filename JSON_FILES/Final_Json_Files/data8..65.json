I'm a sci-fi junkie, I love thrillers, Adam Driver is awesome, and I'll watch basically anything with large scary creatures. This should have been a layup for me to like. Yet I found myself unengaged and somewhat bored. I started feeling sleepy even after a Red Bull.\n\nI don't really know how or why it happened, but this is just a forgettable movie. Some dumb things happen but I am able to turn my brain off. Although after watching the Angry Joes review, I didn't realize how many dumb things I ignored. I guess I just didn't care enough to notice them.\n\nI hope a movie like this doesn't discourage studios from going for more of these mid-budget movies. I like the idea of an isolated story somewhere random in space/time. I just hope they do a better job next time. (1 viewing, opening Sunday 3/12/2023)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really think this film would be doing much better at the box office with a better title and clearer marketing. This is a more than serviceable action thriller starring a legitimate star that is mostly entertaining for its 90 minute runtime.\n\nThe CGI is surprisingly good given the small budget and it's cool seeing dinos in a non-Jurassic Park film. The story is probably the weakest element given its cliched beats and real Last of Us vibe. Some wooden dialogue and lack of exposition round out my critiques. I liked the futuristic tech in the film and Driver delivers an expected solid showing. 65 won't light the genre on fire, but it's better than it's getting credit for."

Man faces a few obstacles that he overcomes, most of them the same situation, that's about it. There's only two characters basically, and the dialog between them is limited. This works for a bit, but there's not enough development of the characters, and it's easy to just not care about what happens to them one way or another.\n\nIt could have been much better if there was more objectives in the plot, more characters or build up, more on what happened before and after the situation on the planet."

The CGI is so mixed one minute at the beginning it's like watching the BBC walking with Dinosaurs program that was released around 20 years ago but the CGI middle to end is good? It's like they kept the budget for the big finale but there isn't a lot of Dinosaurs in this, so if you're going with tye expectations of seeing a lot of Dinosaurs you won't get it. There's a period in the middle of the film were it just sort of trudges on with not much happening. I personally would watch it again but I won't be in a rush to and I'm highly disappointed they didn't do better in every department..story action and CGI."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was very curious about this film since it seemed very simple in concept to those of some of the best movies in the past decades. Not to mention having phenomenal actor Adam Driver fighting dinosaurs, who wouldn't watch it? After finishing the movie, I can at least say the movie was a competent and engaging watch, but wasn't as exciting as the trailers made it out to be.\n\nFirst of all, Adam Driver is fantastic in this movie. Despite the simplistic and somewhat predictable narrative, he's still engaging to watch as a desperate man trying to survive and rescue the only other survivor, a young foreign girl. And Props to Ariana Greenblatt for pulling off a helpless girl with a language opposite of the lead and still having good chemistry.\n\nOther than that, the movie doesn't really utilize it's concept that well with the battle of scientific technology and prehistoric creatures. There are only a few instances where we can see him use strategy and the use of various gadgets to take them down. While those scenes are fun, it's very little throughout the movie.\n\nI was worried that this movie could have been awful since it gave me very similar vibes to After Earth, and I'm sure you don't need me to explain why. But I can at least say that writer and directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods didn't drop the ball that badly. I can also respect that they want to bring Hollywood back to basics with concepts that are simple, yet effective. While slow paced, and at times underwhelming, I can at least say I enjoyed myself while watching."

I would say it's a fairly effective monster film, I wouldn't go in hoping and looking for a sweeping sci fi saga, it is pretty much a man Vs monsters movie.\n\nProduction values are actually pretty good, and the dinosaurs look very effective. The destruction of the planet scene was awesome, and I guess that was a novel take on what happened on the planet.\n\nI enjoyed the relationship between Mills and Koa, the language barrier made it interesting, credit to both actors for ensuring there was a good deal of chemistry between the pair.\n\nI never expect to see the likes of Adam Driver in a film like this, but the versatile actor that he is, delivers once again, I thought he was excellent.\n\nUnusual, interesting, engaging.\n\n7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "65 (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters this evening. The storyline follows a pilot on a research voyage whose ship runs into an unforeseen asteroid belt and crashes on Earth 65 million years ago. Most of the crew doesn't survive the crash except one little girl who doesn't speak English. The pilot and the little girl try to make it across the planet to a rescue pod that can hopefully get them home.\n\nThis movie is cowritten and codirected by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who also worked together in Haunt, and stars Adam Driver (House of Gucci), Ariana Greenblatt (Love and Monsters), Chloe Coleman (My Spy) and Nika King (Euphoria).\n\nThere's a lot to like about this movie but there's also something missing. The storyline had a ton of potential but needed more details of the backstory on a macro scale rather than just the characters sub plots (which were good). I think we needed more details on the reason for the voyage and who the pilot worked for. I will say the storyline does keep you interested from beginning to end, it just could have been better. The acting and chemistry of Driver and Greenblatt was perfect. The special effects are outstanding and as good as any Jurassic Park movies. The dinosaurs and insects were a 10/10, though they could have worked in a few passive dinosaurs, a herbivore or two. Every creature in this movie is a blood thirsty killer. The action scenes are intense and there's some great jump scares throughout the film. The settings and cinematography was very good, the CGI was outstanding and the wounds are gory and intense. The ending is predictable but still entertaining.\n\nOverall, this is a worthwhile addition to the science-fiction, action genre in a Pitch Black kind of way. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend seeing it once."

I. The story is so incompatible with logic, realism or probability , yet so full of the same old unconvincing ideas we've seen thousands of times , that is actually a painful experience for me to endure. Thank goodness for the fast forward button.. if I was in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes.\n\nThis film is in the Jurassic Park mould of sciFi horror- basically a simple horror story made in the action genre. The sci fi trappings just allow lazy writing in dealing with the dilemmas faced.\n\nLike many horror films the protagonist(s) in this just can't help doing the wrong thing, or doing the right thing the wrong way.\n\nI lost count of the ceaseless daft actions and occurrences- whatever could go wrong does go wrong.\n\nHere are just some glaring ones- Adam Driver's spacecraft has no warning or defence systems to detect or mitigate meteorites, asteroids and other space debris- it only notices a field of them minutes before impact. It doesn't alert the sleeping Adam, It then does an analysis of potential danger- ignores any danger; and 30 seconds later continues right into the middle of the meteorite field .... and says - 'warning UNEXPECTED meteor activity' after the first impacts.\n\nWhy has his craft only got one pilot and no other personnel ?\n\nWhy did the ship and meteorite make peculiar 'creaky door dinosaur sounds' during the impacts ...\n\nWhen the cryogenics fail why doesn't the craft implement a retrieval process ?\n\nEverything in the ships personnel apartments was colourless, and the many ships computer screens only had red & blue graphics.\n\nWhen the meteorites teat a hole in the craft why doesn't it decompress / suck all the contents out into space? Why are the cryogenics units on the outside walls of the craft?\n\nAdams character doesn't originally send a distress signal,deleting it instead... Then he goes off to kill himself.\n\nHe shows no humour or empathy with the girl- in fact his character is very peculiar. The story tries to mawkishly tell you why via his daughters video messages.\n\nWhen you fall from a tree on your back you are winded and temporarily immobilised... the way he fixed his dislocation was unbelievable - as was the state of his wound and lack of attention to healing it.\n\nHe tells the girl to run when confronted with fast running 'dinosaurs'.\n\nHe takes no sleeping bags , tent, food & drink...toilet roll , insect net or replant ?\n\nNor his daughters video diaries, spare flash light (also never used to strobe & dazzle the creatures) or his suite & helmet.\n\nThe 12 kilometer journey (7 & a half miles) would take 4-8 hours depending on the terrain. If it was 12 miles as the crow flies then Adams computer should have estimated a more realistic distance.\n\nWhen in the cave there's a tunnel they don't seem to have noticed when they set up camp. When attacked they retreat into the tunnel and a big deal is made of finding another exit- why ? Why not just wait until the threat outside moved on.\n\nBy this point I gave up counting and fast forwarded with subtitles.\n\nIt didn't matter what happened anymore- DEJAVU took over."

I would stick to \"conventional\" - since there are predictable movies (any of the middle and final Jurassic delivers are predictable, but you can find some 20 minutes of excitement here and there), but this one is conventional. The story is there but it's conventional, the action is there but it's conventional... take the cave scene for example. The set up is somehow promising - that thing in the shadows. But then... just 15 minutes of... boooring. Not sure if it's about the story, the script, the direction, the acting... I just didn't care, didn't engaged, didn't guessed.\n\nOnly thing I liked a bit was the score. Like an OST that could stand on it's own. But I'm not even sure about this at this point."

        "review_detailed_main": "Like Beck/Woods' earlier writing effort A Quiet Place, 65 is a surprisingly small-scale thriller that boasts simple ideas and familial themes. Although I think the former was crafted with considerably more skill and had a more polished, tight script, the latter is still pretty effective at what it sets out to do.\n\nWe're granted some clumsy exposition and an overly long set-up at the film's start, but once the journey actually begins, it's rather exciting till it's end.\n\nI loved that Mills and Koa spoke different languages and thus had to communicate mostly non-verbally. It added a great deal of weight to their interactions and emphasised just how much trust and emotion can be built and shared without words.\n\nMany small character moments are shown throughout the film and they do end up building to a sweet, heartfelt conclusion, but Beck/Woods' script didn't really tie these individual moments together very well.\n\nThe screenplay needed some more work to clean up the often wooden dialogue and to build a thread that the movie's individual scenes could follow. Because with how simple this film's plot is, it really shouldn't feel like it's meandering as much as it is.\n\nBut what I mostly came for is the dinosaur action. Like I said earlier, it takes too long to get to these parts, but when they do come they're worth the wait.\n\nEach dinosaur encounter is unique in how it's dangerous and how it can be handled, which kept the action fresh. And each of these sequences is also appropriately directed, with the characters' positions made clear and their peril understood.\n\nI had a good time with this film. It's got its moments when it really shines, though I wish it had been rewritten so it could have been truly memorable."

Nothing about him is that interesting or provocative, or whatever it takes to stare at a screen for 90 minutes. The little girl is a breath of fresh air, but it doesn't help."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was personally my most anticipated first release of the year being a sucker for Sci/fi and anything creature related so I gladly went to the early screening. It feels like its gotten barely any marketing and most likely won't be in theaters long, but it has a chance to become an interesting entry in the genre . This is mainly thanks to writers/directors; Beck and Woods who know how to craft an intense creature feature (A quiet place1/2).\n\nThe story borrows a bit from the mentioned properties, but manages to still maintain an independent feel. It's still written well and has ambitious visions put forth. The scenery and visuals are epic in in every sense of the word. Adam Driver showcases that he can be the main man in large scale action film which is very unexpected but welcomed. The creature design to me is the standout and what I show up for. It blows the last JW trilogy out if the water in that facet as well as the incredible action.\n\nOverall this is my kind of release and while it may not due massive numbers I'm glad crazy sci/fi is still being made for the big screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "You'd be hard pressed to find a lamer trailer that was released so far in 2023 than the trailer to \"65\" - even Adam Driver couldn't save the monstrosity of mediocrity that was the official preview. And yet, I'd be lying if I said the trailer didn't peak my interest, even if it was just out of the sheer ludicrousness of the film's concept; I mean, you're telling me that a movie starring Kylo Ren fighting dinosaurs is soon to be released, and it's not hitting theatres in January? Say no more, I'll be there opening night - and I was.\n\nSitting in a surprisingly full theatre, myself and around 70 other people found ourselves watching the 7:25 p.m. Showing of \"65.\" The energy was palpable, and even though my stomach was hurting from the milkshake I drank 15 minutes prior, I was pretty darn excited to see Adam Driver shoot some dinosaurs. And truth be told, I got that and even a little bit more. You see, \"65\" isn't a great film, but it can be an entertaining one.\n\nAfter an admittedly rocky start with some pretty bizarre editing choices, the movie picks up the pace once Driver crash lands to earth and meets Koa, played by Ariana Greenblatt. A little girl who doesn't speak the same language as our main character, Koa and Driver form a pretty adorable bond, especially through their attempts at communicating that can lead to some pretty funny scenarios. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed their chemistry, and their relationship throughout the film was a big part of my enjoyment of it.\n\nBut if you're going to see this movie, you're going for the dinosaur action - do you get it? Yes and no. There is definitely a fair amount of action in this movie; Adam Driver gets plenty of opportunities to blow dinos to bits with his futuristic rifle, and it's pretty entertaining to watch. However, a lot of the action takes place in the night time, which greatly frustrated me because, as you can imagine, that meant that a lot of the action was obscured by the darkness. I know this is a strategic move on the studios part to save money, but dear god, would it kill them to shell out a bit more cash so I can watch dinosaurs get blown to pieces in the daylight? This is by no means an action fest, either - there is a lot of character building between Driver and Koa, more than one might expect if we're being honest, which can slightly take away from the momentum; however, the amount of action this movie contains did satisfy my sci-fi cravings, even though I certainly wouldn't have minded a bit more violence.\n\nI wouldn't call \"65\" a good movie, but it is an entertaining one - a guilty pleasure, if you will. This definitely had the potential to be better than it ended up being, but for a 90 minute science-fiction action adventure, there's enough here to warrant a Saturday night theatre experience, especially if you've had a few drinks beforehand and just want to chill with a popcorn and a large soda. If you're on the fence about watching this, the question you should ask yourself is: Do I want to watch Adam Driver shoot dinosaurs? If the answer is yes, then you already know you'll find something to like with \"65.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched \"65\" yesterday in the cinema.\n\nFor what the film wants to be, a survival horror thriller, it can hardly be condemned. It's suspenseful, I was emotionally invested and the chemistry between Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt is good. I also liked the acting of both of them.\n\nThe plot is mundane and the character sketch remains fairly superficial, but it's enough to make me grow fond of both of them and root for them. Both have suffered tragic losses in life and thus have a lot in common. However, the plot is unfortunately also predictable in many places. The one or other moment surprised me and went differently than I would have expected.\n\nThe logic in the film can be questioned here and there. For example, the ammunition display of Mill's rifle does not decrease at all in the beginning and he shoots a lot with it. At the end, in the final battle, the ammunition gauge suddenly melts away from full to empty. Another criticism is that the famous comet can be seen in the sky both during the day and at night, which is completely illogical since the earth rotates. Either he is to be seen in the day or at night. Both is not possible.\n\nThe horror scenes are well done and are oppressive, but unfortunately the film doesn't make enough use of the scary factor. There are also jump scares here and there, but they could have been done without, because I'm not a fan of them. You can scare (almost) anyone, but creating real \"creepiness\" is much more interesting. I'm more a fan of creepy atmosphere than scary moments.\n\nAnother positive thing is the soundtrack by Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman. It is really well done.\n\nI also liked the camerawork and various great wide shots of the landscapes. I like it when movies offer something like that. Of course you can also watch documentaries, but they don't offer an exciting \"story\".\n\nAll in all, I came out of the film quite satisfied.\n\nRating: 7/10 points\n\nRewatch value: Low\n\nEmotional depth: Medium\n\nLasting impression: Low."

The music by Chris Bacon is good with all the expected sci-fi sensibilities."

I'm genuinely shocked at the low reviews here.\n\nI'd never heard of this movie, knew nothing of it but it popped on my recommendations. Looked like a silly action movie, so I figured, 'why not'.\n\nExpectations wonderfully exceeded.\n\nIt's a simple story, a man protecting a child, with every fiber of his being, with a SciFi backdrop.\n\nIt's the epitome of 'show don't tell' movie making and it's done wonderfully.\n\nTurns out, I like Adam Driver! After the Star Wars debacle, I'd written him off, but I've been won over.\n\nHe has the physicality and movement for this role, making action sequences believable but he emotes so much, wordlessly. He's excellent at subtle story telling even without lines.\n\nI don't know of the child actress, but she did really well. I was never yanked from the story because of typical 'child actor' issues. She was believable as a stoic, frightened, stubborn young lady.\n\nThe CGI isn't great, but not so bad it distracted me from the story, but nothing to write home about, either. The practical effects and locations are more than enough to keep the eyes happy though.\n\nIt's a story of a father, a man, trying to survive on multiple levels, and a child dealing with horrible trauma and having to trust a stranger, in a strange land.\n\nAnd being he was written as a real man, he steps up, and does everything to protect this child and get her to safety.\n\nI miss simple story telling like this. Again, I don't understand the bad reviews, it's such a sweet, heroic movie.\n\nVery touching, nice to see, I hope it does well so we can get more story telling like this."

The adventure to the other side of the ship is quite treacherous because they must look out for unknown territory and dinosaurs along the way.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a pretty good film that starred Adam Driver attacking dinosaurs in it. 65 reminded me of Jurassic Park, but if it were a Science Fiction. A con that I found is that it is pretty slow since most of the film only consists of Mills, Koa, and dinosaurs. It is still pretty entertaining to say the least with it being a dinosaur-survival film and the ending. I would recommend to watch 65 in theaters for a good watch."

In order to earn extra money for the treatment of his sickly young daughter, Mills volunteers for a 2 year space mission. Alas, wouldn't you know, the spaceship is beset by meteorites and makes a crash landing, on a place called.... Earth, where it is, wait for it, 65 Millions Years Ago! Mills appears to be the sole survivor... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from co-writers and co-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (\"Nightlight\"). Nothing wrong as such with wanting to do another Jurassic Park-wannabe dinosaurs action movie, except that the concept and story line in this case is as utterly laughable as it is cringe-worthy. After all that, you'd think that the action scenes are going to blow you away, but that is not the case at all. I suppose that the best news of all is that this clocks in at 93 minutes, and before you know it, the movie has come and gone. I can only hope for Adam Driver that he picked up a nice paycheck for this role, as there is little else good to say about this. Bottom line: made almost 30 years after the original Jurassic Park, we are reminded yet again that a dinosaur action movie is nothing without good story telling, in which Jurassic Park was, and still is, the master.\n\n\"65\" opened in theaters in March, 2023, and did okay but not great at the box office. It started streaming on Netflix last week, and I just caught up on it the other night. If you are in the mood for a dinosaur action movie, I'd suggest you check this out, with lowered expectations, and draw your own conclusion."

It isn't really a post-apocalyptic world, but for the sake of this review, that is what we will call it. The movie will explain what's going on in a proper sci-fi manner, which I will not spoil here.\n\nHowever, despite its strengths, the film does feel somewhat underdeveloped and lacks the depth and emotional resonance of other post-apocalyptic works like \"The Last of Us.\" Additionally, the B-movie vibe of the film may not appeal to all audiences.\n\nThe release timing of \"65\" may also work against it, as it inevitably draws comparisons to \"The Last of Us,\" which is widely considered one of the greatest shows on streaming. The similarities in plot and themes between the two works may make \"65\" feel like a budget version of \"The Last of Us.\"\n\nNevertheless, the film's simplicity and engaging characters make it easy to become captivated by the performances and the dinosaur action. It's hard not to be entertained when a movie has dinosaurs, and \"65\" delivers on that front.\n\nOverall, while \"65\" has shortcomings, it is still a fun time at the movies for those who enjoy action-packed films with prehistoric creatures."

For me in 90m the story of the film is very neat, concise, attractive, and not fussy.\n\nSecond, this is a purely entertaining movie, you should know what you're going to watch and don't set yourself up to expect something big and then call it a disappointing movie.\n\nThird, the action splash scenes in the movie are so good, you won't be disappointed. Adam's acting is impeccable.\n\nAnd the last thing, if compared to the movie jurassic world dominion, I think 65 deserves more praise and more revenue than that trash movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "LIKES:\n\nThe Acting -There is really not a lot of characters in this movie, so the top three are kind of it and they, well, they do a good job for the roles they have been given.\n\n-Coleman has this way of playing these sort of down to earth characters with a lot of things involving more of the peaceful, calm, and sad tones. She pretty much says a lot of the same things in this movie, and like AE, there isn't much more I can say on the repetition.\n\n-Greenblatt, is still quite a talented actress landing the weirdest roles for my viewing. In this one, she plays the scared and yet learning role, but takes a made up language of pulled dialects together and kills it.\n\n-Her engagement with Driver is about 50% of the story, and to be honest it works very well for helping keep some form of engaging conversation and dynamic in this movie, and she really plays the dual part well.\n\n-You can guess Driver is the best though, and the man continues to take his rather monotone performance and bring with it, this sensational character from the grind.\n\n-He has this astute level to him, but then loses the cool, and it works so well as he takes all the emotional moments and uses a gradient to sell the scene. Incredible performance given much of it is with non-existent creatures.\n\nThe Pace -It's a movie that moves okay for me, but I can appreciate not having the most dives into the characters given the boundaries.\n\n-65 may not be the most engaging tale, but it certainly works towards getting to a goal and exploration and maintains it for about two thirds of the movie.\n\n-It gives you time to deal with things, tries to give ample exploration of the shot gunned elements, and then leave you a bit on edge for much of the movie.\n\nThe Authentic Music -The score is truly grandiose like the movie's premise and world, a symphony of instruments that comes together to really bring out the moods of the scene.\n\n-Blaring horns and drums add the forlorn and powerful shadows of the beast, while flutes, acoustic guitars, and chimes go for the more serene.\n\n-The end credits in particular are my favorite a combination of everything I just mentioned making the picturesque credits have some ambience and get ready for the epilogue to come from this film.\n\nVisual Design And Animation -This movie is very big on the technical prowess and involves a lot of costume work, scenery, and computers to get the job done.\n\n-In the costume department, the Sci-Fi look is strong, fashionable blends with practical props that really do feel like something in this situation. Simplified and yet representing.\n\n-The makeup helps big time with the injuries sustained, making them look raw, exposed, and festering like something that you would expect. It adds ambience and believability to the film indeed -As for the prehistoric beasts, I liked the design, the colors, and the evolutionary traits that they showed, alongside the savage feature in the way they moved. It's got great texture, good fluid movements of reptile behavior, and quite honestly a menacing factor to it that works.\n\nThe Cinematography -Beautiful shots of an environment with the CGI spectacle of prehistoric Earth, make this truly a lovely movie where cameras tell so much.\n\n-The way they capture nature, give you the sense of the wide world, but then connect it to these traps, enclosures, and situations just helps capture the moment of being there.\n\n--And then the big moments at the end truly captivate the attention of the viewer, with these expansive shots that are quite honestly amazing.\n\nThe Sound Editing -This helps really bring the experience to life for me, and how the engineers caught the effects of the world and made it add that finesse.\n\n-The warbles of the outside creatures, the rumblings of the big beasts and the predators within, and the dynamic motion of nature are all things that really are amazing in this film that I loved watching.\n\n-And then add the science fiction sounds of technology, the sensors, blasting, etc., and you just get this amazing experience that really is important in a movie where aesthetic is doing a lot of the lifting.\n\nThe Sense of Suspense -And at times, there is a lot of this movie that is suspenseful, and worthy of the theater experience.\n\n-It's a dark movie, and our band of two is not invincible, where each hit has lingering consequences for the most part. That realism and edge are great in these moments, and add that terror that they might not make it at any point.\n\n-That's the experience of this movie that is probably the best in terms of story, the fear of survival and the unknown.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nThe Scenes Not Needed -This is something I hate big time, including something with little points that involve stretching to metaphors.\n\n-65 has about four of these moments, that do little to progress the story, add some unneeded times, and just have no big repercussions compared to other things.\n\n-One of these involves unnecessary seeing of animal cruelty, which I get, in a movie for survival you can see, but serves no point when I got that with three other scenes that had purpose.\n\n-These moments do little for me and are more annoying/insulting than anything.\n\nThe Direction Of This Communication Boundary -There is a part of this concept where the two unable to understand each other work for several premises and the plot component -But it does become annoying for me, when there is this odd banter and drawn out drama that goes practically nowhere. And by the end, the two of them are in sync and go a tad fast in how quickly they understand each other. So... it's both a love and a loss in my book that gets offset by the fact that there is sentimental components to things.\n\nThe Cheese Factor At Times -Sentimental moments can be heartwarming, but there is also a tad cheese factor that feels like Full House to me.\n\n-Some monologues that feel a tad rehearsed, and the repetition does not approach AE levels, but still get a touch annoying given the number of times they repeat.\n\n-There are some conveniences as well that are a tad cheesy and this sort of cataclysmic bad luck becomes more humorous than anything else to the point of again waiting for this to be over.\n\nAnimation A Tad Fake Looking -Design check, movement check, and the sounds check, but... the reliance on CGI still holds a level that has that fakeness to it.\n\n-It's not a bad fakeness, but there is just that look and polish that makes it stand out, that robots and props, and DreamWorks did better with back in the day.\n\n-But overall, it's not that bad, but still a tad out of the works that computers just cannot get done.\n\nThe Plot -This is the weakness that seems to be dividing fans of the movie and I'm here to sort of give the ups, but what I disliked.\n\n-The plus side is that the movie's plot is realistic, a trial of human spirit, and poetic with the way it's handling this concept. It serves to do the job of symbolic human spirit, and a primal instinct of the world. That's the cool part.\n\n-It just doesn't sell the other parts well, and the limited dialog, the pointless shots, and the lack of engagement fully with all the beasts makes the story inconsistent and rather simplistic and clich\u00e9.\n\n-Then throw in these elements haphazardly thrown in, a looming threat you think will follow, but then kind of does and then doesn't. It's a tad messy and boring, which then sort of takes away from the excitement.\n\nThe Pace of the Ending -And the plot really stands out in its limitations for me near the end, where suddenly things get very hasty and rushed.\n\n-A timeline suddenly gets established, there is hasty wrap ups of things settled, and the suspense has to be randomly adding more things to get in the way.\n\n-Sure, there is some excitement to help, but... it doesn't mean it's the strongest motivation and devices to help make the story stand out and kind of got hokey with it as well.\n\n-Thus, the ending shows some poor planning and the potential to make a few scenes get cut so we could have made a better ending and maybe add a little more cohesiveness.\n\nThe VERDICT: What this movie does right is get the feel, look and sounds of the Earth in the prehistoric state and all the aspects of surviving in the foreboding world it was. It utilizes technology to bring the extinct beings back into the world and how savage the world was back then, while having some good actors to interact with the fake environment. That is the brilliant part of how much this movie is a theater movie for the tech standards, or at least a good home theater if possible to make the most of it. Sadly, for me, the story is cool from the one aspect of survival, but from the other simplistic, clich\u00e9, and a tad overboard with the amount of bad luck these two seem to have. Certainly the first two-thirds keep this relationship engaging, but that last act, though having some bite, really just fails to keep the pace or maximize the potential of the movie. Beautiful and symbolic as it is, it just lacks the finesse it needed, and only the emotional side prove dominant for me in this film to get past the bloated and overdramatic finish. Throw in the unnecessary scenes that did little for me and again, this movie just needs some cleanup to be the masterpiece people want it to be. Thus, putting all this in, here are my scores\n\nAction/Adventure/Drama: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5."

Adam Driver is lovely and always enjoyable. The girl was fine. This movie has dinosaurs which I wasnt expecting since I knew nothing about it before I saw it. I always prefer to go into a movie cold with no preconceived notions from the trailer or whatever. Yes the science was mostly preposterous of course but so what. This is like a survival movie and a good story. The effects were good. It's the kind of film where you have to suspend any skepticism and enjoy it for what it is. I give it a 7/10. Watched on Netflix."

The premise of the movie is great and in theory the story was not bad. The issue with it is it seems like this was based on an outline of what the movie was supposed to be, but it never got fully fleshed out. The kids loved the dinosaurs but as dinosaur fans they did not appreciate that the the dinosaurs were all essentially monsters and the bad guys. Of course that's what they are but JP/JW fans are going to root for the dinosaurs.\n\nAdam Driver runs like Harrison Ford, which I realized is kind of funny. :-)"

That's all you're gonna be getting, and some indifferent CGI effects that make this a throwback to that appalling BBC pretend drama WALKING WITH DINOSAURS don't help much either. The story sees Driver's spaceman crash landing on Earth some 65 million years ago, where he finds his ship smashed, a young girl for company, and lots of hungry beasties trying to get their fill of him. There's a lot of action, inevitably, but none of it particularly impresses. I don't mind Driver as an actor but he can do little with his underwritten role here."

I guarantee the critics or rotten tomatoes will bash it but if your a true dinosaur fan or a true sci-fi fan this won't bother you and you know what your getting out of this film. I was very shocked at the on going heart-felt moments of Adam driver in the dad role! (Pedro pascal should be jealous!) The movie has great dinosaur designs I don't understand the knock on them, and they are definitely in the movie for more than 5 minutes!! Haha people are just trying to hate and exaggerate the hate they had I guess. Go watch this popcorn flick the right way. In a theatre!!!"

Some attempts and symbolism were made to draw the parallels, like for example when the girl drew some doodles in the cave wall to signify her mom and dad (family), and how earth developed cities and buildings in the ending time lapse, but they skipped the gradual progression towards it. In most of the movie tries to make you familiar with the suppose environment of Mesozoic Era, and a objective to reach from point A (Crash Site) to point B (Escape Site), which could've been a great video game plot idea, like the video game BulletStorm."

The editing was atrocious, the cinematography was terrible, and the lighting was trash.

The reluctant hero character suits him.\n\nHe is one of the best overall actors and portrayed the grieving father and hopelessness of this situation so well. Ariana Greenblatt was a believable terrified little girl. I'm not familiar with her earlier works but she is a great actress.\n\nI really liked this movie. For a two person main cast and 90 minutes it was all the action it could be. The acting were amazing and the story line interesting. Sad that so many people were expecting a Jurassic Park type and rating it so low based on them not getting what they were expecting and not giving the movie the chance it deserves.

Dinosaurs are cook as they are, why try to change that (jurassic world movies, this one).\n\nIn the beginning the sci fi background kept me pulled in, but towards the second half of the movie that got completely lost.

I finally watched the long awaited movie.\n\nMy favorite things are that Adam Driver is acting in the lead role and maybe the animation of the dinosaurs.\n\n65 is good with the story and the actors. Adam Driver is playing the character Mills and Ariana Greenblatt the character Koa. So Millses ship crashes on an unkown planet. There is only one person who survived (Koa) including Mills. So Mills's and Koa's mission is to get to the ship so they can leave the planet. During the travel they see dinosaurs but Mills has a gun so they fight for their lives.\n\nAnyways the movie is good and it's kind of fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "IN A NUTSHELL: The dramatic story is about an astronaut who crash-lands on a mysterious planet, only to discover he's not alone.\n\nThe film is both written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who also worked together on the film Haunt. The movie was shot in only 40 days! Another thing that's unusual about this movie is that it only had one press screening before its release, less than 24 hours before it was released worldwide!\n\nTHINGS I LIKED: I adore Adam Driver. He'll win an Oscar someday. I really wanted him to win for his performance in the film Marriage Story, but Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserved the Oscar for what he accomplished in the movie Joker. Did you know Adam Driver was a Marine? He gets to use some of his weapons training in this movie.\n\nAriana Greenblatt is such a little treasure and totally adorable. I think I first saw her in Love and Monsters, a movie I really enjoyed and highly recommend for its creativity and humor. She is a great, young actress with a very bright future in Hollywood.\n\nSome of the filming took place in the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana.\n\nKoa is a Hawaiian word used in the movie that means \"warrior.\" There are moments when you feel like you're watching another Jurassic Park movie.\n\nThe title gets its name from the fact that we get to see the earth 65 million years ago.\n\nThe emotional heft is a bit cliched, yet still very effective, reminding us that family is everything.\n\nVery good and believable special effects and CGI.\n\nIn a year slated to be filled with sequels and franchise additions, the fact that this movie is original is one of its strengths.\n\nCritics hate this movie, but I really enjoyed it!\n\nAn interesting element of the film is that the two leads don't speak the same language and have to figure out how to communicate in other ways.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The plot is pretty simple, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.\n\nNot enough dinosaur moments. A few of the dino scenes look like they're straight out of Jurassic Park like when we see T-rex's face slowly emerge from a dramatic waterfall.\n\nI would like to have seen more of Chloe Coleman in the film. She's another young starlet who is fantastic. I loved her in My Spy.\n\nSometimes, it's hard to see what's happening in the dark, cave scenes. They'll be hard to see on small devices if you stream the movie.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS: We see some blood and gore.\n\nSome dinosaurs die brutal, disgusting deaths.\n\nViolence We see some dead bodies.\n\nKids will be excited to see some dinosaurs!\n\nThere are some scary, intense moments that could frighten young children.\n\nPeople in perilous situations.\n\nLots of destruction.\n\n!"

However, not when the movie is boring and this one is, plain and simple. There is nothing interesting - plot is predictible, characters are flat, I don't even remember the music and the shots? Well, let's say some commercials are shot better. And they have characters with more potential, too.\n\nI can't say I enjoyed even one minute of this disaster. And I like sci fi. I like dinosaurs. I like disasters and tragedy. But, for me to truly enjoy it? Let me care for characters. And what do I get? An orphaned girl and a grieving father who bond, which should be great, except they are so characterless it just feels like something the creators decided they needed to do more than what they cared about. It's like somebody was going over a list of what a sci fi, survival dinosaur movie should have and mashed it all together into a movie. Without any thought or reason or even an ounce of real emotion behind it.\n\nThis movie was supposed to be fun instead it was so boring it made me angry enough to write my first review ever. Great achievemnt guys!"

The scares were effective, a lot of the tension was well executed, and I loved how out of the box it all felt. Some interesting uses of tech as well!\n\nIs it a GREAT film? No - it's got its share of problems and I was hoping for some more Dino variety. But otherwise I definitely plan on buying this on Blu-ray!"

Not much of a plot but that didn't really matter in this case. Jumped out of my skin a few times. Its also commendable that someone has made a movie that is only one and a half hours long, deserves to be seen just for that (saved me an hour and a half with which i was able to do a bit of shopping while i was in town). Overall i would say ignore those low reviews, not sure what they were expecting but exceeded my expectations."

The lack of depth in the plot was evident as only two characters were really featured. The movie relied on action and intense interactions between the characters and dangerous creatures to be entertaining, ultimately lacking any depth. The lore was inconsistent and almost laughable at times, as random items seemed to appear when needed and the characters defied the laws of physics multiple times. I am a believer in the idea that movies are meant to entertain and usually shouldn't be taken too seriously, but this movie was quite hard to watch at times and lacked any real substance from a story point of view. Not the worst film ever, but I was disappointed."

A predictable box office disappointment, a total dearth of positive reviews. It seems that we *can* have nice things but they have to be half an hour longer than 65. At least.\n\nLook, I'm not asking for *all* the films to be this short, that would be unreasonable. But also nice. John Wick: Chapter 4 is nearly three hours long and I can't wait to see it. The more John Wick, the better. I hope the next Mission: Impossible film is 18 decades long. But some things clearly do need to shake hands with brevity and this is one of those cases.\n\nThere are those that have questioned why it's so short. We've been so starved of films where we have time to do other things with our days before and after that we're suspicious when something like this comes along. I didn't notice any huge gaps in proceedings here. It tells us what little we need to know and gets on with it. We're here for Adam Driver shooting dinosaurs and bonding with a kid. Proceed.\n\nIt stops off at the moments of expected trauma and character interactions, that much was to be expected. But there are plenty of moments of solid action and danger, nothing at all mindblowing but absolutely enough to make for a good time. Then it just ends and that's the end of that. Thank you very much, that's exactly what I left the flat for. And thank you Adam for gracing something that you're quite clearly too good for, much appreciated."

It just takes every basic trope from every other dinosaur and sci-fi movie and uses them at their most basic effect.\n\nDriver is Mills, an astronaut from a distant planet who agrees on a two year mission to get the funds to save his dying daughter. While in cryogenic sleep, his spacecraft is hit by asteroids and he wakes up just in time to crash land the craft. Everyone else on board dies so he strikes out on his own to find two of escape pods that his onboard computer tells him are still functioning. Along the way, he discovers the sleep pod of another passenger, a young girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt) who speaks a different language so they have to communicate as best they can.\n\nThere are dinosaurs, swamps, and quicksand to fend off. None of this is original and nothing really interesting happens. They just fight off various creatures and go from one danger to another. There is a twist ending that the writers seem to hope no one remembers a certain 1968 movie about astronauts crash landing on a planet.\n\nThe special effects are good, but nothing you haven't seen elsewhere."

I went in expecting an escape from man-eating monsters, but the movie is really about two survivors just trying to go home. The dinosaurs are auxiliary characters. They're animals, the movie treats them like animals, and they behave like animals.

Thankfully, the CGI used for the dinosaurs is a little better, although it's hard not to compare a dinosaur film to Jurassic Park/World. The set design and location are impressive and it adds a lot to the film.\n\nAlthough Adam Driver isn't the best actor in my opinion, he does a good job as the lead and plays well off of promising young actress Ariana Greenblatt who has a mostly non-verbal role.\n\nOne thing that confused me was the fact that the film is meant to be set 65 million years ago, and the main character is from another planet yet conveniently speaks American english and wears 21st century clothing.\n\nOverall, not a bad sci-fi film, but I think it could have been more successful with a larger cast and a less predictable plot and ending."

Those of you rating this garbage more that the 1 star it deserves are part of the problem. Don't encourage them!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had not really heard anything particularly great about this 2023 sci-fi action adventure movie titled \"65\" from writers and directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. Yet, I still opted to sit down and watch it, since I hadn't already seen it, plus I also prefer to form my own opinions on a movie.\n\nWriters Scott Beck and Bryan Woods didn't exactly revolutionize the cinema with this movie. Sure, \"65\" was a watchable movie for what it was, but it was also a very generic movie and a somewhat forgettable movie. If you think \"Lost in Space\" mixed with \"Jurassic Park\", then you essentially have the key formula that made up \"65\".\n\nYeah, \"65\" is the type of movie where you just lean back and sit along for the ride. The movie doesn't really require much participation from the audience. So just sit back, munch on the snack and watch the pretty CGI as Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt make their way through a prehistoric forest full of dinosaurs.\n\nThat was essentially all that the movie had to offer, so you're not exactly in for a cinematic experience of grand caliber when you sit down to watch \"65\". And thus, it is watchable for what it was, and chances are that come next week you will have forgotten all about the movie.\n\nThe movie has a really small cast ensemble. But I will say that the actors and actresses in the movie performed well enough, taking into consideration the severe limitations imposed upon them by a restrictive script.\n\nVisually then this is where \"65\" shines. The CGI effects in the movie are great and look great on the screen. Truth be told, the CGI effects were mainly the reason why the movie stayed afloat.\n\nI managed to sit through \"65\" and was adequately entertained. It wasn't a great movie, and chances are slim to none that I will ever return to watch it a second time.\n\nMy rating of directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods's 2023 movie \"65\" lands on a six out of ten stars."

The movie should have ended when he was going to end it. That would have saved us all an 1hr 15ish (gotta watch the first 8-10 minutes to get there).\n\nR2D2 should have popped out of the swamp and saved the movie, but alas no such luck and it the movie was not saved nor was my night.\n\nMaybe, if you just watch it to figure out how many movies it copies, it might be worth it. ????"

It's like they lacked the ability to write any meaningful dialogue so elected to fill the gaps between the 'action' with some redundant attempts to communicate effectively.\n\nThere's a scene where they get attacked by a pack of some ferocious raptors/trex hybrids and instead of sensing the urgency to flee the area, the girl curls up in a ball afraid while Adam sits patiently for nighttime to fall, thus exposing them even further!!! So so stupid!\n\nDon't get caught out by FOMO, this one is a dud that I watched with my monthly cinema pass, I'd have definitely felt cheated otherwise."

This is a fun campy movie that can distract you from whatever is going on in life and thats exactly what you need sometimes not some big elaborate plot. Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt are both great in this and I enjoyed watching Driver use his Marine training in this film. If you're a fan of monster films this is definitely something you should give a shot and ignore the negativity towards it."

No wasteful dialog, just 2 people trying to find an escape from an alien planet that's inhabited by creatures they have never experienced before.

It is no Jurassic Park films which it really tries to be. About Mills (Adam Driver) a pilot who crashes on earth which happens to be 65 million years ago when dinosaurs roam the planet. Promising concept. The story is thin. It tries to have Mills and a young girl try to search for a rescue pod. The characters are flat which we learn a little about Mills that on his estranged planet he has a daughter that is sick.\n\nThe action sequences are pretty cool. The visual effects are okay and could be worse. The script is thin with its story and characters. Which provides a brief amount of entertainment. But falls flat every where else."

Special effects are decent. Story is pretty basic but that is fine, as it doesn't need to be complex. Kids younger than eight may find it too scary but definitely ten upwards will be fine.

I felt that it was refreshing because there was no \"universe\" that it was a part of, with no expectation, or pressure, to build on, and set up a larger world around it. Just a great idea, simply, but well executed. The music was also an absolute highlight. With so many films feeling so generic when it comes to the music, this was a real treat. You can't go wrong with a good bit of Danny Elfman. I absolutely loved it! The only thing I really wanted was for it to be longer and have more dinosaur set pieces."

While I won't put 65 quite on that film's level, I was again impressed by their creativity and ambition. As preposterous as the story was, it succeeded in creating entertaining situations and earnest relationships. Adam Driver brought depth to the leading role, and both of the child actors understood the material and were up to the task. I'm not sure there was anything more that could've been done given the limitations of their script. Regardless, the directors have repeatedly proven their ability to build suspense, and I'm intrigued to see what project they choose to pursue next."

OK Let's See What This Movie delivers!..So Let's Say The Expectations I had was low as It isn't a Blockbuster Movie and I must Say it Did really exceed That Low expectations.\n\nThe story is Simple And Just a Use of Plot I must Say But It's still interesting The Dinosaurs Who were shown Had Like Messy CGI But Okay I May Speak. The Action Is surely Great and The Cinematography Is Almost On The Par Perfect. THE Sound design And Music Used was decent and The later Dinosaur escape scene is Better Than I Could expect. In The end 65 Is a Different Type of Try in This Era where Dinosaur Movies are Almost Has No existence So I may Say You should Give it a Small Try."

I love the ambient music, great action sequences, Adam Driver being legendary/comforting, and love the space views! I understand the ones that bashed this there's several parts that were cheesy or poor acted otherwise I'd say the pros out way the cons. A thoroughly entertaining action/Sci-Fi the bulk of it the bonding is magnificent and the movie is pretty cool!"

The previews told us what the movie was about and film experience followed thru completely on what the commercials started.\n\nIf I have any criticism it's that the director should have left something out of the promotion. There was only one surprise, but it fell kinda flat.\n\nBut that's it. Otherwise the movies pretty solid. The young actress was nice and I liked the chemistry between her and driver.\n\nTechnically I think this movie is a nice solid 6, but I scored 7 just to balance out the haters."

Seeing Adam Driver skulk through the lands of a pre-dinosaur extinction, while trying to survive, led to a high level of expectation.\n\nUnfortunately what arrived was a chaotic, messy scenario that involved a plot that was so thin, it could have been written during someone's lunch break. Driver, as usual, was very watchable, but even he struggled to save the script and a character who is reeling from his daughter apparently dying of a cough!!!\n\nThe jump scares were poorly timed and utterly predictable and by the end, the only saving grace was the short one hour, thirty minutes run time that avoided me having to complain about having wasted a whole evening watching it."

There was a quite a bit of suspension of disbelief that weren't too bad. The movie is simplistic and has been criticized for it but it executes well and delivers everything that it should.\n\nThe dinosaur designs were mid and music was mid. The dinosaurs weren't the most realistic looking, not only in terms of special effects but also how paleontologists would predict dinosaurs to look. The pg-13 rating held back the brutality that would come along with actual dinosaurs. I think some gore would be not only great spectacle but also reinforce the movie's themes.\n\nThis movie overall is fun pulp sci-fi but I'm not sure if I would revisit it."

The two leads had no Chemistry and at all and it felt like whoever directed this didn't have a clue how to make two likable and interesting characters interact in an entertaining the way.

This movie is not about fighting dinosaurs (although that certainly happens in it) but rather it is about dealing with grief in its many different forms, trying to live another day when the outlook seems too bleak, discovering that you can start over again even when you believed otherwise, and finding hope when you thought there was none. A nice simple movie with some action, slight thrills, and heart warming girl-dad vibes. The sound and score was outstanding."

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't know Sony Pictures is making a prequel to After Earth. They probably should've called this one, Before Earth. The premise was a straight up carbon copy of After Earth. Shot by shot some scenes were so similar to one another. It seems like M. Night Shyamalan's fanbase is quite strong.\n\nJokes aside, what happened to Scott Beck and Bryan Woods? Their writing was stellar in A Quiet Place and Haunt (2019). But in here it was atrocious and deeply flawed beyond repair. One of the most horrendous writing with subpar dialogues devoid of any depth. I hope this movie taught Beck and Woods what to do and don't when it comes to direction. Because I love their work in Haunt and I'm hoping a sequel is in the horizon.\n\nIt's not just a bad movie, it's way worse. A horrible, below amateur level direction and the preposterous editing that looks like it's done by a preschooler. A stupid and unbelievable plot that only works under visionary filmmakers. Forced \"fun\" moments that was one of the huge problems with this movie and probably the main reason it's bombed.\n\nAdam Driver's career worst performance. His monotone performance was hard to watch. None of the other actors (there was only 4 people total in this movie) actually tried to perform well as they hired to do. Chloe Coleman has a bright future ahead of her, she just needed a new acting coach.\n\nThe only decent thing in this movie is that they didn't wasted all that $45 million (original budget was $91 million, the final cost of the film was $45 million after tax rebates). This movie was sure looked expensive but the VFX was sometimes noticeably poorly done."

The little girl is ok-ish, but somehow I did not get any chemistry between the two characters. The action sequences are fine, graphics are fine, dinosaurs are literally taken from Jurassic Park :) The one gripe I have is that for an alien civilization, the tech, clothing, medicine ALL is 1-1 to earth in 2023. Makes the whole premise a bit unrealistic.\n\nAll in all, a mediocre movie, good for a lazy Saturday at-home, where you can watch the movie for free. Don't spend any money on this."

The movie does not create any sense of tension or suspense, as the audience can easily predict what will happen next.\n\nThe movie is a disappointment for fans of Adam Driver, who deserves better material than this.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film thought it was good, but the end result wasn't.\n\nOn paper the 'what if someone was on earth when the asteroid hit and wiped out the dinosaurs\" seemed like a winner, until they made a shortish film about it and kinda just left it at that.\n\nThere really wasn't much more to the movie than that short idea, and, because they don't rate the audience intelligence for much, at the 17 minute mark they specifically say \"it's 65 million years ago and this is planet earth\" in bold letters on the screen, just incase you thought it was some other alien world and modern or future times and you missed the premise signaled by the trailer and the movie title.\n\nIt starts off on a mysterious 'other' civilised world called 'Somaris' where they've got a nice multiracial couple who are absolutely identical to modern day humans right down to the hair styles, eyebrows and teeth and have knitted tops with sewn sleeves , and form fitting t-shirts (just like at GAP),- they didn't even try to imagine people different from upper middle class 2020 Americans even though they clearly state in the opening it's a foreign world, then they outline that they've got a sick daughter and health insurance problem, and he has to work to pay off her medical bills, ......\n\nThen he's doing a 2 year space mission, at sub light speed apparently, cos an asteroid can hit the ship and not destroy it, and it's earth, so did these people even watch a youtube video on space travel before they cobbled this mess together? He's the pilot and he's sleeping on a bunk bed with a nice pillow, traveling slower than light speed but close to earth (the nearest system Proxima Centuri is 4.2 light years away from earth),........ they really set the tone for this intelligence insulting film.\n\nIt was pretty much a small crew and cast 'covid period' movie which didn't have to be a bad thing but the 2 main cast characters didn't speak the same language so witty and insightful dialog was off the menu and it was left to clever plot and set ups, which, never showed up.\n\nAdd in a bunch of boring cliche tropes (medical emergency fixed with a spray, giant headed dinosaurs sneaking up on them regularly, spooky cave, cliff, quicksand!!!!!!) to pad it out till the big rock hits, and then when the rock hits they didn't really do anything with it, where was the big 'splash' of earth bits that allegedly went half way to the moon? Anything except the standard fireballs raining down would have been good.\n\nOn paper an interesting idea but they didn't do anything with it except write it down a couple of times and pack it with the minimum number of tired and worn out movie tropes we've already seen in Jurassic park and other space movies.\n\nI hope the 'continuing education' teacher who graded this gave it the d minus it deserved."

        "review_detailed_main": "With a strong pedigreed list including Columbia Pictures as part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, BRON Creative, Beck/Woods (as the Writer/Director team here from the breakout series \"A Quiet Place\") AND the Sam Raimi... whew... the production quality is top notch. This includes the sound, storyline, AND get this!... the CGI too.\n\nHere's my 2-sentence review:\n\n\"When you're at the bottom of the food chain, regardless of size, it's you, your technology, and your quick thinking; or else.\"\n\nAND\n\n\"Life goes on, with or without you... be that here, there, or anywhere.\n\n. .\n\n*** NO SPOILERS BELOW. SAFE READING *** .\n\n. Billed as a crash on a planet millions of years in the past, and all the challenges that situation would bring, 65 delivers on the premise.\n\nWe discover along the way that on mother's natures food chain, back then we would have certainly been at the bottom. Sprinkle in a few lighter moments, even laughable, the only thing the movie really misses on is a bit of believability. That and the important intro title screens, but more on that in a moment.\n\nAs we've all learned what to expect from the Jurassic pictures over the years, and here 65 stays true to the genre. Add in a space twist, the typical sense of urgency, and a bit of injured-hero action, we see the formula well followed without adding to many additional ingredients.\n\nOverall Ratings: We were both in as a B- (yet I bumped mine up to a Solid B based on the mix of genres I like, and the production quality that real big screen movies should have.)\n\nThe 65 movie isn't a late night catch-it-at-home situation. Here, the sound and size is worthy of the big screen.\n\nHot Take: Speaking of production, don't miss the first few minutes and pay attention to the on-screen subtexts, as they completely set the stage for the background setup, and the who/what/why Adam Driver's character \"Mills\" is doing there out in space in the first place. Miss the titles and subtext, as you might as the titles are way to small and undersold for the importance they provide in the setup, you'll be a bit behind.\n\nKudos for pulling off the movie with only 4 actors in the entire film, 2 of which carry the majority. AND for the decision to integrate the in-credit scenes subtly at the beginning of end credits, not forcing us to sit and wait akin to the MCU spin on credit scenes. They were welcomed and reinforced the overall life-goes-on concept for sure.\n\nAs \"65\" started the weekend early on a Thursday, carve out a break for you and the family, yes family (you'll understand once you see the movie) and enjoy the show!"

Also l can say that Adam Driver did a pretty good job.. So, l would say don't be fooled by the rating, if you like survival movies, if you enjoyed watching Jurassic park series or King Kong Skull Island, you can give it a try.

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched this despite the low scores and was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any awards for dialogue or originality, but it's far from a brainless action movie, either. The 'story' is a very quick setup for a survival film in which the hero and a young girl must stay alive while trying to reach their goal. There are all the usual tropes of plans that fail and plans that work, a surrogate father-daughter relationship, and a lot that is owed to Jurassic Park - as I said, it's not a completely original idea. But with no bad language to speak of and only relatively mild survival horror, this is a film you can watch with older kids who won't compare it to every other sci-fi that has gone before it. I'd probably rate it somewhere between a very solid 6 and 7, but I'm giving it 7 here because really, the low scores here are hugely unfair."

        "review_detailed_main": "The \"65\" (2023) is a sci-fi movie directed and written by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. The pilot Mills (Adam Driver) crashes on a strange planet. He is stuck on an Earth from 65 million years ago. Now, Mills and the only other survivor, Koa (Ariana Greenblatt), have to explore the unknown place full of dangerous dinosaur-like creatures, with only one chance to survive.\n\nAt its core, \"65\" is a complex narrative about survival on one hand. It revolves around two characters struggling to survive on a planet inhabited by dinosaur-like creatures. The tension between the characters adds somewhat depth to the plot, as their dialogue changes from not trusting each other to possibly working together. The movie cleverly introduces a plot twist in their interactions, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nHowever, even though the visual storytelling is complex, the story itself sometimes feels empty and leaves the viewer wanting more, but I felt there was something specific behind this story but it was not there yet. The story would have been better if the characters' would have been better developed because this is what lacked, e.g., feelings could have been even more explored and developed.\n\nThe movie looks and sounds great, but it lacked emotional depth but later in the movie it progressed. The first 30 minutes are mostly about exploring and can be a bit boring, but they do create some kind of atmosphere.\n\n\"65\" (2023) is a visually stunning sci-fi and survival story that is very interesting to watch. The most impressive thing about the movie is its score Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman, which is not only beautiful but also goes well with watching it. The soundtrack has both electronic and orchestral elements, and it really captures the tense and intriguing feeling of the film. In terms of sound effects, it has ticking sounds, deep bass effects, and different synth tones that make the sound experience just as unique as the visual one.\n\nThe CGI depiction is actually very good. It stands out because of the realistic element settings and the actual CG. The movie's environments look like they are from 65 million years ago which is the base of this story. Moreover, the CGI space creates an amazing background for the story. The film's great camera work and great transitions.\n\nThe film unfolds at its own pace, which is mostly effective, though some may find the slower moments less engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, the film \"65\" is not a waste of time per se. It demonstrates strong audio-visual execution and an original concept. However, it may be advantageous for the film to incorporate more character development and narrative clarity and more complexity. The film stands out in the sci-fi genre due to its skillful utilization of sound and visuals."

It had crazy premise that could have worked but in case of 65 - a highly predictable survivor story set, well 65 million years, it crashed and burned like asteroid that hit the earth all those years ago. If you set up aliens that visit earth on the same day as asteroid dropped, one should make those aliens feel different. And yet here they you casual movie John and girl that needs to be saved but usually saves our main hero with things like stabbing a T red with a piece of wood. Dialogs were predictable and pacing is bad - at running time just 1 h 30 min I was constantly watching at the remaining run time.\n\nOverall, 65 is a shallow and generic and predictable TV movie made for some science fiction channel. It's boring and does not worth you precious time."

This was not, maybe, a $100m film, but it was well written, well acted, fast paced, tense and very realistic. I gave it 7 stars but maybe would have more honestly given it a 6 if the reviews I'd read had given me a more realistic view. It has a good, non-stop action vibe to it which more than compensates for the fact that the main character, Adam Driver, often doesn't appear to have a clue. There are some unlikely moves such as him telling the girl to run when a dinosaur is attacking rather than keeping her close behind him, or sequences where he appears to outrun a T-Rex. But overall it's a good film, not the best, but good enough to spend an hour and a half on."

As with most sci fi movies that is a huge part of the appeal of these sort of films. Unfortunately many fail to deliver a compelling script to really engage you in the story onscreen. This one is no different. The fact that two of the main characters we are forced to watch can barely understand each other makes for underwhelming conversation. So the dialogue is weak.

And fast.\n\nHe is too good for this type of sci-fi silliness, and manages to lift the material from mediocre into watchable. Driver is stuck on a mysterious planet after his ship is hit by asteroids, and must find a way to escape before being eaten or incinerated.\n\nBarbie's Ariana Greenblatt proves highly serviceable as his sidekick survivor, as the duo escape one scrape after another in a sometimes lazy Aliens/Jurassic Park/The Martian template.

While the concept promises an intense 'Prey' or 'Predator' dynamic between a lone human and dinosaurs, the storyline instead focuses on Mills' attempt to establish a human connection with his daughter and surrogate daughter, Koa.\n\nDespite commendable cinematography, shot predominantly in the lush landscapes of Oregon and the swamps of Louisiana, the film's pacing falters, with extended periods lacking significant plot development. The limited dinosaur sightings in the initial 45 minutes may leave audiences expecting more action from a film of this genre.\n\nAdam Driver delivers a solid performance, albeit hindered by the absence of substantial co-stars. The inclusion of a young child speaking a foreign language as his primary companion may not have fully showcased Driver's acting prowess.\n\nWhile the second half introduces more dinosaur interactions, it falls short of redeeming the overall viewing experience. The film's climax, though visually striking, ventures into the realm of the absurd, leaving audiences with mixed feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, '65' struggles to balance its ambitious themes with effective storytelling. Despite moments of tension and some visually captivating scenes, the film ultimately fails to capitalize on its potential, making it less likely to warrant a rewatch. While Adam Driver's performance adds a commendable touch, the narrative choices and pacing hinder the film from achieving its intended impact.\""

There isn't much story beyond \"We have to go from Point A to Point B to get macguffin. Oh no! Nature! Oh no! Dinosaurs! Oh no! Nature again! Oh no! More dinosaurs!\" From a technical standpoint it's competently made.\n\nThe action isn't bad, but since there are only two characters and it's rated PG-13, you never get the sense that anyone is ever in real danger. The foreshadowing is obvious, there are many many holes in the plot and logic, but at the end of the day it's a film about Adam Driver running around shooting dinosaurs. Set your expectations accordingly. I'm simply grateful they didn't have the audacity to slap 'Turok: Dinosaur Hunter' on the poster.\n\nI can't recommend '65', but if there's nothing else on and you're really bored then you may as well watch Adam Driver shoot dinosaurs in the jungle. It's probably a good background movie."

The connection they're supposed to have, nope, no chemistry, not viable in terms of the story.\n\nThe plot points that supposedly delayed their plan and made them \"race even more against time\" were contrived and stupid.

During the journey, his spaceship, the Zoic, is hit by a mass of asteroids and later on, the astronaut crash lands on a mysterious planet only to discover he's not alone. After the catastrophic crash, pilot Mills quickly discovers he's actually stranded on an unknown planet. Now, with only one chance at rescue, Mills must make his way across an unknown terrain riddled with dangerous prehistoric creatures in an epic fight to survive. All the passengers were in a Cryogenic induced sleep and Mills was the only being awake as the pilot of the ship. Million years ago prehistoric earth had a visitor !. 65 million years ago prehistoric earth had a visitor !.\n\nFrom the writers of A Quiet Place comes 65, a sci-fi thriller produced by Sam Raimi, Deborah Liebling, Zainab Azizi, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. \"65(2023)\u00a8results to be a good mix of clich\u00e9s and influences from classic science fiction and monster movies; a movie to watch with popcorn that, although it's not as exciting as it claims to be, has its moments. Here Adam Driver has to survive a trip through space and crashing with his ship in a hostile territory full of dangerous prehistoric creatures in this epic fight that mixes suspense with science fiction. Adam Driver is quite good as the hero who, after a catastrophic air-space accident in a seemingly unknown planet, has to deal with all kinds of stone-historical animals. Now he has only one chance to escape and his only companion, a girl, whom he saves but he is also saved by her. Adam Driver is accompanied by a young cast, such as Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie, Stuck in the middle) and Chloe Coleman (Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves)\n\nIt contains colorful though dark cinematography by prestigious cameraman Salvatore Tonino and the camera often assumes a pointedly aggressive stance. As well as thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman . Scott Beck and Bryan Woods ( Boogeyman, The quiet place, The quiet place 2, Nightlight, 45), direct professionally this adventurous survival story survival story full of action, chills and chases througouts a dangerous and really risked environment. Rating: 6.5/10. The flick will appeal to action/adventure/terror enthusiasts, as well as adam Driver fans. It is entertaining enough despite the fact that creativity seems to have remained anchored in a distant cinematic past, either because it copies other films and mixes various cinematic genres."

The dinos look like monsters, act like monsters, and the movie doesn't skip an opportunity to make you jump out of your skin.\n\nHuge movie buffs probably won't enjoy this, your average movie goer definitley will.

I did think Adam Driver's character was gonna take her in, or that a passenger did survive & it was one of the little girl's parents (mother) like a \"You're not alone\" type film. But I guess not, to a degree. It was a bit confusing with Homosapiens already existing & not even from Earth or whatever. But it was cool."

Turn your brain off, enjoy a movie for what it is and relax. Too many reviews bombing half decent entertainment and killing the joy of cinema!\n\nCast is decent, no nonsense approach and it's entertaining!? Some good suspense, dinosaurs are fun and action scenes are great. Really liked the costume design and weapons too! Plot was direct and you know what's gonna happen before it happens making it easy to watch. I personally enjoyed the dinosaurs! It's nice to see some actual threat from prehistoric creatures and not the wishy washy crap that's been in every Jurassic Park film since the Indominus/Raptor Vs Special Forces scene in Jurassic World!\n\nIt's a movie. It's not gonna win Oscar's, but it entertains! It's a type of movie you let your mates in a group chat know that it's decent and worth watching instead of scrolling Netflix or such like for hours on end to rewatch something you've seen a million times before.\n\nHope whoever reads this enjoys it for what it's worth and doesn't take it too serious."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reading other peoples' reviews make me very nervous for the human race, and just the process of thought, in general. This movie has a backdrop of science fiction, space travel, possibly time travel, and Jurassic Park action. It is all a side show. This movie is about 1 thing, and 2 people, Mills and Koa. It is a character piece/study on tragedy/survival/recovery. Both main characters are recovering from life-altering tragedies, one just doesn't know it yet. Mills knows about his and is devastated with the death of his daughter, presumably light years away, yet perseveres. Koa doesn't know the fate of her parents yet, even though she is still devastated/confused by the crash and current circumstances. She learns to trust Mills (also her only option) to help her. In the manner of strangers/distrust, it is awkward at first. But they help each other, save each other, grow to trust each other and eventually love each other as father and daughter, each filling the piece in which they have lost. The Sci-Fi and action are fun and entertaining. I also assume the nerds/Sci-Fi buffs will poke holes at the \"aliens\" being human and being able to breathe our atmosphere. Which is a giggle fest. In this movie, this was likely \"Mankinds\" first touch of earth. As you noticed, no cave men to be seen. They likely left behind a lot of cells, blood, tissue and DNA which the humans as we now know, formed out of over the millennias. It isn't meant to be a perfect action or sci-fi film, because it isn't either of those at all. It is a personal character study of two beings that were thrust into an unenviable position. They found each other, helped each other, saved each other, and became family. The action, Sci-Fi and dinosaurs were just so the average Joe would watch the film, bait, if you will. A beautiful character piece to me. I thought it was wonderful. I could watch multiple times over again. Very well made, I thought."

Panting out of fear. \"I'm about to die\" panting. \"I've been rescured and I'm not dead\" panting.\n\nI think I'd had enough of his panting a quarter way through this film.\n\nOther than the deep breathing issue, the story is slow, many events pointless, nothing kept me interested.\n\nGiven teh weakness of the story, I'm not sure less heavy breathing by Adam would have made it a good film, but it would have been a lot less bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "First, please excuse me while I express a highly sarcastic observation. I'm sooooo excited by the number of 1/10 reviews this and other movies get on IMDB. With so, so many people out there with such better ideas, talent in story writing, original new world creating, character development, cgi skills, acting abilities, directorial & editing brilliance etc.... just imagine how amazing the movies we will be watching will be, when these people start making there own movies \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17.\n\nOn to the movie. I really enjoyed it. Jurassic Park meets Pitch Black, with a sprinkling of Aliens. I'm not saying that it was as good as any of those movies, but to be fair, this is obviously because I've already been exposed to those movie's ideas.\n\nI liked the movie's world tech. Cool space ship, gadgets & weapons.\n\nI liked the dinosaurs, insects, plant life and the overall grand visual representation of the 65 million year old earth environment.\n\nI liked Adam Driver's slightly flawed character, due to his experiences, learning to care and fight again for the girl.\n\nI liked the girl character for lots of reasons. Not the least of which was that her character when needed, displayed the best kick arse bravery since.... well.... Kick-Ass (2010).\n\nI liked the developing relationship between the two main protagonists. Both having suffered great loss, but learning to trust, care for, protect and fight for each other.\n\nAnd to close, to the many reviewers that ridiculed the idea that Adam Driver's alien humanoid character would speak English, you're correct. That's implausible. But would it have been more enjoyable to watch if we spent the whole movie reading subtitles whilst listening to one character saying, \"Be bop bop zamin shaltze herbo\", and the response being \"Zip doddle zap wap nolen\". ??????. It's a movie device used to make the movie watchable. As the audience, we aren't supposed to think Driver's character is speaking our language.\n\nFrom \"Captain Obvious\". \ud83d\ude44."

        "review_detailed_main": "After a catastrophic crash on an unknown planet, pilot Mills quickly discovers he's actually stranded on Earth - 65 million years ago. Now, with only one chance at a rescue, Mills and the only other survivor, Koa, must make their way across an unknown terrain riddled with dangerous prehistoric creatures.\n\nThe idea of 65 is an intriguing concept: what would happen if an advanced civilization crashed landed on early 65 million years ago and had to survive amongst the dinosaurs? A thesis like that could only go one of two ways: a deep dive into the analysis of the superiority of technology and how it could've changed our entire trajectory as a species or an underbaked story that says let's shoot dinosaurs with plasma rifles. As cool as that sounds, the cool doesn't translate to 65, a movie about crashed space pilot Mills and fellow crash survivor Koa as they navigate the treacherous lands of the cretaceous period to reach their escape pod and rendezvous with their rescue. The front half of the movie is bland and lifeless, with Mills' motivation to raise money to help save his daughter from an unexplained (to the viewer) disease being his driving factor. Unfortunately, the five minute setup we get with Mills and his daughter doesn't do nearly enough to buy into a man desperate to get back to the people he loves (see: Interstellar for this storyline done well). For her part, Koa, wanting to reunited with her own family, joins Mills in the worst version of Lone Wolf and Cub to date. It's not until the introduction of a ticking clock that gives the movie any sort of life; the film's pace picks up considerably, ramping from lifeless to something resembling life support. Somewhere in here is a good idea attempting to escape, but any sparks of life are snuffed out by subpar writing, feeble direction, and subpar acting.\n\nStarring Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt, the entirety of the film depends on them. With the exception of the opening scene, they're the only human characters in the movie and thusly the audience's gateway into the story. With Driver being the older, more established actor, most of the attention is owed to him and sadly here the proven talented actor is not up to task. While some credit for his weak performance must be attributed to such a trite script, Driver seems wholly uninterested in attempting his best on screen. Ariana Greenblatt is doing the best she can with her material; still only 15 years old, she has plenty of time to sharpen her skills and display her abilities in projects with more promise. The two together possess almost no chemistry; the attempts at bonding through humor fall flat and they spend almost as much time apart from one another as they do together on the screen. Had there been a more honest approach to the characters and more attention paid to the relationship between the two, the project as a whole could only have been better.\n\nDeveloped by the writing/directing duo Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, 65 marks their largest film to date. Best known for their work on the script for the 2018 smash hit A Quiet Place, 65 may make audiences wonder how much of that success was Beck and Woods and how much of it was director John Krasinski. 65's stagnant script, halfhearted attempts at bonding the story's odd couple, and dodgy effects prove that the pair have a ways to go in developing their skills. With the exception of one incredibly well done scene with a giant Theropod, the movie lacks any sort of palpable suspense or real sense of danger. Thanks to both Adam Driver's bland acting and the duo's dull direction, any tense situation the characters find themselves in may lead to a sense of apathy from moviegoers; there's nothing in the film that makes them connect with Mills and Koa.\n\nOverall, 65 is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. While the premise has a bit of interest to it, the writing and execution of said premise leave plenty to be desired. Adam Driver seems to almost be just going through the motions, turning in one of his weakest performances to date. Uninspired direction, shoddy visual effects, and subpar acting make this not one of the worst offerings of the year, but pretty damn close. A poor excuse for a reason to put dinosaurs and laser guns in the same setting, 65 feels like only 65 minutes were spent developing this film."

Adam Driver and the young girls-his daughter and the only other survivor do a great job here of putting emotional punch into basically a survival story. I do think it was much better than the big budget Jurassic franchise because it was grounded in emotion. A father wanting to look after his children.

It was a good story for a good story's sake.\n\nYes, it had flaws. There was some shaky dialogue scenes, that felt stilted. Some character development moments were not exactly timed right etc.\n\nYet, both protagonist carry the story very well. And you can tell it is written by the same writers as A QUIET PLACE, because the suspense is layered and nuanced. There is a strong theme of family and powerful scenes of grief and growth.\n\nThis is a very well done film, even considering it's flaws. But, sadly, in today's day and age, I doubt that it will get the credit it deserves. Go watch it."

I enjoyed it through its entirety.\n\nThe tech that space-adventurer Adam Driver uses is very cool. The violence is visceral. The pain seems real. And the emotions are high.\n\nAdam Driver is an excellent actor. I've never disliked him in anything he's done. Not to say that everything he's done is a masterpiece. But he has been excellent in everything he's been in. Does that make sense?\n\nWatch 65 when you're in the mood for a fun movie you don't have to think too hard about."

It was tantalizing thinking about such an event happening here so long ago, with such strong personalities and spirt only to lose evidence of it due to the dinosaur killing asteroid which \"coincidentally\" hit near their crash location.\n\nI love the vibe and feel this give me thinking about their escape and return trip and how all this happened so long before humans came to be and how those strong personalities and their friendship and the love for family are all gone now but existed then.\n\nMany things to critique in this film but I choose to focus on what I liked."

There's also a mysterious girl called Koa that joins him on the adventure. I would have liked to see more dinosaur action but the design of the ones we saw were good and CGI was not bad at all. Mills little gadgets like the little exploading balls and his gun I like to. The spacesuit was not my favourite but still a pretty good scify movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Didn't initially have much interest in seeing \"65\" but I ended up being stranded in a city with a couple of hours to kill, so I thought I'd take it in. I don't regret seeing it, it's fine, but I can't imagine that I'm going to remember much about it in a few months' time.\n\nTrying to earn money for his daughter's operation Mills (Adam Driver) agrees to a long-haul space mission, transporting passengers. The ship collides into an unexpected meteor shower and crashes on Earth, breaking up and killing all the passengers save for Mills and a young girl, Koa (Ariana Greenblatt). They try and make it a few miles, to the element of the ship that contains the escape pod, but they've crash landed on Earth 65 million years ago, and the hostile landscape and fearsome creatures form a dangerous impediment.\n\nSo, there are positives to it. Visually it's really quite good, for what I can't imagine wasn't an absolutely massive budget. The visually effects of both the creatures and the backgrounds are impressive. Adam Driver is always watchable, and he carries the film well with only Greenblatt to work with (aside from some scenes with his family at the start).\n\nIt's just not that particularly interesting a story though. It's almost as if they weren't entirely sure how much of a \"B-Movie\" they were making, so there isn't quite enough fun, dumb action. Again, it's not bad, there are no elements that you can point to and say, they did a particularly good or bad job, everything is fine, but forgettable."

Also maybe more pre-lauch content, perhaps flashbacks of Koa and her family too.\n\nDo they test all movies with audiences before release? Do people not have constructive opinions enough to prevent films from being released in this type of lack luster unfinished state? IDK maybe its just me and I'm being too critical.

This is a film about survival and the human will and spirit to survive against all odds.\n\nThe two lead actors were absolutely superb. Watching the growing father-daughter type relationship develop was truly moving.

When those interactions did occur they were over before you knew it. This film barely had any action, weak character development and minimal dialogue.\n\nAdam Driver should have been given so much more material considering he is a great actor. Instead he is given a weak father figure role that did not work in the slightest.\n\nThis is the second film(Dungeons and Dragon) in which Chloe Coleman plays a daughter and is not convincing in the role.\n\nArian Greenblatt's character should have been allowed to speak English because she was more annoying than anything. The fact her character was made to speak a different language than that of Adam Driver was pointless.\n\nThe few weapons and gadgets that were shown were okay. But as previously mentioned this film did not deliver on anything it promised. There should have been dozens of weapons and gadgets with cool futuristic abilities.

The writer-director duo of Scott Beck & Bryan Woods (who co-wrote A Quiet Place) should be knowing better, when it comes to establishing connectivity between the film's protagonists and the viewers.

Some say it is unengaging, boring, etc... but yet with no details to why.\n\nThis film has a very solid story, simple but solid. It has an emotional element, again a typical one, but one that is relatable and acted out to perfection by Driver as well as the young girl. This sets the film to be more than just mindless CGI action, but with great values and lessons.\n\nThe CGI is also on par with some of the other great films. The dinosaurs were realistic, don't look rubbery or fake. I would say they were as good as Jurassic Park series. There are also great scenery shots, beautiful shots.\n\nSo what exactly is the problem? It is a good solid film to watch with friends or family on a Saturday night. You will not be disappointed.\n\n7/10, but upping it to an 8 for balance."

The kid exists in this story only to give Driver a Last Action Hero role. It's all so cheap and cheesy and not entertaining in the least. The cinematography is good.

It stars Adam Driver from Star Wars: The force Awakens, Ariana Greenblatt, Chloe Coleman, Nika King from Euphoria, and Brian Dare.\n\nMills (Adam Driver), is an alien, who leads an expedition into deep space, unfortunately they crash land due to an asteroid. Besides Mills, the only other survivor is Koa (Ariana Greenblatt). Together they have to get to the escape pod on the ship, all while trying to avoid the dinosaurs and the asteroid headed towards the planet.\n\nDriver, a loving dad, goes on this expedition in order to pay for his daughter's treatment. Greenblatt portrays someone who wants to get back to her family. Sadly for her, her parents died in the crash. Even though they don't speak the same language, they find a way to communicate. Mills and Koa communicate with the little English she knows, and Mills pointing out where they need to go to survive.\n\nEven though Mills and Koa bond during the movie, the lack of dinosaurs was disappointing. The Jurassic Park films have an entire park with numerous dinosaurs, who will try and eat you. Where 65 only has a couple dinosaurs, who never really do anything exciting. 65 isn't as good as Jurassic Park, but the characters make it interesting enough to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't understand the negative reviews. It probably has more to do with the way the movie was advertised, verses the actual movie itself. I was expecting some kind of Adam and Eve story with a crashed ship on earth, which this is not.\n\nThe effects are well done and not over the top. The landscapes and environment were believable. The actors played their parts well and managed to evoke emotion and communicate even though they couldn't speak the same language. No overly dramatic or wooden acting.\n\nThe story could have been fleshed out slightly better. The family background was pieced together late in the story and creates some confusion regarding the amount of time that has passed from the movie opening to the ship crashing (spoiler: it's not the same mission they are talking about in the beginning. It's some time later). It seems to be something even a lot of reviewers missed.\n\nThe movie does a great job of lulling you into a sense of calm and then ratcheting up the anxiety and pace with the dinosaurs and other dangers. It has an edge of your seat quality, including the occasional jump scare.\n\nAll in all, it was an entertaining movie. Don't overthink it or expect any Oscar nods. I enjoyed it, was never bored and didn't leave the theater regretting the lost money or time. My kids enjoyed it as well.......with my youngest watching through his fingers from the suspense."

And these two characters do not speak the same language, so there is not a whole lot of dialog. I wouldn't be surprised if the entire screen play fit on a few pages of paper. The simple plot involves the two characters traveling 15 kilometers to get to the escape pod part of their crashed ship. And to add to all that, \"65\" is short; about an hour and a half.\n\nIf you know that going in, \"65\" can still be an enjoyable ride as a suspenseful dinosaur movie. I recommend a good sound system because low bass effects are used a lot; particularly with the rifle. I loved the rifle and how Mills uses controlled single shots to take out oncoming monsters. In nearly every other dinosaur movie, characters will wildly shoot from the hip in full automatic, screaming at the top of their lungs, and then there is zero effect from all that fire power. That always frustrated me.\n\nSo, if you just want to be entertained with some dinosaur action, get some popcorn and have a good time."

I saw the trailer, figured out the meaning of the title, and was expecting to watch The Grey but with dinosaurs.\n\nThat didn't happen.\n\nThe dinosaurs are incredibly unconvincing. They're rubbery shrinkwrapped monsters with very mediocre vocalizations. Very little effort was made to make them even resemble actual dinosaurs: they act like rubbery alien monsters who can suspend the laws of physics in order to act scary, though the frequent mismatch in size and strength of the dinosaurs makes it difficult to feel intimidated by them-it's too absurd to see what should be (and certainly looks no more than) a thirty-pound theropod act like it's over a hundred pounds.\n\nIf the film were otherwise entertaining, the complete lack of attention given to the dinosaurs would be forgiveable. However, the plot is barebones and the action scenes are quite obviously dependent on the dinosaurs, so the inaccuracies and absurdities drag the movie even further down than if it were just set on some random alien planet."

It feels a bit flat though. Possibly because of the two-actor play. Overall its like Outlander (2008). The title \"65\" is an eluding and misleading number though - the creature anatomy deviates from known paleontology. The story development is reasonably well: From A to B with as many scary moments as can be fit into the timeframe. Overall, 65 is a well-made and entertaining film that is sure to please fans of sci-fi thrillers. It is a film that will leave you thinking about the nature of survival and the importance of hope. So, have fun with phantasy."

Thankfully that simplicity was not stretched to epic 120 minute length, thus the tension is kept high, with only few flaws in between.\n\nSecond, the typical horror stereotypes are avoided, you know the kind of flicks where you have maybe six survivors and then they are killed one by one, usually you can predict who is next. No waste of superfluous characters here.\n\nThird, they always warn actors not to play along a child co-star, because either she steals all the attention from you, or she is annoying and ruins the movie. But neither has happened here, the action is well balanced and gives Adam Driver enough opportunity to shine. The back story about his daughter also explains why he feels so protective.\n\nAgreed, the movie has its weaknesses too, and you wonder why the two haven't been killed at least 5 times, but altogether it was very entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "Besides Adam Driver's face and remarkably good CGI this is quite annoyoing piece of crap. And I kinda knew that from first seconds of the movie which are accompanied by a cheap, pseudo-emotional music score (btw, the music is ALL OVER this flick and its character reminds amateur attempts at scoring computer games to sound 'like movies'). Generally speaking it is composed out of cliches, borrows quite a lot of shots from Jurrasic Park (staging, visual storytelling, visual suspense), but lacks the narrative substance of Spielberg's classic. And those borrowed shots feel 'pinned-down' on the story, like on the corck board - they not fit INTO the story, they seem forced ON TOP of it. And the reason for that could lay in the fact that there's no real character developement here, no mystery in the plot (in terms of the action, and psychologicaly in the area of both protagonists' dynamic), no immersive exposition. We just observe some people doing some stuff. No real life in those characters. At all. It feels like a commercial rather then a movie.\n\nAlso editing feels a bit apparent and forced - like there were some reedits done, maybe some cut-outs, or producer's intervention driven by the 'sell-better' factor? Or like there was no vision for the movie's rythm? Don't know, but it feels off. Lots of times.\n\nAnd what's a bit sad that all that could have been done better, I suppose. The premise of the story, its basic core concept - even with this bit cheesy tear-erupting father-daughter relation - seems legit as for a good sci-fi movie, seems doable more elegantly.\n\nBottom line: boring, predictable, annoyingly commercial-like emotional soap opera with dinosaurs and Adam Driver."

Character development takes place during the story rather than spending unnecessary time setting up side characters and a complex world. Thankful that there are still movies that can easily manage a 90 minute run time and feel complete.\n\nIt's a shame that the story is so boring and generic, - it doesn't really hold up to similar movies that have come before it, despite its superior execution."

I.e. More of a back story.

What? You were expecting one t-rex? No worries. We'll give you two and called it a better movie than Jurassic Park. (It's not.)\n\nAdam Driver makes an effort, but because of the context of the script, he barely gets to act. I never thought of him like a one-man-show, so from my perspective he's no Will Smith in \"I Am Legend\".\n\nAriana Greenblatt (the little girl) was decent, but in some ways I felt they could've done more with her. Being upset, refusing to walk, and to communicate in a crisis like that it's not how a 9-year-old behaves.\n\nMoreover the chemistry between the actors was nonexistent. They weren't able to make me feel anything.\n\nFinally, at the end, I haven't felt like I learned something or enjoyed myself in the process. Honestly, I suspect the script was entirely written by AI.\n\nWould I recommend it? Heck, no. I lost my time. Why should you lose yours?"

To top it off, the writers/producers then felt the need to invent new dinosaurs because...you know...actual dinosaurs I guess aren't cool enough?

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie convinced me diver's only ability is to sit in one spot and use his voice for scary monologues. This movie feels like a weekend project while he had a day off a disney set.\n\nThe title is so cryptic. So cool. So edgy. So new world. So tiktok. 65. Just 65. Eh ok. What is behind it? 65 minutes of your life you will never get back. I think the movie is a troll and somebody out there is laughing at anyone who watched even a minute of this.\n\nCheesy family backstory scene, diver going on some space mission, hypersleep, stuff goes wrong, he wakes up, crash lands, his crew dead alright. It's not original; it is just how badly it is done that is the issue here. Then he goes to basically copy will smiths movie AFTER EARTH which by comparison actually had effort, acting and chemistry in it. This has none. That is correct, everything you hated about AFTER EARTH is here on steroids and cocaine. And jacked up through a collider for extra failure. Amazing!\n\nMoving on, he lands on this dinosaur infested planet and all dinosaurs just want to go and kill him because that's what reptiles apparently do in every movie ever... The he finds a girl (full grown teenager) who apparently crash landed there in the same way he did and they conveniently run into each other right away because it is a very small planet and everybody crash lands there all the time. Just your average galactic crash land pit stop place you know.. yeah.\n\nThe rest of the movie is him trying to be a father while dreaming (im not making this up) this girl is his own daughter as he tries to protect her from evil reptiles. Driver jumps off trees, rolls in the mud, goes gi joe on lizards and generally loses fights to nature by slipping and rolling down hills a few times since as i said earlier, he has difficulty with moving from a single spot. It confuses him. And he is such a man he has to carry basically an adult while nothing is wrong with her (while he is beat up worse than rambo in a vietnam mud pit) because she is just so tired.. she probably read the script and checked out midway herself. Cannot blame her.. We get it, he is superdad but that's not his daughter (irl or in the movie) so it's just a little cringe. Especially when you have this teenager written in the movie that is completely useless in every aspect. She is there to just keep him busy and show the public how much of a superdad he is as he flashes back to his own kid on that other planet he left behind before the mission. Imagine dicaprio getting a useless sidekick in the REVENANT that he had to tote around all movie for absolutely no reason? Not much of an appeal there.. but that is what we got here. And the kicker to all that? It is completely meaningless. There is no plot element that is driven by that.. it has no reason for her being there other than somebody deciding this movie needed more than 1 actor in it.\n\nEvery scene is just stupid, boring and unimaginative. CGI is normal for 2023 standards, short and clearly low budget as they kept dino screen time to a minimum...\n\nIt's just a horrible movie. It has nothing to redeem it.. not a single thing in there is worthy . This could have been a decent movie if it had different cast, writers and producers."

This time I just watched the movie despite of the low rating because I love science fiction. And I liked the trailer. 65 is one of the best movies I have seen this year! Right next to Top Gun and probably Jonh Wick ( have not seen it yet) I don't know why people give this movie a bad rating because it's a very, very good movie. CGI is great, acting is very good and the characters are lovable. Are people over analyzing? People please! From now on I will not be watching movies based on ratings anymore. I am fed up with this. Do you love science fiction? Dim the lights. Get some popcorn and enjoy this great movie! And to all the people who have rated this movie low, go watch some Festival de Cannes movies and rate those! Still 24 minutes left... I am going to enjoy the end."

The whole movie just becomes a big long \"Get kid out of stupid problem that they got themselves into\" This is one of the most annoying cliches you can do in any movie after adding a kid into the mix. Kid doesn't follow directions. Runs toward danger. Runs away from main character. Ignores all directions and just tries to get themselves killed.\n\nKinda redeems themself at the last 1/4 of the movie. But that annoying kid cliche still annoys me."

        "review_detailed_main": "A story of loss and the need to continue against all odds in the face of it, \"65\" squanders opportunities to not only be memeable, but to also develop its characters, their homeworld of Somaris, as well as to present its beautiful CGI monsters clearly and properly.\n\nIn what seems to be an effort to be sensitive to younger audiences, the directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods decided to avoid presenting the pivotal scenes of death in the plot and with it, most of the emotion and distress it causes, thus vastly cheapening the story's experience or any value it might have had to the viewer. Their complete lack of spine in the telling is not uncommon in this generation of Hollywood, one which is obsessed with keeping appearances, leaving good impressions and avoiding hurting any feelings. The movie industry is currently swamped in this ideology; a cancer which is nigh impossible to remove since those in power refuse to hire anyone who disagrees, preferring to languish in their echo chambers, unable to see their shortcomings and choosing only to receive praise at every turn.\n\nIn a pivotal moment in this movie, when Adam Driver's life is in danger, he delivers every ounce of emotion and determination only for his co-lead to seem uncomfortable instead of involved. This is absolutely a director's choice; one that is weighed down by the need to avoid any controversy. What could have been a story of love for our fellow man, and a richly developed tale of a father becomes anecdotal in the hands of mediocre developers. We cannot easily identify with the characters and they are not sufficiently engaging due to the poor script and presentation (but at no fault of their own).\n\nFurthermore, the exciting and wonderful CGI beasts in the film are presented at odd angels, momentarily and without true love or consideration to the incredible work put into them. So many monster moments could have been fleshed out and given weight, but instead dissipate. One baby dinosaur in the movie could have gone on to be the next Grogu, if the directors would have had any insight. The movie is poorly shot in general, leaving the viewer frustrated and wishing for a better view of the action.\n\nBut the greatest loss, in my opinion, was the chance for this movie to become a cult classic thru the use of imaginative language and word play. The fact that the characters speak different languages could have been the premise for some hilarious dialogue, interaction and brevity. Excellent examples of proper use of this premise can be seen in Luc Besson's \"The Fifth Element\" or Wolfgang Petersen's \"Enemy Mine\", both of which are meaningful tales that have staying power in the hearts and minds of their audiences.\n\nIn conclusion, \"65\" avoids the chance to be heartfelt and engaging, and thus becomes ignorable; one of many such titles that fade into obscurity."

I went in with not very high expectations from what I heard in advance, but I eventually found myself almost enjoying it. I would say probably better to wait until it goes on streaming channels, unless you absolutely need big screen and sound. The main characters played by Adam Driver and young Ariana Greenblatt give fair performances, with Greenblatt turning in a somewhat better performance than Driver. There are some suspense and action sequences. Nothing to write home about though. The big problem is the script, and a story that gets bogged down, with quite a few illogical events. The CGI is kind of meh, considering how good it could have been with perhaps a bigger budget. My opinion, considering what I sat through as the story unfolded, was the ending was a total letdown. See it with lowered expectations and enjoy it as a kind of \"B\" movie."

I guess 65 will be of more interest for a younger audience, maybe still in their teens, because the story itself provides nothing really new (does anyone still remember Planet of Dinosaurs from 1977 or Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet from 1965?) and is something (I take any bet) some AI would come up if your input are keywords like \"write a movie script and use ideas of Jurassic Park, Planet of Dinosaurs, After Earth and Enemy Mine\". On top, some of the scenes, like the little girl attacking a beast like a Tyrannosaurus with a stick (a Starship Trooper moment but meant dead serious - because you know, girls can do everything) are plain silly - she (and maybe even a full grown man) would not have any chance to pierce the skin of that kind of beast with just a sharpened stick. Anyway, 65 is not a total fail or crash but somehow rather boring - despite that plot idea right out of pulp wonderland. I guess the fail lies mostly in the attempt to be serious with some drama elements but on the other hand implement some silly scenes like that saving a dinosaur out of \"mud\" or attacking a mega beast with just a stick. Last words: I just wonder - did some virus destroy any talent on this planet to write and give us some decent story?"

But once the scared little kid develops superhuman running, climbing, and fighting skills, not to mention the ability to sneak around undetected for that \"lethal\" strike, this movie becomes another joke. I guess it goes against the mainstream these days to expect a survival movie where one character fights to exhaustion to save the other. There's nothing wrong with that. But it is viewed by the media types as patriarchal these days. So, the kid being saved has to one-up the hero and ALWAYS be the one to save the day in the end.\n\nFor once I'd like to see a movie where the person being saved and protected chips in a little here or there, but leaves the heavy lifting to the lead.\n\nBecause, you can bet if the pilot was a woman, and the child was a boy, that there would have been zero chance he saves her in the end."

Then it started to drag on a little bit. The majority of the movie seemed to creep by a little slow. Although the action scenes were pretty cool, the plot just seem to meander along, pretty slowly. The ending was kind of abrupt, and I wish they had stretched it out more.\n\nThis movie was definitely not a five out of 10 that the IMDb reviews showed. The plot was amazing and the CGI was fantastic. It just moved a little slow for me."

There were just too many life or death moments with resolutions that were beyond belief, even in the sci fi world. You pull a dinosaur out of quicksand and then later you pull Adam driver out of quicksand. And didn't those dinos have anything better to do but chase after these two? They seemed so concentrated in one place. And then the conclusion. I didn't know Old Faithful could parboil a giant behemoth. Well, it was a couple of hours killed. So be it. I never expected a masterful presentation, although it could have been so much better with a little imagination."

After I left the cinema, I wondered what was missing, what I needed more and decided that the film was too short and maybe if it was longer could it be more completed, but then I remembered that Gravity is no longer.

They show him leaving his planet in order to make money for his daughter's life-saving medical procedure. Then, halfway through, they reveal that the daughter died. Uh, why would they throw that in there in a movie that seems like it's striving for a PG rating? It would have been better for their target audience if he and the girl escape earth and then it ends with Koa and his daughter playing together in the surf. Where did the wife go? He takes off on a multi-year run after his daughter dies? Kind of \"Netflix-style\" writing, if you ask me. But who asked me? Have a good movie summer, everybody..."

Yes. Pitch Black? Yes. Red Planet? Yes. Mission to Mars? Yes. A Sound of Thunder?

They are outstanding in their performances. Their presence and purpose is moving and heartfelt.\n\nChloe Coleman and Ariana Greenblatt go toe to toe with heavyweight and star Adam Driver, a proven performer across all genres.\n\nAnd here, especially so.

And I wanted to go back in time, to stop myself from wasting my time watching this!\n\nIf I wanted to see 2 characters with father x daughter dynamics, in a situation of chaos running away from things that want to kill them, I WOULD WATCH THE LAST OS US!\n\nBoring, uninteresting and slow. A disappointment, because the trailer showed an atmosphere that I loved, but well... the only thing is... huh, dinosaurs? \"father and daughter\"?\n\nCome on, there are more movies to watch at the cinema; go see anything else, even if it's a documentary, I promise it will be more interesting."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't really know how they manage to write a script about a man with a laser rifle fighting dinosaurs boring, but somehow they pulled through.\n\nThe plot is incredibly disjointed, with a lot of \"and then\" storytelling, confusing plans, and virtually nonexistent chemistry. Half the dinosaurs are -at best- taking inspiration from real creatures and at worst might as well be dragons for how well they represent real prehistoric creatures. Not that they're present very often; there's a notable lack of fauna at any given moment onscreen other than the single breed of dinosaur to make an appearance every 20 minutes. The threat of the asteroid coming to end the Mesozoic Era ironically has minimal impact on the plot and is more just a case of set dressing to artificially ramp up tension.\n\nAnother major miss is the interaction between the two main human characters, who I will call Adam and Girl because I can't be asked to check their in-movie names. See, Girl speaks what I at least believe to be a sci-fi foreign language, so the two can't properly communicate with each other. So rather than watching the two slowly learning to communicate with each other with clever work arounds and pantomiming, we instead get to watch Adam pull the American tactic of repeating English words to her more slowly and loudly in the hopes that if he says the word well enough it'll somehow push through the language barrier. Which, to his credit, it usually does, alongside some light/confusing pantomiming that in actuality would leave people staring blankly at you or nodding in a \"I don't know what you're saying but I'm gonna role with it\" kind of way.\n\nHonestly, I'm just shocked this wasn't a direct-to-DVD release. Would not recommend unless you really enjoy watching stupid stuff, and even then you'll be better off watching something else."

The character bits throughout felt realistic and let me connect with them on a deeper and more personal level throughout their journey on prehistoric Earth. The world also made me wanting to know more about Mill's civilization. Definitely would recommend if you are interested in something fresh and entertaining. Another great addition to Adam Driver's film catalog. Truly a great actor and he definitely doesn't disappoint in this even though it is an action film. He hits those important character moment flawlessly. Definitely think this film is getting some flak for no reason. CGI was perfectly good. Lastly, you have to see this in a theater to get that cinema experience, especially for something that happens at the end. Enjoy it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "On the planet Somaris, pilot Mills (Adam Driver) takes a two year contract on an exploratory mission to earn money needed for his ill daughter's operation. However, when a rogue asteroid field strikes their ship, Mills crash lands the vessel on an uncharted planet (which as it turns out is Earth 65 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period). While seemingly all the cryo pods were destroyed in the crash leaving Mills alone, it turns out one pod survived belonging to a nine-year old named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt) who doesn't speak Mills language but with her in two Mills sets out to find the other half of the ship in order to contact rescuers and escape the planet while contending with various hazards.\n\n65 is the long awaited film from A Quiet Place creators Scott Beck and Bryan Woods that was developed under strict confidentiality with Sony Pictures during September 2020 with Adam Driver to star. Despite initially being positioned as a high profile project, the film was bounced around the release calendar with its initial date for April-May of 2022 missed until it was released in March 2023 where it opened to both lukewarm box office and critical and audience response. Upon the initial trailer I will say I was somewhat curious what they would do with a premise like this, but unfortunately the movie squanders its high concept premise of \"Aliens vs. Dinosaurs\" with a sodden and rather dull approach that barely musters much enthusiasm.\n\nI think the biggest thing that holds this movie back is the fact that there are only two characters in this movie (more like one and a half, but we'll get to that) and this seems like it was done purely for reasons relating to the Covid pandemic when it was greenlit, not unlike the Idris Elba movie Beast. In order for something like this to work you need to either have a single character become more desperate to survive with each passing moment or have a large ensemble (similar to Aliens) where they're picked off one by one to up the stakes. Driver is a good actor, but Mills is such a stick figure of a protagonist he barely leaves an impression, but at least he leaves more than Ariana Greenblatt's Koa who isn't so much a character as she is an \"objective\" or cargo for Mills to carry especially since she speaks a made-up language and doesn't have much of a personality aside from needing to be protected by Mills. I don't think Ariana is to blame for the character as it's hard for any actor to give much meat to a role where they're speaking a made-up language so this feels like a fault more in the writing than the acting. In terms of special effects, the Dinosaurs look fine all things considered, but the fact that this is yet another PG-13 dinosaur movie only serves to remind you of how played out these takes on dinosaurs have become especially with the increasingly mediocre Jurassic World films that Universal kept popping out. I'm not saying the movie would've been improved by an R-rating, but it at least would've given something to differentiate itself from the prior dinosaur movies that came before it.\n\n65 promises high concept genre nonsense, but is so turgid and lugubriously paced it sucks what fun there is to be had out leaving us with dull tedium. None of the characters are all that memorable and while the CGI on the dinosaurs is fine there's nothing that really stands out about the sequences especially since they're played just as safe as the PG-13 Jurassic World films that were already running out of ways to make dino attacks interesting. If we do end up getting another rendition of \"man vs. Dinosaur\", at the very least make it R-rated, because at least then you could justify yourself with trashy genre thrills."

So the camera work, make up, special effects, animation, and the acting are fine......the major problem that makes it a disappointment is the writing....and it took two writers to come up with this ridiculous story line! Aliens who look, act, and talk like humans crash land on Earth....amazingly one day before the mass extinction event, 65 million years ago, that killed all the dinosaurs! Huh? Further....there's zero story beyond crashing.....being chased around by dinosaurs....and taking off again. That's it folks.....in fact this 90 minute movie would have been 85 minutes if they didn't throw in another chase scene at the end. Everything in this movie is preposterous from the crash and how the pieces of the vehicle end up.....to a dinosaur turning the escape vehicle into its proper launch position! If there had been more of a story....there would have been 15-20 minutes more to the movie. This movie rushes through the nonsensical script.....never taking time to set a mood.....and a plan.....for the next move. Lastly.....there are some woke elements....which is bizarre for supposed aliens.....and the acting is a bit melodramatic at times.....probably used as a time filler."

Not much action, felt awkward at times, not too clever and if you have watched many sci fi movies, you won't find it very interesting.\n\nHowever, there are some positives. Adam Driver is a great actor, i don't know why some people dislike him so much. Not a big budget production but CGI was excellent. Story is simple but not boring. Viewer cares about these characters, likeable and not annoying. Not much action as i said but there are some intense moments. And the ending was good.\n\nBasically, people disliked it because this is a family movie, suitable even for little kids. I sense that they expected something \"heavier\", gory, bleak etc. If i am right, i don't believe this is a bad thing. What's wrong with family movies? Should every movie be sad, bleak, twisted and gory? Have we become so desensitized that everything should be dark and painful in order to mirror our world?\n\nThis is a light hearted sci fi movie, and to be honest, there is indeed a very sad moment here. Lower your expectations and you will probably enjoy it."

There's a character who speaks a different language, and Adam Driver's character goes through a list of possible languages he recognizes to compare it to. Nothing is done with this. Little to no attention is paid to the backstory of the film, which had the potential to be infinitely more interesting when combined with Dinosaur-era Earth compared to what we got instead.\n\nWhat we got instead is a very plain, very boring \"we're here and have to get over there\" adventure movie with unconvincing CG dinosaurs occasionally attacking for no real reason and absolutely no sense that our heroes are going to fail or die at any point.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that could be transplanted into the middle of the Alaskan wilderness at any time between 1820 and 2020 and any and all script changes to be made could be done in less than 15 minutes. It doesn't have an original story, much less a good story, it doesn't have memorable acting or compelling characters, it doesn't have good CG, it doesn't have anything interesting or notable going on for it.\n\nThis is the kind of film that a sleazier film company would cancel release after it was finished in order to pocket the tax write-off. And they would probably be justified."

The back story is rushed and leaves us with little feelings for the lead characters and little understanding of their world, such as; the spaceship they are in (causing confusion later)? Who is onboard? Why are they there? Where are they going? If it was 40-60 minutes longer it could have made a very engaging story.\n\n.... but that would also require better dialogue and a story more action and less cliches and even a different lead as Adam Driver just does not seem likeable. The suspense and reveal of the location of where they are stuck could have been carried on longer and built up to be a surprise but this is already given to us in the trailer.\n\nOverall, disappointing and fairly average movie that was a nice idea but poorly executed.\n\n6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was actually going to give it a 6.5, but it's not quite right to say it's a 7, so I've ended up giving it a 6, which represents an average film. Firstly, the inclusion of a high-tech human-like civilisation is a good start, although the title is more cool than actually meaningful. If I had to write a story about a spacecraft crashing to a 56 million year old Earth, that's all I'd have to say. But it could have been a much better story with that start, especially with the great visual effects and the great high-tech equipment, and it would have been a much better film if I hadn't decided to continue with the script. The visual effects and the lighting are very commendable, especially the visual effects, which are top notch."

I found \"65\" to be a pretty entertaining movie, making most of its budget, cast and locations. The budget is blessedly not $450 million dollars or whatever Hollywood keeps spending on its tired, empty and dying blockbusters.\n\nIt has pretty good production values and an ideal runtime for this type of movie. It isn't a remake, reboot, sequel or prequel. That is definitely a bonus. Plus, I liked the setting and timing of the movie. Interesting concept. Not perfect by any means. However I saw it has pretty low scores and negative reviews and I am not sure any of it is deserved. But that's just me."

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I had heard that this was bad, but I still had to see it because I like sci-fi and Adam Driver and he's rarely in a bad movie so I thought I'd take a chance. It's not terrible, but it could have been so much more of an action and an adventure film. As we know it's about a spaceship crashing on an unknown planet and as usually happens in scenarios such as this nearly all of the crew is killed except for our movie star lead, but most unfortunately a little girl survived as well and their relationship together seems all too familiar and as in many films such as this, she is very bright and annoying. There's a scene that you just can't help but laugh at. Their escape pod is upside down and it can't take off, but a big dinosaur right sides it up. They are so helpful sometimes. The pluses, outside of Driver, though he has seen better days, are the special effects which are very good and when and where they land is an interesting concept. I just wish it had been utilized better."

Main premises of the film is that the ship as on as the worst GPS in the galaxy that cannot see a on coming meteorite shower till its upon the ship then warns Mills the pilot to avoid but to late so said ship then crashes on a planet So far so good ok then the film then cherry picks from the last 30 odd years of films mainly Jurassic Park and Aliens so nothing ground breaking or new but let's face facts what is?\n\nIt's a tiring film with no time for character development cus the target audience only wants action and CGI fast cuts and my personal favourite the next action sequence It's not great but then again it's not The Lighthouse or The Meg which are terrible movies the first why? And the second put Jason Statham in trunks and get the Chinese to pay for it so they look good For 90 minutes of escapism not bad but l do find the really bad reviews really ? Not all films can be Shawshank or Green book lol."

I hate that i could see so much sci fi potential just wasted in a post covid era where movies should be aimed at adults to be played in theaters and the holly wood industry is already getting lazy when they could do the bare minimum to go direct to streaming. Wasted potential on the leading actor."

Things would just happen, and you really didn't know how we got there. Driver's character, even with the death of his daughter, just came off like a jerk to her. You didn't feel a real connection, between the two, until the last 20 minutes. No one would write a film that choppy. Maybe we will get a director's cut and it will be much better. The Dinos were so random, and the final \"battle,\" I guess, was only built on 30 seconds of an earlier encounter. It's like seeing a T-Rex in Jurassic Park break out of his pen, but just run off, and you don't see it until the last 5 minutes. This movie needed to be at least creeping towards 2 hours to make it feel whole."

The combat rifle looks like a 3D printed plastic toy. The space helmet has an LED stripe in the neck area and is freaking fogging!!! Why??? The guy flies a spaceship to foreign planets and his helmet is fogging! This is ridiculous.\n\nThe social behaviour between the guy and the girl (I instantly forgot their names) is not consistent.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is it's length. 90 minutes is enough.\n\nSkip this one!"

Acting by Adam Driver ,Ariana Greenblatt and Chloe Coleman was impressive.\n\nMovie could have been better if few more scenes showing Dinosaur and humans interaction would have been added."

It kind of reminds me and feels like a slightly better version of Will Smith's movie After Earth and judging by the scoring on both, I'm not too far off. The VFX on the movie were nice and the scenery looked good and believable, but I think the main problem of this movie is its writing. Such shame, as I really liked The Quiet Place."

I mean, it wouldn't convince me not even as an idea, how did this get made is beyond me. Did Driver need money? He said that the artistic dramas don't pay well?

Well done, most def. But the brilliantly executed emotional ride it then took me on, in amongst a horde of awesomely rendered predatory nightmares which, although great, simply paled in comparison to the little Dad-nostic teeth sawing through my heart..... oh man, I'm so glad I watched this on my own. I would have been humiliated otherwise. Maybe it's just me & the resonance it found with my particular life. Simply put, if you're a dad or at all dad-inclined, stay far away from this masterful piece of business, unless you are guaranteed alone. You have been warned."

The dinosaurs appear realistic, and the incorporation of science fiction elements seamlessly fits into the plot, creating an immersive atmosphere.\n\nSecondly, the acting performances are commendable. The actors convey convincing emotions and enhance the immersion. The lead actress, in particular, excels in her role.\n\nThirdly, the story offers an intriguing mix of suspense and drama. Character development is well-crafted, and the progression of the plot keeps the audience engaged.\n\nUnfortunately, it has become a trend nowadays to overly criticize Netflix films without giving them a fair chance. \"65\" deserves more recognition for its quality and originality. I recommend everyone to give this film a chance and see for themselves. It might be a pleasant surprise."
