        "review_detailed_main": "It was really funny!! Baburoa played by Paresh Rawal was superb, and so was Akshay Kumars character, although Sunil Shetty'z character didn't shine through as much as in Hera Pheri!! The Chemistry between the three was great to watch, the characters haven't changed in the way they act they still get themselves into trouble and this time round they get into such a big mess!! I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"

Not to forget the Hera Pheri 1st where Paresh himself mentioning after receiving the best actor award...that the credit goes to Neeraj as Paresh is a total guju guy and due to Neeraj..he could project the marathi guy in 1st movie..all credit goes to the script writer and his perception as even the director directs but the key sense to the soul is the script writer..and I would say being a 2nd it really bags the credit for what it has done! A movie which will chuckle your bones and you don't worry about anything when you are driving back to home... Kudos to Neeraj the comedy king Cheers"

        "review_detailed_main": "This has to be one of the overrated disasters of this year. The original Hera Pheri had a refreshingly new plot, \"desi\" settings and ample doses of situational comedy.\n\nBut this one fails to even come close to the original. I am pretty sure that 95% of the people who will watch this movie have never even heard of \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". For the uninformed, this is a stylish Brit comedy by Guy Ritchie and is simply amazing. If you ever get a hold on this movie then watch it.\n\nSome of the scenes, plots and situations have been mercilessly copied by Mr. Vohra for his latest film hoping that the ignorant Indian movie goers will love it. Well, he succeeds to some extent. The problem lies in the adaptation. While \"Lock, Stock...\" is set in Britain with their 90s way of living, the director did a bad job in transposing the settings to modern day Mumbai suburbs. Surprisingly, (well not so surprisingly) even the last open-to-interpretation scene of \"Lock, Stock...\" has been photocopied.\n\nThe dialogs aren't as strong as the original and the director/writer tries hard to impose series of slapstick humor in order to save the movie. And how could I forget those unbearable minutes where one wonders who in the name of God has composed/written/sung this song? The only saving grace are the three lead characters \"Raju\" (Akshay Kumar), \"Ghanshyam\" (Sunil Shetty) and \"Baburao\" (Paresh Rawal). These guys seemed to have mastered the art of comic timing with extra \"Bananas\" to Paresh Rawal. Most of the actors did a pretty decent job but I felt that some of the characters were wasted.\n\nThe reason why it gets a 6 is because of the acting and because of director Neeraj Vohra's courage to make a sequel to a cult movie albeit slaughtering Guy Ritchie mercilessly.\n\nPlease go and watch \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". If you are unable to get hold of a copy, try \"Hera Pheri\" instead."

The chemistry remains top notch. The 3 characters have heavy roles with their own wizardry to match them. Akshay is suave, rich yet left wanting for more. Sunil remains the good man with the standard pessimistic approach to Akshay. In the middle is Paresh Rawal and bundles of humour.\n\nThis plot is set off promisingly with a concept of having gained, lost all and now trying to get it back! :)\n\nCons : - What made Hera Pheri amazing was the original dialogue and interaction between the characters and how the final story tied itself well with the sub-plots. This is not so here because the director decided to lift the latter half of the story from \"Lock Stock and 2 Smoking barrels\" which is a big shame because the story only gets confused and dragged into the region of \"when is this going to get over\"\n\n\n\nStill fun to watch if one does not have very high expectations."

Though it is still Hera Pheri, the same characters, Shyam, the guy who always smells trouble, and the stupid Baburao Wapte, it isn't the same any more. Hera Pheri stressed on the common problems of the poorer class people of India. There was a lot of character development in the prequel, the three characters bonded with each other. Whereas this movie is basically a spin off for Raju(Akshay Kumar) and some nice comic relief from Baburao Wapte(Paresh Rawal). Shayam(Sunil Shetty) has basically no part to play. Also the number of characters in the movie makes it a lot complicated. Hera Pheri was simple with a few basic characters, whereas Phir Hera Pheri sends the audience on a cat and dog chase. This becomes terribly boring at times, and only Paresh Rawal shines through with his impeccable ability to play the fool. He lets you rolling with peals of laughter. The songs are decent, Bipasha Basu and Rimii Sen does a good job as the co stars to this movie. And it was a nice cliffhanger of an ending keeping the people pondering whether there will be yet another sequel to this or not ...\n\nIt should have been rated a lowly 5-6.. But only due to Paresh Rawal, it gets a 7... That man just gets better with each movie he makes. His ability to make you laugh is just impeccable.\n\n7/10 !!!! Chalate jao Paresh ji !!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A sequel has its upsides and flipsides. The upside is that it can redeem on the recall value of the prequel and attract audiences to the theatres. The flipside however is that it has to meet the gigantic expectations of the prequel to satisfy the audiences sitting in the theatres. Most sequels turn a victim of this flipside. Phir Hera Pheri is no exception. When judged on its own merit, Phir Hera Pheri is a fairly entertaining comedy flick. But comparisons with the prequel, though unfair, are inevitable and that's where the film might disappoint to an extent.\n\nThe writer of the prequel, Neeraj Vora writes and directs this sequel. Vora manages to pull of the film from where it ended in the first part and also maintains connectivity between the two films. And since the characters were already established in the first part, he wastes no time here to go ahead with the storyline.\n\nRaju (Akshay Kumar), Shyam (Suniel Shetty) and Baburao (Paresh Rawal) who earn big bucks at the end of the first part; live a lavish life at the start of the second episode. But with money comes greed for more money. So in the greed to double their money, they borrow more money from underworld and invest it in a chit fund on the behest of Anuradha (Bipasha Basu). But the company turns out to be bogus and thereby they lose all their assets coming back to square one. From here on starts their attempt in paying back loans taken from the underworld.\n\nThe movie runs on jet speed pace and you hardly get time to breathe, gasp, feel, absorb, react or relate. With every alternate scene a new gang is introduced and by the interval point you have around a dozen mobsters linked to each other. The film is clustered with so many characters that you lose count after a point of time.\n\nWhile Neeraj Vora scores as a writer; to an extent, he fails as a director. On the writing part, despite so many characters to handle, he etches an interesting screenplay connecting all of them. Obviously you are not expected to think logically in today's comedies. Off lately, slapstick has turned out to be an easy alternative to tongue-in-cheek humor. So you don't have to exercise your brains cells when a circus gorilla (a palpable human in a monkey mask) is in pursuit of Johny Lever in the climax, as far as the duo makes you laugh. Or for that matter, don't think twice when the mastermind of first part, Akshay Kumar falls for a silly trap of doubling money in the second. But then these minuscule loopholes can be overlooked.\n\nWhat cannot be overlooked are the over-the-top loud performances. There's where Vora's directorial skills come into question in extracting performances from the cast. While none of the actors are bad, they are unnecessarily boisterous at times. Vora also ends up sketching caricature characters of a stammering gangster duo (played by Sharat Saxena and Ravi Kissen) to evoke humor. The humor is more formulated.\n\nWhile Vora overuses Paresh Rawal, he overlooks Suniel Shetty. Paresh Rawal gets the maximum gags and is ably supported by Akshay Kumar who compliments Rawal for a perfect comic chemistry. While showcasing the dumbness of his character Baburao, Paresh Rawal at times stretches the jokes too far and goes overboard. Akshay Kumar has a spontaneous comic timing, but off late with this similar kind of roles, he is getting typecast. However he's far better tickling the funny bone than indulging in emotional inanities like Humko Deewana Kar Gaye.\n\nPhir Hera Pheri essentially tried to use the original Hera Pheri pairing of Akshay-Suniel-Paresh as its USP. But post Hera Pheri; there have been so many films with the trio combination like Awara Pagal Deewana, Aan: Men at Work and Deewane Hue Pagal that there's hardly any novelty or a recreated charm effect when they come together here.\n\nOne aspect where the film is better than its prequel is that unlike Hera Pheri where there were half a dozen redundant forced songs and item numbers, in Phir Hera Pheri the songs don't intrude in proceedings and are kept at their minimal best runtime.\n\nPhir Hera Pheri does induce plenty of laughter. But you do feel that with a little more fine-tuning, it could have been even more hilarious. The extended climax is aptly set in a circus that brings the entire clown-cum-caricature cast together. The movie however ends quite abruptly, keeping enough scope for a sequel to continue the series. We just hope that the next episode gets better."

Because of the huge success of the earlier movie(Hera Peri), this might have to take a beating. The director does not have a strong story line to build on, But Niraj's brilliance is visible in patches. All he need is a good script where he can Improvise. He tries very hard to Improvise a script which has no base unlike Hera Peri, that why you get frustrated as the movie goes on. If not the perfect comedy movie its a decent movie for the entire family which is rare to see now a days. Among the actors \"Baburao\" & \"Thotla\" steals the show when ever you see them on screen. One problem with the movie I thought was it doesn't leave any impact on you that you can think of and laugh even for a brief period of your walk back to the parking area to fetch your vehicle."

That is until Raju once again receives a phone call that is supposedly meant for Devi Prasad. He receives an offer from a woman called Anuradha to double his money in 25 days. Of course, things don't go the way he was expecting and once again our trio is in trouble.\n\nLike many Indian comedies,there are many characters and several different plotlines going simultaneously. The movie handles most of these different characters and their motivations surprisingly well.\n\nThe Romantic subplot is the weakest part of the movie. Shyam falls in love with Anuradha simply because her name is \"Anuradha\" (his previous lover). This is probably the worst part of the movie. His obsession with her makes no sense. At least Raju's love story had some kind of build up. I guess you can't make an Indian movie without romantic subplots.\n\nRegardless, if you can ignore some of minor mistakes. This is an enjoyable movie. The movie ends with a cliffhanger but I doubt we are ever getting a sequel."

Of course, Paresh once again gives the funniest performance with his great comic timing. Songs are ignorable. The only drawback of the film is the climax scene, which is funny but is stretched out way, way too long and makes you wonder when this movie is actually going to end.

But the fact that it runs on a copied story is just not acceptable."

        "review_detailed_main": "For those who don't know, this movie is a sequel to the movie 'Hera Pheri.' Hera Pheri was a truly funny movie. It's not that the humor was very sophisticated or even ambitious - the movie was merely funny at a very basic level. This sequel is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and undoubtedly one of the worst sequels ever made by Bollywood (and that is an achievement!!!) Firstly, it seems that the movie was merely made to cash in on Hera Pheri's success (as opposed to say realizing that they could do more with the same characters).\n\nSecondly, as some people have noted, it's a total rip-off of 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' (which is an excellent movie!) - even to the point that the ending scene is exactly copied!! Frustratingly, throughout the movie the copying is done with total non-application of mind, and this factor alone is worthy of the contempt that any self-respecting movie buff should have for this atrocious excuse for a movie.\n\nIt's really a pathetic situation here in India where soooooooo many movies are made by ripping-off movies from all around the world, and the vast majority of the audience are ignorant of this fact. This movie is just another illustration of this terrible state of things.\n\nGuy Ritchie, sue these guys!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched the original film when a friend of mine lent me a DVD of the film.It was fun and entertaining.It doesn't focus on the characters or the plot well,and it's pretty much a mindless comedy and it was messy throughout.But nevertheless I liked it.It was the first Bollywood that I kind of enjoyed.Mainly because it had originality.I'd give that a mere 6.5 out of 10.Paresh Rawal stole every scene and Askshay Kumar(one of only actor that I admire,with Aamir Khan and Akshay Khanna for his performance in Dil Chahta hai only.No other actor is good enough.)proved early on that he can take the comedy genre well.His collaboration with the film's director made yet another mindless,silly,mess of a comedy,which was really fun and entertaining because of Akshay Kumar.Here it's a disaster.It's a showcase of how unoriginal and terrible Bollywood can be.\n\nNow a sequel to that film is out.I wasn't keen on watching this film.I didn't even had any expectations.I didn't even gave a damn about this film but I gave a look anyway.And the verdict,well,I would never say disappointing.It's an expression that you cannot use for a Bollywood film.Cuz a bollywood film can never be disappointing ,you can't expect anything but a terrible film.Before you enter a film you can always expect worse.And this is exactly what happens.\n\nI don't understand what the hype was all about.This was less a comedy and more of a mess.It's loud ,noisy,mindless,ridiculous and overstuffed.\n\nThe story is heavily borrowed,wait,copied from the Guy Richie's cult,Lock,Stock and Three barrels.Especially in the second half ,where the film borrows most of the scenes from that film.Both plot-wise, and scene to scene enactment and characters.It also borrows slightly from Snatch.And a few more Hollywood crime capers.And redoes the scenes from the original.\n\nYes,I enjoyed the original.It was ridiculously mindless and silly.But I liked it.There was originality in that film.Develops the story and characters well.\n\nHere,it's a mess.From beginning to end,it was all yelling,screaming and screeching noises.Dialogues were shouted out.The comedy feels terribly forced.\n\nIn the original,the three actors gave really funny and good acting and had great chemistry.Here,they try everything they can to make you laugh,but all they can do was pull off 3 or 4 minor laughs,1 or 2 actual laughs,and a couple of chuckles.The rest feels forced.It seems funny but it isn't at all.The actors don't seem to get along well this time.And even the funniest character ,which was called Babu Rau seems less funny than the first.He was annoying.Kumar and the rest were not funny.\n\nThe execution was all terrible.The first film's director should have returned.At least he would know how to make people laugh.The writer director has no idea how to make people laugh or what he is doing.\n\nThis is yet another over-hyped film.Bollywood has no celebrities.The actors are praised for no special reason.It's not the audience or fans that make them famous,it's actually the media,or TV shows that promote these actors.It's Bollywood who promotes these actors,praises them for no reason but to make people be aware of their actors all over the world.The audience don't even give a rat's ass.They're just there to kill 3 hours in the dark and then forget about it.They don't care about the actors,they've got far better things to do.They work.Bollywood is just a self-promoting industry desperately trying to do anything to get noticed.The actors don't even deserve the praise they get.They are not worthy of it.None of it is true.It's just a big stunt.The actors are turned into celebrities even when they have one dud after another.Just because they think the actors are good ,so they promote them.That's all they do.\n\nNow this film I heard was over-hyped,buzzed around the television.And was claimed to be the most original and best film of the year,just like KRRISH.And what do I see here?Nothing.All of it was untrue.A bluff.Another film called Chup Chup ke was rather better.But just as weak.It's made by the original film's director.But it was far better than this romp.\n\nThis is not a funny film at all.Only a few laughs and forced entertainment.It's successful back in its country because of its hype.A low class comedy that only favors the Indian people."

        "review_title": "Best comedy of the year so far!! Hilarious",
        "review_detailed_main": "Phir Hera Pheri, the sequel to the most endearing cult-comedy of our times has released. I managed to watch it at a paid preview and here is my appraisal of different elements of the movie:\n\nParesh Rawal as Baburao: Of course you start with him. Baburao is the real hero of the movie. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of my (I think a lot of people will agree with me here) all-time favorite screen characters and Paresh currently one of the best actors around. The way he says \"Devaa Devaa, Utalerey\", only he can do it. He gets most of the best punchlines and as expected delivers them flawlessly. Whenever he is on screen, which he is most of the times, the smile hardly fades from your face. He overshadows all flaws in the movie and any blemishes from others. Outstanding work by Paresh Rawal!! What an actor! Rating \u0096 A\n\nAkshay Kumar as Raju: Another fantastic job by him. He is fast becoming the new age comedy icon (if he has already not). There is never a dull moment with him around and he is just getting better with each film. After Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Garam Masala another knockout performance by him. Check him out when he says \"Haaye Mujhe Sharm Aati Hai\" or in the maze scene during climax (which is a laugh riot) or the way he addresses Rimii with different names. Well done. Rating \u0096 A\n\nSuneil Shetty as Shyam: He is the quintessential action guy who is trying his hand at other roles. His comedy roles like in Hera Pheri, Hulchul, Awara Pagal Deewana have been OK. He is not really that great an actor at comedy (On second thoughts in any role) but still somehow manages to hold his own. Here also he holds his own, but he needs to improve somehow or will be reduced to playing inconsequential character roles (irrespective of whether you change the spelling of your name or not). Here he is fine and actually some of his shortcomings are overshadowed by others. Rating \u0096 B+\n\nJohnny Lever as Munna: One of the most popular comedians ever but he has not been in form in recent times. Here he is back in form as Munna a small time crook who wants to be big by robbing his earlier master. Some of his dialogues are funny. Only problem, his character could have been etched better. Rating \u0096 B+\n\nRajpal Yadav as Pappu: Another current favorite. Problem he does get much scope to prove his ability, but he has his moments. Rating \u0096 B\n\nBipasha and Rimi: They don't get much scope at all. Bipasha looks hot throughout but I think that is what she was required to do as her acting skills are ahem\u0085Rimi on the other hand looks lost. Anyway not much was expected from their characters. Rating \u0096 B\n\nSharad Saxena as Tiwari: Amazing performance!! As \"Totla Tiwari\" he is riot. He is the don whose money is conned (it's too complicated to explain here) and he expects our heroes to give it back. His character can't talk properly and his scenes with Baburao make you laugh your guts out. Rating \u0096 A\n\nThere are a host of comedians in the movie. But most of the others don't get much scope as this is entirely the story of Baburao, Raju and Shyam. Suresh Menon (Munna's spy in Nanjibhai's camp) and Manoj Joshi (Kachra Seth) are very good. Rating \u0096 B+ Bhojpuri superstar and one time Hindi film hero Ravi Kissen as Tiwari's henchman is also good Rating \u0096 B+ Dinesh Hingoo, Milind Gunaji, Razzak Khan are OK. Sunil Pal is wasted. The gorilla and the \"man with no visible head\" (or Qutb Minar as Akshay puts it) are fun.\n\nDialogues: Special mention for the dialogues. This movie has some fantastic dialogues. I won't spoil the fun by mentioning them here. Rating \u0096 A\n\nMusic: Himesh Reshammiya can do no wrong currently. Aye Meri Zohrajbeen is a fantastic number and the video is, you've all seen it on music channels, fantastic. The others songs are time pass.\n\nDirector: Satish Kaushik was supposed to do this movie but he pulled out and Neeraj Vora the writer has directed this. Considering his previous accomplishment as director (Khiladi 420 anyone), this is an amazing achievement. He has improved by leaps and bounds. It is never easy to direct a comedy that too a sequel and make a good job of it. A sequel always has to endure comparisons to the first part. This is not just another comedy but a sequel to Hera Pheri whose characters have now achieved cult status. There is never a dull moment. The movie moves at a very fast pace which gives you no time to brood over what is happening. Just enjoy the happenings as it is. What a job by Neeraj in this movie. Rating \u0096 A\n\nThe movie has some amazing performances and dialogues. There are some references to the first part like the song \"Golmal Hain Bhai Sab Golmal Hai\" in the background or the \"Dhoti Utaale\" scene. But it is still enjoyable. Certain characters could have been avoided. One jarring note was the climax. I didn't like most of it much but people around me were in splits, maybe it was beyond my sensibilities. It will no doubt be compared to the first part. Some will like it and some will not. But don't let the comparisons deter you from watching the best comedy of the year so far. Overall, it is complete time pass. Rating \u0096 B+\n\nThe way the movie ends leaves scope for another sequel (Maybe called \"Ek Aur Hera Pheri). Can't have enough of Baburao, Raju and Shyam, so bring it on.\n\nAppraisal Rating Definitions: A -- Fantastic/Excellent B+ -- Very Good B -- Good B- -- OK C -- Poor"

But Phir Hera Pheri really doesn't live up to that.\n\nA lot of the jokes were lame and somewhat immature, and there was a lot of extreme overacting at parts. Rajpal Yadav and Johnny Lever weren't really at their full potential of comedy, and honestly they got annoying.\n\nThe story was a ripoff.\n\nThe performances were decent. Paresh Rawal once again did the best, he really saved this movie. Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty were average. They both were good in parts however. Rimi Sen and Bipasha Basu are nothing. They were just there to attract people. However, here and there there were some scenes that reminded you of the prequel.\n\nThe music was bad. Since this film was released at around the time Himesh began to sing and act himself, the music is mainly Himesh singing himself and that was painful to hear.\n\nOverall, this movie had high expectations, but mainly disappointed. I'd rate it an overall 5 out of 10."

        "review_title": "Hera Pheri goes Hungama!",
        "review_detailed_main": "I just watched this one on TV, with some anticipation and a few fears. Both were realised, to my retrospective disappointment:\n\nHera Pheri told the story of three losers, Shyam, Baburao and Raju, and their attempts to escape the poverty and desperation they and their respective families were in to ultimately become rich. A simple story, with a moral angle, and of course, the wider focus on comedy. They get the money, climb out of poverty, all is well, blah blah and the film ends. This is where its sequel starts.\n\nThere are formulas, patterns, tried and trusted that many directors reuse for their films. The formula for Hera Pheri, was used for hungama, hulchul, and several other subsequent priyadarshan films. Problem is, tautologically speaking, it no longer works for the sequel of the originator.\n\nSpeaking of circles, the director - who is different from the original - gets himself stuck in a plot circle (no pun intended) and leaves us wondering about the subsequent direction of the film. After losing their property early on in the film, the trio are on the streets, back to square one, and this means of course that the rest of the plot will be about them trying to get back to being rich. Predictable? Yes. Thrilling? No. The problem like I said, is the blind reusage of the winning formula of other films. It seems that there must be a goose chase, and the familiar 'hera pheri' (and all its synonyms) style ending with all characters insanely after the object of desire. To do that, he brings the trio to the footpath, and exasperated, we, with them, start again. this undoing of the original's work to, only to redo it again is an immature directorial gimmick.\n\nHera Pheri was a controlled film, with a simple, poignant tale subsumed into the larger serving of comedy. The 'Hera Pheri' element, was mainly at the end. Here, due to the absence of a plot, it bursts in uninvited half way through the story. This means the relinquishing of control so early on, which is disastrous. We become lost in the madness, and seek an elucidating ending, a 'clear-it-all-out' which doesn't happen. The heaps of plot twists become entagled webs that keep piling up, until at the end, we, exhausted, become more desperate than ever for a clear, happy end to cure our misery. This never happens, and instead what the director does is suddenly in the last two minutes, expect the audience to put on our thinking caps, which we never brought to the film, to swallow the ending. As much as i understood the ending, I was initially in disbelief and frustrated enough to spew expletives.\n\nA failure, a case of trying to ambitiously juggle too many things at once is what brings this film down. What he could have focused on instead was perhaps the moral element: how the trio learn that money is not everything, and that happiness actually is about the simpler things in life, etc. Even the characters, seems to have escaped the strings of their puppeteer here. Rawal is excessive, and the other two portray their characterisations poorly this time. It is as though the director hung a piece of meat high up on a string a distance away from the audience, letting them smell and savour its fragrance in the original, and his successor decided to just cut the string and let them devour it in this one. What ever it was, it seemed a cheap imitation of the original, and it didn't help that it was just one of many money-grabbing sequels released in the year."

Sunil Shetty character was given no importance and the screenplay revolves around Akshay and Paresh Rawal."

        "review_detailed_main": "i saw this film last night and when it finished it got a big clapping send off from the audience. speaks volumes!! i think on the whole, with some reservations, this is more evenly paced and humorous than the original. however it does have its own demerits namely that this time the famous trio have been reduced to cartoon characters. there is a lot more fun but at the same time they all go over the top. this was the beauty of the original. they were all simple and believable characters. but situational comedy has been replaced by sheer slapstick. another thing there are a lot of references to Brit film lock stock. that was a put off. also i think paresh rawal needs to give it a break. he is the funny man yet again and boy he is good at it, but i am sure i don't want to watch him again in a funny character in near future. on the flip side, the chemistry between the three was amazing. in fact its their constant bickering that keeps redeeming the film time after time. suniel shetty was alright, more like a catalyst for the other two superior actors do their job. akshay kumar, well, what can i say?? his unbridled zealousness raises the film by leaps and bounds. he was in his home territory and like paresh rawal will have you in splits. rest of the cast did their part well. on the whole a great film for escapism!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was a decently directed movie in the sense that it makes you laugh most of the times it was meant to, but no one can take over Priyadarshan. Certain scenes and dialogs were not funny at all like the ones when Babu Rao talks about his telephone in the beginning and when he comes to take the money in his chaul house to not believe it really is his home, also when Raju peeks into Johny Lever's apartment through the picture and several such scenes. Priyadarshan never includes lame comedy scenes or dialogs in his movies. Yet, the climax was a very Priyadarshan style where the comedy goes long into several groups fighting with each other like in Hera Pheri (part 1). Moreover, certain scenes and dialogs were repetitive. For instance, the two tall black villains added no substance what-so-ever and the Rs.1000 scene with Raju and his girl was over done the first time and thereon had the same concept repeating in subsequent scenes. Since most people only count the times they laugh to judge a comedy movie, I would say it's a great laughter movie and every couple of minutes, you find yourself either laughing or smiling. So if you haven't yet, go watch it!"

His role as Baburao Apte was fantastic. Akshaye Kumar did the best acting. He fulfilled the role of Raju. And of course Sunil Shetty did great. But out of the three I liked Raju and Baburao more but that doesn't mean Shyam didn't do a great role.\n\nThis movie was full of laughs, and the story had so many turns and twists. If you loved the first then you will love this. Even if you haven't seen the first one, watch this one anyway. I had a great time."

Back in the days we didn't have an internet and since we didn't have a TV until a few years ago, I didn't know anything about what film is. And after a few scenes I was completely on board with this. Later on I learnt about the prequel, watched it and then watched this film. And with all that done, there's no second thought - this is the perfect sequel to that film, and that's actually pretty surprising considering both have been made by two different directors and both are adaptations of two drastically different films.\n\nThe film begins with Raju, Shyam and Baburao having become rich. But then Raju falls for a scam and makes them all broke again. It is hilarious to see Shyam and Baburao's reaction when they learn about it, and it's even funnier when they try to attack Raju throughout the film. They start living in a tenement until their luck strikes back again. And once again they try their best, except this time they fail.\n\nThe film adds many more interesting characters to the duology, like Kachra Seth and Pappu. I don't know if this is a popular opinion, but I personally like this film's characters more than the prequel's. Except for the songs, it doesn't matter which scene you're watching. You know you will have a good laugh. The death of the man who tells them Kook-doo-koo initially looked like it was going to be a sad scene, but it also became funny eventually. Every time we think the film cannot have any more amount of comedy of errors, it introduces one more. And in spite of that it does not feel shoehorned. It feels absolutely natural.\n\nEven as writing this review I feel like rewatching it. Not only was it so much fun to watch, it also has a huge amount of nostalgia for me. It was the film from which I learnt about and instantly became a fan of Akshay Kumar. Although I have heard there is a third part coming up, I'd personally prefer it does not come. Time has passed by a lot so films like these aren't appreciated anymore. A sequel will only end up ruining it."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1999, we saw Hera Pheri, which was the funniest film of the year. You can even saw a classic comedy, with three fabulous actors. It's good to know, they are making a sequel with the famous trio again. Part One had a brilliant Con, Part Two's con is a copy of the great British Gangster movie Lock Stock and two smoking Barrels. The whole film ain't a copy, The first half is Great, Impossible not to laugh. The second half was a little predictable for me since I have seen Lock stock. It still managed to make me laugh. The final ending was one of the funniest parts of the film, set in a circus. It was unnecessary of having a fake gorilla, unless the Gorilla takes Johnny Lever to the bush. Now, that would of been a copy of Ace Ventura when nature calls ending, but still would of been funny. Paresh Rawail is Funny as usual in a terrific role. Sunil Shetty gives a good performance yet again. Akshay Kumar gets better all the time, he is the funniest of them all. The supporting cast are decent. The ones that stand out are the Sexy Bipasa Basu in the dance sequence. Johnny Lever, its great to see him after a long time, a natural born comedian. Rajpal Yadav is funny in a small role. Sharad Saxena is hilarious as the gangster of the town. This is overall a Great comedy, and Worth the watch for sure."

No objectification or adult kind of humour is used. Still, it is one of the funniest comedies we've ever had.. the only drawback here is the director's death. I am eagerly waiting for the third installment."

To crown it all up I won't just deem this to be a worthy sequel but the best ever in bollywood . Unlike illogical and stupid sequels like sadak 2, race 3 and housefull 4 this is a sequel which has purpose and effortlessly impresses without any flaws what so ever, I think the makers of the above sequels which I have listed should learn something from this masterpiece of a film"

So much characters included some characters can be avoided and also Biapasa and Rimi Sen just average both actress is just for romance not for comedy.\n\n3.

I cant say that it is better then the first one because the Original is always the best!! Overall i believe that the film is good to watch and my comment is only based on the first time i watched it so If u ain't seen it GO 2 c it or get it on DVD when it releases because it definitely will have u kneeling over with laughter!!!"
