        "review_detailed_main": "What were they doing in those 14 years between 2 and 3, staring at their shoelaces? I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it's really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn't tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70's because of the craptastic pacing. There's even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should've started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It's so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn't do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There's one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it's the only good scene in the entire film. That's it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE CREEPERS'S ORIGINS!!! I've been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie. This feels like it should've been made for the SyFy channel and seeing this on the big screen is like seeing Lake Placid 6 on the big screen. Just don't do it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh man, where do I even begin?\n\nI've been waiting for Jeepers Creepers 3 since elementary school. When the day was finally announced last month, I couldn't contain my excitement...well, I could, simply because Jeepers Creepers had worn off a bit. I had realized that the first film, though good in certain aspects, was an overall flawed film, and that the second film was an outright piece of garbage. I predicted that this film would be bad, but oh man, I never could've guessed it would be as awful as it turned out to be. JC3 makes JC2 look good. There's so much wrong with this movie that I'm not even sure where to start.\n\nFirst, let's start off with the plot, or lack thereof. There are several stories Jeepers Creepers 3 could've told, but it's like they didn't know which one to choose, so they just made a film with no plot at all. JC3 takes place in between 1 and 2, which is a baffling decision since that story didn't need to be told and it ruins the continuity of the JC timeline. The film revolves around, like, 9 characters and I don't even know which character would count as the \"main\" character because nobody gets adequate enough screen time. We have Officer Tubbs from the end of the first movie, a character so minor in the original that it really makes you wonder why Salva would write him a lead role. Then we have the team of Creeper Hunters led by Stan Shaw. We also have some dementia-stricken old lady, her teenage daughter, the country hunk that's crushing on her, a group of punk teenage bikers, and the Creeper himself. They all have notable screen time but most of them are totally pointless and some don't even have resolutions of concussions to their characters. Notice how out of all of these characters, I never mentioned Trisha? Despite Gina Phillips's on-poster credit, she is not in the movie at all and instead has a 15 second cameo at the very, very tail end of the movie. The film constantly flip-flops back and forth between all of these characters at the most inconvenient times, and by the time the story has come back around to a set of characters, we've already forgotten what's going on with them because the story has packed so much into a 5 minute span, yet so little at the same time.\n\nThe errors in the plot continue as, well, there is no plot. Pacing is something that seems totally oblivious to Salva and company, as the film had no distinguishable act structure of any kind. The film still felt like it was in it's 1st act at the hour mark, and I'm honestly not even sure what the climax was supposed to be, if the film even had a climax to begin with! We're just watching the film and suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, the screen turns black and the credits begin to roll. Tonal shifts are aggressive in this film, as one minute it's an episode of Degrassi, then it's John Carpenter's Vampires, then it's Evil Dead 2, and then it's American Horror Story. None of it matches and it feels like 3 or 4 random scripts were cobbled together without any editing. There are some moments the feel like Salva was trying to make a borderline comedy, but it's unclear mostly due to our next point...\n\nNext is the production. Salva is a great cinematic director and the first two movies are filled with gorgeous shots and atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a blade. I suppose Salva got lazy with JC3 because this movie feels like it was made for TV. The film is laden with abysmal CGI, some of the worst I've ever seen in a theatrical release. The CGI in the original film looked better, and that came out in 2001. The editing and lighting are often so awful that you can't even tell what's happening; there is one instance where a biker is snatched, or something, by the Creeper, but it's so quick and shot so poorly you can't even tell what happens. An audience member behind me said \"what just happened?\" and I was glad I wasn't the only one. The production actually reaches \"so bad it's hilarious\" status on several occasions, including a slow-mo scene with the Creeper that was so over-the-top that it had the theater erupting in laughter. Trust me, it wasn't the only serious scene where the audience laughed hard at something meant to be serious.\n\nEven The Creeper himself is ruined. One of the most intimidating horror villains of the modern horror age has been reduced to a slightly irritated staggering drunk. Whoever decided to give him that bright red T shirt should be fired, as it looks severely out of place on him. Oh, and we STILL don't know his origins. By this point, being teased on his history comes off as a cheap gimmick, like even Salva has no idea what to do about his backstory.\n\nSo there you have it. JC3 is possibly 2017's worst film so far. Too many main characters, an unfocused story with no conclusion, too much plot yet somehow not enough plot, absent pacing, a nonthreatening and goofy looking villain, Syfy channel levels of production, some of the worst CGI ever, and a massive kick in the groin towards the JC fan-base. I used to wonder why this film was denied a worldwide theatrical release, thinking Salva's history may be the culprit. I've now realized that the more likely reason is that the producers saw how awful this film was and couldn't bear to release this on the big screen. It's most definitely a home release, and that's where it should've gone. Judging by how hard my theater laughed at every scene, I doubt I'm the only one who holds these opinions."

Production wasn't delayed, it was 14 years of cinematic constipation, but unfortunately, they finally crapped out a pitiful, useless end to the Jeepers Creepers saga. Ironically, the budget was probably less than a roll of toilet paper. Also, for the record, I am a die-hard fan of the first two films and I promise you I went into part 3 determined to like it, despite the garbage trailers and negative online buzz that was surrounding it. Bottom-line, the first film is scary, the second is fun, and the third is cancer. The creeper did not age well. Someone behind the camera has clearly lost their touch because this one just felt like a cheap, direct-to-video cash grab made without love or legitimate purpose. Avoid this one like the creeper himself and hope it goes away for 23 years... and then another 23 after that.\n\np.s. The ending is the biggest slap in the face to fan ever because the filmmakers know they won't be making another one... and I thank God for that."

Another positive is some(attempt at) character development similar to Part 1. More screen time for creeper than probably both movies put together, which is awesome. Not every thing is rosy though...acting, especially that of the lead actress was wooden at best. Some claims which Salva made about the movie were not true, which was a huge disappointment for me. To summarize, don't miss it at any cost if you are a JC fan. Oh and there is a surprise cameo as well :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Normally with a movie like this that took so long getting and presumably had trouble securing financing, you'd expect the problem to be a restrictive budget. But actually \"JC3\" would have been better-and more like the earlier films-if it were smaller scaled and less costly. There's too much action here, too many characters, all unconvincing and sometimes silly.\n\nBut what's really inexplicable is that there's way too much of the Creeper, who is no longer a seldom-seen figure of mystery but one seen WAY too often, in broad daylight, moving around like a regular guy albeit in some kind of Comic Con costume. He's not scary this way. He's just some dude in a mask. Nor is the hitherto teasingly doled-out mythology at all heightened by overly graphic FX views of him in flight, or so much dwelling on the armored truck he's got that isn't just a \"death wagon,\" it's made out of indestructible stuff and has all kinds of lethal gizmos more appropriate to a \"Phantasm\" movie.\n\nLingering on a few characters in peril, with few and frightening glimpses of the Creeper, was clearly something that worked well for the prior installments. All that gets thrown out the window here, only lessening atmosphere and suspense. Victor Salva remains a technically proficient filmmaker (at least compared to most direct-to-video-level horror directors), and there are scattered things to like, notably giving Meg Foster a major role. Having #3 bridge the narratives of #1 and #2 was at least an unexpected decision. The movie isn't good, but at least it isn't dull (something you can't say about some of those later \"Phantasms\"). Getting an interview with Creeper actor Jonathan Breck, who appears a pleasant guy, provides a nice (if sole) bonus feature.\n\nStill, this is a disappointing film that goes from generally wrong-headed to just plain ridiculous at its ill-judged climax, at which point the Creeper becomes so feeble a menace he might as well be shown dancing to \"The Monster Mash.\" It's almost as if Salva wanted to deliberately kill off his own franchise, no matter that (of course) he claims #4 is already written."

A contingent of law enforcement officers try to finish him off, but he's determined to reclaim a lost relic that has been hidden away by a local farm family.\n\nWriter-director Victor Salva had trouble securing financing for this film, and it shows, with bad FX work and missing shots. There's also a surplus of badly-done green-screen work. A lot of time is devoted to the Creeper's distinctive truck, which is revealed to be loaded with booby traps.

For example on how the video effects and cinematography turned out, this had way more green screen action then the 1st and 2nd movie those two movies took place in the open and I think this movie didn't get enough of the open area.\n\nAlso I was a little disappointed that they didn't tell us who Jeepers creepers really was. That was one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. I do understand why the movie looked the way it did because the video effects and it was because they were on a low budget which is also why it wasn't advertised as much. So probably why a lot of people didn't know about the movie's release date or anything.

Lack of romance in the relationship between those two teens.\n\nLack of empathy towards characters, cause I felt no connection.\n\nAND THEY DID NOT EVEN EXPLAIN HOW OR WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHAT IT IS EXACTLY. They honestly had so much to work with and instead of a horror thriller, they made a romantic comedy"

In the first two films, he was gorgeous. And that was 20 years ago. I understand that there was a low budget for part 3. It is sad. The director is so talented that he takes out the film for script and direction. People made sure that a director like Steven Spielberg could no longer produce masterpieces."

        "review_title": "Should have been named Jeepers Stinker",
        "review_detailed_main": "Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017) O.K., I knew this would be a bad idea. The original Jeepers Creepers was a dark, creepy and effective horror movie until about the last 20 minutes. It has been awhile since I saw the original, but I remember the introduction to the Creeper was pretty terrifying. Jeepers Creepers 2 was just awful, as to be expected from a sequel of a movie like the original horror flick.\n\nThis brings us to the subject at hand, Jeepers Creepers 3, a film that I recorded from the SyFy network so that I could watch what turned out to be the greatest World Series slug-fest ever, Houston defeating The Dodgers 13-12. It was a good choice watching the baseball game as when I finally got around to watching Jeepers Creepers 3 it was simply horrible.\n\nHere is the synopsis of the movie. It was not about a monster, it was about a pouting girl who cannot afford to feed her horse. She also had a crazy Grandma who sat on a tractor staring out into space. Eventually Grandma dug up a Creeper hand and all Hell broke loose, or what passes for Hell breaking loose in this stinker of a film. That's about it, thanks for reading. Just kidding.\n\nMoving forward, the horse gets his lunch and the sad girl is out with some clown at the feed store who wanted to get into her pants, so he bought feed for Flicka. They ended up out in the woods, and when danger reared its ugly head, of course, the truck would not start. I will say that Meg Foster as Grandma was the scariest thing in this movie. I don't know what they did to her, maybe they sent her to Ugly Bulimia Camp, but she really looked rough.\n\nAnyway, just meh on this movie. It was not creepy, it was not scary and it was shot nearly all in broad daylight, which totally jettisoned any chance of this lazy effort being remotely scary. Only at the very end of the movie was it dark and foggy, but the ridiculously poor acting and editing (not to mention the cheap, annoying soundtrack) made it more laughable than horrifying. What made things worse (or better, depending on your perspective) is that there was about 10 minutes of commercials on SyFy for every 5 minute of movie. Thank Goat for DVR and fast forward\u0085or not. I cannot properly articulate just how bad this movie sucked. Victor Salva may have learned how to toss salad in prison, but he sure didn't learn how to make a movie sequel.\n\nJonathan Breck, who was a terrifying presence in the original, was totally squandered in this movie. I really don't care anymore as I am typing this review while the movie is still running. The Creeper just goes around in broad daylight, doing his thing, and avoid the police by the use of his police scanner. He was also inexplicably wearing a red shirt. I mean, why? Instead of scaring the Hell out of us flying around at night, he is running through a field (with his red shirt) wielding an axe that looks like it came from a LarpFest. The ending of the movie was absolutely pathetic. I mean what in the Hell does a random rabbit and that stupid horse have to do with Jeepers Creepers? Plus, the ending left the door open for another movie. Victor Salva should be returned to prison for this movie, much less if he ever attempted to make another one. Just, no."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't really understand why so many people hated this movie. But, since the vast majority of the people who will read the reviews for this film are doing so to have their own negative opinions validated, we'll start with the things I didn't like:\n\n1) The acting was hit-or-miss. Some of the characters I enjoyed and was rooting for, while there were others I was just waiting to fall victim to the Creeper. 2) I'm not a huge fan of the multiple daytime scenes with the Creeper. I feel that he's best represented in the shadows of the night. That being said, the Creeper is at a place where most horror franchises wind up. The more of a villain you see, the less frightening and intimidating they become. The Creeper is kind of on the border of that; he needs to be treated carefully going forward or he could easily wind up being satirical (think along the terms of the later Elm Street sequels pre New Nightmare). 3) I'm not a fan of the Creeper's red shirt. It just doesn't suit the character well, I thought. 4) It's not quite the film Victor Salva wanted to give fans of the franchise, and it shows. The original Jeepers Creepers 3 was subtitled Cathedral, and the script for that original concept has been leaked online to show a much more complex movie that would've relied on a special effects budget much higher than the film could generate. If the stories circulating around the internet are factual, securing funding for this film was a major issue, resulting in Salva watering the script down to something to fit the budgetary restrictions. Some liberties were taken with the Creeper as a character and the things it's capable of doing, which were off-putting but, ultimately, this movie is a good example of working with what you have available to you, however little that may be. This film would've worked better as a sequel versus a prequel, showcasing a more technologically evolved Creeper in the next 23-year cycle.\n\nThat being said, what I enjoyed about this movie - and what led to me giving it such a high rating - is pretty simple: I just enjoyed the movie. It was a fun slasher from start to finish. It was as different from the other films as Jeepers Creepers 2 was to the original. It takes the character of the Creeper, includes enough of the previous entries in the franchise to please the fans, while at the same time telling a fresh and relevant story in an interesting way. Victor Salva, for all the controversy against him and all the protests, has proven yet again what an incredibly gifted writer and director he is. I only hope he keeps Cathedral on the shelf for consideration as a fourth part down the road.\n\nFinal note: without spoiling anything, I love that Victor leaves this film open-ended. He famously set the 23-year rule as a way of ensuring no sequels would be made (something Francis Ford Coppola managed to exploit to get the sequel), but at this point he seems to have fully embraced the fact that the Creeper is a popular figure in the horror movie universe and that, as long as there's an audience for horror, people are going to want to see more of the character. This film doesn't leave you with the question of whether or not there will be a sequel; it pumps you up for a sequel that's almost certainly in the works right now. So, despite it not being the film Salva wanted to give his fans initially, it's still a pretty fantastic and entertaining bit of horror."

I did however want to see the series continue and was looking forward to this.\n\nSadly the road to release wasn't easy for Jeepers Creepers 3, people didn't care about the movie so much as wish to boycott it due to the director/writer Victor Salva being a convicted paedophile. This frustrated me because though I understand peoples wishes to screw over this disgusting human being they are too blinkered. Can we kindly remember that this movie provided the livelihood of hundreds of people not just Salva, bigger picture people.\n\nAnd the movie, isn't half bad actually. In fact I'd say it's the best one yet. Full of interesting ideas, great kills and really builds up the mythology.\n\nSadly that's also its greatest flaw. This third part really humanizes the creeper, takes it away from being a mysterious creature cloaked in shadow. We now begin to find out it's origins, but alas the movie poses questions, gives the characters the answers but never relays them to the audience.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if it were a AAA movie guaranteed another part but this simply isn't. Will we get answers? Will we get a 4th part? Will we wait almost 15yrs for it again? Will it even get made due to the boycotting?\n\nIf they'd done a better ending complete with answers then I'd consider Jeepers Creepers 3 a really quite good film but in its current state it's enjoyable but flawed.\n\nThe Good:\n\nSome great characters\n\nWell cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nVery much feels like a made for tv movie\n\nFAR too open ended\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nMeg Fosters eyes still stun me"

As it gets towed, the Creeper attacks and takes back his van. Kirk is taken after his dirt bike friends are killed. Next, teen Addison Brandon is taken. Tashtego and Tubbs continue on the hunt.\n\nThe first problem comes from the silly booby-traps. The van has more gadgets than a James Bond car. The menace of that van driving down the road in the original movie is lost. The Creeper in full daylight is not my favorite move of the franchise and there is too much of that in this film. This also suffers from a scattering of protagonists which does not allow them to gel together. It's also trying to bind the three movies together. Unless one has watched the other two recently, it's hard to put together the pieces. On top of everything, the CGI is cheap. This is a franchise crashing and burning."

I don't think the production had any trouble or issues - while the stories and allegations exist a long time (beginning of his career), I think they came up again, when the movie was about to hit cinemas. Not sure what your view is on that or if you even care, but it is worth mentioning.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, even if you don't care, is the fact that while this starts where the first movie left us off (character returning), this includes new \"gadgets\" and other stuff, that do not work well in context with what we had seen in the movies before. But maybe you don't care about that either and you just enjoy new things coming up.\n\nSo while this really lets the viewer down most of the time, the beginning and the end are really almost saving the whole thing entirely!

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen many horror films throughout my life, especially throughout the last few years, but Jeepers Creepers 3 may just be one of the worst of them. Simply said, there is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie. It takes a film of which I love and takes a hideous dump on it in the worst way imaginable. Let's be honest, the second Jeepers Creepers wasn't anything great either- but despite it being a forced cash grab with little to no plot- it tried to be something different and it tried to live up to the legacy of the first film. This film is not one to try. The final product is worse than fan films I have seen people make on Youtube of other horror properties, and the special effects are so blatantly horrendous and obvious that you can't help but squirt with how cringeworthy it all is. The dialogue feels like it was written by a computer and the characters are so thin you'll forget most of them even existed by the end of each scene. The acting is so triflingly bad you can hardly believe the actors were able to take themselves seriously, let alone the horrible line delivery that they have to focus on with such sincerity. To make things even better, the film just makes no sense, and looks so cheap it could have honestly been shot on an iPhone. Green screen is literally visible in shots, technology feeling more dated than Sharkboy and Lavagirl despite the 12 year gap. In the end, Jeepers Creepers 3 is a disaster of epic proportions and easily the worst horror film i've seen from the 2010's.\n\nMy Rating: 1/10."

In same scene, there is daylight in one movie frame and night in another (only few seconds apart)? Second mistake is the selection of the time-line. I don't think anyone is interested in what was happening between the first and second movie. Maybe I was disappointed so much because I expected sequel not prequel. In addition, I think that the audience would be much more interested in knowing what happened after the second part when they killed Jeepers Creepers. Perhaps Salva choose that period for third part because he wanted to make another one. However, regarding all that was happening with this movie release (all the protests and everything) I am sure that Salva will not shoot another Jeepers Creepers any time soon. All that makes this movie total failure. I saw it once, and I don't think I want to see it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I shamelessly admit being a fan of the first and the second \"Jeepers Creepers\" films, and I'm also one of the people who closely - and seemingly endlessly - followed the production status of the third film; which was already announced shortly after the release of the second. But, probably for a wide variety of reasons and much to the frustration of myself and many others, part three didn't immediately come. I remember that, at a certain moment, the inexistent sequel was even going to be named \"Cathedral\" and had really cool teaser poster, but alas, Victor Salva made the inferior stalker thriller \"Rosewood Lane\" and the passable backwoods demon chiller \"Dark House\" instead. Now, almost out of the blue, \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" is here after 14 years, but it doesn't have a cool extra title anymore and the plot - as well as the entire production - is formulaic and disappointing. One of the gimmicks in this franchise is that the protagonist monster only prowls once every 23 years. Perhaps Salva also should have waited 23 years to take the time and pen down a worthwhile finale to the series.\n\nThe \"Creeper\", a sort of lonesome demon with a hideous mug and an unclear mythology, is busy slaughtering random teenagers and terrorizing the area with his old-timer van full of death traps. It's being pursued by the obsessive Sheriff Tashtego and a small vigilante army, but the Creeper proves that he's not the type of demon that can easily get killed. There's also a weird and confusing sub plot with Meg Foster (who actually looks scarier than the Creeper) receiving messages from her murdered son regarding the monster's origins, but that leads absolutely nowhere. \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" lacks tension, likeable characters and genuine menace coming from the Creeper character. Suspense & atmosphere were two things that parts 1 and 2 had plenty of, and therefore they still stand as modest genre classics. Considering the exaggeratedly long pre-production phase and the overall weakness of the third installment, I don't think a \"Jeepers Creepers 4\" is desirable, though."

But that's enough about HIM\u2014let's get on with talking about the film\u0085\n\nThis third entry in the Jeepers Creepers series stars Gabrielle Haugh as Addison, who finds herself gathered up and thrown into the back of the rusty old truck owned by 'The Creeper' (Jonathan Breck), who has returned after 23 years to once again feed on unwary teenagers. Out to try and rescue her is Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing) who isn't happy about Addison being snatched away before he can declare his love for her.\n\nAn incredibly muddled script, sloppy editing, dreadful CGI, a seemingly invincible creature that drives a cartoonish vehicle loaded with booby traps and a range of fancy weaponry (including a Creeper\u0099 javelin, Creeper\u0099 shuriken, and Creeper\u0099 homing road mines), and loads of unanswered questions (despite suggesting that we might at last be given some facts about the monster's origin): JC3 is an extremely disappointing sequel in almost every way imaginable.\n\nWhatever your opinion of director Victor Salva as a person, it's hard to deny that he can turn out a fairly decent film when he really tries, but this one feels like little more than a life-less cash-in to bleed money from avid fans. If you're looking for revolting gore or decent scares, definitely look elsewhere: this one has neither (unless you count Meg Foster's frightening countenance. Old age can be a cruel mistress)."

Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) and a team of Creeper-hunters hook-up with Sgt. Tubbs (Brandon Smith) to destroy the flying creature as it terrorizes a farming community in the South. Meg Foster and Gabrielle Haugh appear as a troubled grandmother and mopey granddaughter respectively. Chester Rushing plays the latter's wannabe boyfriend.\n\nI can see why some would be disappointed by this flick: (1.) The story opens in an unnecessarily convoluted manner. (2.) Until the climax, the Creeper appears mostly in broad daylight, which naturally takes away from the creature's mystique. (3.) The Creeper now has his own eye-rolling 'Mystery Machine' with built-in weapons and defenses. (4.) While the movie teases us with explaining the Creeper's origins, it doesn't deliver. Instead, the ending (with a cameo from Gina Philips from the first installment) is a lead-in to a possible fourth movie.\n\nAddressing these criticisms: (1.) While it's true that the story begins in a convoluted manner, everything eventually comes together and makes sense, sort of. (2.) Yes, the Creeper loses his mystique, but the daytime sequences can be defended on the grounds that the Creeper only has 23 days every 23 years to conduct his diabolical business; thus it makes sense that he'd be active day and night, not just night. Besides, there are several night scenes. (3.) I agree that the Creeper's vehicle is too cartoony and it takes away from any sense of genuine horror, but it provides the opportunity for some slasher thrills. (4.) I was anticipating discovering the secrets of the monster and so was disappointed that its genesis wasn't explained, BUT this compels me to see the next (and presumably final) movie, IF there is one.\n\nIn other news, the female cast is scant, but Gabrielle Haugh certainly makes up for it with her tight jeans in the last 10-15 minutes, lol.\n\nTHE FILM RUNS 100 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana (St. Francisville, New Roads, Ethyl, Jackson and Baton Rouge).\n\nGRADE: C+"

As revealed in the comics, the Creeper's evil goes back millennia, demanding Human Sacrifice and having wiped out the local farming community. The Creeper relishes tormenting its victims physically or mentally, and shows no care at its actions once accidentally causing an entire town to be destroyed. Shortly after the events of the first 'Jeepers Creepers' film, the police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies. It results to be a bizarre truck owned the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) which appears each new 23rd spring, after several years. The truck has been rigged with several booby-traps, including spikes that emerge from the bed of the truck, and a safety system composed of 2 internal sabers and a spear that is ejected from the rear , shooting out from the tail-pipe , in addition to some poles in the doors . After a massacre Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) arrives, Sergeant Davis Tubbs (Brandon Smith) tells him what happened and Tashtego informs him that the Creeper has been around for thousands of years and must be stopped. Tubbs assembles a task force to destroy the Creeper and they are travelling across the rural South to meet him once and for all , while growing closer than ever before to learning the secrets of its dark origins. He needs humans for a good barbecue and some young riders are menaced by the murderous maniac Creeper, they then flee and looking for to save their own skin , when the cannibal go after them things go awry . Meanwhile, the monster terrorizes a local farm inhabited by Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) and her granddaughter Addison Brandon (Gabrielle Haugh) . The Creeper regularly slaughters all in its path, target or not, and demonstrates utter sadistic relish in every evil it commits. Every 23rd Spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat. Welcome to day 23. This summer feed your fear. Are you hungry for more? The Creeper is back for more. By the time you hear him, by the time you see him it's too late. Like a bat out of hell. He can taste your fear. Feed the Fear. Its time has come. Third Time's the Charm. Fear the Creeper. It's coming...and it's hungry. Something Wicked Has Returned .\n\nThis exciting movie with original monster , displays terror, suspense , cannibalism , thrills, and lots of blood and gore . The genuinely scary monster packs an excellent make-up, is played by Jonathan Breck who gives a real chill as the horrible creature , furthermore appears the veteran Stan Shaw who confronts Creeper along with Brandon Smith who appeared in the first entry as Sergeant Tubbs . So Brandon Smith and Jonathan Breck reprise their roles, while Gina Philips has a brief cameo at the end as Patricia \"Trish\" Jenner. The Shuriken of Bones that the Creeper used was made from cattle bones that were carved, varnished and welded . The motion picture was regularly written and shot by the franchise director, Victor Salva, he tries for profundity at the end and blow it . Salva is an expert on suspense's creator of atmospheres, such as he proved in : 'The nature of the beast\u00a8, \u00a8Powder\u00a8, \u00a8Rites of passage\u00a8 and \u00a8Clownhouse\u00a8. This director is a craftsman who usually makes a cameo appearance in his movies.\n\nThe saga is formed by the following ones : \u00a8Jeepers Creepers\u00a8 (2001) with Jenner brothers, named Patricia: Gina Philips and Derry: Justin Long , Jonathan Breck, Patricia Belcher , Brandon Smith, Eileen Brennan. \u00a8Jeepers Creepers 2\u00a8 (2002) with Ray Wise , Eric Nenninger , Nicki Aycox , Travis Schiffner, Lena Cardwell in which Gina Philips turned down the chance to reprise her role from the first Jeepers Creepers movie, but Justin Long has a cameo . \u00a8Jeepers Creepers 3\u00a8(2017) , though it is set between the first and second film. \u00a8Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\u00a8 (2022) by Timo Vuorensola, stars : Sydney Craven, Imran Adams, Jarreau Benjamin."

This has all of the look and feel of a TV Movie, or a low budget film that was sent straight to DVD.\n\nThe story is utterly lame. There are no shocks in it. It is not creepy in any way. This time, we see an awful lot more of the Creeper and the film-makers have seemingly tried to give it some \"character\" or even some \"back story\". This was such an error.\n\nThe reason that the first film makes you jump, is because you don't see too much of the Creeper, and know almost nothing about what it is or what it's capabilities are. This changed in JC II - which in part was more of a comedy horror film than an all-out shock-fest, where it was demonstrated that he could be brought down with a large harpoon in the chest, and subsequently in the head (not a spoiler as JC II is 14 years old!).\n\nReleasing this nonsense, that supposedly sits between JC and JC II in the timeline makes no sense and offers a few more tricks on the part of the Creeper (various weapons that appear from the truck during the film) to \"spice things up\", but in fact it fails epicly to deliver anything new that's in anyway creepy or scary. Everything is predictable. There are no shocks.\n\nOh, and what was going on with that cameo from Gina Phillips (not a spoiler as she's named in the credits)? A film that takes place \"a day or two\" after the original JC (2001), where Gina is supposedly now a day or two older, but is in fact 16 years older and no longer looks like a teenager (she was in fact in her very early 30's when playing a late teenager in the original JC!), but she now looks like a woman in her 40's (because she is in fact 47 now), but is still trying to pass herself off as a few days older than her persona in the original JC? That was simply moronic.\n\nThe acting overall is lame and lifeless (Stan Shaw - what happened to you man?). The actors are entirely unable to convey any sense of peril or fear. This is making low-rent movies by the numbers, and I hope it made a big loss so that they don't make anymore of this nonsense.\n\nWhat should they done? Picked up after where JCII ended, with an aged Ray Wise and his son ready to take it on right from the get-go in their barn and see where that went when it awoke - 23 years later.\n\nJC III as a storyline was such an error. I fear for JC IV which apparently has been written. If it's set in the same time period, this will be an error too.\n\nPS - have a think about where some of these weapons are appearing from on the truck. It's just stupid, if weapons and defence mechanisms entirely defy the laws of Physics. (The Creeper flying not included in this of course!)"

Build up. Real, genuine scares, not cheap jump scenes! And don't get me started on the Creeper! Also, the cast of the first film does an amazing job. Just unbelievable!\n\nAnd we skip part 2 in order to reach the 3rd one faster: cartoon characters that do nothing more than die. Horrible special effects, complete lack of belief in the monster and let's not forget the new add on to the series: booby traps! All over! As many as possible! And of course the Creeper itself gets these new uber powers, him and his truck also. He becomes something like Hulk in an Iron man suit I think.\n\nOverall, if you are a die hard fan of the series, you'll watch this no matter what. It feels like after Alien 1 and 2, they throw in Alien 3. And they expect you to like it as well. Just go with it..\n\nAll in all, a fourth movie is in talks. It looks like they chose to return to form. Problem is this one did so bad, I'm pretty sure the hype will die out. Even finance should be a problem. They can't use the same camera work they did in this one. It's a disaster. And so many cut scenes it feels like the job is just not finished yet. Seems more like a sneak preview.\n\nNow you've been warned. It is as bad as they say it is.\n\nCheers!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This underrated horror series is not going to appeal to all tastes, but this third installment absolutely delivers the goods for fans of the series. The Creeper returns, as does Jonathan Breck playing The Creeper, with series writer/director Victor Salva recounting the events between the first two films, which involves a small town sheriff and a team of Creeper Hunters led by Stan Shaw taking down this flesh and blood urban legend. I think what I like most about this series is that it's basically a straightforward monster movie set-up, but each film stands apart from the one preceding it. The first film was more of a creepy \"Children of the Corn\" like rural urban legend story. The second film was more of an action packed horror suspense film. This third film combined those two elements, adding onto the lore surrounding The Creeper while also providing a number of suspenseful and scary action set pieces. The budget on \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" is noticeably smaller than the previous films, but it's nonetheless an effective horror film that's filled with suspense, action, and send-a-chill-up-your-spine horror imagery. It's also a lot of fun to see the return of the BEATINGU truck driven by The Creeper from the first film. Overall, the third entry is not as frightening as the first film and is not as large of scale as the second film, and is easily the weakest of the three, but it's still a wildly fun horror film for genre fans."

He is ,as others have said,too human.There was nothing human about him in the first two movies.The kill scenes are completely left out....instead of leaving the monster mysterious,they leave the kill scenes out! My favorite of the three movies is the second one because of all the gory and creative kill scenes. This installment is a continuation of the first movie,which i thought would be interesting but there were too many sub plots..none of them interesting.I never cared about any of the characters.I hate a movie that drags out sub plots.Again i have to say my biggest complaint is the monster himself.....why did they make him seem like a human serial killer? Why did they drag out the sub plots instead of setting up an interesting movie from the beginning? I shut the movie off three quarters of the way through..i didn't care to see the ending."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Best Jeepers Creepers film to date. Alright. I'm not going to spoil nothing so go see the film October 4th again.. The film was a complete homage to the first two Creepers films. Mostly, the first one. It was way darker and had more kills than ever.. We even almost got close to finding out the Creepers true origins that could be the secret to killing him ( Hopefully, Not). All of the characters had a connection to the Creeper that made it more interesting then the first one.The acting in the film was decent. The film moved very fast and was an excitement. And Gina Phillips cameo makes you really want to see Jeepers Creepers 4. Just hopefully they bring Meg Foster back for Part 4 because she made the film for me, she was a riot and those eyes are amazing! As a filmmaker of horror myself I condemn the history of Salva. And have seen every film he has made and think he has more of a vision then these crappy so-called filmmakers now. At lease it wasn't a complete remake more like a Prequel/Sequel. I hope they make the fourth film and keep it going until Part 12. If Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th can have a hundred sequels and remakes they should do it for the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Great Film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Being a fan of the first two installments, I had been looking forward to this third film for years but the release had been delayed multiple times and once it got released it received overtly negative reviews. The film wasn't played in any movie theater near me and once it got released it cost thirty bucks which was way too much in my opinion. I had to wait until very recently to pick the film up for ten bucks and didn't have any expectations anymore at that point.\n\nAs it turns out, Jeepers Creepers 3 is much better than its reputation. It isn't as atmospheric, creepy and intense as the first film but it's clearly better than the odd second installment in my opinion. A lot of people criticized that the film follows too many characters. I actually think this is a strength that keeps the movie diversified, entertaining and even surprising from start to finish. The different characters also have enough depth to convince. We follow cool black Sheriff Dan Tashtego and a group of citizens who want to see the titular monster dead because they have lost family members and friends to it twenty-three years earlier. Other parts of the movie focus on sharpshooter Sergeant Davis Tubbs who sees his police officers decimated by the mysterious creatures. We encounter mentally unstable farmer Gaylen Brandon who has lost her son to the creature. We meet her solitary granddaughter from a broken family who tries to defy the monster's attacks with the help of a young gentleman who has a love interest in her. The movie also shows what happens to the rude brother of the granddaughter's best friend and his three mates who go on a fateful biking trip. Despite all these story lines, the movie never loses focus or momentum as everything revolves around the titular monster and its gruesome actions. One could actually say the monster is the lead character here.\n\nAnother element I liked is the importance of the monster's vehicle in this film. It is filled with traps that prevent victims from escaping and others to get inside the vehicle. The vehicle almost seems to be an otherworldly entity which adds a fresh mysterious touch to the franchise.\n\nThe film is set between the first and the second installment which some people criticized. However, the movie connects all three movies and their characters very well. It gives some more background information on the creature without revealing too much which would be fatal for such a horror franchise.\n\nThe movie oozes with atmosphere since numerous scenes are set in the disgusting vehicle and because the titular monster gets a lot of screen time and is seen flying, investigating, killing, running and smelling in order to get as many victims as possible. Even though most parts of the movie take place during the day, the film manages to evoke a creepy atmosphere.\n\nDespite an abysmal budget, the movie is filmed with care. The special effects look solid and never too artificial. The camera work is calm and not shaky. The sound effects blend in very well. The soundtrack is appropriately chosen for this type of movie. The actresses and actors deliver overall realistic performances.\n\nHowever, the film also has its flaws. First of all, the film fails to surprise and is missing some intriguing twists and turns. The story could have been more imaginative. The conclusion is rather underwhelming and indicates that there might or might not be a sequel at a certain time which is frustrating after a waiting time of a decade and a half between the second and the third installment.\n\nSecondly, the movie has a creepy atmosphere but is missing some truly horrifying scares that made especially the first part so intense. This third entry focuses on character development but fails to elaborate upon its horror elements. One could rather describe this film as drama with supernatural elements.\n\nThirdly, the movie obviously hasn't met everybody's expectations and one could have expected something more spectacular after such a long waiting time. The film feels as if it were mostly just trying to cash in on the commercial success of the first two features instead of bringing anything new to the franchise. Don't get me wrong, Jeepers Creepers 3 is still an enjoyable movie in my book, but the delivery is too safe to leave a deeper impression after all.\n\nIn the end, fans of the franchise should ignore the overtly negative reviews and give this film a fair try without any unrealistic expectations. I'm glad the movie finally saw the light of day and was positively surprised by it. I can't wait to watch the three films in a row in the near future."

This guy is exceptionally good at what he does. It is probably best to keep him away from young boys. It was probably best to keep Charles Dodgson (Lewis Caroll) away from young girls also.

I actually fell asleep from sheer boredom. Yep, the movie was that boring.\n\nThe only reason why I am rating this third installment of \"Jeepers Creepers\" a four out of ten stars rating is because of the special effects, the creature design, and also because there was a fair amount of killing in the movie.\n\nHowever, and let's be bluntly honest, \"Jeepers Creepers III\" is not really worth the effort."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jeepers.\n\nThe first two \"Jeepers Creepers\" movies are vastly underrated classics, in my opinion \u2014 they're well scripted and boast a truly original and frightening bogeyman. The third, regrettably, struggles to retain even a B movie charm. It's a substandard horror film that I'd only grudgingly rate a 4 out of 10.\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers 3\" (2017) is cloddishly written and awkwardly filmed. The film also suffers from action sequences that are absolutely cartoonish. A lot of this stems from the titular Creeper's antique vehicle, which is now inexplicably depicted as being \u0085 conscious? Possessed by the Creeper? It drives itself, deflects bullets, launches projectiles, and contains booby traps that defy physics. This leads to some Wile E. Coyote-style fight scenes with the story's various protagonists, in which the saddest victim is the franchise's credibility.\n\nAbout those protagonists \u2014 there are far too many to examine with any real success; the two ostensible teenage main characters fall a bit flat. There are so many characters that have backstories connected with the Creeper (and his signature, decades-hopping supernatural murder sprees) that the film simply becomes confusing. And that confusion is made worse by this film's chronology with the previous movies \u2014 it takes place immediately after the first, but before the events of the second. (In all fairness, maybe the problem is me \u0085 I am being quite honest when I write here that I just do not follow movies as well as other people.)\n\nWith all of this exposition, though, one bit of lore is egregiously omitted \u2013 contrary to some of the movie's advance press, we learn nothing about the creature's origins. And this is extremely odd, because a bunch of characters do. There is a befuddling central plot point where the good guys methodically gain knowledge of their otherworldly foe by \u0085 touching one of its severed body parts. But we, the viewers, learn nothing.\n\nEven the makeup and special effects were inferior to the prior films.\n\nI'm confused by all of the things I've written above, as \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" was written and directed by Victor Salva, who wrote and directed the excellent previous movies in 2001 and 2003.\n\nI hope I'm not being too hard on the movie, because there's still some fun to be had. Jonathan Breck still chews the scenery quite nicely as the Creeper, and the monster's character concept still manages to please. In a horror movie market often dominated by seemingly interchangeable serial killers and undead little girls, the Creeper is a truly inventive monster \u2014 part human; part gargoyle; part body-stealing feral, Frankenstein's monster. He's fun to watch, particularly for horror fans who've grown tired of the Patrick Batemans and the various angry ghost children that endlessly haunt the zeitgeist. You could do a lot worse for a plot-driving antagonist.\n\nAnd, thanks to so brutal a bad guy, there are occasional moments of tension in the movie. It's genuinely scary, for example, when he attacks a group of teenaged motorcyclists.\n\nThis isn't enough to make recommend paying for the movie, however \u2014 even if you're a fan of the franchise, as I am. I'd wait for \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" to hit Netflix or Hulu, or wait until it's playing on SyFy again."

BEATNGU, the creeper's vehicle has a bunch of new magic powers and is the main \"bad guy\" of this tale. And the makers of this film really Sharknadoed it, meaning the special effects are terrible and completely fake looking. The only scary thing is Meg Foster's appearance. Don't waste your time - just watch the first 5 minutes and then the last 5 minutes, and you'll see all that you \"need\" to see."

        "review_detailed_main": "Long-awaited after over a decade of rumored production starts and stops, \"Jeepers Creepers III\" follows a small town battling the Creeper during his feeding time. A group of people with intimate connections to the Creeper bond together to stop him.\n\nSeeing the first \"Jeepers Creepers\" in theaters as a junior high schooler was something of formative experience for me, and while I don't think the original is a perfect film, it is finely-crafted. The sequel was good (but not great), and this third installment is unfortunately worse. The production values here are clearly hurting\u2014it shows in the special effects particularly, which are both hokey CGI and poor practical effects. It's not surprising to me that many fans of this series have complained about the villain's appearance (which in and of itself is overstated). His face shows on screen more like a mask than anything else, and the monster now has an arsenal of elaborate weapons and his truck now built with souped-up security features that rival those of Fort Knox.\n\nThat's not even the half of it though. The main problem with \"Jeepers Creepers III\" is that it's spread far too thin, with its script juggling multiple plot lines ineffectively. There are too many characters, too many subplots, and not enough time to connect them in any meaningful way. It becomes weirdly episodic until the last third of the film, and even then, it all seems arbitrary. It almost feels as though Salva was writing the film as he went along, cramming as much as he possibly could for the series' swan song. Even weirder is the attempt to tether the film between the first and the second, which seems narratively inconsistent and tonally unbalanced if nothing else.\n\nMeg Foster has the most interesting character in the film, and she is without a doubt the best actress here. The younger supporting cast are serviceable but nothing to write home about; Stan Shaw is also likable as the sheriff and chief hunter of the monster. The finale is rather dull as well, with pacing that resembles everything that's led up to it.\n\nIn the end, \"Jeepers Creepers III\" is a weak followup to two rather good horror films. The visual effects and repeated slow-motion scenes wear on the senses, and there are far too many narrative strands to accommodate in a runtime under ninety minutes. It is somewhat amusing overall, but ultimately looks and feels like a television film, and fails to offer anything aside from a few mildly fun vignettes. Foster's performance is far better than the material demands, and that is one of the film's few additional strong suits. 5/10."

It's actually kind of a shock to me that they are actually playing it over here in my country, Malaysia! First of all, I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this movie and also about the director's past. Anyway, I'm not here to do a review of the director's life. I'm here to do a review of this third chapter in the series. It's a direct sequel to the first chapter and it's really scary good, with eerie elements from part 1 and straight up action from part 2. It combines great performances from the legendary Meg Foster as Gaylen Brandon, Stan Shaw as Sheriff Dan Tashtego, the one and only Jonathan Breck, reprising his role as The Creeper, and also a big surprise cameo at the end. The practical effects were awesome and the CGI effects were not that bad, compared to a lot of the overrated bullshit that Hollywood produces in this day and age. I really loved the scenes where the scary stuff is happening in daylight, with action-packed and heart pounding scenes. Plus, some of the scenes were captured in slow motion, which I thought was really cool. It's really great to see an old- school horror flick on the big screen after a long time and I really hope there's a part 4."

The storyline was terribly written, there were many plot holes (especially, about the chronological order of the movies). The characters weren't well-developed and they weren't interesting, at all. In my opinion, it's the worst movie of the franchise. Also, the killcount was awful. There weren't many kills and most of them, weren't bloody and gory. The opening scene of the movie wasn't good. Overall, it was a silly movie, that I still don't understand how it was connected with the previous movies. Moreover, it was so boring (especially, the last 40 minutes). The ending wasn't very well explained, it was so complicated. Actually, I didn't really care what was gonna happen, lol. Anyway, I'm really hyped about the 4th film of the franchise \"Jeepers Creepers : Reborn\" and I hope it's gonna be good..! Last but not least, the keeper's appearance wasn't really good."

Jeepers Creepers II was a worthy sequel, it didn't have the shock value of the first, but it kept the legend alive and hope was put in for a third. This third instalment gave me the same feeling as tasting the new reduced sugar strawberry Ribena for the first time, knowing what you had for years and then the realisation that someone destroyed it. Simply put, Jeepers Creepers was something amazing to build on, part three is destroying the Creeper legend, taking all the goodness out and leaving you with a bad taste."

Until midway, the film is fine. Nothing special, but rather bland fare. This I can stomach. The second half? Be ready for leaps of logic, physics, and honestly: cartoonish plot devices. Wiley Coyote Acme branded \"tools\" , \"weapons\" and a vehicle. Added to the nonsense; cartoonish and pretty terrible special effects for these parts of the movie. I literally fell out of my chair laughing at what was totally meant to be serious. The ridiculousness spoiled the entire movie for me, and made this an avoidable movie for anyone not a fan of unintentional farce. I am actually a fan of really bad movies, but you can't start this garbage midway thru a movie that you are striving to make serious. This is actually STUPID all in caps. I will avoid this writer/director combo in the future."

Of course it wasn't shown, because even the writers don't know. They can't think of anything that would make sense. And how could they? What possible \"origin\" can be thought of about a creature that it's one of it's kind, can't die and apparently uses magic (he extends his arm from a far, body lifts up and the axe goes back to it)? There is no \"origin\" for that. And the ones who \"saw it\", still couldn't figure out how to kill it. Because even the writers don't know how to kill it. They created such a character that even they can't figure out. As a writer myself - that must hurt, especially with a large fan base that expects explanations, which they can't give.\n\nBtw, poor dude that plays Creeper. I'm sure after 2 movies, he got to know his character. And now he couldn't play the REAL Creeper, but this poor sad sack that just whines and growls for literally no reasons whatsoever. He couldn't even do \"sniff and pick\". They made him go around killing people for fun, even though Creepers DOESN\"T do that! He kills who he wants to eat and who is useful to him... doesn't kill teens on bikes for joy and amusement! Dude, sorry you had to play this character like that. When the script comes and you still want to have a job after reading it - you agree even if you don't like it."

It just isn't a good one either. Bottom end of average in my opinion. It is an acceptable brain-in-neutral, watch it once. forgettable horror flick. Apparently this one is set between parts 1 and 2, so a tad confusing to those of us who are not big Creeper fans. We see way too much of him, and most of the film takes place in daylight, reducing any sort of scary atmosphere. Some of the CGI effects are on par with an average Sci-Fi channel movie, in particular a rolling truck that looks truly awful. Is there or will there be a part 4? I for one don't really care."

Victor Salva, the director of this creation, delayed the third part for a very long time, they say that due to personal circumstances. The third part takes place between the first and the second, which is a little strange.\n\nThe plot is that the winged monster returns every 23rd spring, dissecting on his rusty truck and terrifying all living things. It is in this part of Jeepers Creepers that they will show in all its glory, it will appear before the audience in daylight, a grin, a look, gestures, all this can be considered. The truck has also undergone changes, in general, you will see everything for yourself.\n\nIn the center of the plot is a young girl Eddie, who lives on a farm with her grandmother, the woman suffers from mental disorders, her main goal is to save her granddaughter and take revenge on the clawed monster.\n\nA group of people are trying to confront Jeepers Creepers, how will the battle end?\n\nThe third part does not reach the first and second parts, I still wanted more horror, but in general I liked the film, and perhaps those who were in the subject and followed the story will like it. I was very pleased with the acting. There are practically no moments when they do not play out or overplay. Everything will be here, intrigue, confusing meaning, a logical plot and a very unexpected ending. My rating is 10 stars. It is up to you to decide whether or not to go to the cinema, the film can already be found on the Internet. I recommend Jeepers Creepers Part 3 to watch."

Sadly, the other user commenters are correct; this is simply not a good movie at all. I could go on for some time listing what is wrong with this movie, such as the sub-par CGI effects, the absurd abilities of the Creeper, and some really incompetently directed moments. But the biggest problem I had with the movie was that it had a really inconsistent tone and feel. First, the screenplay feels like it was assembled from pieces from two (or more) different screenplays. The story goes way over the map, with lots of padding as well as half-baked plot threads and character arcs. Likewise, the movie also feels like it was directed by two (or more) people. There isn't a consistent feel to the movie, and as a result it's hard to get involved with what you are seeing because you don't quite know how you should feel. The only real positive thing to say about the end results is that the photography is pretty good for what had to be a limited budget. But that's not anywhere enough for me to want to see a \"Jeepers Creepers 4\"."

After watching the new JC: Reborn last night in cinemas and rewatching JC3 right now, it does not deserve a low rating that it has received. This film does deliver; good story, acting and ties together 1&2 well whilst setting up the next film quite well. It is sad to say that we may never see a worthy conclusion due to controversy surrounding Victor Salva. By no means should this controversy surround such a great franchise."

Now, for the rest of us who are loyal to the original which was sensational and some of the second film, this one is a letdown. However haters want to describe it unfortunately for you the fourth which got pushed back is on its way this year after the lockdown and so the movies can't be as bad as the uninterested would imply.\n\nThe third in question was shot in broad day light mostly, which was intended to be more realistic and eerie with more memorable horror moments. Of course this didn't happen. This time the local characters battle Creepers by eventually forming a last minute plot to kill it, the problem isn't just that the characters impetuousness does not happen as fast or effective as it should or the needless dialogue, the problem is mainly they lost the intensity, the hairs on neck raising fear factor the original had and therefore instead what we got was more like a low budget college made film with dodgy acting.\n\nHopefully the fourth will be better suited to what the usual horror marathon quick to judge keyboard warriors will approve of. These people didn't like the first two not just this one. Actually the fact of the matter is we needed a better film for the time gone without one as the concept and fear factor didn't come off this time but the movie isn't quite as bad as people would describe and for anyone falsely stating none of the three films made you jump out your skin at some point it's clearly just a lie or you didn't watch it properly.\n\nThree out of ten. So It's still fairly bad though let's face it just not to the one out of ten people scored it as. Still, the fourth will be better after the former characters come and get me plea. Right..."

Like the creeper having magic abilities that just automatically make weapons show up in his hands.\n\nThe beatngu truck, also had stupid magical abilities.\n\nThe creeper no longer had his personalty nor did any other characters.\n\nWhat really pisses me off is that they dug up his hand and it apparently has magical abilities that lets who ever touched it, know it's secrets and what is and crap. So a bunch of people touch it and all they find out is that it gets to eat every 23 years.\n\nWE ALREADY KNEW THAT !!! From the first film even !\n\nSo we find out nothing about it. The film literally had no ending at all.\n\nActing sucks, no story or plot. Characters sucked. Special effects sucked. Everything sucked.\n\nBy the 3rd quarter of the film I didn't know if I was supposed to be laughing, like is it a drama/comedy ?\n\nAlso all the bad words and who knows what else is edited out. Pretty much no night scenes. All broad daylight.\n\nAnd what is with the vampire skull hanging in the beatngu truck ? Why was that never explained ?\n\n15 years for a stupid syfy TV movie.

Except some fantastic cinematography and creative direction, the rest of the film didn't hold up like the previous two entries. The VFX was horrendous and the low budget was a hindrance.

The problem is that the Creeper is too over exposed in broad daylight most of the movie, which makes it look funny and less threatening when he is attacking people.\n\nThe acting in the movie is not good, and the characters make dumb choices that I was getting me annoyed most of the time. The characters do not have good dialogue and I was just waiting for the Creeper to kill them in entertaining ways that was stupid but worth looking at.\n\nThere are slow moments and random moments that would happen. There are uses of CGI that I noticed that looked fake and less practical, it is also laughable to look at especially on how obvious the CGI looks bad looking and obvious in how they use it along with weird editing.\n\nJeepers Creepers 3 (2017) was not as good as the first two Jeepers Creepers movies, but if you want an entertainingly bad horror movie with over-the-top moments then this movie will give you what you are looking for."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't get me wrong this is absolutely the weakest of one two or three. But the ratings on websites like this are just completely ridiculous. If someone doesn't like a film they just put one. I take ratings on things like this serious because can you talk about for example I feel like the Meg, I hated it. It was horrible compared to the novel. But I'm not going to get butt hurt over the fact that I didn't like it and give it a one because if that film is a one, what is a movie like sharknado? What is a movie like me straight to TV sci-fi movies? Is that a one also? It's just not comparable. If you gave this movie A one, what would you give the newest one? You can't go any lower than one but the newest one was way worse than this. Realistically this movie is probably like a six. Any movie that goes into the theaters is automatically at least a four my biggest issue with this and I think what really ruined this movie the most is the budget. If you give this movie a better budget and it had better graphics, I think this movie is much much better. The story is good the ending kind of sucks but it moves the story forward. Had they made a fourth film that actually had Trish Jenner come back, I think this would have been a good film to develop the story into that. There were definitely some potholes and bad graphics but it was very entertaining and there were some cool kills and we learned some new stuff. I would have changed the ending but aside from that and the bad graphic it was a quality sequel. If you watch the newest one, that was horrible movie. Unfortunately the fans of this franchise are getting punished by the doings of the director. The director's past made it so this movie didn't get a budget or get a full release. Dont get me wrong he is a monster and a horrible person but you can love the work of someone who is a horrible person. If Jeffrey Dahmer painted a beautiful picture, it doesn't take away from the fact that he's a monster but you're allowed to like the picture. I wish the director had just stepped aside and allowed someone to make a proper sequel with Trish Jenner any quality budget but like I said the only one really getting punished for the director's actions, is the fans of this franchise. But I think most people will agree after seeing the newest sequel that this movie wasn't that bad. And I will say one more time if you give this movie a few more million dollars to clean up the graphics and you change the ending a little bit you have a much better film. But even as it is it's much better than a 3.9."

I felt a little lost at first also after not seeing the other films for so many years. It just somehow seemed more silly and less scary than the other two movies. Nothing good enough in it to even make me want to watch it again. The Creeper was far less mysterious than in the past films and was just sort of out there all the time killing everybody compared to the previous movies where he made fewer but far more memorable and scary appearances . Maybe it was because the low budget or just poor writing this time?"
