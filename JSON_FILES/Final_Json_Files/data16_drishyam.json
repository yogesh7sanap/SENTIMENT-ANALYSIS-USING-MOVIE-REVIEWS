Drishyam is a remake of the Malayalam movie by the same title. The movie is nestled in a Goan village, the kind where everyone knows one- another. The protagonist is a middle-class Goan Vijay Salgaonkar( Ajay Devgn) for whom his family's well being is paramount.\n\nAjay plays the role of a 5th class school-dropout who runs a local cable-service provider shop. He is a big movie-buff and spends most of his time at work looking at the motion pictures.  \n\nVijay has a cozy life with his wife Nandini(Shriya Saran) , elder daughter( Ishita Dutta, 'Poonam  from Ek Ghar Banaunga'  & Tanushree Dutta's sister) and younger daughter(Mrinal Jadhav).  The coziness of his family is shattered one night following an offhand chain of events.\n\nVijay's character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white,  right vs wrong, yin vs yang.  His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story.\n\nThe unfateful night's chain of events leads to a massive police search headed by the stern and steely IPS Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).\n\nTabu's acting is top-notch in multiple interrogation  scenes throughout the movie with a distinct no-nonsense persona on display at all times.\n\nIshita Dutta is remarkable in her Bollywood debut with a wide palette of emotions. Mrinal Jadhav plays the role of the innocent and adorable younger daughter splendidly, generating a few interspersed audience laughs.\n\nRajat Kapoor has a knack for playing the upper-class, businessmen \u2013roles and is casted perfectly as Tabu's husband. However his character is a bit monochromatic, probably due to the script.\n\nThe movie has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax.\n\nEven though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.\n\nI strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers.\n\nP.S. The film also teaches you why watching movies can impart you with paramount life-skills. So, definitely a connect with the movie buffs :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.\n\nMy special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move \"Visuals Can Be Deceptive\" The Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu's never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously. Overall, Its 100% worth a watch on this weekend, so go ahead book your tickets and go for it, I am sure you wont be disappointed, specially people who like Ajay Devgn on screen should go for this movie for sure."

Last but not least, Mr. Devgan has done a good job as a father who goes out of his ways to protect his family.\n\nIf you are a Tabu fan, you would regret if you miss this movie.

His portrayal exudes maturity, strategic planning, and unwavering perseverance that sets him apart.

How they try to out do one another. The climax is brilliant.\n\nAjay makes up for the time he was away from serious movies and excels scene by scene, Shriya is gorgeous and does well too. Tabu is menacing and yet a mother aptly supported by Rajat.\n\nIts a must watch!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "What are the necessary requirements for making a good movie? I guess strong acting, realistic judgments made by characters, complementary music and tight pacing are essential elements in achieving this. In all these departments, Drishyam stands head and shoulders over every other Bollywood movie that has come out in this year. Even though it is a remake of a Malyalam movie, there is no loss of quality and it delivered emphatically.\n\nThe essence of the movie is that due to some unexpected turn of events, a normal middle-class family gets itself involved in the missing case of the son of Senior Police Officers. As they never intended to do anything wrong, they decide to forge a story to dupe the police and save themselves.\n\nAjay Devgan and Tabu are the two established actors in this movie, and both of them prove their mettle. It is a welcome change for Ajay Devgan as he has made one bad movie after another despite possessing great acting talent. He plays Vijay who runs a cable TV network and leads a modest life that revolves around his family. Tabu, on the other hand plays the IG officer who is the mother of her missing son. She once again proved that she is the finest actress in Bollywood with a menacing, layered performance that will leave people spellbound.\n\nDrishyam is a suspense movie and the director does well to include several trademark techniques that are used in such movies. The slow- zoom, slick editing and the tense background score all add another dimension to the well-written thriller.\n\nThe movie explores several elements of Indian life such as the rampant corruption of police officers, unyielding devotion to family, and the longing for revenge. Drishyam is a well-made movie that deserves wide recognition for its achievement in making something that everyone can relate with. All the actions that the characters made were justifiable and any other person in that situation would have done the same. I have not revealed much about the movie in this review because you have to see it to understand the power of this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "DRISHYAM REVIEW- Hell yeah, just watched the Masterpiece, gem of thriller. Wow is the only word is in mouth now for this movie. Heard a remake of national award Malayalam movie is coming in bollywood and i was just waiting like anything for this movie. Trailer didn't offered much but it was promising. Then critics reviews came which took my expectations to sky level. And finally after watching it i must say movie worths it. A rare thriller which was made to look realistic only not as filmy masala content. First half takes time to set platform, sets movie plot then 2nd half blows you away with its masterclass planning and scenes. A simple plot, a common man who is 4th std failed not much educated tries to hide his family's crime from so called educated police officers. But the content and screenplay is so realistic that it makes this simple story a masterpiece. Even a Long runtime of 2 hrs 40 mins looks too tight and glues us to Our seat. Writer has done an extraordinary job, people will not forget this story in lifetime. Kudos to him and screenplay maker . Music wasn't much needed for movie,still 1 song after interval is situational which plays important role to make scene much tight. Entire star cast acted like real incident and really made me feel that its all happening in real in front of me. Ajay devgn the man who is the soul of this movie. His acting is just out of the world. Those intense eyes, innocent expressions, scary scenes and some emotional scenes as if this movie made for his acting only. Surely best performance of the year till date and i don't think someone will give better performance than him in this year at least, he deserves an award for this movie. Tabbu role is exactly half to Ajay according to runtime of movie. She did whatever expected from her role. Other star cast did fab job, each and every actor gave his best for their roles. Director Nishikant Kamat proves his skills and talent metal again here. He never left movie's grip till the end. Even the last ending scene of the movie was watchable and gives goosebumps. Hats off to him. He already had remake in hand which made direction much easier so there was no chance to make movie a crap. Overall a must watch for all. Only kids wont understand it, but other audience like classes, masses, youngsters and even seniors will love it. Go for this one, take 3 hrs from your life and enjoy the rare and the best thriller ever made in bollywood. Don't miss, you cant afford to miss this masterpiece. Here we have got the best movie of 2015. Last line, 'Its like,'Shawshank Redemption in bollywood. 9/10 * stars by me :)"

Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), the father, must do everything he can to keep his family from going to prison, utilizing every legal and illegal trick he has learned as a lifelong movie buff.\n\nA fine example of how a good script can elevate a movie. Because to be honest the acting is not a strength of this film. Devgn is very good, which helps a lot, as is Tabu as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, but all the rest are either rather wooden or a bit too over the top.\n\nBut that doesn't really matter because it's really a movie about Devgn's character and how he continuously outsmarts the police. The greatest thrill of the film is finding out just how long he can keep up the juggling act without Tabu's character finally nailing him to the wall.\n\nAnd it's a good juggling act. The classic crime thrillers are more about \"who did it\", but this is a great example of a smaller subgenre tentatively called \"will they get caught\". And in executing the conventions of that subgenre is where this film shines.\n\nRecommended. Especially if you're looking for a Hindi film that's about more than singing, dancing and jumping around."

        "review_detailed_main": "With all honesty, the Hindi version of DRISHYAM gives me no energy to write about it in details being the weakest 4th remake of the original Malayalam film featuring Mohan Lal in the lead.\n\nUsing a fresh backdrop and a local feel it has got its impressive moments that obviously come in the final hour when the proceedings become high paced, intense and brutal too with police interrogation crossing all its extreme limits at the orders of its own IG. But at the same time, it doesn't make any change in its slow first half, following the fixed format that was also pointed out as the weaker portions of the original by few critics. Still, despite the not so happening first hour, one might like it as a crime thriller that doesn't allow the viewers to move in its concluding hour, offering many unexpected twists and turns keeping them thoroughly engrossed.\n\nHowever it's the missing emotions, lack of energy or fire, average performances, a loud-inconsistent background score, avoidable spoon- feeding and few unnecessary (ridiculous) commercial insertions that don't let you rate the film more than anything above average or decent. Thankfully they use only two songs out of four (in the soundtrack) as required but fail to en-cash on the emotional aspect of the script that should ideally have been its key feature becoming a 'family- thriller'.\n\nAs a bitter truth, the theme of the film didn't require any kind of philosophical soundtrack both Vishal and Gulzar are known for. The weak acts of Shriya Saran, kids and more contribute a lot in its feeble impact. Plus confirming my doubts Ajay Devgn remains a miscast in the role of a clever minded, cinema loving father guarding his small family. Moreover the most disappointing feature remains Tabu, who doesn't come up with anything even close to what was being expected quite surprisingly, whereas Kamlesh Sawant as the cruel sub- inspector scores the most.\n\nIn comparative terms, it seems DRISHAYM (Hindi) has been made hurriedly in some kind of available time with the star or team, without giving any major emphasis on solid characterizations as seen in the original. In clear words, where in all the four regional films, the actors seem like sinking deep into their given characters, the Hindi version has them all doing it as another of their professional assignment standing in front of the camera with no home-work done of any sort to play their given roles. Mentioning it specifically I didn't find any concerning FATHER in Ajay Devgn or a MOTHER in either Shriya or Tabu disappointingly, that was supposed to be the main requirement of the script as my personal conclusion. So would suggest to go for the original Malayalam film first if you wish to enjoy the subject more in the right manner.\n\nNote: Hope after DRISHYAM many passionate Hindi filmgoers get enlightened that in reality our Indian Regional movies and makers are miles ahead than the present mainstream Hindi Cinema in all respects."

There is NO police in the world that can do that. There was no evidence, no witnesses, not even hint to suggest that the family was guilty, yet the detective just \"knew\" that they were guilty. Makes zero sense at all.\n\nIt's also ridiculous how the detective says \"we can't put them through a lie detector test without a court order\" but she has no problem torturing them in police station. I guess it's perfectly legal to torture people to force them to confess but not put them through lie detector test.\n\nWho cares about common sense anyways."

        "review_detailed_main": "Drishyam is a gripping Mystery Thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The film revolves around an ordinary man, Vijay (Ajay Devgn), whose peaceful life is turned upside down when a tragic incident puts his family in grave danger.\n\nThe film's brilliance lies in its exploration of a father's love and his ability to manipulate situations to his advantage. Vijay, an ordinary man, transforms into a formidable opponent against the relentless police force led by IG Meera Deshmukh.\n\nThe core of the film lies in the intense cat-and-mouse game between Vijay and the relentless police officer, IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu). The screenplay is meticulously crafted, building suspense with every scene. The film explores the depths of a father's love and the lengths he will go to protect his family.\n\n*Stellar Performances :\n\n* Ajay Devgn once again proves that why is he the most intense actor of Bollywood. Ajay Devgn delivers a career-best performance as the ordinary man turned extraordinary protector. His portrayal of Vijay is nuanced and believable. His transformation from a mild-mannered cable operator to a master manipulator is a testament to Ajay Devgn's acting prowess. His character is layered, with a complex interplay of love, fear, and ingenuity.\n\n* Tabu is equally impressive as the determined police officer. A formidable force, Meera is a complex character driven by maternal instinct and professional duty. Tabu's portrayal of a woman torn between grief and justice is captivating. Her character adds depth and complexity to the narrative. Her character adds depth to the narrative by challenging Vijay's every move. The cat-and-mouse game between Vijay and Meera is the heart of the film.\n\nThe crux of the story revolves around the disposal of the victim's body in a compost pit, a gruesome detail that adds to the film's suspense. Vijay's cleverness in creating a false alibi and misleading the police is both admirable and terrifying.\n\nThe music in Drishyam plays a pivotal role in creating the film's tense atmosphere. The background score, often subtle yet impactful, enhances the emotional undercurrents of the narrative. It builds suspense, intensifies confrontations, and underscores the characters' inner turmoil. While the film's focus is primarily on its gripping storyline and character development, the music acts as a silent partner, elevating the overall cinematic experience.\n\nThe film's climax is a testament to the director's skill in maintaining suspense until the very end. While the truth is eventually revealed, it's the journey to that point that keeps the audience engaged. The climax is particularly satisfying, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.\n\nDrishyam is more than just a thriller; it's a study of human psychology. The film explores the power of imagination and the lengths people can go to when pushed to their limits.\n\nDrishyam is a masterclass in suspense and storytelling. It's a film that will leave you questioning your own ability to think under pressure. Film is a must-watch for fans of the thriller genre. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. If you haven't watched this Masterpiece, Please do yourself a favor, stop reading reviews of this film, go and watch this absolute mind blowing thriller which is rare gem of Indian cinema."

As later on the story took a 180 turn and started escalation from interesting to the whole new level of awesomeness and interest. I don't care if its a copied version of some movie or not, but hats off to the writer/screen writer! Acting was top notch from all characters, not even a single one, whether a big famous actor, or side roll; small time actors; everyone acted to the nearest of perfection. My best movie so far, story wise. Literally it blew off 3 Idiots, PK, Bajrangi etc. from my top lists A must watch..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Drishyam is a Hindi remake of a Tamil monster blockbuster. I have not seen the latter so I can't make the comparison (but I have just found out that the Tamil movie with English subtitles is on YouTube ... Yeah!).\n\nVijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) runs a cable TV network in a remote and hilly village of Goa. He lives a happy life with his wife Nandini and two daughters. A 4th grade dropout & an orphan, Vijay has worked his way towards success with his sheer hard-work & street smartness in order to provide for his family who mean the world to him. A man of few means & needs; Vijay believes life is to be lived simplistically - his wife, while she loves him devoutly, wants Vijay's thrifty & miserly behavior to end and wants the world for her family. If there's one thing that Vijay cannot live without, it is his passion for watching films. Such is his 'filmy' obsession that he doesn't mind staying up all night at his office binging on TV movies! In a bizarre turn of events; a teenage boy goes missing; he is the son of a headstrong & no-nonsense cop; IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu) and the Salgaonkar family is the prime suspect! Will a humble & middle class man, be able to protect his family from oppression of the powerful? How the family weathers the storm that ensues during the violent investigation forms the rest of the story leading to an unexpected & shocking climax.\n\nDrishyam is a riveting entertainer. The first half lays the foundation for a rip-roaring second half and it didn't disappoint. The cast is great with Ajay Devgn leading the ultimate \"how to get away with murder\" plot line. We are treated to his ultimate foe in Tabu who has the killer look to match her crime brain. Elsewhere, I really enjoy watching Rajat Kapoor who plays Tabu's husband. His character moves in brilliant counterpoint to Tabu's relentless pursuit for the answer. Love the superb cat and mouse games and how the tables keep turning till we were tearing our hair off, but everything hits the groove and reaches a satisfying climax.\n\nDrishyam could have been a classic but several creative choices baffled me. The humour in the first half feels laboured and forced. How it paints the family of four is too obvious to me. But thankfully I love watching Vijay who is a character after my heart. He loves watching action movies, law and crime dramas, and the accumulated wealth of knowledge help lay the path of deceit and red herrings for the police. He is a character that is very easy to root for. Tabu also puts in a superb shift and it is easy to believe in her smarts, but it is her cold cruelty that puts a shiver in my heart. Overall, I find the writing couldn't match up with the characters and story, and it felt very \"by the numbers\" rudimentary to me. In more capable hands the shades of the characters would have been more layered and the theme of wrong versus wronged shining forth. Fans of the Japanese film Suspect X will find this quite familiar but thankfully with a good mixing up of elements and locale. As it is, it comes off just as a solid piece of entertainment than superb character studies."

First half is lose and needs editing,however the second half doesn't let you even move your eyeballs off the screen. Shriya Saran is good in looks n below average in acting.Both her daughters look convincing and act decently well. The story keeps you glued till the last frame,and the last 1 minute of conclusion gives you goosebumps and deserves claps.Intense,engaging,sharp and an intelligent thriller.This visual is DEEPLY DECEPTIVE."

Its most realistic story and flawless movie. Usually Indian movies are never realistic, there will be lot of spice and fiction, songs, crazy emotional melodrama etc. But this one is a master piece and it has the perfection of Hollywood level.\n\nIn short great movie and must watch. Only reducing 1 star because I read some reviews that original Malayalam movie had better actor and start of the movie could have been improved. Else this would be the real perfect movie.

Ajay Devgan also suited for the role as calm, sharp till innocent Vijay./ I am sure that watcher will be spell bound till the credit scene comes. About direction, NIhsikant Kamat delivered his best for what any thriller movie needs. Suspense is open as well as suspense is a maintained as a suspense till last second. That is the achievement of director. Best scene of art direction is when police come for first time to Vijay and his daughter was about to face them. last moment Vijay (protecting father, this is shown excellently that is what expected from every father for his daughter) comes in between of policeman and Anju. He talks to police hiding his daughter while she continues to cry. This was the best scene of movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, without further ado - this is a phenomenally entertaining film. The script is so well constructed that once it enters the suspense zone, there's no looking back. Yes, the film takes some time to pick up so as to provide some background of the characters and establish some familiarity with their everyday life, but when it gets past that, it's one hell of a ride.\n\nI'm sure the scenes with the guy who comes to visit with the phone in his hands and the mother and daughter's pleas to take mercy on them will throw some people off. In many ways this scene seems to be taken right from a primitive masala film of the 1980s. It takes great cultural perspective to understand this sentiment if you are removed from that mindset.\n\nBut once it's done, the film is a treat all through. The proceedings, turns and twists are absolutely fun to watch and there's hardly a dull moment after some point. Yes, there are some exaggerations here and there, and some of the slow-motion sequences are amusing as is some of the scores, but everything is within context and these do not damage the overall product.\n\nAjay Devgan, as always, is tremendous. Credible, real, charismatic and enjoyably subdued in his mission. Shriya Saran is stunningly beautiful as his wife. Tabu is always a great addition and when she gets a role like this one, which she shows to be equally good at, she is a delight. Drishyam is fantastic suspense thriller and quite an intriguing and thought-provoking watch."

Using his TV knowledge, he helps an elderly couple get their son out of jail from a corrupt system where a crooked cop extorts from the locals. He's a father-knows-best at home. When creepy Sam threatens his daughter Anju with a peeping Tom video, Anju and his wife Nandini inadvertently kills him. Vijay sets off to hide the crime against Sam's unrelenting, ruthless police chief mother.\n\nI wasn't sure what this movie was going for at first. There is a bit of light tones which confused me a little. The first act needs to be tighter and darker. This does turn much darker with a hint of The Usual Suspects. The dates concerned me a little but the movie throws it a very nice reveal. The other concern is Sam's mother. She's definitely not a simple villain although a much darker villain may be better. I appreciate seeing both sides of the crime but it does make for a more complex narrative. I can see this being remade into a dark, stripped-down noir."

The sneaky cat-and-mouse game stretches them to their limits as they attempt to outmaneuver each other in more and more daring ways. The schemes are intelligent and demand close viewing, as more is revealed gradually throughout the film, culminating in surprising plot twists near the end. However, the film relies too much on revealing the family's scheme and it gets tiresome to watch the same thing over and over - how many times can I see someone buying \"pav bhaji\" to get receipts? The characters seem to fulfil only the most basic archetypes - stoic family man, brutally corrupt cop, weeping wife, evil stalker (who, by the way, was too dumb to live) and so on. Although the film had good points, its runtime leaned too heavily on the same clever schemes at the expense of character development and other necessities."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, which was a surprise as I already knew the story as I'd seen the original with Malayalam with Mohanlal as the star.\n\nPersonally, I preferred the original for a number of reasons. I felt Mohanlal was perfect as the lead character. His whole persona was just right for the part of George Kutty, who was renamed Vijay Salgaonkar in this remake, although I can't see why. That's not to say Ajay Devgn was bad as he wasn't at all. I thought he was superb and played the part brilliantly, but Mohanlal just seemed to fit that idea of the lead character exactly right.\n\nThe plot was, for most of the time, an perfect replica, but there were some notable differences, particularly the ending. What happened was the same, but the way it was filmed in the original was more tense and dramatic and, for some reason, more believable.\n\nAnd one more thing, the cinematography in the original was amazing and very atmospheric and the staging in the original was picture perfect. In this remake it is still exceptionally good, but I don't think it is quite as perfect as the original.\n\nOn IMDb the original has a very high 8.9 from 6,000 reviews. I am sure this remake will score high too, particularly as the market for Hindi films is much larger. Although, it really wouldn't matter which language they made this film in, it would always be a hit as the story is so well constructed.\n\nI'd be amazed if Hollywood hasn't already snapped the rights up for this movie as it would, without a doubt, be a blockbuster if they did. If they do I just hope they don't change the location as it just works so well already."

This is my first Shriya Saran movie so can't say much about her. I am sure she is a very popular actress and she was good playing the role of a docile and gullible mother and wife. The kids were good too.. I personally feel that they could have taken Prakash Raj for the role of Gaitonde.. I missed that guy throughout the movie. Rajat Kapoor looked wasted as he didn't have much lines but he has that upper class appeal and looked good with Tabu as her husband.They could have avoided the first song in the movie and just keeping the Rekha Bhardwaj song (which made sense).Otherwise,The story is 10/10. I am giving it 9 because i felt the first song was unnecessary and I missed Prakash Raj as Gaitonde... !!!"

Ajay Devgn is simply the best in such role..and he can out class anyone when it comes to such type of role. Tabu at its best..other actors did the acting pretty well its a must watch film and a sure shot winner. After Baby Piku Tanu weds Manu and Bajrangi Bhaijaan now comes Drishyam...i have not watched the Malyalam Drishyam but this movie cannot be compared with other remakes...and i seriously don't have worlds to express my view on this movie as it is a class movie and a family drama movie with one of the best script and actors."

Ajay and tabu Both have been National Award winners sorry trio Nishikhant Kamat who well known for Mumbai blasting feature fill Mumbai meri jaan . The film takes off as a typical family drama. The first half of the film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Vijay This half combines the elements of drama and low power genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course."

Early morning I went through certain reviews (the one mentioned by Rediff calling it as an ordinary film), by no means it is an ordinary film. It is an exceptional work brilliantly performed by Ajay Devgn and Tabu. Critics can rate it negatively but this film will certainly entertain you. The film starts on a slow note but picks up pace rapidly. The thrill will keep you on the edge of seat. Those who have seen the original version of Sir Mohanlal will also enjoy watching this remake. Ajay Devgn as a family man is tough and hard. Tabu has done full justice to her role. This movie is going to be your perfect watch for this weekend."

Few scenes are very neatly crafted and few scenes are actually not shown and left for audience to self understand - how rare is that in B'wood. Although I am tempted to reveal the story, i ll let the viewers see this one and enjoy the thrill drama.\n\nThe background score fails to go hand in hand with the tight script. Sriya disappoints and does not hold up well, both the kids were amazing , Gaytonde nails it as the bad cop, Tabu is strictly average after her award winning role in Haider & finally Ajay is back to his intense roles where he delivers a powerful punch .\n\nHad the 1st half, actors & background score been perfect, this would have been one thriller to remember. Nevertheless, definitely worth a watch, can't wait to see the original in regional languages"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are lots of things great about Nishikant Kamat's latest feature, but that doesn't mean it can be touted as a great film independently.\n\nStarting with a scene so mystic in its own way, the film starts with a flashback. Characters are brilliantly placed into the plot as we witness a family setup being created. Things take a turn when an act of crime enters this scene. One more act of crime follows, and that is when one gets the vibe of a thriller coming into form.\n\nThe 50 minute second half, which is also the most engaging minutes for any Bollywood film this year, steals the show and keeps us on the edge of our seats as we are smothered by a series of twists. If one does not feel goosebumps during that master-stroke climax, then I don't know what will.\n\nThe build-up is great, and so is the score that accompanies it, but if one pays attention to details throughout the film, even TataSky's native adverts look more professional. The writing is to be blamed. I am all okay with the idea of remaking, but borrowing the frames, hiring lookalikes, and even using some of the dialogs makes the whole drama look like an answer written by an Engineering student: everything out of place and irrelevant. Plus, apart from few minor, clever changes, there is no hint of any improvement which should have been necessary and which would have made it more appealing to the learned masses.\n\nI had problems with the whole cast; like they all watched the original (2013) and just re-enacted their roles. It hardly works, and now this can be taken as a testimonial study by filmmakers in the future before they enter the remake scene. Devgn could not handle the fatherly figure well, nor could Tabu create thunders with her uniform. The guy who played the corrupt policeman Gaitonde acted like he just came out of a wrestling pit and was made to deliver his cocky, cringe-worthy dialogs. The child artistes were fine, if not oversmart. Even Kapoor was a let-down.\n\nThe film also questions justice and what a person should do at times like this. Although, the plot constantly makes the family look like protagonists in spite of their deeds, and falsely guides us what it thinks is right (or should be right). But if you look closer, you will realize the climax answers all the questions about righteousness.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Drishyam, as an edge-of-the-seat thriller, does not tell you how to act during time of brutal crimes, but it finely creates a story so charming that you will want to talk about it with your friends just to understand what is right and what is wrong.\n\nVERDICT: 6 stars out of 10. Watch it!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

I liked the second half more, because that is where is whole bulk of the story starts to open.\n\nActing of Ajay Devgun is so good, that I think this is his best to date. Supporting actors could have done a little bit better, but I'm not complaining coz the story makes it up for them.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was worth it. Enjoy with your family. Because rarely comes a Bollywood movie that can be enjoyed with family. Yes \"enjoy\" is the key word here.\n\nSo, 9/10 for me, for a really interesting and refreshing flick.\n\nPeace."

How far a common man can go to save his family - This is the main storyline. Vijay (Ajay) saves his family from IG Meera Naiar (Tabu) and other policemen. The concept is very fresh and unique. No one can beat the visualization which Ajay's character has. Very well crafted. Director Nishikant Kamat has done a pretty good job. I was seating on the edge of the seat in most of the parts of post interval. He made a very good thriller. Other technical aspects are also good. Music is given by Vishal Bhardwaj. Carbon copy is my favorite from this album, written by Gulzar. Dumb Ghutata Hai is okay. Background score is in the flow of the movie. Actors are really good. Ajay, Tabu, Shriya - all have acted well. Rajat Kapoor has a small role, nothing to offer. When Bahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan both are rocking the box-office, it is obvious that only mouth publicity can help this film to survive in the battle. I've heard that this too is going strong. So, July brings the best for all the viewers. Go for it, if you love to watch thriller movie, catchy story and you will surely appreciate it!"

After a Long time I have seen this type of acting from Ajay Devgan (specially after Omkara). Tabu never disappoint us after her recent comeback.

Even after the run time of the movie is around 2hrs 43mins it makes sure that we don't leave our seat till the movie is completed. It clearly shows that how far a man can go to save his family which was involved in an \"Unintentional Murder.\" A Perfect Remake in Hindi Language."

It will keep you connected till the very last movement.\n\nIt revolves around a small family about a father (Ajaz) who is going to do anything to protect his family. And a mother (Tabu ) who will do anything to break him.\n\nI wouldn't say its the \"Shawshank Redemption of Bollywood\"; however It really is one of the best Bollywood movies i have ever seen.\n\nDon't think, just go and watch some of the best performances by Ajaz, Tabu and other actors."

The movie is little bit slow in the beginning but it balances the situation. Ajay Devgan and Tabu both acted really really well and who knows you might also get a little bit crime ideas after watching this movie. Anyway it a good movie and everyone should watch it for at least once."

Keeping aside the performances and the direction the story alone had so much of shades which made me completely hooked to the seats till the end. A simple story about family emotions told in an unconventional way was the biggest triumphant for the whole team of Drishyam. How can a father watch her daughter being jailed for a crime that was not intentional how can a mother not be furious on a family who had some link to her missing boy? All these were so equipped that sometimes you do not know who was correct and who was not (which was fantastically explained by Devgn just at the end to Shiriya). As a complete movie buff this movie for me would definitely be ranked in the highest order. It is not that whodunit suspense thriller (where one suspect who is the killer) but how someone conceals the matter in the utmost way was the biggest jolt that people coming out of the movie halls would think. Devgn playing a fourth standard fail with utmost sincerity and never once going OTT which the character demanded. This performance reminded me of his hay days when he gave a movie called \"Company\" where he oozed with confidence and his body language spoke everything. Tabu in one word was excellent, the way she ruthlessly attacked Salgaocar's family and in the same frame worriedly asking about her son spoke volumes of her aura as an actress. Other actors were equally compelling especially the little kid and after watching the movie for 163 mins I never felt bored or tired even for a minute. The movie will remain with me in the days to come for family emotions and for the compelling confrontations between its prey and the predator."

        "review_detailed_main": "A remake of the Malayalam film of the same name, 'Drishyam' is A True Thriller, that thrills & engrosses you. While the narrative warms up in the first-hour, its the second-hour that takes this thriller to dizzy heights. Director Nishikant Kamat & Lead-Actor Ajay Devgn, deliver a tale thats truly interesting.\n\n'Drishyam' Synopsis: Desperate measures are taken by a man who tries to save his family from the dark side of the law, after they commit an unexpected crime.\n\n'Drishyam' is about a family's fight after an unexpected crime is committed & the series of twist & turns that follow. However, 'Drishyam' isn't full-proof. The first-hour is relatively slow-paced & although its never boring, the story doesn't really move. Its the second-hour that does wonders. I strongly feel if the first-hour was crisper & stronger, the overall impact would've enhanced even more.\n\nUpendra Sidhaye's Adapted Screenplay is genuinely engaging & engrossing, especially in its winning second-hour, that also offers a fabulous culmination. How one wishes if the first-hour was more on the point & crisper. Nishikant Kamat's Direction is skilled. He has handled the film well. Cinematography is stark. Editing is decent. Vishal Bhardwaj's Score is perfect.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Ajay Devgn shines in the central role. He truly convinces you as the man who'd do anything to protect his family. Tabu is impressive, yet again. As the tough cop in search of her missing child, the supremely talented actress ignites the screen with her strong presence. Shriya Saran is flat. Rajat Kapoor is first-rate. Ishita Dutta is very sincere. Kamlesh Sawant is excellent. Prathamesh Parab is decent.\n\nOn the whole, 'Drishyam' works! It may not be perfect, but it still has enough merit to earn itself a viewing. Watch it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Drishyam is an intense story of an average middle class family caught into a \"legally wrong morally right\" act from which they have to escape any which way. The only way they can do that is to be together come what may. Just like in the trailer, it shows that a person can go to any extent for his/her family. Shot in the backdrop of Goa, it shows a Marathi family putting every bit of their energy (physical and mental) in escaping from the claws of our legal system for a supposed crime. But when it comes to family, there is nothing right or wrong.\n\nStory is meticulously written and all the pieces explained and tied up perfectly. It keeps surprising you till the last scene. The twists and turns in the movie has been well conceptualized and ensures that audience keeps guessing the next scene even though the movie is more of a thriller. This is one of those rare movies that shows a flawless plan executed to perfection without any loopholes unlike other planning based movies like Players, Dhoom 3 etc where directors take things for granted due to their \"chalta hai\" and \"Bollywood movies mein aisa hi hota hai\" attitude. All kudos to the story writer, Jeethu Joseph and Upendra Sidhaye, for a perfect story.\n\nAjay Devgn has given a memorable performance with his effortless acting. His eyes do most of the talking. He plays a role of a street smart person, a family man and extremely protective for his family. Tabu has been a little weak, mainly in terms of dialog delivery, compared to her performance in Haidar but does well enough to give justice to her role. Other actors - Shriya Saran, Rajat Kapoor, Ishita Dutta - have complemented the efforts of leading stars very well. A special watchout for the youngest kid among the fantastic four, Mrinal Jhadhav (other three - Ajay Devgan, Shriya Saran and Ishita Dutta), who holds up with the big shots through her brilliant performance.\n\nAt the end, Drishyam compels you to put yourself in the shoes of Vijay Salgaonkar and think about right and wrong. It is a must watch."

Ajay Devgn just can't emote. The man is such a poor actor and especially for these roles. Worse is in the case of a remake you're constantly comparing tot to the original and throughout the film you are feel he's trying too hard but you just can't feel it. Pathetic stuff from Bollywood.

Original writer Jeetu Joseph and adaptation writer Upendra Sidhaye work caters fresh and engaging script. Story offers something new. Screenplay keeps the thrill intact and succeeds to keep an outgoing graph. Dialogues give realistic feel. Film's starting humor is light and fresh. The excuse made for going late night at home by protagonist is cute and his habit of watching movie establishes his character well and that has been used in script in good way. The basic point of drama is silly. When, protagonist saw that an Inspector is standing in front of a house, where both can be seen to each other, then rather waiting for some time, why did he prefer to take the car away just then, which leads the complete drama. After some time drama in first half is slow but second half is very intense and drama keeps you on edge. Somehow, I sensed most of the twist, even the pre climax twist, a few minutes before but that does not mean that it was bad. Most of the twists are logical and show off perfect mind game. I missed that why they even did't try to incorporate CCTV in this script, which is very common now a days. Nor Police tried to take advantage of that neither male lead cared about that factor. They have just ignored this fact as if it doesn't exist. Performance wise Ajay Devgan is superb. His expressions builds up and hold the tension well. Tabu is fine. Expression in her last scene is so pure and authentic. Surprise factor of this film is actor #KamleshSawant, who played the role of Inspector Gaitonde. He is just amazing that still I am in dilemma that is he real cop? Without his perfect expressions film could not have been so engrossing. Shriya Saran as Nandini (Ajay Devgan wife) is fine. Ishita Dutta as elder daughter is OK. Her change over of expression in her school scene is very good. Actor, who played younger daughter, she is cute and fine too."

The movie has a solid grip and twists to make it a must-watch.\n\nThe story begins where the first movie ended. Mohan Lal is now the owner of a movie hall. He has a solid bond with his wife and daughters. Though his wife and daughter are still going through the mental trauma caused in the first movie. The police are still investigating the murder and Mohan has to save his family, once again.\n\nThe subtle beginning may look a little stretched but the movie offers an engaging plot that has plenty of twists. Another thing about the movie is that it doesn't look desperate to cash in the success of the first movie.\n\nKnowing that one day they will get caught, the natural element of fear and anxiety will be felt throughout. The writing retains empathy for the family without making them look like villains. Further, Murli Gopi as a strong-headed policeman and Anjali in a supporting role is another gem to check out.\n\nIn the end, Drishyam 2 is a rare movie that manages to complement its origin. Whatte story. Whatte acting. Whatte movie. Watch it right now.\n\nDo like and share it with someone who's a mad fan of movies."

Tabu was just awesome and matched to Ajay's powerhouse performance. Shriya, both daughters and all policemen did wonderful job to keep us glued.\n\nThere are few disturbing scenes which may not go down with kids under age of 12 so I would not recommend to go with kids in this movie.

Except George Clooney's Daniel Ocean all the protagonists in above movies/series were simple men. A Banker, a School Teacher and an Architect with no criminal history. They lived their normal lives until they were forced to do the impossible. Dhrisham's story go by the same logic. If I dare compare Dhrisham to Shawshank Redemption (which incidentally is my all-time favorite movie) not much need to be told about the quality of the script, the direction and the performances. Dhrishyam is Bollywoods entry to world class family thrillers. For the entire second half of the movie Bollywood Cinema was elevated to the class of Hollywood. We had several art films or those parallel movies to brag about, but until Dhrishyam not many thriller or family drama type movies of Bollywood could have been called world class. Movie Is unpredictable till the end, Ajey Devgan has managed to keep his audience at the edge of the seat Till the end of the movie, it's hard to find anyone who may complain about the movie. In One Word Its Best thrilling movie of 2015."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story is about a small family, led by Vijay (Ajay Devgn) and his wish and passion to protect his family what-so-ever! That's all I am going to tell you about Drishyam, because the less you know, the more you will experience.\n\nStraight out, I loved Drishyam! It was the most engaging film I have come across in the past few years. First it engages you with Vijay's simple life, family and friends. And how his family is really angry for him being a little money conscious. It's small little things like these, in the first 40 mins. Then it engages you with the tragedy that takes place (can't tell more). And then finally, engages you with it's revenge drama. Also, the twists in the tale will leave you spellbound!\n\nNishikant Kamat does a superb job as a director. He does borrow the style of making a raw and effective film from his previous film, Force. But as this is not an action movie, it would have been a hard task. Still, he does his job brilliantly! He is outstanding. I really wish he makes more films.\n\nEditing is good,Locations are perfect. Cinematography is good. Dialogues are good. Background score is really good. Songs are good and perfect for this movie. 'Carbon Copy' and 'Dam Ghutta Hai' stand out!\n\nAjay Devgn leads the pack with his brilliant performance. He plays both, the innocent Vijay, and the master-planner Vijay with equal conviction. He is perfect for his role. Tabu is good. She really makes you hate her with her super strict cop character. Shriya Saran also does a really good job as the lovely wife and worrying mother. Both the daughters are also really good. The supporting cast is also fantastic and lends great support.\n\nIn conclusion, Drishyam is the best thriller film that has come out of Bollywood! It is continuously engaging and the twists will just add to the film's total value! And if you are still not convinced, let me tell you that this is also my all time favourite movie. 10/10"

How they try to out do one another. The climax is brilliant.\n\nThe Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu's never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation."

        "review_detailed_main": "Drishyam is a crime thriller film directed by Late Nishikant Kamat. The film stars Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, Mrunal Jadhav and Rajat Kapoor.\n\nThe film is a remake of the 2013 Malayalam film of the same name.\n\nWhen the disappearance of a policewoman's son threatens to ruin Vijay's family, he leaves no stone unturned in order to shield his family.\n\nWhen we discuss about Indian cinema particularly Hindi cinema we have always lacked a good gripping film which will keep you engaged rather glued from start till very end.\n\nThe plot of the film is great and execution is superb. The film has a normal start but as the film progresses you'll start getting engrossed with the film and as the film approaches it's climax you'll not even want to blink your eyes to make sure you didn't miss a single scene. The best part of this edge of the seat thriller is that the director has very carefully crafted a very captivating web of mystery and suspense with twists and turns in regular intervals with what will happen next kind of feeling after every scene.\n\nActing in the film is superb and in my opinion no other actor apart from Ajay Devgn could've played the role of Vijay Salgaonkar a simple but very sharp witted family man who can go to any extent to safeguard his family from any trouble. His dialogue delivery, his facial expression and his acting from his eyes works as an icing on the cake. He was so natural that any family loving father may start relating Ajay Devgn to themselves.\n\nTabu was equally impressive in the role of tough and persistent IG of Goa police. One the one hand she portrays a tough IG and on the other hand a restless mother. The way she changes her expressions narrates or showcases her talent.\n\nShriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, Mrunal Jadhav and Rajat Kapoor were equally impressive in their respective characters and a very special mention for Kamlesh Sawant in the role of Gaitonde. He was so impressive and molded in his character that the viewers will start hating him after a point of time.\n\nScreenplay of the film is another strong point of the film It was very skillfully and carefully written and shot that the mystery and suspense was maintained throughout the film and reaches to it's optimum as the film reaches it's climax, the stunning and spectacular climax will spellbound you and makes the film a engaging and gripping experience.\n\nBGM of the film is superb and so as the cinematography.\n\nTo be honest Drishyam is not a film but an experience which will make you sad, angry, helpless, touching, connecting and happy altogether. A must watch masterpiece."

I'll be frank, the trailer the promos were not arresting. The film started pretty sluggishly, in fact nothing much happens in the first 30 minutes, but maybe it is used for character development, it effieciently sucks us into it's world and makes us feel for the characters, so much so when the film takes off after half an hour it never lets you go. Drishyam is a very rare thriller which keeps you hooked till the last scene of the film despite its length. Ajay Devgn Tabu are perfect, Shriya saran was refreshing too, she should do more films in bollywood. Overall i think, it is a very rare film from bollywood, which should be watched and remembered."

The start of the movie is too below ordinary wherein you will find yourself to another boredom but that's when even myself was wrong.\n\nNormally the suspense of the movie is that right in the end everything is shown as to how it all happened but in this movie you will know what happened but the suspense is how the character play along with their game.\n\nI agree two wrongs does not make one right but the movie not only strong in its content but beautifully played by the actors.\n\nAjay Devgan and Tabu at their best.\n\nDo watch and very much enjoy the ending."

Do any one think that even the most brutal cop of the world will do something like that? Then I thought that the director probably inherited it from the original South Indian movie stuff where overacting is not only very well accepted but appreciated.\n\nOne more thing Tabu does not look like a Police Officer from any angle and the flashback started a bit dull and slow. Rest is just wonderful."

So instead of dubbing or subtitling the original they just remade it in their own language instead... It is a disgrace to the original work and is completely soulless movie. If you remake a film you have to change it, so it has individuality over the original, so you know that it is a remake and they tried something different this time, but here they didn't even try in the slightest. While on it's own it's a great film, it's just a replica and has no value whatsoever. It's completely same as if the original was Mona Lisa real painting and this film is just a poster of the painting..."

This is best movie and performance since Singham and the viewers will definitely such roles from him in future as well. Tabu was effective in the role of IG. Shriya complimented Ajay well in the role of a faithful wife. Ishita Dutta portrayed the role of Ajay Devgn daughter's faithfully.\n\nOverall, the film is a must watch for people who want respite from mindless masala movies.

A well adapted story and a tight screenplay is a treat for the viewer's eyes. The first half of the movie builds up the momentum which takes the script to the desired platform in the climax. The image which Ajay Devgan has build over the years, of an action hero, was kept on the side bench in this movie and his role of a 4th standard fail, common family man was well sketched, and there is no doubt whether he was able to pull it or not. With much ease he was able to showcase the feelings, the true emotions of a ordinary person. Tabu on the other side was marvelous as always. She is one of the gems Bollywood has. Although, a better background music would have been a cherry on the cake. There were times when better music was needed to support the gripping screenplay. This movie involves you to the very end and you wait for the next moment, the next scene to come and unravel the mystery. All the other actors supported the screenplay so elegantly that the nothing less than \"Amazing\" is coming out."

        "review_detailed_main": "One particular area where bollywood films had lagged, is the lack of serious and purposeful movies. But Drisham has put an end to this and has compensated the gap sufficiently. Nishikant Kamat (Director) deserves applauds for his direction abilities, story formulation and characterization. The movie is a combo of mystery, thrill, suspense and intelligence. The plot revolves around Vijay (Ajay Devgan) and his small happy family who runs a cable TV business and enjoys a good reputation in his area. Anju (Ishita Dutt) is Vijay's daughter who goes on a school trip where she is harassed by a boy (Tabu's son). The boy manages to record a mobile clip of Anju while she is bathing and blackmails her to fulfill his sexual desires. When he reaches at the spot, he finds Anju's mother Nandini (Shriya Saran) at the RV alongside her. Nandini pledges and begs him to leave them in peace for the sake of God but in vain rather he insists Nandini instead to fulfill his sexual desire. In the meanwhile, Anju picks up a rod and hit him on the head which results in boy's death at the spot. Frightened, upset and shocked from the sudden tragic incident, Anju and Nandini bury him in the courtyard lawn. Next day, Vijay returns home and finds about the incident. Now Vijay decides to save his family from police and the court while repairing the psychological damage in the meanwhile. Vijay is a movie-holic who spends most of the time watching Hollywood and Bollywood films. Keeping his movies experience, situations and plots in mind, he makes a fool-proof plan to avert the danger. Here enters Mera Deshmuk (Tabu) in the plot who turns out to be the Commissioner of Police as well as the mother of the murdered boy. Investigation starts but no clue comes in police hands until inspector Gaitonde (Kamlesh Sawant) informs police that he has seen Vijay driving decreased's car few days ago as he finds in it an opportunity to level personal scores with Vijay because he denies to pay him illegal money just for the sake of being a police official. This opens up a new Pandora Box of suspicions, illusions and perceptions but Vijay trains his family intelligently and skillfully that how they will react to all the possible situations utilizing his movies experience. He goes on a 3 day family trip to outskirts and maintains record of all receipts but not for the actual dates rather for 3 days preceding the actual date. When police inquires him and his family, he responds that he was not present in the area on the suspected dates and shows them the record of receipts. Police tries hard but could not find any clue which frustrates Mera and she decides to torture the family in front of themselves. Ultimately the little daughter of Vijay confesses and tells police that the dead body is buried in the courtyard lawn of her house. When police digs the place, they instead find a dead dog stinking badly and that was the master trick played by Vijay as he knew that one day police will penetrate through her family and will come to this spot. Taking advantage of the situation, Vijay informs the media nd public gathered at the spot that its the conspiracy of Mera and Gaitonde to involve his family in the alleged murder and they have even tortured his 6 year old daughter for confession. The police is beaten up by the angry mob and Vijay is liberated from the charges. But where goes the actual dead body remains a mystery till the end and Vijay does not tell anyone of the reality as it is buried under the area Police Station. The whole plot is embodied with twisty, thrilling and sensational schemes and makes you sit at the edge of your seats while watching this movie. The credit goes to the intelligent director who has kept his characters under control and made the happenings the way he wanted. Ajay Devgan has impressed with his acting abilities and showed maturity in his performance. The supporting cast also did fair justice to their assigned roles. Tabu has not been utilized to her full potential and there is hardly a one to one scene between Ajay and Tabu. Music of the film is routine alike and cinematography is even ordinary. The highlights of the movie are its story, dialogs, acting and above all the direction. Its a recommended movie for family audience and a message for children to respect and trust their parents because they can go to infinite limits to protect and safe them"

Other Indian movies should also inspire from this and make meaningful movies. Songs were OK. but it doesn't matter. Even the acting of little girl was extra ordinary. Nowadays we hardly find such nice movies. And all of above, there were no third class pakistani actors in this movie unlike in almost every recent movies."

Mind blowing suspense and thrill till the last minute will make you sit tight on your seats is what the biggest plus point of the movie is. Simple plot with a great story.\n\nMore importantly director does not try to tamper the story to add unwanted masala in the movie just like most other Hindi films do. This makes the movie more interesting.\n\nTABU has done a great job with her flourishing acting as IG (Police) and so does AJAY DEVGAN who stands equally well in front of her. His family (SHRIYA SARAN and two children) and RAJAT KAPOOR as TABU's husband have also acted well giving a good support.\n\nThe movie also gives a very important message of not to underestimate your opponent. AJAY DEVGAN who is shown as a 4th standard fail, Cable TV line owner and a complete movie buff learns facts of life from movies themselves and gives police a roller-coaster ride during the case investigation. This makes me think... Yes, we can learn from movies too rather than looking at them just from entertainment perspective.\n\nIts indeed very nice to see such kind of movies are now releasing in Hindi film industry. Overall its a great movie and of course 100% worth a watch !!!"

Story-wise it's a physiological thriller where a fourth grade fail husband is shown to protect his wife and daughters from police for the murder they've committed for their self defense. The hero, though is illiterate, is very smart and his smartness is credited for the endless time he spends watching movies, especially the crime thrillers due to which he is able to save his family until the very end. His smartness is coupled by his patience, courage and affection for his family.\n\nThe specialty of the film is its story which grips you to the very end due to the suspense it delivers. It looks much like a Sherlock Holmes tale with the last minute irony. The deft direction and performances are enough to hold you to the edge of the seat. Had the length been trimmed and script offered tautness, it would have been better. Anyway, still the film is remarkable for its interesting and unpredictable story.\n\nRating: 3 stars out of 4"

Tabu in a role of a cop and a mother has done a great job, it was a treat watching her portray this role so convincingly and at ease.\n\nShriya does justification to her role as a mother and a wife of Ajay Devgan.

        "review_detailed_main": "Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.\n\nMy special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move \"Visuals Can Be Deceptive\" The Camera work of the movie is good. It features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu's never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously."

I even can't blink an eye to look forward, what he could do. Regarding the actors, it just perfect. Yes, it was not that remarkable, but for a good story- oriented movie, it is as it is.

        "review_detailed_main": "Probably one of the best bollywood movies out there, even if it's a remake. I agree that this is a remake, and certainly (having seen both the pieces of work) this film in no way does a better job than the original Mohanlal film, but there are two sides to that aspect. There are good remakes and bad remakes. This film creates a newer branch for itself, great remakes! I can't express how much this film changed my perspective in viewing the thriller genre.\n\nAjay devgn portrays the protagonist (I don't know if we can really call him that) Vijay Salgaonkar (an orphan who has barely passed the 4th grade) so skillfully that I became a fan of him after this performance and it made me realise how much potential he carries as an actor (I literally started watching almost all his films after this). You instantly connect with Vijay and his family and even though Tabu and her gang of cops aren't necessarily the bad guys here, you view them from an antagonistic perspective, which makes you question your own morality. Speaking of tabu, she needs to be kept in a gold vault and protected forever. Tabu is essentially perfect casting, her performance as the inspector general of goa police investigating the missing and supposed death of her own son is so full of emotion, that you almost side with her but the film manages to keep you on the family's side only to completely blow you away in the climax (believe me, it's just bonkers).\n\nAnother thing which I particularly love is the soundtrack and the music provided in this film. It's on point and placed perfectly throughout the film and provides more than enough depth required for a scene. What's surprising is, the soundtrack has been composed by the acclaimed director Vishal Bhardwaj who directed the Shakespeare trilogy of bollywood (which also I would highly recommend you to check them out). And after I see the score credits, I go and check his other credits and voila! He has composed scores for several other films too (including his own)! Man, the guy is just so freaking talented. My favourite song from the film is Dum Ghutta Hai as it perfectly builds the required tension which the film pays off in the extremely beautiful second half.\n\nP. S.: some people would argue that giving this film 5 stars is a disservice to the original film which was made on a regional level while this being a worldwide release. I would just like to say that, just being a remake shouldn't be viewed as a point of hate for the film as it does a disservice to both, the original and the remade film because not everyone will watch the film in it's original language and not everyone will know how good regional cinema is. It ultimately falls upon personal preference how to watch a certain piece of cinema."

The entire rest of the film tugged me back and forth between highly tense anxiety and amazement, and it weaved between the two emotions so expertly that I was laughing with giddy wonder during the most climactic reveals.\n\nThe acting was also very good, especially Devgn (Vijay) who always seemed like he held total control in even the most desperate situations. Tabu (Inspector General) gave an increasingly excellent performance as the movie progressed. At first I thought she was breaking character, but I soon realized her character was also playing a character whose shell slowly cracked and fell away as the situation became increasingly dire. I did think Saran (Vijay's wife) gave a subpar performance, but it wasn't bad enough to break my immersion in this masterfully crafted story."

Gaitonde and IG Meera(Tabu is arguably the most intense actress in India) are intimidating for different reasons. Meera's husband is reasonable, and you can see sympathy in his eyes, and he realises they've failed at parenting; Rajat Kapoor is a phenomenal Bollywood Dad.\n\nThere are no words for Ajay Devgn; his best work, perhaps, the range of emotions he has delivered almost effortlessly and his closing dialogue is excellent!\n\nThis film is basically about love. Love for your family. Nothing is greater than that. The lines of right and wrong go blur when you religiously love."

It is quite feasible that in a terrible attempt to preserve one's dignity in a brutally judgemental and hypocritical society, an innocent victim can commit a crime, and their family can do their utmost to preserve and protect themselves. Vijay played brilliantly by the always capable Ajay Devgan, is the quintessential underdog, constantly underestimated by those who have absolute power in society, including the long oppressive, abusive arm of the law. The core thesis of the film is a gray area - the merits of self-defence and the controversial attempts to prevent one's family from being buried alive. This movie is at heart a battle between 4th grade graduate Ajay and ultra-powerful Inspector General Meera - what a brilliant game. Never underestimate the less educated, nor the power of learning from every possible source including movies and popular media.

        "review_title": "Drishyam: A Remarkable South Movie Remake",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Drishyam,\" directed by Nishikant Kamat and released in 2015, is a gripping thriller that delves into the lengths a man will go to protect his family. Starring Ajay Devgn, Tabu, and Shriya Saran, the film is a Hindi adaptation of the 2013 Malayalam film of the same name. With its intricate plot, powerful performances, and moral complexity, \"Drishyam\" stands out as a compelling addition to Indian cinema.\n\nThe narrative revolves around Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn), a simple cable TV operator in the small town of Goa, leading a content life with his wife Nandini (Shriya Saran) and their two daughters. Vijay's life takes a dramatic turn when his family becomes entangled in an accidental crime. To protect his loved ones, Vijay crafts an elaborate web of lies and deception, drawing on his vast knowledge of films to outwit the police.\n\nAjay Devgn delivers a standout performance as Vijay, portraying a man of ordinary means pushed to extraordinary measures. His calm, methodical approach contrasts with the escalating tension, highlighting Vijay's resourcefulness and determination. Devgn's portrayal of a loving father and husband, desperate yet resolute, anchors the film emotionally, making his character's journey relatable and gripping.\n\nTabu, as Inspector General Meera Deshmukh, is formidable and nuanced. Her character, driven by personal loss and a relentless pursuit of justice, adds a layer of intensity to the narrative. Tabu's performance is both powerful and poignant, as she balances her professional duty with her personal vendetta. Her interactions with Devgn's Vijay form the crux of the film's tension, as both characters engage in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse.\n\nShriya Saran as Nandini Salgaonkar brings warmth and vulnerability to her role. Her portrayal of a mother caught in a harrowing situation evokes empathy, and her chemistry with Devgn underscores the family's unity and desperation. The supporting cast, including the young actors playing Vijay's daughters, contribute significantly to the film's emotional depth.\n\nNishikant Kamat's direction is taut and focused, maintaining a steady pace that keeps the audience engaged. The screenplay, adapted by Upendra Sidhaye, stays true to the original while incorporating cultural nuances that resonate with the Hindi-speaking audience. The film meticulously builds suspense, with each revelation adding to the complexity of the narrative.\n\nOne of the film's strengths lies in its exploration of moral ambiguity. \"Drishyam\" challenges the viewers to grapple with ethical dilemmas, blurring the lines between right and wrong. Vijay's actions, though illegal, are driven by a primal instinct to protect his family, prompting the audience to question their own moral compass.\n\nThe cinematography by Avinash Arun captures the picturesque yet tense atmosphere of Goa, contrasting its serene landscapes with the underlying tension of the storyline. The film's editing by Aarif Sheikh is sharp, ensuring that the narrative unfolds seamlessly, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe music by Vishal Bhardwaj, with lyrics by Gulzar, complements the film's tone, enhancing its emotional and suspenseful moments. The background score subtly underscores the tension, adding to the overall impact of the narrative.\n\n\"Drishyam\" is not just a thriller but a thought-provoking drama that delves into themes of family, sacrifice, and the lengths one will go to for love. Its intricate plot, combined with stellar performances and adept direction, make it a standout film in Indian cinema. The film's ability to engage, entertain, and evoke introspection is a testament to its storytelling prowess, solidifying its place as a modern classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "Nishikant Kamat have assured that even though the movie length is more than usual but you will not get bored watching the thriller. The start is slow but it was needed for creating the after-story which is the main plot. I would also appreciate the writer- Upendra Sidhaye for writing such a wonderful script which may have a flaw but as a normal audience, you will only find greatness in every scene of it. The tension between the protagonist and policeman is nicely depicted since beginning. The situation where a dad refuses to send his daughter to Goa but on insisting has to agree and then how the consequences of the trip destructs the family's peace is sent across a good message. The story also focuses on how children are given independence and boys aren't asked what are they doing and where are they which causes several crimes in society.\n\nAjay Devgn plays his role of a family man perfectly and you will love him specially in the 2nd half when he starts planning, plotting and executing. His eyes speaks everything for you and that's the incredibility of this actor. Shriya Saran is also perfect in her role and plays a mother perfectly without any sort of over- acting and unwanted performance. Tabu- the moment she enters the movie, she takes it to some another level. A different dimension she gave to her character despite playing a mother of a boy who has been killed is great to see. Ishita Dutta who played Ajay Devgn's daughter is the younger sister of Tanushree Dutta in real but thankfully, what a nice actor she is unlike her sister. Kamlesh Sawant and Rajat Kapoor have also done great justice to their roles.\n\nThis Movie is best Indian thriller movie till now. A must watch movie. Loved it. My rating is 10/10."

Ajay Devgan acting is mind blowing and the child who plays innocent role is so cute and will won your heart. Role of police inspector who hates Vijay Salgaokar is also nice.

I must take my hat off to AD for keeping me on the script of this movie.\n\nFinally the end twist is beautifully done to finish off.

        "review_detailed_main": "In an era saturated with predictable plots and formulaic storytelling, \"Drishyam\" stands as a refreshing and audacious anomaly that leaves its audience spellbound. Released in 2015, this Indian Malayalam-language thriller directed by Jeethu Joseph remains a testament to cinematic brilliance, weaving a tale of deception, morality, and the sheer power of a common man's determination.\n\nAt its heart, \"Drishyam\" is a psychological thriller that explores the lengths to which a father, Georgekutty (played magnificently by Mohanlal), is willing to go to protect his family from the clutches of the law. The narrative is set in a serene and picturesque village, seemingly far removed from the complexities of urban life. However, as the story unravels, the layers of deceit and manipulation lurking beneath the tranquil fa\u00e7ade are peeled back, leaving the audience in awe of the director's ability to craft a gripping plot.\n\nThe film's title, which translates to \"Visual\" in English, serves as a thematic foundation that underscores the importance of appearances and the intricate web of lies that ensnares both the characters and the audience. Drishyam subtly raises the question: What is the truth, and can it be deciphered from what is seen? This recurring motif is brilliantly conveyed through clever visual cues and symbolic references, cementing the film's place as a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nMohanlal's portrayal of Georgekutty is nothing short of mesmerizing. With a captivating blend of charisma and subtlety, he brings to life a character who defies convention. Georgekutty is not a superhero or a larger-than-life figure, but an ordinary cable operator with an extraordinary commitment to his family's safety. Mohanlal's nuanced performance encapsulates the desperation and brilliance of a man who orchestrates an elaborate cover-up, exploiting the weaknesses of the legal system itself. His chemistry with Meena, who plays his wife Rani, adds depth to their relationship, rendering it an emotional anchor that resonates with the audience.\n\nJeethu Joseph's directorial finesse is undeniable, as he masterfully constructs a tension-filled atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccably orchestrated, allowing the suspense to build gradually without ever losing its grip on the audience's attention. Joseph's keen eye for detail is evident in every frame, as he utilizes framing, lighting, and camera angles to convey a sense of unease that mirrors the moral dilemma at the heart of the story.\n\nWhile \"Drishyam\" excels in storytelling and acting, it also boasts a hauntingly evocative musical score composed by Anil Johnson. The music becomes an integral part of the narrative, heightening the emotional impact of pivotal scenes and further immersing the audience into the complex world of the characters.\n\nBeyond its entertainment value, \"Drishyam\" raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of justice, morality, and the lengths one can justify when pushed to the brink. The film doesn't spoon-feed answers to its audience; instead, it presents a labyrinth of ethical dilemmas that linger long after the credits roll. The ending, which leaves room for interpretation, ignites discussions on the blurred lines between right and wrong, leaving audiences pondering the choices they would make in the characters' shoes."

This guys has an authentic charisma which none of our Khan has. Ajay Devgan has tried his faith with comedies and some human super heroes movies in the past, but when it comes to delivering strong and firm emotions beyond anger, he does a great job unlike anybody else in the bollywood.\n\nA no-nonsense movie, with good dialogs and great delivery by our beloved Ajay Devgan, will win your heart in first 15-20 minutes. The movie progresses at a decent rate and in a short while you are deeply emerged in the movie that it can occupy your mind.\n\n[ No Spoilers, Don't worry ] The movie is about a small town virtuous man who have not received any formal education but is a shrewd observer and fast learner. He loves his family and uses his wit to take them out of a horrible situation. It's a great character to learn from throughout the movie.\n\nIt's a much watch for everyone looking to watch an entertaining thriller in Hindi."

He lives with his wife Nandini (Shriya) and their two daughters. Their halcyon life turns topsy turvy when a random kamikaze stranger, son of the tough and ruthless IG Meera Deshmukh (Tabu), threatens to destroy it. The movie further is a battle of wits between the cop and Vijay and this forms the crux of the movie. Tabu (who had earlier played a policewoman's role in the film KOHRAAM), plays the role of a cop with oodles of grace and elegance and at the same time handles the role of a concerned mother with ease! Ajay Devgn plays the role of a 'simpleton' but a 'protective' father who can go to any extent to protect and save his family. Do watch Drishyam for Tabu and Ajay's performances, as they are the main torchbearers of the film and of course for the Content- which is the key! So what are you waiting for?

It shows that some situations cannot be judged as right or wrong, maybe it is right from one perspective but is wrong from a different perspective. And only thing you can do is choose between those two options according to the priorities you have and stick with it, No matter what. Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) is an orphan dropped out of school after his 4th grade, works as a cable operator near a police station in rural area. In this movie Vijay's family in order to protect themselves, had done something which according to society is a crime. But Vijay supports his family and protects them with all his wisdom and knowledge he has got through watching TV and trying to apply those in real life.\n\nThe movie is a must watch for a thriller lover. Ajay Devgn as always has done brilliant acting. Shriya Sharan has also done impressively good."

We have already seen her serious acting in recent movies but in this, she goes a notch higher. The rating has earned an extra half star for Tabu's acting.\n\nDrishyam is excellent in all departments.

The screenplay is excellent and there is not a single unwanted scene in the movie after the actual story picks up. MUST WATCH"

Ajay Devgn at its best what I say after Omkara and Nishikant Kamat getting mature after Mumbai Meri Jaan, Lai Bhaari. And Tabu needs no explanation, Rajat Kapoor made his presence felt with such less screen time as well.

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie develops well from the start and has few coincidences. But they are used perfectly throughout. Crux of the movie is its script that is almost developed flawlessly. Even when you think that script has shown every thing, it extracts few more awesome spices from within and presents it's brilliance. Cinematography shines from the start and consistently wonders all through. First half shows good thrilling intensity that makes the viewers want more from the second half. Fortunately, the second part shows much more than expected. Ending of a movie of such kind is very important and that was only scaring me at the end. But it was done very diligently and suited well. As per as the remake phenomenon is there (movie is remade from Malayalam Drishyam), I would love to see these kinds of remakes instead of silly commercial ones.\n\nBoth Tabu and Ajay Devgan were spot on in their part. Although main focus was completely on the theme and not on the stars at all but it was very important to play these characters well. Rising above all was Kamlesh Sawant (Inspector Gaitonde) who nailed the performance that was supposedly the most important role and character in the movie. We have seen him before in few good short roles but this was a comparatively bigger responsibility in which he succeeded. Few other characters were good and fit well with the flow.\n\nNishikant Kamat is well known to direct good high intense movies and he used his skill perfectly in this venture. He did full direction justice required for this remake. Certainly he puts a good amount of appreciable effort.\n\nIt reminds me of a similar 2010 movie gem 'Right Ya Wrong' which many people are not aware of. Not inspired of-course but both these movies are definitely a must watch.\n\nOverall, an astonishing script supported with great cinematography and direction."

From very start, It makes you believe that you know the climax but topples you down from your own beliefs at the end.

The storyline revolves around a man trying to protect his family after a crime, which in itself could be interesting, but the cultural context and the pacing make it difficult for non-Indian audiences to engage fully with the plot.\n\nThe film's melodramatic tone and drawn-out scenes feel far too exaggerated for my taste, and the moral dilemmas presented don't hit with the same intensity they might for an audience more familiar with the setting. While it's always interesting to see films from different cultures, this one felt too alien and disconnected for me.\n\nI couldn't relate to the characters or the societal issues portrayed, and after about 40 minutes, I found myself tuning out. The plot didn't offer enough intrigue to keep me invested, and it's a struggle to understand why this film is held in such high regard.\n\nUltimately, it's not a film I'd recommend unless you're deeply interested in Indian cinema or familiar with the cultural context."

The screenplay was astonishing and THAT music just made us hooked throughout the film.\n\nT the end, I just want to say that Indian Cinema needs more movies like this as the audience is sick and tired of those stupid Rom-Com and Action movies.

        "review_detailed_main": "Drishyam is a film that I had been keeping my eye on ever since it had been announced. And when it opened, it opened to outstanding reviews and I went to go see it for myself. And I have to say, those reviews were all right. And even though the film is a remake of a South Indian movie, this film is still outstanding.\n\nThe performances were excellent. First off, hats off to Ajay Devgan. I feel with this film he has redeemed himself after doing films like Himmatwala, Rascals, and Son Of Sardar. His performance was intense, natural and overall great. Tabu also did just as good, and she really impressed in the interrogation scenes with her intensity and emotion. Shriya Saran and Ishita Dutta, who I have not seen before in films, did very well also and they were very impressive and convincing. And the little girl was adorable. Overall, the entire cast did excellent.\n\nThe story was gripping and intense. And even though the film had sort of a slow pace, the films intelligence makes up for that, as shown in the ending and how they show Ajay Devgan conning the police. The direction was also very well and same with the dialogues.\n\nOverall, if you love thriller movies, or just want to watch a great, intelligent, and entertaining film, watch Drishyam."

        "review_detailed_main": "For all the Ajay Devgn fans out there, especially those who were complaining about him performing more of gravity defying stunts in his last flicks with Rohit Shetty and not portraying realistic, grounded and intense roles, just go and watch Drishyam. Go and watch Ajay Devgn deliver one of the finest performances in his highly illustrious career. You can watch him in sheer disbelief as he gives subtle acting a new meaning in Drishyam. He has fit into the character of a common man having extraordinary intelligence with remarkable ease. Ajay Devgn has emoted a common man's struggle to prevent his adored family from falling apart mostly through his smoldering eyes. Watch out for him in the scene when he goes to his cable office and his assistant asks him about his well being finding him in a pensive mood. Ajay Devgn immediately changes his tone and expressions in a brilliant manner so that everything seems normal to his assistant. It's one of Ajay Devgn's finest performances till date. Tabu, once again proves her mettle as an actress with her extraordinary performance in this film.She is seen in two different avatars in this movie ; a top notch, intense Police Officer and a worried, emotional mother. And, to her credit Tabu has stood her ground firmly while portraying both these avatars. She has enacted the right amount of intensity, aggression and emotions that her character was supposed to portray in the film. Pertinent to say, Ajay Devgn and Tabu are the two solid pillars of this movie. Shriya Sharan has given an earnest performance as Ajay's wife. She has ably emoted the expressions of fear when the family goes through crisis and covers them up commendably when interrogated by Cops. Rajat Kapoor has given a restrained performance as Tabu's husband who is worried about his son's whereabouts but is also against the torture being inflicted upon Ajay's family. Rajat is such a natural actor and it is a treat watching him perform in Drishyam. Ishita Dutta & Mrinal shine as Ajay's daughters and have given a commendable performance. Not to forget, Kamlesh Jadhav who looks every inch the corrupt cop that he is supposed to portray on-screen.\n\nDrishyam is undoubtedly a Master-Piece with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances. An exceptional film as far as the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audience who love to watch family and thriller movies.\n\nThanks"

Should we side with Ajay Devgn's family who have committed a crime, even if they are good people or should we side with Tabu, a strict Police officer but also the grieving mother of a boy gone missing?\n\nAjay Devgn, Shriya and the two girls all play their parts to perfection. Their emotions, dilemmas, fears and the sense of guilt is expertly portrayed to the viewers by the director. Tabu is her awesome self and plays the part of a ruthless Police officer well and then just as easily shifts to the tear-jerking character of a grieving mother. The other characters also play their part well."

Corruption and oppression are portrayed here in an interesting way. Sometimes the themes and acting seem artificial, but that's familiar from Hollywood and is part of the deal. The European taste was certainly a bit exaggerated at times and overall a bit drawn out. But absolutely worth seeing."

And then a movie introduces itself to the faculty of our reasoning (if you keep the practicality aspect aside) which not only keep you amalgamated with its effects but also make you think on every twist and turn: How come everything is making sense!\n\nOne of the best things I found about the movie is its unusual pace, as exists in the Mother Nature of slowly and slowly ripening things to next levels, cautiously building up the story minute after minute. No point in rushing towards a nail biting finale. And leave one or two strings unattached on the way to always keep spectators perplexed, speculating.\n\nAll in all a must watch as a thriller!\n\nDown Point: Music\n\nPlus Point: Acting, plot and story-telling."

So you cannot even in your wildest dream expect this movie to be entertaining in a traditional way. Coming at the storyline, I am not going to repeat it as it is already there several times. There are situations when you cannot judge/or call a person to be criminal just because of what he did. Instead, even he is a criminal in the eye of the law, you would support him after knowing the full story. Just a philosophic thought here; are all the so called 'criminal' are really criminal - or you would support him and will not judge him as guilty if you know why he had made that action. The movie is unpredictable - at least to the general viewers. I have never met anyone who had climax that he had anticipated the climax before it happened. Being a general man, we usually keep distance from the unwanted problems. But what you would do if problems comes itself to your door? Would you surrender to it or fight against it. But there is another way. Heard a proverb where it said that aim to the storm in such a way that it works in favor of you. Evey character are so appropriate, that you can call them ideal as per the Indian tradition and society. Loving husband, caring elder brother, Protector of the family \u2013 you will find all of them in Vijay. In the end , you will leave the movie hall \u2013 but the movie will not let you leave alone.

As it's a remake, all credit goes to the original writer-director Jeethu Joseph. What a brilliant, gripping, thrilling, and flawless thriller movie has he written! Full credit to him to even think of a such an awesome plot and execution.\n\nFor the remake, I can say Ajay did a good job, but it could be pretty much done by anyone. The script is the main and only thing that snatches away everything. Just mind blowing. If you're a fan of classic thriller movies like Shutter Island, Se7en, Fight Club or even Ocean's 11. You would love the film same as those. Just go with it. You can't go wrong with this!"

But this one truly is totally different which was very brave of the producers and directors to make this movie in spite Bollywood totally taking a safe side with those non sense romantic flicks and they got their reward people likes it and i think this is the stepping stone towards change in Bollywood in the coming years people are less likely to watch those stupid senseless flicks again and again on repeat mode year after year. Coming to this particular movie though it will in the beginning loose all the hopes of being an 'Absolute Thriller' and 'Suspense', but what follows throughout is not less than a suspense, director has very perfectly managed to sew in suspense in those small events throughout the movie, the plot as a whole is very clear in the beginning half an hour but you'll have to watch this movie and will keep you glued not for mystery but what follows and what is the likely outcome though most will guess it it is quite obvious but how the director still keeps those mystery intact in small events is totally phenomenal. Coming to the conclusion watch for a change in Bollywood and the evolution of Bollywood which might just be around the corner.Bollywood Directors and producers should take some risks and provide new themes and set an example world wide, because if they keep on sitting on their comfort zone the movie goers might move on very soon to Hollywood and other different stories."

But just when you're about to lose patience, it takes us on a tour de force and keeps upping the gears until the last few moments. Drishyam does take some time to speed up as the first half is mostly concentrated on character development. But things quickly start moving after the murder occurs, and reaches a thrilling climax.\n\n\u202aDrishyam\u202c has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax. Drishyam deserves to be seen for two very good performances by the lead actors and also for the director's tight grip over the subject material. Drishyam is as Indian a thriller as there possibly could be. Even though the film is long enough, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.\n\nI strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers."

        "review_detailed_main": "Two quotes from the past -- First quote - 'Everything I learned I learned from the movies' -- Audrey Hepburn;\n\nSecond quote - 'You know what your problem is, its that you haven't seen enough movies - all of life's riddles are answered in the movies' -- Steve Martin.\n\nThis movie is a testament to the above two quotes.\n\nA father, a private cable movie operator, who is only 4th class (grade) pass is suddenly engulfed in a crisis starting with the sexual harassment of his school going daughter. The movie is about how he deals with the family crisis.\n\nThe movie is gripping, suspenseful and without a dull moment. There is no hitch or element of implausibility in the entire narration.\n\nDirector Nishikant Kamat has done three movies, Dombivli Fast (2005), Mumbai Meri Jaan (2008) and Drishyam (2015), and it is difficult to say which is better than which....all of them have been very well appreciated.\n\nAjay Devgn has given a memorable performance. Tabu gives a very excellent act in the last scene with Ajay Devgn and Rajat Kapoor, where her son's fate is tacitly revealed and she is left to quietly bear the devastation of his loss. Kamlesh Sawant (as Inspector Gaitonde) has acted very well.\n\nMost of the key actors in the movie are women - Tabu, Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta, Mrunal Jadhav. They have all done well.\n\nRajat Kapoor was just like an emotionless prop, although he is a grieving father.\n\nThe remaining actors also have acted well.\n\nThe film poster has been designed very well. It shows all the important actors in the story and conveys the dark suspense of the movie."

As it is said that it is a remake of Malayalam movie of same name and that was a blockbuster, this one is well made remake. Unlike other high budget movie the backbone of this movie is the story. No useless action or item songs, in fact there are only 2 songs if am not wrong and well placed according to situation. Its also shows the advantage of watching all the movies when you need a way out of a mess ;)\n\nBrilliant story,power pack acting by all the actors.The first half is little slow but it will compensate later. Ajay & Tabu are brilliant as usual."

The way importance of Family in one's life is represented, is truly amazing. Great twists. Undoubtedly I call this movie \"My favourite Bollywood movie\". Followed by Don2. I'm a huge fan of dark movies, and this movie goes far beyond my expectations. I thought it would be just another Bollywood disappointment in the name of dark movies, but the moment it reached to its climax I was completely amazed. Its just a shame for us that Bajrangi bhaijaan that released two weeks earlier than Drishyam, collected far far more than this masterpiece and it performed average on box office."

I would have regret if I missed such a masterpiece. Story portrays the life of a middle class family who suffers from intense pains and sorrows just to keep themselves intact. High authority tries to bully, put pressure over them but still they face them.Movie cleverly plays with psychology of the people and degree of impact cinema has on people's mind. I would rate it 9/10."

There wasn't a single dull moment till the end and the climax was also unexpected. I would love to see more movies like this in Bollywood.\n\nThe only drawback will be the Nandini character which could have only added more to this masterpiece but overall her roll wasn't that much of a requirement, I mean I don't see much solo dialogue of her in the movie.\n\nAnd anther thing which I like about this movie is that there was no song forcefully added. The one which are here weren't that much of an entertainer but its Bollywood.\n\nIn the end, we would love to see more movies like this soon as can'y aspect a sequel of Drishyam anytime soon or ever."

Why is this simple non educated family man taken in? How can him and his family have anything to do with this?\n\nI can't give too much away as it will ruin the plot but the climax is amazing.
