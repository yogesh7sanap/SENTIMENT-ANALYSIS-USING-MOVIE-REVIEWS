        "review_detailed_main": "@garcwrites: This movie is a slow burn that gives you enough time to get to know the new mutants but it's not very atmospheric. It doesn't put you in the mood, despite the horror vibe of the piece. I never felt anxious, or worried for any of the characters.\n\nEven if the tone is a bit of a miss for me, it is a smartly constructed story. I felt I got the characters. I understood their fears, their traumas, and why they were the way we found them on an intellectual level but I hardly felt for them. I can't say that the actors didn't pull their weight, even though they are no oscar worthy performances, but giving that the atmosphere wasn't really there nothing elevated the work they put in.\n\nThe action scenes and visual effects were great for what they were going for, but in comparison to the sets looked like an expensive new car in a junk yard. The facility they were in is so rundown and cheap looking that I couldn't believe that it had voice activated locks. It would have been easier to believe that the doors opened and closed because of a Mutant's power.\n\nThe New Mutants felt like a great idea that wasn't totally followed through. There is a gun-shy feeling to it. They didn't go all the way or didn't strike the right tone. The first half of Josh Trank's Fant4stic Four felt more ominous than this entire movie. Unless they going for an intellectual horror superhero movie - if that's a thing - it worked! Because I understood what I was suppose to feel but never experienced any of the emotions."

Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive. The climax is anticlimactic so....\n\nThere was potential for a good movie, and the actors did fine, but the characters didn't act like real people. It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.\n\nPart of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth. It checks all the boxes except being interesting and having a good plot... you know... like missing the whole point of movies."

It has some stranger things influence and some cliches around it but overall is a nice blending of bizarre horror tinged aspects from the comics with great character arcs.

People were expecting a full out conjuring horror with an endgame level ending which is obviously not what this movie was going for so for anyone expecting either of those your of course gonna get disappointed. It does start out a little slow but once the horror and trauma aspects of the characters start the movie is easier to get into. My family and I went into this movie barley seeing the trailers and not really knowing what to expect and we came out feeling like we got our moneys worth. If you're questioning what to do because of the reviews I advice you go and make your own opinion."

The movie starts off quite well, however it definitely falls flat a bit at the end, but it's entertaining and worth watching. It has a decent length and it's well made and it has a good plot. As for the concept of horror ... MEH ... it's not really horror, it has a little bit of horror but nothing spectacular, and I wouldn't put it under the category of horror. I loved all the characters, especially the character of Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy), it's a shame that we won't see these characters and their stories anymore since it is the closing chapter of the X-Men saga with FOX. Probably all the delays that occurred with this movie affected it in one way or another, especially because most of the people will expect too much and be disappointed, but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is. At least it's WAY better than X-men Dark Phoenix."

        "review_detailed_main": "So, I've heard a lot of bad word-of-mouth about this X-Men flick, but otherwise knew very little about it. As such, I went in with low expectations. And although there is nothing remotely novel about the movie, I didn't think it was too bad at all.\n\nThe plot: So, my review title suggests that the plot is very closely aligned to M Night Shymalan's \"Glass\" - his \"Split\" sequel from last year. A Victorian-style hospital-cum-prison similarly forms the claustrophobic setting for the majority of the movie. This is where the troubled teen Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) is taken after being suddenly orphaned in dramatic and mysterious circumstances. The only doctor present, Dr Reyes (Alice Braga), says she is being held there for her own - and society's safety - while her puberty-driven mutant tendencies emerge.\n\nLocked away with her is Rahne (Maisie Williams), Charlie (Sam Guthrie), 'hot' Brazilian hunk Roberto (Henry Zaga) and the gloriously named Illyana Rasputin (Anya-Taylor Joy). Danni's arrival sparks a serious of escalating events that literally lead to all hell breaking loose.\n\nBlu is the warmest colour: What made this Marvel movie stand-out for me, from the normal glass-shattering standard, is that it is predominantly a character-led piece. We spend quite a bit of time (for a Marvel movie) in building relationships between the teens, including a sweet lesbian-coming-out 'will they/won't they' tension between Rahne and Danni.\n\nI was also very much attracted to the performance of Blu Hunt. I admit that this might not just be due to her interesting performance (the indigenous / LBGT angle is intriguing) but because she reminded me strongly of a girl at school who I had a mad crush on and completely failed to get off with! Blu is actually native American (from the Lakota tribe). Given she is the lead and has to carry the movie, it's a surprise that she is only about 5th in the billing: I'd have been upset with the director (Josh \"A Fault in our Stars\" Boone) about that.\n\nMaisie Williams is also effective in this, and gets top billing, although arguably Anya-Taylor-Joy has emerged - with her wonderful \"Emma\" - as the bigger star since filming.\n\nBut it's Taylor-Joy's Rasputin that really stands out as the most interesting of the characters on show. There's a scene where she goes into action - eyes blazing and 'daemon' hovering - that would make a splendid PC screensaver! Stuff the \"Black Widow\" standalone movie: I'd go watch Illyana Rasputin kicking ass in her own follow-up movie! (Of course, Anya Taylor-Joy was also prominent in \"Glass\", which unfortunately cements the similarities between the films.)\n\nThe movie has had a long and tortuous path to its final release, being made waaaaaayyyyy back in 2017. As an X-Men movie, it's appeared after the X-Men universe finally imploded (with the disappointing whimper of \"Dark Phoenix\"). So in that sense it's a bit of a ghost of a flick.\n\nOverall, it's a mixed bag. There's a sense of great familiarity with the contents - particularly with the strong echoes of \"Glass\", actually filmed after this one (but with 'inversion', who knows anymore?). Even the \"Indian legend\" that runs through the movie swaps a bear for a wolf but ends with a familiar, rather groan-inducing, motto. (It was used in \"Tomorrowland\" I think?)\n\nBut the young cast are attractive and entertained me for the (pleasantly short) running time. It's not going to win any prizes for originality, or indeed anything else. But it really wasn't the X-Men bust I expected it to be.\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)"

I find it good that they finally did something with Magik. It'll be better if was more about her. I would also find it better if it has more connections to the greater X-Men franchise with Magik being Colossus's sister and there being a small tie to Logan. It can feel a little short in my opinion. It'll be better if it's a half hour or a full one longer and having that R rating, leaning a little more into the blood and possibly a scene of full rear nudity."

There are great special effects, there's Maisie Williams and Anna Joy Taylor (great upcoming actresses!) and there's a good storyline (not the most elaborate one, but at least there's a storyline!) but... here it comes! But, you feel the restraint of the director, the lack of the potential that could have been! Maybe Boone should pull a Snyder and release his 'Boone cut' of the movie! Because this could (should!!) have been a horror movie like The Conjuring (it had that potential, believe me!) Good effort though and sometime directors should listen less to the studios and make the movie they want to make!!!\n\nAll in all a good movie, but it could have been better! Let's hope Disney dares to make the horrors (which I doubt) that we really want to see! Marvel has great characters and some of them are truly bad and scary... (will they ever dare to make the Marvel Zombies movie?) just give the directors the chance to do what they want to do!"

Too many things going on without a clue. Who is going where or who is hunting whom you will have no idea. Second, they tried the old \"cliche/corny\" humor in almost every scene but it just didnt cut. I mean they were so bad and the timings were so off w.r.t. to the scene. Third, the dialogues didnt at all make sense. All of a sudden \"you are family\". I mean WTF !!! .... I think they had a \"Random Word Generator\" for the dialogues for any given scene.

The movie may not be perfect, but it has a good premise and I respect the director new direction to the superhero genre. I appreciate this movie more than other generic Disney marvel movies that makes me feel like I'm watching the same movie every year.

I also really enjoy the basic premise and, although ultimately a small failure, I also enjoyed the attempt for a slightly darker more horror feel.\n\nSo, the good: Anya Taylor-Joy! It is such a joy to watch this young woman in anything. She is brilliant actress and she is the shining star of this movie too. The rest of the cast, with a couple of exception, is also excellent in their roles.I also love the pacing. There is no Wham! Slam! Kaboom! every 5 seconds as is the norm with most superhero movies. The general story and storytelling is also very good. We get to know the characters really well and since the telling of the story take its time we have a nice good entertaining story to watch. Also big extra plus for showing a Buffy episode in the background in one scene. As mention I also enjoyed what they tried to do. Mostly they did a great job, but it didn't really land. Which leads me to:\n\nThe bad: The horror aspect and slightly darker feel do not really work 100%. Mainly because its very cliche. Evil corporation? Well, never seen that before... And testing going with an evil doctor is so cliche that its basically a bore. Especially since the doctor lady is also the weakest actor of the movie. The movie is also very short. Feels like they should have made the story last a lot longer. And my final small complaint is that the CGi is not always on point. Sure the computer graphics are a million times better than anything the DC gang spits out, but for Marvel and superhero movies not so great.\n\nOverall though this is a good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I give it a 7/10, a strong 7. Magic is the star and a great character, but I hope we see a lot more of these folk in the future. Definitely a lot that can done with this team. Definitely recommend!"

I was, obviously, expecting the worse, but once in a while there's a movie where I think the whole world has gone insane. What I saw was a solid but very different super hero movie. I was surprised with the quality of the direction and the whole production and I must say I really liked the idea of making a horror version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with a super hero backdrop. Granted there are some pacing issues and it takes a while for something to happen, but I much prefer trying to go for something different and fail than to watch the same movie over and over again. The cast was OK, with Anya Taylor-Joy having the best character, and as I've said before, she can do no wrong. The ending is a bit formulaic but I think it was earned and I would gladly see more movies with this particular team. Watch it with an open mind."

This movie lacked substance, continuity, story, everything. I am very disappointed and hope the makers of this debacle feel the same as well. One positive, I think the actors actually did a good job with what they had to work with. But come on!!! Haven't we tortured the x-men/mutant side of Marvel enough with bad movies?? It is such a RICH storytelling opportunity!!! Why can you not see this and make a movie that is worthy of it? Okay, I am done with my rant, but seriously, the \"mutant phenomena\" within Marvel and essentially the American Dogma of American Mythology has been something I not only grew up with, but have studied throughout the years, and this movie really missed its mark. There is so much amazing source material they could have played from, and they just trashed it all to make some garbage that they hoped people would pay to see."

Its weaknesses are evident as well: it feels rushed and some of the action dialogue is unnecessarily cheesy. That said, it holds its own as a fun, creepy and unique entry into modern super hero cinema. I would write off the poor box office showing as partly due to Covid, and many of the poor reviews due to it being compared to Phase 3 Marvel, which was full of top-rate movies.\n\nIt's not just watchable; it's fun, unique, and memorable.

But I have to say new mutants was a pleasant surprise of a movie, no it isn't perfect or like the best movie I have seen out of this year but this movie I did enjoy for what it was. There is a lot to like about the new mutants aka the cast, the cast here was pretty good and each member gave a pretty good performances but the 2 standouts had to Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor Joy who steal the show each time they were on screen and both gave the best performances of the whole movie. The story is also very interesting and the concept was done pretty decent. The characters are also for the most part good but the 2 stands were Rahne(maisie Williams) and Illayna (Anya Taylor Joy) who easily kept this movie going each time their characters were on screen. The action and fight scenes were also fantastic and well shot this is a super hero movie so expect some well shot fights. Also the romance in this movie even though it was very clutches I thought it did the job for what the movie was aiming for. The second and third acts also saved this movie from being a flop and being an disaster. Where the movie starts to fail is with the pacing, the pacing in the first act is extremely messing and the first 30 minutes of this movie felt extremely rushed. Also there is barley any character development for some of the characters in this movie which sucks because we got these great characters but we don't get to really know about their backstories or their pasts we just get little hints about it. But where the movie does fail was it was always marketed as a horror movie yes there is horror elements and those elements were done very well but they never committed to this being a full blown horror movie and maybe because it was PG-13 and I think that rating did make it suffer if it was R I'm sure it would of been a lot better. Overall, the new mutants is a pretty fun movie that I enjoy quite a bit, yes it's not perfect and after all the delays it had I don't think it did any help to this movie but if you have the chance to see this movie I would say give it a watch because I enjoyed it quite a bit."

The acting, led by a talented ensemble cast, infuses authenticity into the diverse characters grappling with their extraordinary powers. The film editing weaves a narrative that balances supernatural suspense with moments of heartfelt connection. The movie's strength lies in its departure from conventional superhero tropes, delving into psychological horror and the emotional complexities of its characters. However, the weakness may emerge in moments where the plot feels restrained by genre expectations. The music, with its haunting tones, adds an eerie layer to the atmospheric tension. With a 7/10 rating, \"The New Mutants\" stands as a genre-bending exploration of mutant abilities, blending the supernatural with the emotional struggles of adolescence in a way that's both intriguing and, at times, haunting."

It was definitely on the tame side. It could have been dialed up a notch or two but overall it's good. Better than most of the X-men movies. At least the story isn't filled with a bunch of plot holes. I personally would like to see these characters in other movies.

The first time I saw this, I wished I had been wearing a nappy or sitting on a very big sponge, it is that funny. Personally, I could not get up from rolling around on the floor, nor the people I was with, although they had it worse, as they kept falling off the bed. Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles, which could well be true. Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film. Or when they made it. Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production. Just possibly. Anyway, it is hilarious. I got my DVD copy for \u00a32. That says it all really I would say. Watch this film if you want to see: neon-coloured food, children in masks and dressed in sacks charging around a forest set to a dodgy 2020-theme, awful make up, worse acting, even worse dialogue, the funniest yokels ever (including Anya Taylor - 'nuff said) and the mightiest weapon ever seen in any film ever. Go on, watch it. Best laugh of my life, could be yours too."

But the movie could easily stand alone as a horror even if it wasn't connected to Marvel.\n\nIt was nice though that they did include enough clues about the bigger Marvel/X-Men universe which kept it interesting.\n\nOverall, was somewhat anticlimactic but had a positive message. It just felt too safe in the Politically Correct department. But otherwise it was enjoyable if not a little disappointing."

Maybe it's taking so much heat because with so many delays people had built it up to be something it's not. It doesn't fit perfectly in any genre box, it melds a bunch together. It pays homage to a bunch of classics for serious movie lovers. And it leads you to imagine how these characters would fit into the larger X-Men universe by giving you a teaser of their backstory. I personally would love to see these characters integrated into some new storylines with some of the classic characters."

There are only minor references to the X-Universe, and then Essex, but that's really it. The characters have their own story and are allowed to show who they are and why they are there; not just existing to move the story to a bigger narrative or introduce other characters. It can work as a stand alone film, like \"Logan\", or be enjoyed as part of the X-Universe. I think it's well done, and has solid music by Mark Snow."

It is as if the writer(s)/producer(s) never bothered to read any of \"The New Mutants\" comic books. The film's direction is all over the place. Is it a horror film? Is it a drama? Maybe an action adventure film? This film doesn't know what it wants to be.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about this film is that I waited for it to come out on cable television. It seems thousands of other MCU fans also agree with my review as box office sales were one of the lowest for an X-men franchise movie. I think it is safe to say that a sequel is not forthcoming anytime soon."

As a fan of the 90's comic you cannot deny the film kind of was trying to capture the spirit of this era.\n\nI somewhat had to think of Sam as the emo kid listening to Grunge all day and being depressed. You could say it's a but clich\u00e9 but It somehow reminded me of my own teenage years in the early to mid 90's.\n\nThe overall pacing can be a bit slow at times and the Horror elements are not actually scary. It reminds you somewhat of IT though the scenes here are generally more creepy.\n\nIn the end it felt more like a pilot to an upcoming New Mutants TV series...that will never be. And it might have actually been a decent TV series with more time to explore every characters background a bit more in detail. Like this it's a one time watch only."

The trailers are slightly misleading as to who the antagonists are but does it in a way that does not spoil one of the best parts of the movie.

Hence the lack of tension and excitement in many of them.\n\nHowever, this film suffers from different problems - a lack of spark, desperation, intriguing character development and , by the looks of it, not going far enough with the horror aspects of the story. Which is what the director was hoping for, but didn't get to do.\n\nThis movie would not do well at all in theatres, but probably better on streaming.

It was a shot at letting someone take their creative spin and try to make something new as opposed to retelling the same tired marvel stories over and over again.

Despite McEcvoy's talent, X-Men was better with Hugh Jackman, Halley Berry Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. Going to watch the 3rd Deadpool movie tomorrow night. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart have been the key ingredients so far. Deadpool (played by some part time actor) and Welshpool (played by an accomplished thespian) can do no wrong."

Did the people making this movie just give up after a couple day in to the production of it? Thankfully I didn't spend (loose) money for a movie ticket. Those people who have read The New Mutants comics will still find this movie difficult to sit through. Bad acting, bad story, bad direction and bad production values plague this movie from start to finish."

        "review_title": "Not as Bad as Initially Perceived",
        "review_detailed_main": "Last year during the brief revival of limited theaters during late summer, the controversial X-men movie New Mutants was released. Despite being made in 2017, the film was not completed until 2020 due to scheduling conflicts and the Disney Fox buyout merger. Unfortunately, when it did come out, it was poorly received by critics and it made very little money financially, thus prompting a potential franchise to squander as of late. So now that it's been a little while since the film's disastrous light of day, it's time to look at it with a fresh new pair of eyes and see how it holds up. The result itself is quite promising actually, albeit to an extent.\n\nSet in the X-men universe, the film follows teenage mutant Dani Moonstar, who is sent for treatment at a secret institution that means to cure her powers, along with four other teen mutants: Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Sunspot and Magik. Supervised by Dr. Cecilia Reyes to share their stories, each mutant's memories soon turn into terrifying realities based on their concerns about being held prisoner. From the start, this does seem like a pretty intriguing story to set up all of these fascinating characters, and to the film's credit, it does establish a lot about Dani's discovery of what her powers are supposed to be. Aided by a strong performance from newcomer Blu Hunt, Dani's lack of knowledge of her own true power and spiritual connection as a young indigenous woman are what make her the most sympathetic protagonist throughout the film's slow albeit short runtime. It also helps when the film gets really emotional by developing a very strong friendship between Dani and Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane), especially based on Rahne's insecurities with great power and feelings towards Dani.\n\nWith that said, the one make or break deal for viewers coming into the movie blind is the familiarity with the X-men franchise and the admittedly generic plot. It's not hard to predict what might happen in a movie where a new girl is brought into an asylum and isn't treated too well at first by all of their peers, and if not for the movie being in the horror genre, this would not be too different from any other coming of age teen dramedy. As for the issue regarding the X-men movies, while I do think this movie works as a stand alone film without knowing about any of the previous X-men movies, the whole connection leading to why Dr. Reyes is even controlling the mutants might need a bit more backing up from previous movies, or even comics for that matter. It doesn't help that while Alice Braga does her best intimidating role as Reyes, the character herself feels severely underdeveloped and one would almost wish the movie would spend just a little more time on how she feels about the mutants overall, especially when a good chunk of them are either brats or emotionally scarred forever.\n\nOn the plus side, while the movie does fall short in the substance department, it does have a very solix albeit dragged on climax which could lead to more interesting stories with these mutants later on. Sadly, those plans might not happen given the X-men being forged into the MCU (thanks Disney) and the film's poor financial performance, but one can certainly hope for future tales of teen discovery. As for other notable qualities, given that this is a lower budgeted superhero flick, the special effects are a bit more limited yet very cool to look at, almost as if director Josh Boone and the VFX crew really took advantage of the limitations to make the mutants' powers come off as believable as possible. Also, for a PG-13 horror movie, there are some genuinely messed up moments here and there that even startled myself, something that a lot of the more mature superhero movies don't quite do as often. It's really funny how this simple spinoff film managed to come off more sophisticated in its darkness than most mainstream Marvel fodder.\n\nSo while it doesn't look like New Mutants will be successful enough to warrant anymore potential storylines, I don't think what we got turned out as bad as people made it out to be. For all of its faults, there was a lot of passion, heart and even dedication put into this movie that might have been more successful had it been released before the global pandemic. I'm sure people have gotten jaded with X-men movies at this point, but even if you're not a fan, I would at least recommend giving this film a watch. It might not be your cup of tea, but it's worth a viewing or two just to give more attention to unique coming of age superhero tales."

The actors were more than convincing, the build up was amazing and the effects were awesome. Keep an open mind with this movie, it definitely fits parallel with the first three Xmen when it comes to vibe and atmosphere. I am going again and taking my friends!\n\nAND HELLO!

        "review_title": "\"New Mutants\" offers nothing new",
        "review_detailed_main": "Fimed way back in the bygone time of 2017, \"The New Mutants\" - the newest entry into the now-scrapped X-Men Cinematic Universe - has had its fair share of trouble getting to theaters. Originally set for release in April 2018, the movie has had a record of seven date changes, making it a running joke that it would never see the light of day. Defying the naysayers, \"The New Mutants\" has finally hit theaters right in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nSet in a remote research facility, \"The New Mutants\" follows five teenagers as they discover their newfound powers. The stern Dr. Reyes looks after the young mutants and tries to help them control their raw powers. We follow the newest member of the group, Danielle Moonstar, who was placed there after a mysterious natural disaster wiped out her entire reservation. After some time, the five realize that there's more behind this facility than meets the eye. To save themselves and right the wrongs of the past, the group must work together to harness their powers and become something bigger than themselves.\n\n\"The New Mutants\" is directed by Josh Boone, who last made a critical and commercial splash with his adaptation of \"The Fault in Our Stars\".\n\nBilled as an action/horror/drama, \"The New Mutants\" fails on all three of those genre levels. Thanks to Boone's inability to grasp onto his material, the various tones of the movie go together like oil & water rather than peanut butter & jelly.\n\nThe action is sparse throughout the first 80 minutes, only showing us glimpses of each person's unique power. The final 15 minutes end on an action set piece that unleashes all that the movie has been building up, which isn't much. The intentionally dark and snowy setting acts as a smokescreen to cover up the poor digital effects and blocking.\n\nFairing even worse than the action is the horror element. It's been reported that the studio demanded reshoots to add more horror after the mega-success of \"IT\". Neutered by a PG-13 rating, the scares in this movie are comparable to the ones found in a January dumpster movie aimed solely at young teenagers. For nearly the entire runtime, we're subjected to a rinse repeat cycle of jump scares and sound blasts that only mildly startle us, but never come close to scaring. Even the main villains - gangly creatures dressed in tuxedos that look almost too similar to Slenderman - come across more laughable than creepy.\n\nBut even the failings in the action and horror department don't come close to the movie's biggest crime, which is how boring it is. For being set in a superhero universe, very little of this movie is connected to the larger world. Except for a few name drops and the fact that our main characters are called mutants, this could have been set in any other YA universe and it wouldn't have made a difference.\n\nThe uninteresting plot offers few biting questions to chew on. If you have even an inkling of knowledge about the X-Men Universe, then these questions will be a breeze to answer. But, immediately knowing these answers is a double-edged sword as you now have to impatiently wait an hour for the movie to reveal them in the dullest way possible.\n\nMaybe the only person who can come out of this mess with some credibility is Blu Hunt and her performance as our lead character, Danielle. Hunt does fall into the teenage actor trap of overdoing it, but overall she does a commendable job of being the audience's viewpoint into this story.\n\nThree of our five main characters have accents and each of them vies for the award of least convincing. The winner of that goes to American-born Anya Taylor-Joy in her attempt at portraying a Russian. Charlie Heaton's Kentucky drawl comes in at a close second place, while the British Maisie Williams of \"Game of Thrones\" fame does alright with her Scottish accent.\n\nAs an action movie, \"The New Mutants\" is a failure. As a horror movie, it's a failure. Even as a piece of entertainment, it's a failure. This is nothing more than a cheap cash grab whose only purpose is to make a quick buck off brand recognition alone.\n\nThe only time I'll ever think about this movie again is when I have to decide where to place it on my worst-of-the-year list."

Not that I am overly thrilled about superhero movies in any way, so maybe that is why I wasn't aware of this movie's existence.\n\nAnd as it dawned on me that it was a Marvel movie, I must say that while the promise of a good movies grew bigger, I can't really claim that it was something that had me thrilled or excited.\n\nI will say that \"The New Mutants\" didn't feel like a movie with any heavy ties to the \"X-Men\" as such. Sure, there were some references, but this 2020 movie felt very much like a stand-alone movie just lightly set within the same universe. And I think that is an aspect that will part the water; either you enjoy that or find it a nuisance. Personally, I enjoyed that part of the movie.\n\nWriters Josh Boone and Knate Lee actually managed to put together a wholesome story that proved to be entertaining and enjoyable, without the glitter and glamour of Xavier and superheroes in skintight outfits. And the fact that there wasn't an all-powerful nemesis to battle and no determined heroes is what worked well in favor of the movie for me.\n\nVisually then \"The New Mutants\" was quite the treat, as it was pure eye-candy when the CGI team unfolded their talents and brought the creatures and powers to life on the screen.\n\nThe characters in \"The New Mutants\" were, for the most parts, actually enjoyable and interesting, and they had put together a good cast ensemble to bring the characters to life on the screen.\n\nOne thing that didn't sit well with me was the fact that the movie just had to have a lesbian love story angle to it. Of course it did, as the sexism wave hangs heavily over Hollywood, and every director has to be politically correct and include gays, lesbians or transgenders in every movie. Don't get me wrong, as I have nothing against such people or such sexual preferences, but it constantly being painted out on the screen in new movies is just wearing thin and leaves you with a sense of 'what is wrong with being heterosexual these days?'\n\nI found \"The New Mutants\" to be an enjoyable movie and, for me, the fact that it didn't have that generic \"X-Men\" vibe to it.\n\nMy rating of director Josh Boone's 2020 movie lands on a six out of ten stars."

The problem is that the movie has almost no tension. It's trapped like the kids in something that is neither this nor that. As a horror, there is little to no intensity to the scares. There could be some romantic possibility but they don't spend enough time on it. Mostly, this falls flat. Braga is not the most threatening of actors. I do really like the younger actors. I want them to succeed and that by itself is enough for me to accept this movie. It has no real drive or tension but it has enough good will to push it through."

The plot was just awful, the acting was awful, the ending was awful. \"The New Mutants\" is a generic spin off title even if there was no mutants in the movie. There was no character development, the main guy we can only assume is a creep for cheating on his wife. Unfortunately, my friend had to buy this movie to complete the X-men series.

During pandemic/Corona times, it would at least have an excuse. But the sheer endless wait had an end. And while I guess this might have either heightened your expectations or lowered them, the movie will probably land somewhere in the middle. I could not tell if or what was reshot, even if some characters look generally older than the age they are supposed to be playing.\n\nHaving said all that, this is the last X-Men movie that was made under the independent Fox logo. Disney bought Fox and therefor now holds the rights to their franchises. Which has good and bad sides to it. Disney can make and include even more Marvel characters in the MCU now. But it will also be more family friendly which takes away some of the edge some things may have had. Not X Men though, they were always on the PG13 side of things. So while this has some horror elements to it, it still isn't near an R-rating. If that matters to you.\n\nSurprising is that they took so much time and the end product is not really ... well it doesn't seem like that exceptional or worthy to be delayed. On the other hand it is not as bad as some made it to be on the day of the release, but I understand the anger or at least frustration. It's decent overall and entertaining, if you lower your expectations"

Today a movie we never thought would see the light of day finally awakens in hopes of making a big flash on the screen. But will Covid and a massive delay screw up the project promised months ago or are we merely to be a crowd of the incompetence of Hollywood and the business politics of the studio getting in the way of creativity. Robbie K back again to give you insight into the latest film as he reviews:\n\nMovie:\n\nNew Mutants (2020)\n\nDirector: Josh Boone Writers: Josh Boone, Knate Lee Stars: Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton\n\nLIKES:\n\nGood Graphics\n\n\nSome Decent Acting From Young Actors\n\n\nSome Deep Meaning\n\n\nDecent Run Time\n\n\nSome Great Horror Delivery at times\n\n\nRahne and Dani\n\n\nOkay climax:\n\n\nDISLIKES: Predictable\n\n\nSlow at times\n\n\nA Little too progressive at times\n\n\nA bit too forceful in acting\n\n\nPowers Come a Bit too late\n-This way was more drama focused and horror than the usual superhero part. Unique yes, but the slow none the same and a bit too bland.\n\nAddressing the deep roots a bit too easy and rushed\n\n\nIllyana a bit too much for me\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nAfter two long years I had my doubts about the movie having any sort of quality. However, the movie had some enjoyable components and was more put together in terms of the themes it was trying to deliver. Like Teen Wolf meets the Breakfast Club, the rogue like drama of this film manages to keep much of its characters interacting to make a heck of a drama. Some elements of the horror really are executed well and had they focused more on this element, we could have gotten one heck of a thrill ride. Sadly for me, the drama elements get in the way with a rushed plot, leading to overdone, in your face moments, rapid development for many of the characters, and some pacing issues that I hope to have settled in my comic movies. Still if you like drama/horror movies with a bit of a super hero flair, then check this one out, otherwise hold out for the bigger releases coming in a few weeks.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nAction/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had low expectations before viewing given all the bad reviews, but I actually liked the film. There have been worse movies in the X universe... far far worse that people reviewed as better. New Mutants isn't secretly a work of misunderstood genius (it gets close sometimes), but I don't think it deserves as much hate as it's received. Reading over some of the bad reviews, I felt a need to counterpoint.\n\nI loved the original run of the New Mutant comics. Much like the movie, it was relatively self-contained - there wasn't a whole lot of crossover. Nominally they were X-Men in training, but ended up doing their own thing most of the time. If the movie tried to force in a better known character to lead the audience, I think it would have cheapened it rather than enhancing it. Let the new mutants figure it out.\n\nOne review I saw complained about the accents - I would have been mad if they weren't there. Accents were represented in the comic text and an essential part of a character (shame on you other X films for accent stripping carelessly). Sam is from backwoods Kentucky, Rahne is from Scotland, and Illyana from Russia. 'Berto is from Brazil but for whatever reason his actor didn't bother trying (or wasn't directed to try). Illyana's movie accent is a little inconsistent - Russian accents are notoriously difficult and maybe they should have found a Russian or East European actor, but I appreciated the effort to make her true to her origin.\n\nAnother reviewer said they didn't explain the character backstories. Maybe it's because I know the backstories, but I liked that they didn't try to cram in biography expositions, instead focusing on experiential bits of fragmented memories for each character. The other X movies have butchered character backstories so often that I was expecting the worst. Here I didn't have that complaint. While not 100% comic consistent, New Mutants does pretty well at encapsulating similar sentiments to comic canon, something other X movies have been way more careless about.\n\nThe most impressive thing in the film though is the mutant powers. There was some creative license involved (one very notable embellishment), but this is probably the best portrayal of mutant powers in any X movie I've seen, as it not only was pretty accurate to the comics, but also really evocative and thoughtful about specific power nuance and how those powers might interact with the surrounding environment. Everyone involved with planning, shooting, editing, and adding special effects to those scenes did a fantastic job. Again here though, it might help if you know coming into it what each character's powers are, as they're a little more complicated than Cyclops eye beams (though even that has nuances that got lost in the movies).\n\nFinally, a lot of reviews seemed to be lost in the plot and not understanding why everything was happening. If you're familiar with the references (one of which has never really been fully explored in the movies but is huge in the comics), it all makes sense in the end and there's even some fun misdirection a long the way.\n\nBut maybe that's why it flopped for a lot folks - like fan fiction for a crowd not familiar with the source material. There were definitely other issues like occasional odd scene jumps and the movie being unsure whether it was trying to be breakfast club, girl interrupted, or \"miscellaneous teen horror movie\", but I think it got a lot closer to making a unique blend than given credit. My biggest disappointment is that we'll probably never get to see this version of these characters ever again, because for all the shortcomings of the film, it treated the characters and their source material with a lot more respect than typically seen in comic films."

The special effects are cheap, but hey, it's students, right? They have time to get it right when someone gives them a budget.\n\nBut this film is not a student film, but instead a 70 million dollars production from Disney-Fox. The connection with the extended X-Men lore is tenuous at best, the horror element is very generic, copied from so many other C movies that it has become comical and the thing that they never seem to get right is characterization. Watch Maisie Williams in the first seasons of GoT, Anya Taylor-Joy in Queen's Gambit, Charlie Heaton in Stranger Things, even Alice Braga in one of the Spanish films and you will see quality of acting, relatable characters. None in this film. Movies like The New Mutants is where actors go to die.\n\nSo it's a waste of time. Mutant X was better than this."

It's stupid. What made it worse was the diabolical storyline. What was with stupid characters. I realise there is a tiny screening of X-men on a television screen at the beginning, but God please, the only thing remotely in common with this film was that it contained a mutant. I personally think they should've stopped after the first two X-men's, unless they're prepared to follow up with something bigger, better and something that makes some kind of sense. If you wanna be bored stupid I suggest you watched that film."

Don't get me wrong - this isn't a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn't that good.\n\nOverall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed \"The New Mutants\" as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible \"Dark Phoenix\". This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Delayed so many times over the last three years that it seemed more likely that hell would freeze over before I saw this film, The New Mutants has become a hotly-anticipated and mysterious prospect. After all that waiting, though, I can't say that the movie lives up to its potential.\n\nA messy and unfortunately drab watch, the film struggles to inspire the imagination with its spin-off of the X-Men stories. Lacking atmosphere, tension and character depth, it's a pretty mediocre movie that, while not a total disaster, clearly isn't able to use its brightest ideas to the full.\n\nAnd that's where I want to start, because although The New Mutants is hardly a masterpiece, the effects of its many reshoots and production issues is wholly apparent throughout. As a result, its faults can't be entirely attributed to director Josh Boone, because there's a definite clash between a darker, more cerebral story from Boone and something a little more generic from the film's new owners, Disney.\n\nThese sorts of issues are inevitable under such circumstances, and it really bears out as the film briefly introduces really interesting ideas surrounding the history of the facility the story takes place in, but then just drops them in favour of a generic action finale - reminiscent of the struggles of the infamous Fant4stic.\n\nSaying that, however, there are major problems with this movie all the way through. Above all, it's a really drab, dull watch that does little to use the potential of its setting to tell a unique superhero story.\n\nWith a small cast in a contained setting, The New Mutants has all the potential to work as a hybrid haunted house/comic book movie, yet it lacks any sort of fear factor, tension or atmosphere to really put that into effect. Meanwhile, the film is frustratingly content with using an overtly grey colour palette to make things look moody, yet without really doing enough to bring a genuine sense of eeriness or claustrophobia into play.\n\nFailing that, The New Mutants also had the potential to work as a coming-of-age take on the superhero genre. Following young mutants discovering their powers and how to control them, the film's central themes fit perfectly with the genre, but the screenplay is nowhere near layered enough to make that drama at all interesting.\n\nAll of the characters are painfully one-dimensional; each a stereotype among the wider group in a vain attempt to play off the legacy of The Breakfast Club. As a result, there's little reason to actually invest emotion into connecting with the characters, because there isn't much to uncover beneath the surface.\n\nAnd because of that, the film's story, action and main villain are all far less effective than could have otherwise been the case. Linking into each of the characters' back stories and deepest fears, there should have been far more focus placed on the emotions of the main characters.\n\nBut with no way to form a genuine connection with anyone on screen, The New Mutants falls flat throughout, and the final act in particular lacks any genuine intensity or excitement, unfolding as a painfully drab and generic action climax with nothing to really grab your attention.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed by The New Mutants. Though it isn't a total disaster, it has all the hallmarks of a film that has been wrangled back and forth between different owners with different sets of ideas. It's messy, dull and unfortunately drab throughout, missing the opportunity to develop its best ideas as it plumps for a more generic, one-dimensional action story."

Too convoluted and a sad way to end the X-Men film franchise."

I wish it was more creepy but was there was creepy enough.\n\nI'm giving it a 10 because of all these negative reviews, in reality I would give it a 7. Not the best in the marvel series but far from the worst.\n\nThe biggest downfall of the movie were the obviously fake accents that the actors had, they were heavy and even if you never saw these actors in anything else you would know they are fake. Besides that, shut up and watch the movie!"

Apart from that, other than it being a little slow in some places and then being rushed at the end, it was a cool movie and definitely doesn't deserve half of the abuse it's been receiving."

        "review_detailed_main": "The New Mutants (2020) Dir. Josh Boone. Taking as a common thread the Cherokee legend of the two internal wolves (in this case, bears) that represent the conflict of antagonistic internal forces in each individual, 'The New Mutants', takes us into the fierce inner battles that five cloistered youths wage in a kind of psychiatric hospital trying to make their dark side visible and face it to find a balance between who they are and the individual powers that segregate them and make them different from others. I understand that negative comments are emerging around the new Marvel proposal: The New Mutants is completely different from the tone that has characterized that universe and that of the X-Men in particular. From the fusion of action and thriller that predominated in the two previous stages of the mutants, we have a new beginning that bets on psychological terror. A walk through the dark corners of the psyche. The five are in charge of a doctor who, in addition to the daily group sessions, monitors them day and night, in an obsessive exercise of auscultation, completely denying them any vestige of privacy. Located in the middle of nowhere and with an insurmountable energy field surrounding the facilities, they are totally isolated. They only have themselves. Marvel enthusiasts will be somewhat baffled by a new narrative treatment that bets on examining the deep fears of these new mutants, leaving behind the eye-catching of long action sequences and special effects, focusing on the psychological cages that keep them as social outcasts by not knowing how to handle with care their personality and the powers that they involuntarily possess. Personally, I like the 180 \u00b0 turn in the narrative nuances with a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the interaction of the mutants and leads you to sympathize with them because of the oppression they suffer. The characters, in general, are well chiseled leaving unknowns that, I suppose, will be cleared up in future installments. Now I understand why there were reshoots and several postponements of its premiere. Marvel being now owned by Disney, it is a film at times, too dark that bursts into narrative territories and tonal scales that Disney is not used to traveling."

My assumption was always that this movie was going to suck the way they kept pushing it back, but as it turns out it was not that bad.\n\nVery enjoyable if you are a fan of the comic as it attempts to be true to the source material rather than convey to the recent popularity of over the top superhero movies. I respect that because it gives the genre of comic book movies more diversity.\n\nThe tone of the film is like a horror movie. I remember getting the feel from the trailer and it stays true for the entire feature. I will say that the tone is darker than the comic. As if becoming a teenager is not hard enough with suddenly having powers you can't control, the movie decides to turn these mutants original origins into a much more grim situation. I did not think it was needed but it does not hurt the film.\n\nI though all the actors were excellent in their parts, they truly pulled from the comic book and as a fan I loved that. Even the fair skinned kid playing Sunspot (who was a dark skin Brazilian in the comic) was cast perfectly for his role as a rich snob with everything who can't control his body.\n\nIt's one of those teen movies that's dark and moody that works perfectly in the horror genre. That's something to remember because its nothing like it's X-Men counter part. Still, it's not a bad movie at all."

I especially liked that Magik was allowed to keep her magical abilities, even though the FOX X-Men universe never really had supernatural elements before. (However, they did have aliens out of nowhere in the last movie.) That said, if seeing these characters in live-action for the first time isn't a selling point for you this movie is definetly skippable. It's fine as a stand-alone mildy scary young-adult-novel-like flick to watch on when bored, but that's about it. No major flaws, but nothing impressive either."

Being a young actor with a different voice. Might wanna pass that one off on voice coaches though.\n\nMy last point isn't necessarily a failure. I know why its a slow burn and there's lot of character building. If it ends up being stretched into a sequel (at least) then it can definitely recover in exchange for an eventful story line. As is it's not exciting enough to be memorable.\n\nCool location, solid effects, good music, character profiles are great. I didn't have a problem with the teenage aspect. I believe more people need to look at this movie without expectations and it would be a better watch for them. Definitely not a \"regular Marvel movie\"."

The LGBT romance plot is well done, doesn't feel forced and doesn't contain many of the stereotypes we usually see in films. The few downsides were the terrible fluctuating accents and the bad acting in some scenes."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review By Kamal K\n\nThe story revolves around a group of mutant teens being sent to a special institute to help them manage their powers but instead of being supportive and learning to live with their condition like Xavier's School from the X-Men films, this institute is oppressive and they are trying to control their powers for their own sinister purposes... Which never get explained. It's the series first foray into the horror genre and it gives it a decent go but I didn't find it scary at all if I'm honest. The characters are interesting but none seem that fleshed out so I struggled to have a connection with any of them. When the teens start to use their powers they certainly look cool, particularly Magik with her soul sword and teleportation abilities, but they just didn't use them often enough for me. It seemed these kids preferred to run away rather than fight when clearly they were stronger than the nightmare smiley face monster things. I was a bit disappointed in the character of Rahne Sinclair to, she was essentially a werewolf but the special effects to bring her to life didn't do it for me it just seemed a bit basic and simple. The Demon Bear at the end of the film was some very nice CGI work though and the fight between it and Magik was my favourite scene in the film.\n\nFinal Verdict: It plays out like a teen horror flick but it's not really that scary and it leaves some plot points unanswered. When the characters use their powers they certainly look cool and overall it's not without some charm but ultimately it falls flat."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never read the New Mutant comics or knew anything about the characters. Just read some of the reviews so I was not expecting much from this movie. However, it seemed to interest me enough to go check it out. The beginning leaves you open to interpretation as the opening sequence of events has you wondering what the heck is going on, and who is this girl, Dani(Blu Hunt). She ends up waking up handcuffed to her bed in some sort of medical facility. Freaking out, she is visited by the Doctor on staff, played OK by Alice Braga. Soon she meets the others who are detained at the hospital, which looks like a mental institution straight out of the 1970's. The cast of characters playing the other New Mutants are good to very good, especially Rahne(Maise Williams) and Illyana Rasputin(Anya Taylor-Joy). The Kentucky guy, Sam, played by Charlie Heaton is pretty good also. So maybe the first half of the movie is all of the characters interacting and developing relationships together, good and bad. I was OK with the character development, it was pleasantly interesting. They eventually find some common ground that they're all being held against their will, and not entirely sure what the hell for.. The situation escalates from there and proceeds to get more intense. A few things I thought were cool was the psychic monitoring and the psychological manifestations becoming physical, which I suppose is where the horror aspect of the movie would play in. But other than that, not too much horror, but a little bit of deep supernatural stuff going on. Not really too deep though, as I would tend to find this movie geared for more of a 12-16 years of age audience. But, I did find it entertaining, slightly above average, despite a few flaws with some predictable and bland dialogue, but the strength of 3 or 4 of the characters helped it along. So not knowing anything about the New Mutants, I thought it was pretty good.. maybe you just need to approach it with little to no expectations.."

I guess it also depends on how old you are. The Demon Bear got cool design and that's it.\n\nThe cast brings nothing special to the table, except Anya Taylor-Joy's Magik character, which stands out in front of the others.\n\nThere are some great scenes, but in the end the movie is kinda forgettable. This movie was supposed to come out 3 years ago, a time in which many movies came out and people slowly lost interest.\n\nIf you are a comicbook fan, watch it and support the work of the people who worked on it, they deserve it.

Not only because it was never truly marketed as an X-Men movie, but also because \"The New Mutants\" comics were not so much about action, either (although had way more of that, that the movie). Or at least the comics that I read more than a decade ago.\n\nThe comics were about self-dsicovery, in a sense, and the movie is kind of about that, too. Personally, I would say that it stays true to the source in that regard. Obviously original were not \"horror\" or even \"thriller\" for the most part, but I think there were \"horror-like\" titles in X-Men franchise, too, so that's fine.\n\nThe main problem of this movie is that it does not really commit to psychological part of either \"self-discovery\" or \"horror\" (although this one could be a body horror, too). Because of that it does not really deliver on both. Perhaps if it was a TV show and worked with the sense of danger similar to how \"The Magicians\" 1st season did, it could have worked better. As is, though... It's not necessarily a bad watch, it's not exactly memorable either.\n\nWhat I can saw with confidence, though, is that if Disney (or Sony or whomever holds the rights now) does not bring Anya Taylor-Joy as Illyana Rasputin into MCU - it will be just plain stupidity. Magik is a great character with lots of crazy stuff going on with her, and Anya is just the best casting one could have done for her. Since Disney has been gunning for girl power lately, she could be the best candidate to help them do something really proper, while bringing X-Men as well (through the nature of Limbo)."

What a way to end 20th Century (now minus the \"Fox\")'s X-Men series, with a dead-on-arrival spin-off after a remake that's somehow worse than what was formerly many people's most disliked X-Men film, \"The Last Stand\" (2006). Anyways, this one is Freddy Krueger as some young-adult variation on the X-Men series. PG-13 horror meets PG-13 comic-book CGI. Josh Boone, also of the putrid young adult fiction \"The Fault in Our Stars\" (2014) was the director here, but I can't really blame him for this one given that these franchise installments are so much by committee, and this one in particular, reportedly, went through a troublesome production and post-production, including as it was delayed for Disney, almost the last studio I'd want to manage a horror movie, to purchase Fox.\n\nThe scenario of putting a bunch of twenty-somethings who can't control their superpowers into an asylum where they're attacked by their nightmares may be more promising than the result. It surely would've been better had someone made it so that it were frightening in the least, or at least made the characters interesting enough for one to care what happens to them, or one could just start slashing blood and guts and showing nudity in the shower and pool scenes to make this into trash that's at least a little bit fun. And, if it can't do that, I'd hardly expect any intelligent exploration or blending of fantasy and reality or the reflexive relation of cinema to dreams. They even have surveillance cameras to do something with the latter--I mean, \"Glass\" (2019) managed to make an intriguing meta construction out of a similar set-up. Oh well, time to incorporate the mutants into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I suppose."

No. It has its moments of the expected superhero team-up cliches, unnecessary teen drama, and the occasional clunky editing, but what it lacks for in technical prowess, it makes up for in pure energy. This is a film that reaches out from the screen and grabs it audience, pulling you into a world that is familiar, but also, pardon the term, new.

        "review_detailed_main": "New Mutants is the film God forbade. Its theatrical release postponed again and again since 2017, the latest instance having to do with the Coronavirus outbreak, New Mutants seems almost as cursed as Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, albeit with the worst stuff seemingly taking place after its completion - or \"initial\" completion.\n\nYet again, I can't very well tell you where in the X-Men semi-canon this film fits. I'm going to assume it takes place after Logan and thus in the Altered Timeline, even if this weakens the perfect closure that Logan was. I don't think it takes place in the past, i.e. In the X-Men Apocalypse era, but it does follow up on that film's post-credit stinger, which teased the experiments of the grim mutant Mister Sinister. Much like Logan, however, The New Mutants ultimately neglects the final major X-Men villain to not have been in the movies (apparently reshoots are to blame for this, and the delayed release, which is never a good sign).\n\nI know these things don't matter, especially not with The New Mutants, the first film in the X-Men franchise to fall under \"horror\". Ergo, much like the tongue-in-cheek Deadpool, it doesn't necessarily need to fit; 'tis of a different genre altogether. But again, reshoots and various extra delays were unkind to this one and I'd have just shelved it if I were Josh Boone.\n\nThe movie stars Blu Hunt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, and Harry Zaga as a group of angsty tween mutants who believe they've been assembled to join the X-Men, but soon learn something sinister (tee-hee) about their caretaker (Alica Braga). These superpowered kids are fairly diverse, but indecisive on which accents to use. We also get some goofy-looking additional creatures and a cameo from Marylin Manson, just so you know this is edgier than usual.\n\nOne must wonder, were there still devotees who sincerely looked forward to this mess? I know DC fanboys will stop at nothing to convince themselves even the most fundamentally inept piece of cinema is superior to Avengers: Endgame, and I do recall people who insisted that Dark Phoenix, despite how obvious its sloppiness was even at a glance, was the adults' option to the Avengers finale last spring (maybe throw in an embarrassingly blatant Christian symbol and I'll be convinced of its depth).\n\nAs for New Mutants, however, things seemed pretty clear from the get-go. This was pretty dang bad, and although we shouldn't treat the Rotten Tomatoes number like the final word, audiences as well as critics seemed to loathe this movie.\n\n\"It doesn't really work as an angsty romance, misses the mark as a horror movie and never for a minute feels like a superhero flick\", said one Rotten Tomatoes blurb. \"It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where Josh Boone goes wrong, because there are just so many options to choose from\", reads another.\n\nThis isn't much but it's what you'll have to go on right now. As it turns out, several publications have apparently \"refused\" to review this film, due to Disney's inability to realize the benefits of streaming over theatre-going, especially during a global pandemic that makes critics' screenings (or any sort of screening) a really bad idea. I suppose we shouldn't worry too much about what critics and audiences have to say about this particular movie. Let the fact that fate itself hates this film be enough."

The characters go through their own challenges, face their own demons which keep haunting them and learn to rise above. Amazing visuals, feels like Stranger things meets Defence of the ancients. While it doesn't not have a lot of strong moments, it creates a lot of space and lays the foundation of a link in the mutant story line. Definitely a must, for all mutant enthusiasts out there, but a usual weekend watch for the rest of the crowd."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was on my watch list for a long time. When I finally had a chance to see it, I was concerned about the low rating (5.3 from 24,223) and the many negative reviews.\n\nThis is far from a great film but it also isn't atrocious. My rating is a 7; here's why:\n\nThe entire cast is comprised of just 6 actors. Only 6. The setting is a single enclosed building. I have just described a low-budget set up. I shouldn't have but this is what this film clearly is for some odd reason.\n\nThe budget (according to online sources) was between 67 to 80 million dollars. Where did the money go? Clearly it wasn't spent on hiring more cast, improving the script, managing the interactions of the characters better, location shooting or anything else that defines a big-ticket blockbuster.\n\nI love the 'X' franchise. It is far and away my favorite superhero film franchise. It's got a \"bite\" and realism that other franchises lack. I'm very angry that someone (or a few someones) abused this franchise to the tune of 70-80 million dollars. They got the money and then skimped on everything, it seems.\n\nIt's hard to make an epic film when the setting is a single building and the cast totals just 6. I can only review what I see in front of me - not my expectations of what I think it should be. I can only review and rate this film based on the fact that only a small portion of the budget was actually used for the film in any real sense.\n\nAs a low-budget 'X' entry: this film truly delivers. Great acting, fantastic special effects, and above average story. As a low-budget film there are some obvious holes: like Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) working 7 days/week, 24 hours/day to oversee 5 mutant teens in a huge building (when a few more nefarious super-powered staff would have delivered a much better story).\n\nEven as a low-budget film, the film's main failure was the unlikability of two of the teens. Rasputin (played excellently by Anya Taylor-Joy) and da Costa (very convincingly by Henry Zaga) were so unlikable (for most of the film) that they infected the entire mood of the film. Likable characters like Moonstar, Guthrie and Sinclair (and even Dr. Reyes) were unable to truly deliver on their traits because of how the two teens were written.\n\nA couple more nefarious staff to aid Dr. Reyes would have made these two teens seem less obnoxious. It may have forced a tweak of the existing plot to make the group more cohesive earlier rather than the final waning minutes of the film.\n\nI cannot, in good conscience, rate this as I would an expensive blockbuster. The money wasn't there. We'll never know where it went. I can only rate this as a low-budget entry into the 'X' franchise. As such, it's a 7 low-budget effort."

However, when it comes down to it, the movie was just boring and clich\u00e9. Most of the characters were forgettable besides their horribly inconsistent accents, which becomes almost hard not to laugh at. There were too many dumb moments that constantly took me out of the movie, which especially sucks when it had an extremely generic and predictable plot.

The girl who played Dani was mediocre, Charlie Heaton's accent was forced to say the least, and Anya-Taylor Joy's accent veered from Russian-ish to South American/Hispanic. The makeup and visual effects were on a Halloween store and PlayStation 3 level, leaving a lot to be desired. I found it hard to be captivated at times because of how jarring some of it looked.

I would give this a lower rating if it wasn't for the strong performance of these young actors. However, the script, setting, plot, and story are all just cut from a well-worn raggedy cloth.\n\nBased on the preview we already know that nightmares are coming to life. The first time we see their hospital campus we already know it is sinister - there is an angel of death out front just in case you didn't get the right feel from the dark hallways and cell-like dorm rooms and locks everywhere. Also she's handcuffed to the bed from the start. So what do we need to wait (a short) 90 minutes for? For a team of misfits to put their differences aside and the new girl can put on her big boy pants and overcome her (Spoilers)? The whole premise is like someone took a 4 year old's childrens book about dog training and tried to turn it into a horror story, throw in some same sex attraction for good measure, and try to appeal to the college crowd; but forgot to upgrade the story development and climatic ending. There is no way to sugar coat it - the ending is just laughable and downright stupid.\n\nSo the story is not great. The setting of the hospital is suitably eerie, though predictable. Also they never leave the campus, so there is no change of scenery other than going to the different rooms - the attic, or swim house, or chapel, or solitary confinement, etc. They venture outside a few times, but can't get far.\n\nThe script is pretty predictable and the characters fall into cliches.\n\nThe music is done well and fits the scenes and mood and does not distract.\n\nIn the end the only redeeming quality is the acting of the characters, though they have little script to work with and a tight setting and a predicable story arc after a million superhero movies out there (there is nothing new here). Even the coming of age and together as a team falls flat. But yet I believed in their characters. I didn't see them as actors delivering lines. They really came to life and pulled you into the setting, the challenges they faced, their history and past, their weaknesses and strengths. They made you forget about all the downsides of the movie and pulled you right in. You feel the characters are real, believable, and alive. There are even some quite authentic sounding accents going on that stay fairly consistent.\n\nSo if you are a fan of some of these actors - I would go to see them perform and cheer them on. If you want to know what the movie is about, just watch the trailer and you've seen all you need to know."

All the leads are very good, young actors who are already carving out careers.\n\nThe characters don't always match the originals, Dani lacks the leadership qualities, Berto, the humour, Sam is a bit all over the place and Illyana, actually she's the right amount of nuts! Rahne is pretty spot on but the writers have introduced a new character trait to both her and Dani which I personally didn't think as necessary, if they wanted that trait, they should've used Karma or Rictor instead.\n\nThe film tries to be a horror and apart from the rejects from the episode 'Hush' of Buffy, it's not a horror, but it could be a good action film, if the story actually brought in any action apart from the last 20 minutes or so. It falls down by spending too much time faffing about and not enough doing what The New Mutants do best and that is working together.\n\nIt's not as bad as you might have heard but can be considered the X-Men's poorer cousin, which is a shame as the comics have tried their hardest to get away from that moniker."

In fact, I found a new favorite Marvel character (you'll know her when you see her).

I don't feel like there was anything that was noticeably removed that would help make parts of the movie make sense outside of a little more backstory for the New Mutants. They did get a little explanation of backstory but I feel like I needed just a little more.\n\nThe showcase of their individual powers was done well given these are New Mutants who are still learning how to use their powers properly. A little awkward at times and confused was the reaction to their powers.\n\nThe demon bear we saw in the trailers was really well done. A strange foe to tackle for mutants getting a grip of their powers but still done in a fashion to make it believable that they were going with whatever happened and making the best of it.\n\nOf course, you had the predictability in some scenes. The teenage romance/drama was there but outside of a scene or two I don't feel like it was \"in your face\" as much as it was natural progression.\n\nAs a standalone movie outside of the X-Men films and MCU, it was a decent movie.

The major name/character drops & teases were awesome and I'm sad they won't get to further explore those!\n\nThe actors did great with their accents & portrayals of the new mutants! Braga played Dr. Reyes in a way that made you question whether her every motive but also wonder if she was good or not. Zaga, Peters, Taylor-Joy, & Heaton were great in their scenes, Hunt as Danielle wasn't the greatest actor at times, but definitely fit the role in my eyes.\n\nConsidering the direction the series was going to go, they did good with it. You could tell a few things were shoe-horned in for the sake of this being the only film to be completed. The New Mutants story was on the shorter side, but also felt satisfactory considering they wanted to tell an effective storyline that wouldn't also bring in the other major players in the X-Men.\n\nThey definitely could have pushed the thriller/dark aspect of the film much more. Considering it was marketed as that, it didn't really have much eerie-feel. But still, a unique and different comic book film.\n\nDespite some opinions, the cast was picked very well & the movie is worth seeing for those who are big x-men/marvel/superhero Fans!"

It was held up for reshoots and re editing which implies that there were problems with the movie.\n\nIt was 20th Century Fox that revitalised Marvel characters with the first X Men film. It mixed action featuring characters with mutant powers and grounded them with real life events.\n\nIt began with a young Erik Lensherr being taken to a concentration camp as he is separated from his parents he makes the metal gates bend.\n\nThe New Mutants is a quasi spin off from The X Men. It is The Breakfast Club with tenagers with mutant powers locked up in a shadowy hospital run by a mutant Dr Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga) who takes orders from someone unseen.\n\nThe new girl is Dani Moonstar who arrives after a supernatural storm that wipes out her family on their reservation. She wakes up handcuffed to her bed. However Dr Reyes has no idea what Dani's particular powers are as Dani is also unaware of them.\n\nDani is introduced to four other young teenagers. Sam Guthrie, Illyana Rasputin, Bobby da Costa and Rahne Sinclair. All have suffered a past trauma relating to the manifestations of their mutant powers.\n\nIllyana seems to have the strongest powers and the most abrasive relationship with Dani. Whereas Rahne and Dani are the ones that bond easily.\n\nLike Fox's reboot of The Fantastic Four film in 2015. This was a misguidedly drab film which is low on action and humour. It wants to ramp up some horror, the realisation of the Smiley Men comes across like an episode of Steven Moffat era Doctor Who.\n\nIt is the Young Adult version of a Superhero movie with sullen teenagers and only perks up when some action sequences arrive at the climax."

They kept us guessing what the powers of there Mutants were for a long time; almost to the end of the film! This is an interesting approach, and for me, it worked wonderfully. Their powers were leaked just enough to keep us interested and and suspenseful and wanting to see more!\n\nWe also get to see the non-mutant side of each character. This is refreshing. Their personalities were NOT dominated by their mutant powers. This is a very interesting approach!\n\nThe acting was well done by all. This is decidedly a \"just go see it\" film! Do not believe the negative reviews!!!!! Just get some popcorn and enjoy the movie."

Then it just progressed into pure teen agnst nonsense & terrible CGI & effects. Ended with a lackluster & totally anticlimactic ending. Good God. This was JUST AWFUL. Maybe it it was the Online Streaming super hero shoes like Titans or Umrella Academy or Runaways that made me expect more from this but this was bar none the worst super hero movie or series Ive ever seen.

I don't think it's the garbage that all these other reviews have said about the film. Could it have been better? Sure. With it originally being promoted as a horror movie I wish it was a bit scarier. It's still a dark and gritty, yet fun teen movie though. Effects were kinda shotty in certain scenes but the acting for the most part was on point throughout the movie.

The 39 metacritic score for this movie is waaaaaaay too harsh..\n\nLet's be honest, The New Mutants (TNM) lacks on a few fronts; the story brings nothing special or at least interesting to further expand or reflect on, the characters motivations and backstories are lacking or rushed, the acting and lines are often cringeworthy and last but not least; where's the horror? Just to name a few things that could made me understand the 39 metascore, BUT.\n\nTNM still somehow achieves to be a very entertaining movie! It's very cool to finally see a marvel movie trying to touch ground with the horror genre (even though it's not scary or gory at all). And the comic character 'Magik' is an amazing addition to the story (she could easily function in a standalone movie). There are some surprises here and there and the cgi is pretty good too.\n\nThe movie had a constant flow between the positive and negative things mentioned above. Therefore resulted in me giving this movie a 6. Don't expect a classical X-men like movie; just go in open minded and you'll have a great time!"

One assumes it is Dr. Moira MacTaggert who is doing the tests but that is shown to be false. Finally when the New Mutants finds out the truth they take matters in their own hands.\n\nBesides having Magik as an original member I have an issue with Roberto da Costa a.k.a \"Sunspot\". The character is supposed to be biracial. Why take this away from a character. I have the same issue casting Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie or Idris Elba as Heimdall. These are of Norwegian origin. I would feel the same way if they would casts Iron Fist's girlfriend Mist Knight as a California Blonde.\n\nAs for the New Mutants can't wait for the sequel."

The horror elements, such as the eerie setting and psychological terror, create a distinct atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the film struggles to balance its horror and superhero elements. The pacing is uneven, and the plot twists feel predictable. The characters' backstories are hinted at but never fully explored, leaving the audience yearning for deeper connections.\n\nThe performances by the young cast are commendable, with Maisie Williams as Wolfsbane standing out. The visual effects, particularly those involving Magik's powers, are impressive.\n\nUltimately, *The New Mutants* is a missed opportunity to create a truly groundbreaking superhero film. While it has its moments of brilliance, the film's inconsistencies and underdeveloped characters prevent it from reaching its full potential."

A thriller? A comic book film? A teen drama? I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThe film definitely had potential, especially with how the trailers set it up. But unfortunately it was undone by poor decisions and the acquisition that took place between Disney and 20th Century Fox. And with the announcement that there wouldn't be any sequels, which could have improved what this film did, I think it's fair to say that this film was a waste of time and money, and could very well be the last we see of the X-Men franchise, which is very sad.\n\nIn my opinion, watch the trailers instead.

So I was expecting the movie for a long time.\n\nLet's say it could have been far better. And yet far worse. The biggest problem to me is the lack of supporting characters, even,say, guards and nurses in the facility who would have helped giving it a more realistic view. The place feels hollow, and that makes it all looks cheap. And as written by someone else, this movie needs a rock n' roll soundtrack. Using a \"legend\" for children (heard so many times) in the beginning makes it sounds cheesy, and the horror vibe felt in the trailer never really happens.\n\nYet... The characters are promising. If only they're given the opportunity to be seen again. Illyana/Magik is the most interesting as already noted. Roberto/Sunspot is a funny and friendly one, and Sam/Cannonball gives the right human touch. Rahne/Wolfsbane can be improved, as she's originally much more incapacitated by her religious bigotry. Danielle/Moonstar, well... She lacks substance. If only there was a sequel to perfect those points, and give the New Mutants a real chance... the potential is there, the characters created by Chris Claremont have a lot to give to the movies. Last but not least, even with all its imperfections, I still had a good time."

More in this extended universe, more about these characters and more about their powers.

At times the script falls flat, the 2nd act drags on almost to the point of being boring and the screen just goes black in the middle of a scene obviously to cut a possible plot point due to the unlikely possibility of a sequel. Which was a huge shame.\n\nBut overlooking the films short comings, the final act does come together in a way that I believe does tie a bow in the film and personally, I would love to see more come from this.\n\nI know it's unlikely but I would really love to see more from this film in an extended universe film series of go the way of the MCU and give it an MCU TV series.\n\nIt is easy to see that there is so much potential with its characters and story and you can see the film wants to be something more.\n\nI would say it's the perfect example of company executives thinking they know what their fans want. Sadly we've seen the same from none other than 'Justice League'. Which also went through expensive reshoots and cuts when Zach Snyder left the scene and Joss Weadon joined.\n\nAll in all though, as I said before, I can see the film wants to be more and I want more!"

The film was planned to be part of a trilogy as well.\n\nThe film follows Danielle who ends up in this mental hospital. She doesn't remember how she got their and the doctor says that you are here to protect you from yourself. She and a couple of other mutants are in this facility. One good thing here unlike most horror films is that the characters are interesting. Their backstories aren't the most unique but still intriguing The movie does start off pretty slow but once the second half the movie starts it gets pretty interesting. The acting here is really good. The sequences of the horror are handled well. Fox actually wanted a young adult film and Josh boom wanted a horror movie.\n\nThis movie gets a 8 out of ten.

        "review_title": "Provides an adequate amount of entertainment for anyone longing for that last taste of X-Men related fun",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The New Mutants\" is a spin-off superhero film based on the Marvel Comics group of the same name. Directed by Josh Boone (The Fault In Our Stars) and starring Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Charlie Heaton, it provides an adequate amount of entertainment for anyone longing for that last taste of X-Men related fun before they are fully integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nAfter losing her father and home due to a tornado, young Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) wakes up to find herself in a mysterious hospital run by the equally enigmatic Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga). Confused by her new environment, Dani is informed by Dr. Reyes that she is a mutant and that her powers need to be studied and controlled before she is allowed to leave. Dani is soon introduced to four other young patients who also have mutant powers; Rahne (Maisie Williams), a Scottish girl with the ability to transform into a wolf, Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Russian girl with witch-like powers, Bobby (Henry Zaga), a Brazilian boy who can harness solar energy, and Sam (Charlie Heaton), a Southern US boy who can fly at super fast speeds. Each of them struggle to control their mutant powers and deal with the trauma of their past, eventually bonding together to conspire a way to escape the hospital.\n\nThe X-Men series of films have had a spotty history when it comes to quality, ranging from a clever and ambitious way to fix previous mistakes (X-Men: Days Of Future Past) to a boring and underwhelming conclusion to certain character arcs (X-Men: Dark Phoenix). In spite of its status as a spin-off, \"The New Mutants\" does feel like it is part of this universe, as the audience is reminded of it quite often. While I don't believe it is anywhere near as bad as Dark Phoenix, it still doesn't leave much of an impression to elevate it above being simply \"okay\". The whole story felt as though it was on autopilot, weaving through the typical cliched tragic backstories of its main characters all while offering little to no surprises along the way. As things like this have all been done before in older entries, it just comes across as a lazy retread of something that we've all seen several times before. With that said, I did feel that the film's saving grace is the acting of its main stars, who despite the mediocre lines they had to read, managed to keep it watchable during most of its weakest moments.\n\nDirector Josh Boone, who also co-wrote the film's script, does a reasonable enough job keeping things going at a decent pace, dedicating most time to developing the characters and providing explanations as to why they are in this hospital to begin with. There are some nice interactions between these youths and it definitely felt believable that they could all become friends, in that they are united due to their mutant abilities and mutual PTSD. Unfortunately, Boone does struggle to properly build tension and implement action into the story. Scenes that were clearly intended to be frightening didn't feel as impactful as they should have been, sometimes bordering on laughable, and the action scenes were overloaded with CGI, to the point where they hardly looked natural. That's not to say previous X-Men films didn't have their fair share of superfluous CGI or scenes that failed to illicit the appropriate emotions, but they at least had a kind of balance between that and the character traits whereas this film does not. This bothered me as it felt like a missed opportunity to do something creative with the ways in which the mutants showcase their powers at the most important times instead of just being saved for the climax of the film.\n\nEach of the five main actors gave solid performances, with Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams being the standouts as Dani and Rahne, respectively. I enjoyed their interactions and friendly bond that the two of them had with each other and it was nice to see them work together whenever they needed to. Anya Taylor-Joy was also fun to watch as Illyana, even if her Russian accent was slightly inconsistent at times. However, the two male actors, Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga, didn't receive the screen time that they deserved. Aside from some scenes involving their tragic pasts, they felt somewhat shafted aside to make room for the other three mutants' backstories, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have all five of them with an evenly distributed amount of importance in the story, and this could have made for a more exciting conclusion.\n\nIn the end, even though it could have been a whole lot worse considering the frequent release delays and production troubles it has experienced, \"The New Mutants\" should still provide some fleeting enjoyment to hardcore fans of the X-Men series before new circumstances come into play. It neither takes away anything major from the lore it has created over the years but it doesn't add anything hugely important to the series canon either. At this point, one can only wonder what direction the franchise will go in as a result of the Disney-Fox merger. All of the potential is definitely there, so let's cross our fingers and hope for the best.\n\nI rate it 6/10"

I won't say I thoroughly enjoyed it or anything, as I do recall some moments I was cringing, but overall I enjoyed the premise, and the characters were interesting, and it was sort of a welcome deviation from the old \"bad guy attacks and heroes throw flashy powers at him and dazzle the audience\" formula. This was more of a psychological drama kind of take on the classic New Mutants, which special attention to the treatment of the main female protagonist, the indigenous girl (honestly, I think the other characters are Sunspot and Cannonball, and I think the cute blond is supposed to be Witchblade, although that was a newer hero I wasn't familiar with in the old New Mutants days, and there was the werewolf girl I don't recall the name of, I want to say Feral, but dunno). It's honestly a bit like a psychological horror film in a way, where things are not as they appear, and people are feeding off each other's fears, etc. I feel it stood its ground, and this coming from a person who absolutely loathed Spider-Man No Way Home and the lame excuse it was to put together all the Spider-Man actors, so I don't go liking just any superhero movie just because it exists. I felt New Mutants was more or less on par with the Black Widow movie, which I also felt was nothing spectacular, but was an entertaining enough story. In my opinion worth a watch."

Is it the best X-men movie? No. Is it the worse. Hell no? The horror elements could have been more in my opinion but I knew they had been cut down during the long long production/post production process. But I liked what they had in there. I thought the actors did a good job and the accents weren't nearly as bad as some had said. For the most part they pulled it off. So in closing, if you like the characters and you like X-men movies you will like this movie. If you want something different in your super hero movies, you will like this move. If you are expected Avengers End Game level work/production then you are crazy and delusional. Anyways enjoy."

I just honestly think this movie would've been a good filler and building movie after Days of Future Past. Magik absolutely 100% takes over the show,her story is intriguing,her powers are awesome, and the acting is great. The only character I thought should've been replaced was Moonstar..I just found her to be very boring and to have sub par acting. The rest of the cast was amazing and I thought meshed well together. I also found the forced love story was kind of unneeded but it is what it is. A rated R rating more focused on magik and the horror element they were looking for would've been groundbreaking."

Only six people in a institution? That is definitely a hint that this movie will be unsatisfying when we all know it's from Marvel. The story is overly easy and lacks any respect for the Marvel fans.\n\nSecond of all, this movie concept is for horror movie instead of for superhero, which makes it so weird to watch and cringeworthy. I wouldn't tell you why, but I can tell you that the similar element is also in \"The nightmare on elm street\".\n\nLastly, the CGI is the worst.

I spent the entire movie trying to figure out who I was supposed to like or root for. I don't know why this hospital exists, why the characters are in it or, and this is important, why there was only one \"doctor\". The movie ended like it began. There was a group of teens that I had no knowledge of or feelings for. Things happened to them, it ended and I feel nothing. I'm not excited for a sequel. It won't matter if the characters make an appearance in the MCU. Not to put to fine a point on it but I'll rewatch Green Lantern before I bother with this show again and it irritates me. Like like Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy, it would have been something to see them decked out in hero attire. I don't know who these writers are. I hope they never work again."

Now the accent from the actress that plays her is not so great, neither is smug look she tried to wear constantly. Sam's accent isn't that great either, but you can't help but like him a bit.\n\nIt's not Avengers, it's not xmen, it's more of a teens end up in this place because their powers are dangerous and things may not be what they seem with the \"doctor\" and the company behind her. Let any expectations go, it's not a horror movie, it's not a scary movie, but as my 10 year old said \"that movie makes me anxious\", but it is still a mutant, coming of age, superhero genre film. It's not the best, but it's worth a watch in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had heard of The New Mutants a lot, and seeing how awesome it looked I thought I should really give it a try. On top of that it was even going to be a horror movie so a superhero-horror could be a fantastic combination (Unbreakable Trilogy, Brightburn - it always works for me). And now that I have just seen it, I feel betrayed to levels I cannot even comprehend. The above average rating that I'm giving this movie is only for the awesome visual effects. The CGI is very well done and the colour grading is on point. But that's pretty much it.\n\nThe New Mutants is not even one and a half hours long. Normally I would have complained about it since I hate it when movies charge five hundred rupees and don't entertain us for even two hours, but since it was released digitally in the middle of a pandemic I will allow it, since it means I get more time to watch something else. However, this movie even lacks a plot. Not a cohesive plot or a good plot, but a plot itself. The only thing we get in the runtime is the exposition, kissing scenes, teenagers partying and occasionally back stories. In most of the scenes I would start laughing because of how badly the scenes were done.\n\nThe acting is done very badly, especially by Dani, which is ironic considering she's the main character. Her only personality is that she is a Native American. Her backstory concerns that, her being bullied concerns that, her character development concerns that, and heck, the opening and closing speeches also concern that! The score is also very, very bad. There are so many 'scary' scenes in this movie which could have legit scared me if the background music and camera angles were better. And this movie had so many subplots which were never talked about. I guess there was supposed to be a sequel to this where this would have been talked about more, too bad.\n\nIf you just remove the VFX this movie would become the worst in the X-Men franchise. One thing I really like about X-Men movies is that it can never be completely bad. I'd put this movie above at least Dark Phoenix and The Last Stand because of how good it looks. I read some reviews here and found out this movie had a lot of studio meddling, so I'd give it a benefit of doubt. Probably it could have been something better, but we will never know."

        "review_title": "Despite the Delays and Issues with Development, This is a Decent Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "This was a movie that I remember something close to 2 years ago seeing the trailer for it and was interested in seeing it. Growing up I was into comics and I knew this fell into the X-Men line. I didn't know much about it, aside from the fact that this was going to be a superhero film that bleeds over into the horror genre. I've finally seen it now as a 2020 horror film when I had a free afternoon when it was out. The synopsis is five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.\n\nWe start this film with Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) being woke up by her father, played by Adam Beach. They flee out into the night as it is snowing, but we see fire raining down on them. He tells her to hide in a tree as he has to go back to help the others. She then sees him flung by something, dead. She runs into the night.\n\nDani then wakes up in a hospital bed. In the vents she sees a face that disappears. She finds she is handcuffed to it and pulls her bed to the window. She doesn't understand where she is and then pulls her bed to the door. It is locked and she pounds on it. The voice of Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) tells her to calm down and she will come explain what has happened.\n\nIt appears that the event she saw was from an F-5 tornado. She is the only survivor of her tribe. She was saved and it appears she is a mutant. Dr. Reyes asks if she knows what that means and Dani seems to. The X-Men and their adversaries seem to be common knowledge. This teen is here as it is a hospital to figure out what her power is and once she is ready, she can leave to go to a school to develop and hone that ability. That is if she wants to.\n\nDani then gets introduces to the others that are here. There is Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) who seems to be from Scotland. She has the ability to change into a wolf and goes by the codename Wolvesbane. There is Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is from Russia and has a hand puppet that is a dragon. From what we will learn, she's the most powerful one here, but also has the most deep-seeded issues. There is Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton) who can discharge energy to fly and he's from the southern United States. Then finally there is Roberto da Costa (Henry Zaga). He is a rich teen from Brazil that won't reveal to the others what his power is. It seemed to have led to a traumatic event that landed him here, partially at his parent's wishes.\n\nNone of this group really wants to share anything. Illyana immediately is mean to Dani while Rahne takes a liking to her. She tries to show her that things here aren't that bad. That is until something happens in the night, while they sleep. They start have to face their past demons that might be a bit too real. Dani needs to figure out what her power is before it is too late. Dr. Reyes might not be who she says she is and might not be working for who these teens think either.\n\nNow to delve a bit more into what I stated earlier, I was really into comics back when I was a kid. Marvel was more of my jam and I really liked Spider-man. That's not to say that I didn't have a few here and there of the X-Men, Venom, The Fantastic Four and others to just name some of them. I bring this up as I recognize some of the more important ones and few of the lesser ones. The New Mutants did not fall into my realm of knowledge.\n\nWhen I heard they were going to combine this with a horror film, I was really intrigued as I've been a fan of this genre since I was child as well. I tried to temper my expectations as this really had some development issues. It appears that they were going to allow the co-writer/director Josh Boone to make the film he wanted with more horror elements. It appears he may have made it and then the studio decided to change things. They then decided that wasn't going to work after some sales when through and it just kept getting its release date and then moved.\n\nThe reason I bring this up was that this movie doesn't feel like it knows exactly what it wants to do. It feels like a superhero movie with some horror elements, but it doesn't necessarily lean into either enough to really be good in my opinion. The movie is also a bit too predictable as well.\n\nThat's not to say that I didn't like some of what they were doing here. Dani tells a story from her people, as she is from the Cheyenne tribe of Native Americans, about there being a demon bear. Everyone has this with them as a child and if you let it feed on your fears, it will consume you. From this moment, I knew that her mutant power is to show people their fears. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler, but we learn this like 15 minutes in if you're paying attention. I did like seeing what each of these people's fears are as some of them are quite dark to be honest. I really wish they could have made their movie as this would have been better to be honest.\n\nSince they don't really go far enough, the movie as I said is just predictable and it made it boring as well. They also introduce the idea of this Essex Corporation. From trivia I read, this was planned to be a trilogy that would give us more about this group and their leader. This is like dark X-Men and the movies would get progressively darker. I'm not sure what they'll do now though since I have a feeling this isn't going to do as well.\n\nThat's not to say that the acting is bad in this movie though, as I believe it to be the strongest part. Williams is solid here and I'm impressed she could hold her accent as well as she did. I like the development we get of her character and the tragic back-story she has. It deals with her religion and the darker aspects of it as she is branded a witch. Taylor-Joy is really good as well. She is harboring probably the darkest secret of all. She acts out and it is really hard to blame her the more that we learn. Her power is the strongest and it makes sense with what she endured. Heaton is solid along with Zaga and Braga. Hunt is good as well. For her being our lead, I really feel like she takes a bit of a backseat which is odd. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed in their minor roles.\n\nThe last thing to go over would be probably one of things most people worry about, the special effects. This movie doesn't lean as heavy into the CGI as I was expecting it to. What we got was good. From Rahne being part wolf, which I'm assuming is part practical and part CGI was fine. Illyana's was probably the most difficult and I thought it was solid. Sam and Roberto's didn't bother me. The big bad at the end really impressed me too. The only other thing would be that of the Smiling Man (Dustin Ceithamer). I'd be willing to watch a movie about Illyana dealing with that for how dark I think that story would be. The movie was shot fine aside from that, I had no issues.\n\nNow with that said, it is a shame that this movie couldn't be made how Boone wanted it as I feel what we got falls short. There are some really good ideas here that don't get fleshed out enough so the movie feels like a superhero movie that doesn't know if it wants to be that or a horror movie. The acting though is really good across the board as were the effects. It does end up being boring for the reasons that I stated above though unfortunately. I just wanted more as I feel if we got it, there other two planned films might have happened. I would rate this as just over average in my opinion."

This could have been great too but... it just wasn't meant to be.\n\nThe script was bad. It tried to do too much and be too many things. The pacing and the tone were also problematic. I appreciate the effort and vision of trying to make a hybrid film, but ultimately the superhero tropes conflicted with the horror tropes, and they diminished rather than enhanced one another. It's a shame.\n\nThe acting is top notch. The special effects were okay. It's def worth seeing if you're already a fan. Otherwise, skip it."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you read New Mutants you may have expectations that are not met here. But in the end forging strong relationships out of trauma is the essence of what the original story and this film are about. Young actors often lack the skill to carry off the challenge of translating emotions into performance. That's true here to some extent, but I believe the main fault with this film lies elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest failure of the film is in the production design of molly Hughes. She needed to better understand the visual style of New Mutants that made it a success, in particular the genius of Bill Sienkiewicz. While McLeod was the original artist, his drawing was workmanlike with a solid but nondescript superhero style and he quit the title soon after launch. It was Sienkiewicz who brought the magazine to life, drove home the substance of Claremont's writing, and made it more than an also-ran mutant spinoff. Had Hughs, or more likely a different designer entirely, aimed for the bleachers with Sienkiewicz-inspired visuals instead of playing it safe with a moody haunted house theme, then the whole film would have been elevated to the level we now expect from Marvel. Sadly that was not the case."

When it finally came out, the movie received a lot better review than I had anticipated and that was good. So, I would eventually watch the movie back in 2020 and I loved it.\n\nPositives for The New Mutants (2020): As a fan of the X-Men films and horror films in general, this movie was a fun time to watch. I appreciated that this movie was an homage to A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). I enjoyed all of the main characters. Anya Taylor-Joy as Illyana Rasputin/Magik was easily the best part of this movie. The action sequences are all awesome.\n\nMixed for The New Mutants (2020): It sucks that we'll never get to see these versions of these characters again after Disney bought Fox.\n\nOverall, The New Mutants (2020) was one of the best movie that I watched in 2020 and one of the entries in the X-Men Franchise."

But the overall acting was a bit disappointing. The accents... oh the accents.\n\nWith the literal amount of years it took this movie to come out, and how lack luster it turned out to be, it's probably best that Disney takes hold of the X-Men reigns.

I tell you their names in comics cuz it otherwise isn't revealed in the story\n\nAdmittedly idk much about this series. Which imo gives it a clean slate to wow since I have no expectations. But boy did these ninjas disappoint. The movie could be best described as a psychological thriller version of Twilight meets every CW show ever. Who makes a superhero movie w/o a tangible villain. Hopefully this can be the start of something but I can't say this is a franchise I'd care to invest much else in. This might've been better as a TV show or even a stageplay.\n\nIf filming/production occurred in the midst of the Rona Outbreak I might be a lil more leniant of the final product but this was a film that added lil to no value to the franchise; it's on par w/ the last F4 movie\n\nWAKANDA FOREVER RIP Chadwick Boseman"

Considering the fact that this film was supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy, the director did a really good job with fixing up all the loose ends so it wouldn't end off as such. There was good character development, good action sequences, with comedy bits and touching moments so overall good film. I also liked how they made references to the Fox X-Men Universe, which to me, is important in a film series. However, I do wish it had more jump scares and creepy moments which is why I deducted a point. Who knows? Maybe they had to cut lots of it out due to it being given a PG 13 film rating. Either way, if you're a fan of the Fox universe of X-Men, I'd recommend this film!"

It's difficult to do in a 2 hour film with many new characters. A single character like Deadpool gives you the time you need to tell the story, unlike Suicide Squad, where there were too many heroes and not nearly enough story.\n\nThe New Mutants were supposed just to be a introduction to the characters for us so the story wouldn't be lost or ruined.

With this film being in development for quite some time now, and rededits lasting nearly 3 years, it is hard to believe this film even came out, let alone is in any way coherent. And yet, I am here today, having seen the film, and having quite liked it. Like I said before it has its flaws, small inconsistencies towards the beginning of the film make for some minor mishaps in the whole scheme of things. There is also a bit of a tonal problem throughout parts of this film, and it's ending can feel a bit underwhelming. On the positive side of things, all actors really give it their best effort while making this film. Every performance seems authentic and everyone is entertaining to watch on screen. I appreciate the time the writers took for this film to delve into the characters, as well as the look and idea of this film. It lacks potential in spots, but for the most part, it is a rather exciting and interesting endeavour that I wouldn't' mind catching again sometime. The feel of the film, with its setting and plot ideals, gives me much of a similar feel held by the 80's horror flick- A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Warriors. However, the result doesn't seem as flimsy in its execution, nor as thin, and I found myself surprised at how appreciative I felt for this film when I left the theater. I expected it to be much worse than it was, but honestly speaking, it has much to offer for the franchise, and more Marvel has ever been willing to dare to go within the lengths of characters and situations that have unfolded- especially with Disney's prized Cinematic Universe. I won't spoil the lengths it goes to, but I enjoyed the things they did, represented, and callbacks to previous X-men flicks. In the end, New Mutants was a solid good time, and if you have the chance, a good film to go back to the theater to. My Rating: 9/10"
