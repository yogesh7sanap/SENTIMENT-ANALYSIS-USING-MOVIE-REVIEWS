        "review_detailed_main": "The 'Predator' film series is a mixed bag, with the best being the 1987 film (a great film on its own) and its follow-up, the only great ones from personal opinion. Was actually really intrigued into seeing 'The Predator', despite hearing numerous bad things about it, and saw it anyway with an open mind. Just to make that clear in answer to the condescending accusations made by those defending the film without taking into account that those who didn't did see the film and simply didn't like it legitimately.\n\nCan totally see why many were disappointed and share a lot of the criticisms directed against it. Didn't think it was that bad and it had its moments and decent assets, a 1-star film 'The Predator' isn't. Although towards the weaker end ranking films from 2018 seen, it is not one of the worst, being better than 'The First Purge' and 'Slender Man'. It's not a good film, hugely disappointing in fact, and has a lot of issues. As a Predator film 'The Predator' is a disgrace, but as a standalone film judged on its own terms it also doesn't work.\n\nBefore getting on to the faults, 'The Predator' has good points. It looks good, very slick and atmospheric with some of the effects being great and imposing.\n\nAt times, the action is fun and edge of your seat, contributing to the occasional glimpses of tension and excitement lacking elsewhere, with cohesive choreography and spectacular stunts. The film also begins promisingly, zippy in pace and quite thrilling.\n\nWhen it comes to the predator, it is scary and imposing enough, as are the other creatures and their methods, and the gore does disturb and doesn't feel too gratuitous.\n\nHowever, Shane Black's direction is constantly wayward and fails to generate much momentum, personality or clarity of storytelling. The character chemistry is not very natural and excepting perhaps Jacob Tremblay the acting doesn't seem very engaged or at ease. The characters are sketchy in development, are very difficult to get behind and their credibility is zero. There is effort to develop them, but through very clumsily written, superficially soap-operatic and blatant exposition that doesn't always feel necessary, adding nothing to the story or characters and failing to intrigue.\n\nOn top of that, the story, as well as being slight and at times sluggish, is far too complicated and busy which makes some of the film very hard to follow and at worst incoherent. There is lots of chaos and noise on the surface but no brains or soul underneath, while there is very little tension, suspense or surprises, relying on the action to make the film watchable which it marginally does. The atmosphere generally is bland and doesn't evoke enough scares, not enough to bite the nails anyhow. Nothing memorable about the music and the basic concept doesn't feel that much evolved, having not enough freshness, and it is too forgetful of what made the franchise at its best so great and too cheesy and bland to be a tribute or throwback.\n\nIt is the script that comes off the worst and nearly single-handedly brings 'The Predator' down, bad enough to warrant its own paragraph. It is far too talky in the exposition, it rambles often pointlessly and sometimes with not much cohesion, plausibility is as non-existent as the credibility, there is excessive sentimentality in spots and muddled moments and worst of all the over-reliance of humour. Next to none of the humour works which is a massive problem, it is eye-rollingly cheesy and not placed or timed very well too often, also being repetitive and distastefully vulgar.\n\nOverall, not awful but mediocre. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

Unless someone wanted to try and challenge the original in terms of plot, there's not many options that works, this kinda did work.\n\nIf you ignore the more crazy fans that like to bash on anything that's not on par with their own opinions, you'll enjoy this film.\n\nPeople don't seem to understand that rating 5 out of 10 is \"watchable but not for me.\" ratings. Yet there's individuals out there that give perfectly alright movies 2 and 3 stars just because they can't give objective opinions even if their lives depended on it.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThe movie was a excellent action movie, a great sci fi movie and a questionable Predator movie. So how should we base the rating then?\n\n7/10 action movie. 7/10 sci fi movie. 5/10 Predator movie.\n\nFinal verdict = 6/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Predator, wall to wall hatred and mockery. It was even suggested that it was one of the worst movies of 2018 and comparable with the messy AVP movies. Going in I was forced to have low expectations, and I firmly disagree.\n\nLet's make something clear, I am not saying The Predator is a good film because it simply isn't but worst of 2018? Absolutely not. It's just a badly flawed addition to the franchise yet manages to be oddly loyal at the same time.\n\nSo a Predator comes to Earth but this time the government is ready for it. Cue lots of action, blood shed but a pretty wafer thin plot that doesn't exactly go anywhere.\n\nWith a stellar cast including Thomas Jane, the stunning Olivia Munn and the excellent Keegan-Michael Key it had no problems on that front. Okay actually I retract that, the leading man Boyd Holbrook is less than impressive and just wasn't up to the task.\n\nWith an odd amount of comedy and levity The Predators tone isn't exactly in keeping with the original movies yet manages to solidly feel like a Predator film thanks to the original score and franchise tropes. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was passable and hated the third but this right here is underwhelming yet perfectly watchable despite the lashings of Hollywoodness it has.\n\nSure it's goofy and badly flawed but I'm not sure exactly what everyone expected. There are certainly a lot of problems with the film, I'd have liked it to be darker, I'd have liked it to be longer and I'd liked the original Predator to have gotten more screentime.\n\nRegardless despite it's many many problems it comes under the category of harmless take your brain out fun.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLoyal score\n\nSome great nods to previous movies\n\nQuite a few very funny moments\n\nDecent cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLacks elements that should be essential for a Predator movie\n\nNaff ending\n\nMuch of the cast feel wasted"

        "review_detailed_main": "So how many Predator sequels have there been? Not counting the \"vs.\" films, it's at least two, all of which have tried to re-work a very basic premise that worked cause it was basic.\n\nNow Shane Black, a screenwriter who has written some of the best action comedies ever, and Iron Man 3, tries to do the same in what amounts to a fun action flick, but a pretty average Predator one.\n\nThe plot all concerns a rogue predator who escapes his planet with a stolen object, which other predators on his planet want back. The planet where they all crash land of course is Earth.\n\nSterling K. Brown is a military official who will stop at nothing to acquire the technology first and Narco's Boydd Holbrooke is a decorated soldier who along with a team of misfits tries to stop him.\n\nThis is all taking place after the events of Predator 2. There is even a character played by Jake Busey who is playing the son of the Gary Busey character from that movie.\n\nBlack tries to swing for the fences in terms of a new story to tell but it's pretty obvious this movie works best when it's working on the hits. Sometimes you just wanna sit back and watch some gore.\n\nBodies gets severed, people get thrown across the room and clawed in the face, impaled, heads will roll.\n\nWhat highlights the fun here even more is Black is a funny director who knows a good laugh when he sees one.\n\nA scene with a severed arm, an ongoing dialogue about why we call the predator \"the predator\" in the first place. Just examples of how Black is very adept at visual comedy and snappy lines.\n\nHe's very good with characters too, not so much developing them here but giving them a chemistry that is irreverent lunacy.\n\nHolbrooke and his whole crew, particularly Keegan Michael Key, Thomas Jane, Moonlights Trevante Rhodes kinda reminded me of the A-Team. These guys are total section 8's and I loved each one.\n\nIn fact better than the A-Team movie. In fact, i'd like to see Black do an A-Team movie with this cast.\n\nBrown gets some of the best dialogue and Munn is actually quite good here too. Jacob Trembley and Alfie Allen are a bit wasted but the cast is having fun.\n\nThere's something off about this movie though and it involves the predators. This movie almost seems like a Sterling K. Brown vs. Holbrooke and his crew movie more than a predator film.\n\nThere's no real joy in the hunt cause for the most part they seem to just be making periodic appearances into the story of human vs. human.\n\nIn fact this movie actually had to reshoot it's entire third act because of poor test screenings and you can tell because the last act does pull a sharp detour, taking us into the woods for some incognito Predator action.\n\nIt almost seems like Black wanted to make this such a new concept that the very nature of why people like the predators in the first place sort of gets lost.\n\nI still contend this is a funny, action-packed flick and I liked the characters too. Even the predator action, when its on screen, is good. Just you may not get enough of them as you might want.\n\nIf you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more."

Revisited it recently.\n\nThis is the fourth in the Predator franchise and it has nothing to do with the previous Adrien Brody one.\n\nThis time a U.S. Army Ranger sniper disables a Predator and has parts of its armor sent off by mail to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life thereby putting his son's life in danger. The sniper is aided by a group of PTSD-afflicted soldiers and a scientist, who all team up to fight off Predators and discover their plans for mankind.\n\nThis one has lots of action n gory moments, some good character development without sacrificing the pace. It is no doubt an entertaining action flick but Predator movies shud have dark n serious tone. I liked the characters but their jokes were silly.\n\nLooking forward for the fifth one which is set during the Civil War. Hope for some good showdowns.\n\nCan someone tell me how Brackett manages to arrive at the crash site n that too so soon?\n\nCan someone tell me what happens to Lynch? The Predator severs his arm with his shoulder cannon. We don't see him get killed by the Predator, and it's interesting to note that the Predator was originally aiming at his head, then moved to sever his arm. If the Predator didn't kill him.....\n\nThe Predator's shoulder cannon is known to cauterize wounds?\n\nThe scene at Emily's house - the predator kills the agents but dont kno why it spares Emily. Some may say that Emily wasn't armed but so were the scientists. The main problem here is not the sparing of Emily. It is about the editing. The scene darted off to another one without any explanation."

There is some good ideas in there but nothing to redeem it. Why are studios so scared to just slow down and make a descent horror film.

The action, why everyone realistically went to the movie, was pretty good. I for one liked the concept and why does everyone say there's no story? The premise has more story than Predator 2 or Predators. What I didn't like, was some of the cgi and the enhancement of the predator(seen in the trailer - not a spoiler) everyone goes to see predator movies to see a big brooding badass kill people. It delivered in that aspect. The humor was funny and fit well considering the group of misfits. The end, I will admit, I didn't care for. Everyone hates on it, and I ignored it but honestly it wasn't great. It does present room to grow. Personally I think they should scale up the story line with not evolving, but a use of more predators. She can grow the story off of the actions of the first predator in the film which would work very well. Long story short, it is an action film you're expecting and if you've seen the trailer, you know what to expect. Just enjoy it. And they can never make one to live up to the hype of the very first film. The first film was stripped down to mercs fighting an alien. People loved it because it was new. So to make something new for fans, it has to evolve. It makes sense. Just watch the movie."

        "review_title": "The New Bottom",
        "review_detailed_main": "Like everybody else back in 1987, I was really impressed by Predator. It was pretty simple and straightforward movie, but it introduced a pretty neat and unique concept and, well, there was something special about the atmosphere. \"...the jungle... it just came alive and took him.\" It was awesome. Unfortunately, sequel suffered from some seriously poor writing, while Aliens versus Predator franchise turned out to be a complete disaster. Everybody knows that and everybody wanted Predator franchise to return to its former glory one day. That's why I had some hope for this one. I seriously did. That's why I bought a ticket and went to see it the day one. I really expected to see a good Predator movie. I mean, there was no way they'll make a bad movie after all those big expectations, right? RIGHT? Well... I was na\u00efve...\n\nLong story short, the new Predator is EXACTLY like AvP. Only worse. Wa-a-ay worse. 999x+ times worse. Remember the first AvP movie? Remember how at the beginning it at least tried to create some atmosphere, but ended up with that girl fighting together with Predator in a very silly way? In this movie it's that exact silly stuff from very beginning and until the very end. It's so silly that it doesn't even feel like a real deal. It feels like a cheap comedy. A parody. A B-movie with AAA budget. The movie tries really hard to be like Deadpool, but the problem is... it shouldn't be like that! I mean, come on! Predator was supposed to be a mix between horror and sci-fi. With deep atmosphere. With suspense and a man versus alien in a brutal battle. Add Deadpool-like jokes about genitals and BOOM! The entire thing is ruined. Just like that. The entire audience laughed through the entire movie, can't argue with that. People like Deadpool's jokes. Not me, but... you know... as long as audience love it... If all you want is some cheap laughs, this movie has them. A lot of them. It's literally MADE of them. The entire movie is, like, one... big... JOKE. My problem, though, is that nobody warned me about the fact that this movie is a parody. It was advertised as a real deal, a big comeback, which turned out to be a cheap parody. Why? I mean... WHY???\n\nAlso, unfortunately, jokes are not the only problem here. Even though 2/3 of the movie are just that - dirty jokes. The thing is - the entire writing is bad. The entire IDEA is bad. It feels a lot like E.T., only E.T. is Predator now and kid's father is Ash freakin' Williams.\n\nTalking About Evil Dead. Remember Army of Darkness? That's EXACTLY what this movie tries to achieve. And there are three problems with that. First: Boyd Holbrook is not Bruce Campbell. He doesn't have that thing that allowed Bruce to do his thing. He doesn't have that crazy spark in him. And as the result - his character feels absolutely, completely RIDICULOUS. Second: writers have no clue how to be crazy with style. Evil Dead franchise had that. This movie? Nope. It tries. Hard. Way too hard. But still... nope. And, finally, there was no reason to turn good ol' Predator into the Evil Dead. Evil Dead is good. Predator is good. Mix them together and here comes disaster.\n\nThe new Predator is something that may work for you at home, when you're way too drunk at your weekend to enjoy something real. When all you want is something on background with some cheap laughs, while you're eating your pizza and drinking your beer... this movie will do. Like any B-movie. Like Sharknado. But as a proper Predator movie... on big screen... for the full price... It's a disaster. Did I tell you that 3D also sucks and pretty much useless here? No? Well, it is. The new Predator is one of the very rare movies that totally made me regret paying for a ticket. Even as one time movie... it doesn't work. Back in the days, I believed that it's impossible to be worse than AvP. The new Predator proved me wrong. Ladies and gentlemen... here comes the very new bottom for the franchise.\n\nP.S. There's one good thing about all that, though. It makes Predator 2 to look like timeless masterpiece."

I went into this expecting little after reading the reviews where ppl hated it. Most of these people wanted a remake of the original. That is not what this movie is. This was a fun romp. Fred Dekker was involved in creating this (he brought us Monster Squad and Night Of The Creeps... which were both classic horror/comedies from the 80s) so the humor was no surprise. The gore/body count was ample too. The thing that made this even more enjoyable imo was the characters were great. I wanted them to survrive and felt the main characters were not just kill-fodder and the lead character dudna great job. Sure the cgi wasnt the best and the ending (the last 5 minutes after the movie is wrapped up) was pretty stupid but that didnt take away from what I felt was a fun time. If you want the original just keep watching that. I liked this and will watch again. You can do much worse with your time. Dont take everything so seriosuly. Its a movie about aliens!!!"

All the stuff involving the Predators is badass as expected, loads of blood and gore (seriously loads, it's insanely cool), awesome kills and wicked gadgets. The film is also one of the funniest I've seen this year, if you like Shane Black's writing you'll like it, the jokes (even the 'mum' ones) basically always land, there are witty and some not-for-the-easily-offended jokes constantly being chucked around which also basically all land. Even The Predator itself gets one of the biggest laughs. Also surprising amount of character development and backstory. The only main issue I have is the editing, it's obvious where they re-shot and cut around the film and the ending scenes feels very tacked on and some jokes are bit awkward and badly timed. Overall it's entertaining as hell and a throwback to old school action movies and defo worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having written and directed 1986 horror classic Night of the Creeps, Fred Dekker teamed up with Shane Black the following year to give us enjoyable kids monster movie The Monster Squad. Black would go on to write action classics Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, and The Long Kiss Goodnight. With these guys behind this reboot of the Predator franchise, I figured fans were in for a real treat.\n\nHow could I be so wrong? The Predator is an insult to the brilliant Arnie original and easily the worst film in the series so far (and quite possibly the worst mainstream movie I have seen this decade). The film starts off bad, and goes downhill from there.\n\nFashion model Boyd Holbrook is the star, playing decorated sniper Quinn McKenna, who witnesses the crash-landing of a predator spacecraft. The authorities hush up the incident, capturing McKenna and labelling him as mentally unstable. However, before he is apprehended, the soldier manages to send proof of the predator's existence - the alien's mask and gauntlet - to his autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay). As McKenna is shipped off to a secure facility in the company of several other 'crazies', the predator escapes from the lab where scientists have been studying it, and goes in search of its missing equipment...\n\nSo what's so bad about this film, I hear you ask? How long have you got?\n\nNot only do we get a pretty boy protagonist, there's the now obligatory feisty female (Olivia Munn as boffin Casey Brackett), that irritating kid (whose autism allows him to operate the alien tech), a comedy relief character with Tourettes (how funny!), and a CGI super predator with his digital space-dogs. Instead of testosterone fuelled action and tense sci-fi horror, the terrible script prefers to play the whole thing for laughs, but it simply isn't funny. Oh, and there's CGI blood. To be honest, it's hard to pick the worst thing about the film - there's simply so much to choose from - but the accidentally lobotomised predator dog that likes to play fetch has to be a contender, as well as the ridiculous scene that sees McKenna and friends standing on the hull of the predator ship as it tries to leave Earth.\n\nAbout the only positive to come out of this mess is that, when they make the next inevitable film (after a reasonable gap, so that people will forget how bad this was), the only way is up."

There was enough homage the the first and even second to make it feel like a sequel even after all these years. But other than the few references was entirely it's own movie.\n\nSure some of the CGI seemed a bit off at times but its certainly more ambitious than previous installments into the franchise. But for the times more practical special effects were used it nailed it. The fugitive predator especially.\n\nThe humors there but no worse than any marvel or transformers movie. It could have been dulled down to suit the tone of the movie but it doesn't ruin it and sometimes even gets a laugh. I'm happy it dosen't tone down the violence or the language but it seemed to throw the f bomb into ever sentence even it really didn't need it and come across forced.\n\nThis predator really isn't as bad as some of the stupid 1 star reviews make out. It's an action packed popcorn movie that's worth a watch. If you wanted a remake of the original your out of luck, but it's certainly taking a leap in the right direction and if they decided to make the planned sequels hopefully they come out more polished."

I assume that some will find some of the humor distasteful, maybe even offensive at times; however, most funny things are vulgar to someone.

Mix this with good to great performances and some wonky editing and pacing, and you get a perfectly serviceable late summer action film. I very much enjoy the Predator franchise, but I woudnt label myself a die-hard fan, but I did have a blast in the theatre. Constant one liners and gory violence moved things along at a \"usually\" good pace. The final 30 min are cleaely affected by the reshoots as they lack the previous two acts tight pacing and plot. Those looking for a deep, dark suspenseful horror/thriller should seek out the older Predator film or different films in general. I see many reviews or people going into this film expecting near Oscar notifications, DON'T. Go in with a free mind and enjoy the bloody violence."

I had low expectations after the trailers, but after watching the movie I was speachless of the idiotic characters, absurd dialogue and nonsensical script. Sorry for the overwhelming hate, I don't usually do this, but this is clearly not only the worst Predator movie (yes, it is worse even than AvP: Requem), but it is a bad sci-fi movie and it is comparable to ridiculous titles such as Sharknado or alike.

The theater was packed and for the most part the movie goers enjoyed the ride!

I didn't go in expecting it to live up to the original because I am pretty sure that will never be accomplished. What I did expect was to at least be entertained, which other than laughing at the atrocious dialogue, predictable actions, Star Wars ripoff film score, incredibly stupid Predator characters and overall terrible aspects of the film, it was very far from entertaining. It in fact was painful to watch. The editing in this movie is maybe the worst ever done. Scenes stretch for what feels like forever and they easily could have been cut. It is confusing to think that Shane Black co-wrote and directed this movie. It felt like a Sci-Fi Channel movie you watch to laugh at. I am still wrapping my head around how bad it was. I normally am not this negative when reviewing films I watch... but this one is definitely an exception. Viewer beware!"

It delivers what is expected in hefty doses, but it fails to become anything of greater substance. It's amusing and violent and funny, but it is also ultimately empty and forgettable.\n\nThere's a joke a minute, and at times the movie seems more concerned with one-liners than actually constructing a coherent story. To be fair, many of the jokes do land, but they do so in a way that meanders from what matters in each scene, so they end up serving as distractions. Much of the film consists of loud, violent (and a share of humorous) distractions that certainly entertain but don't do much else. And maybe that's all director Shane Black was looking to make-a fun, disposable movie that fans will forget shortly after leaving the theater.\n\nBlack clearly wasn't attempting to make something that he wanted to be taken seriously. It's too silly for that. There are mountains of both intentional and unintentional comedy littered throughout. At times, it's difficult to tell which is happening. The special effects are laughably bad in certain instances, but maybe that was a nod to the original? Again, it's difficult to tell.\n\nThere's also an outrageous claim about the next step of human evolution that is simply passed off as plausible even though it is the exact opposite of plausible.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the plot yet because it's hardly relevant. But here's the gist: a group of soldiers encounter a predator on Earth, and it kills everyone except the one truly excellent soldier, who subsequently steals the predator's gear. An accidental misuse of the gear signals another predator to come to Earth. So now we have two. And the second one is a BEAST. Predator 2.0. Then yada yada, the humans fight the predators and what not.\n\nThe plot doesn't matter much. This is about the spectacle. The spectacle puts on a decent show, but it's not nearly as impressive as it needs to be. So, ultimately, you'll walk away with an empty feeling, wishing this movie had tried to do more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay so I'm not the biggest Predatorfan. I have seen all the movies (apart from the AVP ones) and I can say that I really like the first one, the second is just meh I think and Predators is actually a solid entertaining movie that brought us something new. I wasn't excited for this movie, I knew it was coming and I was probably going to see it but was I waiting in full anticipation like a true fanboy? No. Then the movie came out and wow did it get bashed by audiences and critics all togheter. Everyone said it was a hugely dissapointing movie. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I do like that they referenced the first movies, they didn't pull an AVP alternate universe on us. The references are brief, making it clear that they really wanted to make a stand alone film, which I am all for. The characters are mostly good, I really like the protagonist as the big action hero and most of his teammates are a fun presence. They also made this movie rated R, now if there's something which I despise about current cinema, it's that everything has to be PG-13, all because of money. This movie actually has some guts and quite literally shows us them. There are some really entertaining deaths and it was just satisfying overall to see that they wanted to make it as violent as the first one, because let's be honest, we all went into this movie wanting to be entertaind.\n\nAlright now we are into the bad... Let's get the big one out of the way first: the comedy. Now I knew going into this movie that it was going to be a comedy, and knowing that I could deal with it, most of the jokes were actually pretty funny I thought, but by making this decision they really ruined all of their potential in making this a good Predator movie. Suspense? None of it. Atmosphere? None of it. Compelling characters who we care for? A couple yes but mostly they are all expendable. Let's talk about those other characters. There's a female scientist who has a huge role in this movie. Why? I don't know, she's just there be scientific and a \"cool female character\" I guess (this is not how you write good female action characters guys...), there's also a young boy who also has a big role...and he's pretty annoying. He's suposed to be this very intelligent boy who has no friends etc, you all know the clich\u00e9, so at least you could make him likeable? Nope, they didn't do that either. There are also evil human characters of course (because we really needed those), and they are there to be evil, yup that's pretty much it. When it comes to characters, it really all comes down to the protagonist and his teammates. The predators are cool yes, we have a couple of new designs now, and while I like that they keep on expanding the predators' possibilities, in the end they did nothing with it, you'll see. Last but not least, this movie ends...yup you guessed it, with a set-up for a sequel. Could someone please explain to me why every succesful movie has to be remade, rebooted and most of all, be turned into a franchise? It's all about money these days, and as a result the passion is gone, the feel is gone, the atmosphere is gone, everyone is just trying to make everything like the MCU and everyone is failing.\n\nGuys, in the end, this is a descent movie if you view it as an entertaining action comedy you can watch with some friends and have fun, but that's it. They just keep on remaking every great movie from pre 2000 and turning them into cash grabbing conveyor belt products.\n\nI give it a deserved 5.6/10"

This movie delivers on just that, and on what made the original fun and unique! Why is it not great? It rests its hat on a fairly simple plot, great action and a formulaic build up. The characters are formulaic, until we meet the Loonies, then we get this great rainbow of crazy and well, its fun!\n\nIf you like Aliens, Predator and what made 80's action movies iconic, then this is for you. The comedy had the theater bursting out multiple times, some people WILL find the jokes distasteful and politically incorrect but ask a comic if he's met anyone who found his jokes offensive? Better yet, ask The Predator's critics. That's usually the hallmark of a great joke, to reflect how insane we can be as a whole and turn it on its head, reflect it back to us, and ask us to laugh at the ridiculousness. So in that, The Predator, invites you, to get away from the seriously dire need for thought and existential questions and simply asks, will you laugh at the ridiculousness with us? Rated R for RIDICULOUSNESS."

It still managed to entertain me (most of the time)\n\nNow to be completely honest with y'all, I did go into the theater hoping to witness a great movie and i did come out kinda disappointed. But, despite that, as i previously said there were a lot of parts in the movie that did entertain me.\n\nSo overall I'm gonna be generous today and I'm gonna give it an 8/10"

It was more like a parody that a movie about the predator, scary movie does the predator kind of thing.

        "review_detailed_main": "The hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?\n\nPlot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.\n\nWe have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land.\n\nPlus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell. Shame. 3.5/10"

I hope it does well in the box office to get a sequel going.\n\nI'm mainly writing this review so that this title does not get flooded by all those 1s and 2s from people who loved the original and cursing this film to not follow the plot of the original and subsequent sequels. I only evaluate this film based on if it is enjoyable with good action sequence and likable characters.\n\nIt has a good amount of humor and some good action sequence. Yes I second that some of the combat scenes with the hunter Predator is unbelievable since the original film it took a team of highly trained elite force to take on the ordinary Predator. Yet that kind of ordinary Predator gets defeated by the hunter Predator like a 5 year old kid vs an adult.\n\nI think this film is worth going into the movie theater to watch.

However the combination of a great cast (Thomas Jane being brilliant as the Tourette's riddled vet), a surprisingly funny script thanks to Shane Black and the gore of the original really brings this one up there with the first film. Jacob Tremblay is also a stand out in the cast and actually brings a bit of emotion to the film, add on top of that characters that you actually don't want to die ( a rare thing in movies nowadays, especially horror) and you find yourself on the edge of your seat hoping that no one gets the chop. The film is not perfect however, one of my main criticisms of the film would be how rushed the final 20 minutes feel, and how certain characters seem to get killed off in a blink and you'll miss it scene, but end at the end of the day I really enjoyed this film and I hope Shane Black comes back to this series to carry on the Predator legacy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Predator franchise has seen a tumultous journey to Black's newest instalment, with the original retaining its reputation as the best. Besides this, only Robert Rodriguez's 'Predators' is considered to be of a similar quality. Wheres these films were originally considered action-horror films, Black's new interpretation, whilst vastly different, proves a worthy addition, and hopeful defibrillator, to this otherwise dead franchise. Many have commented on the shortcomings of 'The Predator', claiming its comedic tone to be a bastardisation of what the original stood for. Whilst this may be a valid comment for die-hard fans of the original, one must remember that this is a 2018 Predator film. Gone are the days of 80's machismo and campy over-the-top action. We live in a cinematic landscape where every other film is injected with off-the-cuff humour, whether it be appropriate or not, inspired by the success of the MCU. In this case, it works. The R-rating allows for savagely funny comedy, aided by the inclusion of Keegan Michale Key and Thomas Jane, to match the brutality of the on-screen violence, which lacks the unconventionality Black previously deployed in 'The Nice Guys' and 'Iron Man 3', but reverts to its roots with indulgent, crowd-pleasing gore. The characters retain the series trope of being overtly shallow, but plainly serve as reminders that this series has never accommodated depth, simply prey for its titular star, which shines here above all iterations since the original. The narrative is laid thin, once again a servant to the graphic panache of its main antagonist, with the ending proving an unusual and seemingly rushed conclusion. Furthermore, the score, heavily reminiscent of the originals, contributes a level of nostalgia, which, alongside the reinvigorated visuals and tone, cements this as a Predator film for modern audiences, taking the action-heavy, mindless focus of the original and thrusting it into the 21st century. 'The Predator' is a ridiculously enjoyable action film that proves a direct descendant of the original, borrowing its shallow characters and plot to highlight the grandeur of the creature that made the series such a pop-culture staple. Black understands the advantages and allure of the property, and unapologetically utilises them to create his modern Predator film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Predator: In a homage to the original the film opens with a Special Forces Sniper team in a Mexican jungle targeting drug cartel gangsters. Their mission is rudely interrupted by a crashing Predator Starship which has impacted with a satellite. The Predator kills two of the the team but Captain Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) acquires some of it's equipment and disables it. Then the Men In Black (MIB) appear (though their tactical uniforms are dark blue) and McKenna makes off, posting a Predator helmet and armlet to to a PO box. Back in the US attempts are made to portray Quinn as being insane and he is put in a bus with five other military personal suffering from PTSD.\n\nCasey Bracket (Olivia Munn) is a biologist who is called in to examine the captured Predator and Quinn's bus is diverted to a MIB base for interrogation. Meanwhile a large Predator Craft arrives and attacks the MIB base. In the confusion the Predator escapes. We see how ruthless the MIB are and Casey joins up with Quinn and the five loopers (self-described) to hunt down the Predator. Things are complicated as the helmet and armlet were delivered to Quinn's home and his Autistic hyper-intelligent son (Jacob Tremlay) has made them operational, they cam now be tracked by both aliens.\n\nWe get not just your usual Predator but also a eleven foot tall specimen who has the alien equivalent of bloodhounds. He is in competition with the other Predator to track down not just the helmet but other artifacts and a crashed Starship in Georgia. Plenty of humans are torn to pieces, decapitated and have their throats ripped out by the aliens. Quinn and his group also have to engage in savage battles with the MIB led by Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) who will kill anyone to keep the existence of Predators secret. Naturally they also want the artifacts.\n\nA tale of Alien hunters in conflict with each other counterposed by the two sets of humans in a four-way battle. A cross between Catch-22, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and the original two Predator films. Directed and co-written by Shane Black this is an effective Science Fiction/Horror film which continues the Predator legacy and is leavened by a dark vein of humour. 8/10."

It would have been good to see the non-hybrid Predator work alongside the humans & for it to have put up more of a fight against the mega predator.\n\nWhat's good... Although it could have been a lot better this film is still worth a watch. It had a well put together cast & had solid acting throughout. The action sequences were good and the mega Predator looked amazing. Some of the ideas behind it were quite original an added to the myth of the Predator.\n\nWhat's next... I hope they make more predator movies because lets face it the Predator character is ace. However the directors, producers & writers NEED to listen to the fans and not just inject their own ideas in to make movies. Just imagine what a Predator film would be like based upon what the fans actually wanted from the franchise!\n\nThanks for reading my review."

What a wonderful movie that came to save the day, and restore peace in the predator world! It was a debt owed to the predator fandom.\n\nAll the copies of The Predator should be hidden and destroyed, buried in the desert, deleted from every platform or database, and let's just forget this heresy ever took place.\n\nEven Alien vs Predator Requiem is better than this POS.\n\nIt seems the writers, producers and director hated the franchise so much that they wanted to denigrate it to a limit, and this movie was the result. Thankfully, it wasn't effective and it couldn't kill the franchises.\n\nI forgot what I was talking about. It must be a movie that never existed. So, back to Prey: have you noticed how wonderful it is that the gun she gets to her tribe at the end is the same the Predator hands to Danny Glover in Predator 2? Meaning (possibly) that more predators came and killed Naru's tribe and took the gun as a souvenir.\n\nThe dog is so cool, too."

McKenna, his son, and Traeger (played brilliantly by Sterling K Brown - deserved more screen time)\n\nOther than their little quips and oddly placed one liners, There was no connection there. Where as in the original and it's sequel the characters were memorable, as they all had their part to play in the story and when they did meet their end, I rooted for the hero even more.\n\nI generally think the final act suffered greatly from the re-shoots and script changes. It felt rushed, and went in a different direction than what had been setup in the beginning. A shame.\n\nGood action. Black's one liners are there too. Sadly let down by the muddled third act. 7/10"

From the opening scene into the first 5 mins, I knew the writing was sloppy and convoluted. Plot issues everywhere. And the lame humor... I'm a huge fan of Keegan-Michael Key, and maybe they cast him for the humor, but even he couldn't make the lame comedic writing funny, never mind the rest of the cast and their one liners. The score sounded like a 5th grade production. The directing and editing was sloppy, but what do you expect when one of the original Pred actors decides to write and direct. No wonder Arnold turned down the role unless the script was re-written. They should have chosen a different name for this film and changed up the alien costumes to have avoided the failure and embarrassment calling it The Predator and insulting the franchise. A very generous 6/10 out of sympathy for the all star cast wasting their talents due to a lousy director and writer(s)."

The predator gears are seriously much faster and lethal making them much more deadlier then their predecessors . One thing they should have explained more about is their home planet and their culture . Everybody wanted a predator backstory and more about their home planet YAUTJA PRIME. And why their is war inbetween different types of predators . The story line is good rather better but could have been a lot more . The humour is good but the portrayal of Turrets syndrome is rather cheap . The action , music and scariness is seriously good , but could have been more. I vocuh that one must should watch the movie at least once. I have been a great fan of the entire predator-alien-engineer universe. I want a sequel to come soon . Please a request to the writter and producers and directors."

However, The Predator is perhaps the biggest farce of a mainstream \"blockbuster\" this year. Not only does the outside of the film issues give the \"The Predator\" name an unsettlingly cringey vibe, but the film is just not good. It's just not good. The characters are written poorly and even at times borderline offensive, the plot hardly ever makes complete sense, and Black's direction is nothing more than sub-par. Why did I have to watch Sterling K. Brown chew gum in every scene, in every shot, and every single thing he said on camera? Or how about the fact that they introduced Olivia Munn's character to The Predator by saying \"would you like to meet a predator?\". After what happened, why in the world you keep that line in the film? I wasn't a fan of the original Predator, so I didn't have much expectations anyway, but I certainly didn't think it was going to be this bad.\n\n3.2/10"

AvP remember. Not what we hoped for as did the others that followed. Predators (2010) was okay but 8 years later we have this one.\n\nStarts off pretty good but once the soldier swallows a thing from the predator that makes him go invisible made me already think, OMG. And when a child comes in to solve the puzzles this quickly turns into some kind of Disney predator.\n\nWhat do makes it worth seeing are the battles against the creature. Messy and bloody and even gory, but again, sadly all CGI what turns it down again.\n\nPutting in a crazy bunch of soldiers with jokes and all turns it completely away from the horror Sci-Fy genre. With the child they are picking in on the succes of Stranger Things of course but some scene's are really unbelievable and even a bit over the top to make this a mediocre flick. Predators and spacedogs working together? Predator making human moves with his finger? I don't know. If you never have seen an entry in this franchise you can pick it up but like with so many franchises see th efirts one to understand what's it all about and what makes it great.\n\nGore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"

To wit - Predators are immediately shown on screen, fighting in space, before one crash lands on Earth - conveniently mere metres from a hostage/sniper operation. From there, a soldier investigates, and within moments has stolen some Predator tech and mailed it back home to his ex-wife and child in the suburbs.\n\nSound legit?\n\nAnd so begins this rollercoaster of implausible action, confusing scene cuts, internal leaps of logic, and witless coincidences that will only feel acceptable if you were a cast member of this film and stand to profit from it.\n\nDon't bother even trying to suspend your disbelief. Held beside earlier films, this is a film of leasts and mosts:\n\n\nAt one point, Olivia Munn's \"character\" is introduced by being taken by agents to a secure compound. Once there, her arrival coincidences precisely with the moment when decades of government research into Predators, descends into chaos. And in seconds, she tranforms from University Professor to gun-wielding commando.\n\nShane Black ought to be ashamed of this garbage. The film is packed with snappy lines, but how can an original cast member of Predator be so utterly clueless as to the structure and tension which made the original film a success? Or why it's enduring appeal still gave him the opportunity (30 years later) to make yet another sequel?\n\n\"The Predator\" is a Marvel-ized atrocity of a once-beloved sci-fi suspense franchise, edited by and for people with Attention Deficit Disorder. This is the final death-knell of this franchise for fans like me. A film so overblown and childish, I wouldn't even download it for free.\n\nNo matter what they release after this, I won't be watching. Well done everyone.\n\n1/10."

Now, I can only speak for myself so, if you read this then please take it at face value.\n\nThe script and editing, has problems. It really does, this is evident throughout. The best way to describe the problem is to say - if you look away from the screen for 3 seconds then you have no idea what's going on or who died (the who died then) is still reeling in my brain and I still have no idea. You'll seriously watch this not having a clue what's gone on, you'll just remember that something did happen and now something else is happening. However, there is a good movie in there, I imagine there is a 2 hour version of this where everything makes sense. And there is some great action! The deaths are the main attraction, you'll enjoy them.\n\nMy own personal gripe was Thomas Jane'seseses character being there for comedy value, personally I like the guy and think he was deserving of a more heroic role, but he made it work and was memorable so I can't complain too much.\n\nThe actual story is bland, not really much could have been done due to the franchise being as old as it is, so a lot of the writing came across very lazy and half hearted.\n\nThe humour - some was good, some felt forced, each to their own on that I guess.\n\nSpace dogs - I hate all space, vampire, monster, creature.. anything dog-like in a movie. It's very lazy and always feels generic.\n\nStory- LOL\n\nNostalgia- music, some scenes, ultimately -childhood ruined. But don't let that put you off.\n\nOn a serious note, it's 'OK'. It felt as though it could have been great with a little more TLC but it scraped by and I didn't hate it.\n\nPs: maybe you've read this, maybe you haven't. But I've typed out this review while sat in the toilet, doing a poo.\n\nI'm just saying..."

However this is a different type of movie and once I got my head round it I actually really enjoyed it, it's that bad it's good, sort of like a Deadpool Predator with loads of action an funny lines. I can see how it might annoy some hardcore SiFi nerds but they need to chill and watch this for what it is. My advice, go and see but get your head round this isn't a follow on from the originals and treat as a separate entity. Open mind is the key to enjoyment."

Tone deaf, brutally unfunny (the filmmakers think they are hilarious though) with a idiotic story and lazy uninspired call backs to the iconic original. No wonder Schwarzenegger stayed very far away from this train wreck. Watch the original classic masterpiece and just pretend they never made the others.

Yes, it had some questionable scenes, but never did I cringe over a character doing something stupid.

But this is not just about a father and his son, this obviously has a Predator in it. Now I understand that some still have the very first Predator in high regards (a very good movie) and liked the over the top sequel it spawned (even if the latter didn't make as much money in the box office). But this has merits of its own. For one it is made for adults and it has quite a lot quotable lines in there.\n\nGood acting overall and the action is more than decent too. You get a bit of a callback to the original with a posse of people trying to fend of the Predator. But they are more than unlikely \"heroes\". One may even call them bad apples/guys and would not be wrong to do so. If you can get over that and just enjoy it, you will be good. This is not a masterpiece, but it is a good action movie"

The government retrieves the Predator and calls in biologist Dr. Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn). The Predator escapes as Quinn, Casey, and a ragtag group of prisoners go into a pursuit. They are hounded by dark ops leader Will Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) who intends to retrieve the alien tech.\n\nWith the creepy best friend scandal aside, this is simply trying too hard. Shane Black is trying to be too wacky, too sly, and too complicated. A Predator movie needs not be that complicated. It's not so convoluted that it's not understandable. A little clean up can make this a sleeker action thriller. He fills the movie full of weirdos. Some of them are trying too hard to be weird which makes the comedy a little awkward and not that funny. As for the predator dogs, I want them to be more imaginative. It's basically a monster dog with predator hair. I also am uncertain about the denouement. I don't want to go back to the base. It's one of many pieces that remains uncertain for me."

        "review_title": "The Predator - Complaints and Grievances",
        "review_detailed_main": "So, this was a big moment for Predator to return on the big screen once again. Good old Predator! It was a simple and focused film back in 1987. But... how is this new version holding? Let's find out. First of all, I want to say - NO! This film is definitively not holding good. We have waited for almost 8 years for Predator to return to big screen, to return big and unforgettable. Alas, that wasn't the case. And honestly, I will not hate this film. You know why? Because, it is NOT WORTHY of my anger and my emotions. Not even close! Let's start from the beginning.\n\nSo, first off the bat - Shane Black. Now, Shane Black is not my cup of tea, but I appreciate some works that he did. I think he is a decent director, who can give us a well-directed comedy film. But, I think he is an even better writer. In my opinion, \"Lethal Weapon\" is the best action, buddy-cop movie out there. So, automatically, I put all of my trust in Black. Yes, some people use an argument that he worked on the first \"Predator\" film. But, only as a supporting actor. That does not make him qualified for the job. He co-wrote this film together with Fred Dekker. So, is the script good, since it was written by a two experienced veterans? Is the directing good, since it was directed by a pretty much seasoned veteran? Sadly - no. I'll try to keep myself calm and not break the keyboard under my fingers... This movie is so far away from previous \"Predator\" films. I understand that the change is good in movies and it is needed for originality, to attract future generations, etc. But, if the change is good and original and if executed well, then, we have no problem, whatsoever. However, in the case of this film... It's a mess. This movie is a complete and utter mess. The idea, story, characters, script, etc. Everything looks senseless. It looks like a movie doesn't know what to do with itself. Everything happens so quick and randomly. There are many cringing, uninteresting, non-funny and confusingly unexplained moments. It looks more like a science fiction / action / comedy. Far away from the tone of the previous movies. It is not tense or exciting. I understand that Shane Black, as he said in the interview, he wanted to expand Predator universe. An interesting idea. But, what is the idea?\n\nSo, the plot is next: A special forces sniper made an encounter with the Predator, and therefore he is captured and thrown into the bus full of crazy soldiers. He also has a son who has autism, and, get this - the, so called, super Predator wants him badly, because of his autism and because, according to this film's idea, autism is the next step of evolution. OK, how so? This is just ridiculous and does not have anything to do with the Predator universe! I just cannot carefully explain this story in detail. There are many things in this film that are done, there are many things in this film, that are said... And, they are just unredeemable. Characters bickering about the title's character name and definition. WHY is that important!? This super Predator... terribly done, by the way. The CGI is really ugly. Super Predator is basically nothing but that terrible idea - make it bigger, make it badder! And it is just horrible. This super Predator is neither interesting, appealing, nor fun. He is just big. The super Predator also have hunting dogs. The less I say about them the better. This movie has a terrible plot, or no plot at all.\n\nThe characters: unlikeable, not charismatic, irritating, dull and pointless. Our leading hero is portrayed by Boyd Holbrook. He is a decent actor, but here, he was just boring and not appealing at all. This guy does not have a star power. Jacob Tremblay is a great kid actor, I have seen him in \"The Room\" and I think that he does not deserve this kind of treatment. Olivia Munn was... well, I saw wooden boards and steel pipes performing better than her. She can be OK, but here... there was just nothing. We have some veteran actors like Thomas Jane and Jake Busey. OK, Jane is also a good actor and I think he was the best actor in the movie, but his character was nothing but a waste. I only gave one star because him and Keegan Michael-Key have some decent chemistry together. They really fed off each other nicely. And that is the only thing worthy in this film. Trevante Rhodes plays a potentially interesting character, but not that much. He has some charm and he is trying to work something with it, but the film just does not allow him to do so. The less I say about other actors and performances the better. These are the characters that you don't care about and you want them dead.\n\nSo, CGI, editing, musical score... nothing good, new, or special there. So let's get back to Shane Black. I really don't know what was he thinking about when he wrote the script. I am curious what was in his head while directing? Did he really wanted to make a film that is actually one big joke? And why using Predator in all that mess? This is a real travesty example of a film character that is really beloved by many fans. I am a fan of Predator, not the hardcore fan, but still a moderate fan. My obsessive passion is movies. And Predator started out as a movie. It was a respected and interesting character through the years. The first one is the best, second one is not the best, but still a decent sequel. AVP movies are bad, but better than this crap. At least they have some consistency and solid pace. Predators (2010), I think was a decent film, and I think that film expanded Predator universe more than 2018 film. I feel quite weird and ashamed for watching this film. To be aware that this film is the part of the franchise now. This is just another example of Hollywood today. No ideas, nothing new, and when they give us something new - the idea is terrible. This film will not last long and you can be sure of it. It will not be timeless and I can't believe what I am going to say... I feel sorry for today's generations. For giving them something like this. This horrid piece of puke. I hope that this film will not get a sequel and I hope that somebody else will take over and restart and rethink the idea. The audiences and fans do not deserve this film."

The humor to add isn't your typical humor, it seems to be more the style of black, war-related humor you'd find more in movies like Range 15, Jarhead. Or series like Generation Kill. It really isn't for everybody, which is a good definition of comedy in of itself.\n\nIf you've got nothing better to do, want to kick your feet up and sink into a movie without having to think about anything, you will enjoy this movie."

This movie is a Gorey action flick you think ? Well you thought wrong. This is a comedy like a straight up comedy with jokes which actually land at times. Now we've seen the predator in the jungle , we've seen it in the city and even seen it fight in pyramids so this time we see it in the suburbs( ik , wtf right ) . Unlike the other predator movies this one doesn't involve the predator taking out people strategically. You know how in fps games it's a stealth mission but that noob teammate of yours goes full assault that's pretty much what the predator does in this movie. The story is very linear and you don't really anticipate for anything. Now the editing in this movie is like so bad I wonder how it made it to a final cut . Like say a kid is walking to a table to get his toy , that scene has 5 cuts !!!. In the end it's a guy movie , if you're into Gore , guts and jokes then you won't mind this movie in fact you might enjoy it . Otherwise it's a should've been shelved script somehow turned into a movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Predator is a new film from the Predator film series. This film is directed and partly written by Shane Black, the director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys. In the film ex-military Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) discovers alien technology, through which he comes into contact with a secret research team who is familiar with this technology and would like to examine the technology he finds. Quinn only wants to cooperate when he gets more answers and is put on a bus with other former soldiers. The research team has called in the assistance of scientist Casey Brackey (Olivia Munn) in researching the Predator and its technology. When the Predator technology is activated, people end up in a conflict between two different Predators. Quiin and the other former soldiers must now, together with Casey, protect the inhabitants of the small town in the suburbs from the actions of the conflict between the two Predators and try not to fall prey to the Predators.\n\nShane Black, who also played a role in the first Predator film of 1987, puts this new Predator film in a modern look and adds some more humor. He has made an entertaining new Predator film, which sometimes can get used to for the fans of the original Predator film. They have also chosen to add a new kind of Predator in the film, which was also done in the Predators of 2010 film. All these new Predator types do not appeal as well to the fans as the originals do, but it is entertaining to see, but it is entertaining to see what these new Predators can do. This new kind of Predator only goes against the Predator idea. Predators are chasing their targets more unseen, while this larger type of Predator can be heard when it comes to its target. The effects have also been put in a modern way in the film. In the older Predator films there was really an actor in the Predator costume, which made the Predator credible. In this film, star-contact Brian A. Prince is really in the Predator costume of the normal Predator, but in the film they have added CGI effects, which makes realism less. The big super Predator in this film is fully placed with CGI in the film. This is done well and credibly, but sometimes you can see that it was done with CGI.\n\nThe acting is also well done by the entire cast. Because of the size of the cast not every character is worked out equally, but most of them have a nice action moment or funny comical moment in the film. The best comedy comes from Keegan-Michael Key and Thoms Jane, who like to play together with each other. Boyd HolBrook puts down good acting in the main role of the film, just like the young Jacob Tremblay, who plays his son in the film. Olivia Munn also makes strong acting as the only female characters between a group of male characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "The predator franchise has a very hit and miss history but for the most part they are at least enjoyable as some mindless action escapism, this movie however was painful to sit through, not only is it extremely self righteous and preachy, but the thing it preaches is objectively wrong and massively insulting. The gist of it is that autism= highly intelligent which in turn = the next step in evolution, which could not be further from the truth, autism is called a spectrum and classed as a disability for good reason, sure and there are high functioning individuals, but the condition itself is a defect that in the 100% of cases is a lifelong struggle and often times so debilitating that the person unfortunate enough to be inflicted with this incurable, untreatable condition will never experience things that \"normal\" people get to.\n\nAt best this movie is massively insulting to those of us with autism because it grossly misrepresents it as a positive thing and a form of evolution while glossing over the fact that even the most highly functioning people still struggle with aspects of the ailment.\n\nAt worst it is beyond tone deaf again by downplaying a literal disability so that some evidently out of touch writers and exec's can get on a soap box, use a subject they have less than 0 understanding of and pat themselves on the back for \"raising awareness\" or whatever they have convinced themselves they are doing.\n\nI am classed as \"high functioning\" I can live independently and take care of myself and my property, I have also spent a number of years as a \"mentor\" for people younger than myself who are having a hard time accepting their diagnosis, between my own time in groups and charities and my volunteer work I have encountered thousands of people with autism, I have seen every possible symptom associated with the condition and the numer of people who are capable of living fulfilling, independant,funcitonal lives that they are content with can be counted on 1 hand because having a small enough number of symptoms and having them to small enough severity for this to not be a struggle have lower odds of winning the lottery, one quick example is a man in his twenties who is obsessed with health and exercise, he has completed marathons, triathalons, iron man competitions, rock climbing, you name it he's done it and by all accounts when interacting with him he can pass for \"normal\", but he is so bad at basic human functioning ( cleaning, changing clothes, washing clothes, feeding himself etc) that when he tried to move out of his parents home and have his own space his health deteriorated to the point where he was hospitalized, of course that is not going to be the case for all of us, that is just an example to show how rare it is for this condition to be anything other than a handicap in your life, it is so rare that even people who are considered to be on the \"high functioning\" end of the spectrum are still afllicted to the point where they will need constant supervision for their entire time on this earth.\n\nI did not get diagnosed until I was a young adult, I went my whole school life being bullied because as far as people knew my awkward mannerisms, lack of eye contact and mumbling when trying to start a conversation weren't a sign of anything, I was just branded as \"weird\", the point of telling you this is that I spent 16 years in formal education being \"weird\", I grew up hearing every insult you can possibly imagine but even with that long history I can still say without a shadow of a doubt that sitting through this movie is the most insulted I have ever been, I genuinelly do not think it is possible to create something more tone deaf than this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Great sci-fi thrillers of the past used to go out of their way to capture an element realism. Those film-makers, the ones that were visionary sci-fi directors, were not hamstrung by the effects technology... they planned the shots and adapted according to what worked for the story and tone of the movie. It's well documented how in the original predator the Fx people sent down a red \"crab creature\" to the shoot location, and the filmmaker basically said, this is not going to work, and got someone else to design the rastafari Predator we know and love.\n\nIn the modern era, however, we have directors who are better at comic book story-boarding than they are at filmmaking (think about it... when you pitch your film with an entire story board vs. a mere text screenplay, how much less vision and trust is required from the producer to open up their wallet!) And the dialogue / writing ends up sounding like it was lifted off the pages of a comic book as well.\n\nI suggest watching \"The Abyss\" to see how story premise can be used to create tension. Even though that film flows into several sub-conflicts, there is constant demands put on the audience to anticipate what will happen next. What does the alien look like. Is it friendly or hostile. Who will survive.\n\nModern comic book style sci-fi films, none less than \"The Predator\", abandon that approach and instead try to entertain you with \"Deadpool\" like *shocker* dialogue, and as filler gouge out the audience's eyeballs to CGI effects that come so fast and frequent that suspension of the laws of physics becomes trope, as does the Sarah Conner gritty female who can fight better than the men. As others have mentioned, this film gives a female biology professor who goes from cowering in a heap to blasting away with an AR like she's John Rambo. OK PC Hollywood. But did you also have to go all \"Mercury Rising\" on us?\n\nAnd BTW, the IMDB \"filters\" prevent using the kind of language that you will find in this film, as well as the kind of review it truly deserves. I would say this movie is not just a \"pass\", but one of those movies where Predator fans should be writing angry letters to the studio. That's how bad it is. So why 3 stars and not 1? Because there are a few places where they were creative in tying back to the original film: namely \"Get to the Choppers\"... a ridiculous scene, but one that was actually funny in a creative way. But then again, I'm someone who likes this franchise so much I would rate AVP at about a 7/10 and AVP2 a 6. In many ways, this film has a lot in common with AVP2... even to the point of having a \"good\" predator have to take on a bigger, tougher \"hybrid\". The difference is that AVP2 made no bones about being a B-movie slasher film where everybody is going to die... kids, dogs, they don't care. \"The Predator\", on the other hand, film tries to resurrect an epic-premise, the alien hunter vs. the elite soldier, and falls all over it's face trying to do it."

Brown as a pretty nasty villain, and yes he works just fine, and the thing that i really like also was of course the bloody goryness that they are not shy to show, i'm pretty sure male audience especially teenagers will love to see many people got cut in half, and the special effects was pretty good, overall The Predator and basically this whole franchise are still not giving us the new completely original different direction since 1987, despite this movie particularly still have some things that works, and it's pretty disappointing knowing that the Alien franchise actually able to do it and it works for me personally, 31 years later same old cases."

The first one is my favorite movie of all time and I watch it atleast once a month.\n\nI'm reading a lot of negative reviews and, from appearances, it would seem these reviewers either wanted to watch the first one on the big screen or not watch a Predator movie at all.\n\nDoes the movie have flaws? Of course it does, but you're hard pressed to find a movie that doesn't, let alone the sixth time the titular alien hunter appeared in a theatrical release. Shane Black and Fred Dekker had master stroke world building that added without taking away from the monster mythology. They cleared up a plot hole from the second movie where the Predator has thermal vision without the mask, which has infuriated me for twenty years.\n\nThis movie is action packed. It comes in hot and it doesn't get boring. Director Shane Black brings his amazing writing and dialogue that made his earlier movies like Lethal Weapon a massive hit and is peppered with comedic bits as well as interesting characters mixed with quirky. The story isn't a rehash, so it builds and expands upon what we've already seen and remains relevant without neutering the creature. It has exciting visuals, well paced, and feels like a Predator movie.\n\nFor the flaws, the main team of protagonists are over the top when they are introduced but balance out as the film goes on, the ending feels a bit rushed but has a really good payoff, and it falls into trope territory with the \"gifted\" child and a scene involving a translator. Also it's probably not the most delicate representation of combat related PTSD.\n\nAll in all, if you came to watch a Predator movie, you will be entertained. If you came to see a best picture nominee you will be disappointed. If want it to be just like the first movie, watch the first movie. If you are a fan of the franchise and want to explore more of the Canon, then this is for you."

Still the Director defends the iconic scenes of Predator which are sadistic, full of blood, mutilation scene, or unpredictable gruesome. This kind of movie that is for 17+ Rating in my country. The action, devices, and technology are better than before because here we can see other purpose of Predator to use high tech and why they have been called Predator. Do not forget the ending scene that could make you wonder of what happens in the movie still in the movie, then you will pray that Sci Fi movie is not for real. Because if that so, just run for your life. Besides, this movie has such level of humorous that could make you sometimes smiles because basic idea of this movie is the fighting between the angry alien, imperfect soldier, and his child who has autism. Their main roles is to prove which one has the right to rule the world and to defend the life. I believe there would be Predator 2. Come on, fighting still goes on and Doomsday is still mystery."

        "review_detailed_main": "The original \"Predator\" film is one of my all-time favorite action films. John McTiernan's direction is excellent in depicting the geography of the amazing action on screen and generating suspense and thrills accordingly. The testosterone-filled crew of soldiers led by Dutch (a prime Arnold Schwarznegger) is absolutely legendary among action films. The jungle setting gives the film a special atmosphere, which again would not have been the same without McTiernan's abilities as a director. The one-liners are genuinely delightful.\n\nAfter quite many sequels, reboots and spin-offs, all of which, in my view, were highly forgettable and pretty mediocre, 20th Century Fox hired Shane Black to direct \"The Predator\", an astoundingly ridiculous sequel that tries really hard to implement many of the elements that made the very first film so enjoyable, but that fails so miserably that it feels disgraceful in a franchise that already included plenty of terrible sequels. \"The Predator\" is a complete mess in so many departments, I don't even know where to start. And this has nothing to do with my love for the original film: with all objectivity kept, every aspect of \"The Predator\" is a failure.\n\nShane Black's direction is the complete opposite of McTiernan's: You can barely understand what's going on throughout this endless string of poorly filmed, chaotic action scenes that are completely devoid of structure and continuity. At the root of this widespread mess is a scenario of staggering stupidity, probably one of the worst scripts that I can remember in recent years, even by B movie standards. The dialogue is laughable, the characters are beyond archetypical and bland (I can't remember one of their names, even the protagonist's), and the generalized silliness of the story extends beyond that of any of this derailed franchise's outings and spin-offs. Take a second, and let this sink in: the crew of soldiers manages to \"train\" one of the Predator's pets (those ridiculous dog-like creatures that were introduced in \"Predators\") at some point. Oh boy.\n\nThe cast features some of the least charismatic actors I've seen in a major production in years, especially the protagonist, an incredibly far cry from Major Dutch in the original film. It was quite heart-breaking to see Thomas Jane impersonate a totally anonymous, poorly-written character in this wreck of a film. As the interchangeable members of this crew of soldiers get impaled, beheaded or cut in half, you'll most likely remain totally indifferent. Again, that's if the messy direction even allows you to notice who's getting killed.\n\nFinally, the quality of the special effects aligns perfectly with the overall production: they're mediocre to a point where you'll wonder whether this really is a major studio production. All the creatures (especially the \"giant\" predator), the spaceship and the gore all looked cartoonish, and the overall cinematography feels like a joke of very poor taste.\n\nNeedless to say, \"The Predator\" is an abysmal mess from start to finish, in every department without exception. Do yourself a favor and revisit the original film instead of wasting your time with this cinematic garbage."

I would have also of liked to see more of a concentration on the use of predator technology which I think they tried to do in this film but missed the mark a bit and perhaps seeing the predator being more tactical.\n\nI would happily watch a continuation of this film or perhaps (in light of all other predator films) another predator story by the same writed and director"

It is an action movie, about a killer predator from outer space. And for what it is, it does an awesome job. I highly recommend for any action/sci-fi/predator fans. Shane Black did a solid job on this film. 8.25/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Shane Black is known for some great scripts but this one may be his poorest, either that or he hired the worse editor in motion pictures. The plot and story are a jumbled mess that begs for more questions asked than answers them. Plot holes are so huge and obvious you wonder if you have fallen asleep many times throughout the film. Where do the heroes get an RV? How did they get a cache of weapons? Or the news helicopter? How is it that a biologist has the skills of a mercenary? Normally I would include some sort of outline of the film's plot that I review but it is truly so messy, I can't describe it. Character backstories are non-existent and some character's disappear altogether for a good amount of screen time only to reappear without an explanation. Whether this is the fault of a poor script or a bad editor, the story is one of the hardest to follow in years. The one good point is, like many of his scripts Black provides some humor as well as some fun nods to the previous films, but it isn't enough to cover for its obvious shortcomings. The film's ending obviously sets up a future sequel, but like the rest of the film it is so out of place and chaotic you really don't care. Shane Black has the ability to make a much better film than this and why he didn't is the true questions to ask. Not even fans of the franchise will get excited for this film and it is truly one that should be avoided. Except for a few laughs and actions scenes this movie offers nothing but a waste of time. It might not even be worth a rental a few months from now."

        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up a huge fan of the Alien and Predator franchises. The original Predator is a straight classic and I was a little worried this addition was going to take Predator into similar territory as Alien: Covenant. I am happy to say it did not.\n\nThe newest Alien films stripped the Xenomorphs of what made them terrifying: that there are species \"out there\" that are inherently murderous. Ridley Scott threw that fear out the window with his origin story. It muddled the franchise and sapped the life out of the original. Shane Black's The Predator does not do this.\n\nSure, they gave the Preds a motivation, and added details that can be applied to the Arnie original but not so heavily as to really be taken too seriously. The Predators are still the hunters. They are just trying to be the best hunters they can be.\n\nShane Black has proven to be a master in comedy-laced action and it worked very well here. This movie is pure entertainment and I was entertained throughout the entire runtime. The action was gorey and visceral, and with the comedy I give huge credit to the casting and the great acting. It's not forced and it does not attempt to be comedy first, action second. It's a healthy mix.\n\nGo see it for yourself. On a big screen if you get the chance. In my opinion this is the only Predator that lives up to the original. And in today's day and age where classic franchises are being wrung dry this film is one sequel that does not disappoint. 9/10 spines ripped."

        "review_detailed_main": "I decided to watch this movie and make up my own mind despite the spectrum of negativity it's generating. I like the Predator franchise, and I've enjoyed watching all of them for what they are: a provocative science fiction monster movie. And, I'm rather glad I ignored the criticism (perhaps it helped), as this is an entertaining interpretation, albeit a somewhat comicbook-esque instalment. This is not a movie concerning the typical tense Predator confrontation-survival versions; this is more of a misfit, magnificent dirty half-dozen sci-fi flick, more in tune with the 21st century superhero genre replete with self-referential irreverence, thematic mockery, and subjective amusement. This version of the Predator isn't going to please everyone; however, this is a solid popcorn rendition of the alien-monster genre - finally, a version that doesn't take itself too seriously and, while leaving room for some development, expands the typically restrictive vantage point usually present in Predator movies. Until now, we've only seen the Predator narrative presented in the form of a skilled hunter versus a determined prey that - and let's face it - only prevails due to some dubious decisions made by the antagonist. The mystique of previous movies lay in its intentionally restrained portrayal of the signature character, which, although inspired fascination, eventually moved towards repetition present in each sequel. The dilemma with this version of Predator is in its anti-hero status clashing with the need to avoid predictability - does anyone really want to see yet another banal-more-of-the same edition? If we already know the Predator format - the whats, the whens, and the hows - then surely, what could we expect? As with other franchises, a soft reboot that mixes it up a little isn't committing the original sin according to the Predator bible. I considered the departure from the classic 30 year old original to be refreshing. Unlike other fans, I didn't want a samey, prosaic walk down memory lane - I know enough about the Predator already. The version is about the Predator Universe and not just the Predator itself; and, in the expanded universe (first introduced in the comic series of Predator and Aliens vs Predator: Three World War 1991), there are different Predator clans with different traits and attributes that help explain the changes. This movie tries to add to the story-universe by redirecting emphasis towards a more progressive concept rather than rehashing the threadbare hunter-stalking-quarry motif - hardly the crime of the century. Yes, it has a different focus, intention, and style; even though this has inflamed frustration, resulting in disappointment, even fury from many fans, it must be said that this is a very different movie model than that of previous releases. With a nod to the originals, this movie works as a good individual piece, which is how I've judged and rated it. Granted, there is much about which to complain, however, mitigating expectations to solve myopic nostalgia, it really isn't all that bad - remember, even the original had its flaws - this movie delivers an entertaining, humorous, and contemporary extrapolation of the initial Predator concept. In other words, and in PG Deadpool pithy parlance: it's much, much better than a prolapsed rectum, ignore the trendy bandwagon of exaggerated hypercriticism and watch the movie; it's ok, you won't die. Give it a go, and you might have fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Once again, a Predator comes to Earth. but this one is behaving a little strangely. And this one may not be alone. Rory, an Autistic kid(Tremblay, giving a nuanced performance), Casey, a high school biology teacher(Munn, who I've yet to find convincing. She seemed more confident when she was on G4), and Traeger, one of the higher ups(K. Brown, who we love to hate) who wants to learn about the \"bass fisherman\"(rather than destroy it before it starts its rampage), join the familiar players: a team of military badasses who have the skill and weaponry to fight back as they're being hunted down, one by one(if that *is* what it's interested in this time...). The twist? That last one? Every member is suffering from some mental issue as a result of their service(this very clearly has respect for those, and wants the audience to as well. Despite the jokes at their expense arguably going too far). Except of course for Quinn(Holbrook, charming, albeit not to the extent he was in Logan), who is being hidden from public view since he saw the extraterrestrial. He doesn't have a disorder. He just wants to keep his (already mentioned) 11-year-old son safe(and it's due to this point that I don't understand why people say there is no one to cheer on in this, that you can't get emotionally invested. I'm not judging, I'm just confused).\n\nThis is not perfect, it has definite flaws, but it does have a lot going for it. It feels like a proper sequel to the first movie, which none of the other sequels do. It knows how to still have action scenes(which are fairly varied and always exciting. I never felt like I was just sitting watching special effects, stunts and \"noise\") as frequent and as big as we expect today, since everybody watching this knows the titular creature. We are not going to sit through the equivalent of the '87 flick, that can only work with a new franchise, where we don't know. Here we see it very early, and so do the protagonists, in some cases few minutes in. So they can approach it in a way that makes sense from that perspective, rather than frustrating us with having to wait until they get there. There are a lot of quick short scenes and you can tell that this has been reshot, sometimes by the demands of executives. That's not going to bother everyone, I didn't think it hurt the film very much. I understand why some say that the humour is tone deaf, belongs to another decade, and makes us dislike the heroes - I guess all I can say is that that's ultimately a matter of perspective and I disagree with them on that. I don't think this ever slips into self parody: rather, it manages to be satirical and yet deliver. Just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3.\n\nThere is a lot of bloody violence, sexual references and strong language throughout. I recommend this to any fan of Shane Black and the series. 7/10"

Surely some of the actors, production crew, studio reps noticed it not only disrespected the franchises canon but also makes no sense at times? For instance we all now know bullets only do minimal damage to a predator, so why were these dummies grabbing any gun to fight the creatures? Like, you dummies are all going to die and guess what? They do. This makes it hard to root for any of the good guys coz they're just too stupid. There are so many WTF moments it would take ages to list them all.

        "review_title": "\"The Predator\" is Nothing What You're Expecting, If Expecting Anything At All.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Predator\", like its predecessors had a lot to live up too concerning the original film, which director Shane Black starred in himself 31 years ago, starring the ever iconic Arnold Schwarzenegger. To me, the original is exactly what is now and honestly always will be, a self-aware 80s action creature thriller that is never short of one liners. As well as having more cheese than the whole state of Wisconsin, some hold the original up as a really impressive feat for sci-fi action but to me, it's slightly overrated and tried to be way more serious that it truly needed to be, especially with it's cast. \"The Predator\" is almost exactly that but with the style of writing and directing Black has come to be known for throughout his career. This new film was exactly what I expected it to be knowing the witty dark comedic tone Black has within his script. The humor in my opinion was delivered extremely well and like it's 1987 predecessor, never short of one-liners that I'll most likely be quoting for a long time to come.\n\nThis film is at its best when our rag tag group of heroes are together exchanging dialogue with eachother either during the small moments of of breaks they get from the action or while participating in the chaos of the carnage our antagonist is dishing out around them. It truly goes without saying that the acting in here is very on point here and in an extremely well blended way. Each actor really has their own moments to shine and they truly give their all without sounding too cheesy or out of place within tone that Black is trying create. The standout performances are definitely without question from Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn, Trevante Rhodes, and Sterling K. Brown.\n\nThe action is very well shot and choreographed as well and it comes without shock that our beloved Predator shines when it comes to creative flashy kills. Every single scene with Predator doing what he does best was an absolute joy to behold to the eye. The VFX team as well deserves to be applauded for their work on everything to really amazing practical sets, stunning green screen, and masterfully blend the ladder to where it's almost indistinguishable to the human eye. It really goes without saying that this movie does look extremely beautiful, and especially our open shot, the cinematography team cannot get enough praise here. Lastly, Henry Jackman's score was just perfect for this film and honestly just an excellent score overall. He was able to just captivate all the orchestral 80s music that we love, the score just sounded so vibrant and ominous that it made me just want to immediately go on Spotify anf listen to the whole score.\n\nThis film does not come without its flaws though, the third act is really muddled with the crammed idea for an obvious setup plan for sequels and not all the characters are as fleshed out as I would have liked to see sadly. An example would be Alfie Allen's character, Lynch. He arguably has the least amount of screentime out of all of main characters and the few moments the he was in, were actually pretty good. It just sucks thats his talent was so looked over and never got his own moment.\n\nAnd yes, this film does not come without controversy with Olivia Munn doing the right thing in my opinion and outing a sexual predator who starred in the film. Thankfully the scene with him in it was quickly removed and never to be seen. But this should not impact the rating of this film at all. Politics should be set aside when it come to viewing a film on your own. There truly is enjoyment to have in this film and some may not view is so but this really is the best Predator film since the 1987 film, yes I get to some that making that statement really isn't saying much. No it's not a phenomenal film or even an amazing one at that, but it's a good time to honestly sit down too with a grouo of friends, a bowl of popcorn, and just watch the galaxy's greatest hunter go do what he does best. I understand that diehard fans of the first may not enjoy it as much and that's completely understandable to me. But if you're willing to get past the muddy sequel set-up in the last 30 minutes of the film, then you should have a fun time with \"The Predator\"."

Movies nowadays relay on comedy to stand out, and this movie isn't supposed to be funny, but still the studios wanted it, and they accomplished it with some fairly good jokes but still out of place. The editors had to cut the movie in order make it last as the same as the previous other movies, as a result some scenes are too fast and incomplete. It all happens too fast. It's so fast it doesn't build up to the last fight, nobody is excited to see a fight, it feels like everything else in the movie. Probably the best thing in the film is the bloody action. Finally an R rated film! It has the action the predator must have, not excluding what was necessary. In the end, the predator is an enjoyable film but forgettable, the more you think about it the worse it gets, I don't think this movie will be remembered or mentioned when compared to the others"

It looked like everyone did their best to make a serious Predator movie, but they all happen to be in on the joke. There's some funny callbacks to earlier films that people will see and enjoy and, as it most sequels, it tries to improve on it's original and just quite doesn't hit the mark. Regardless, go into this film with an open mind and lower expectations (I mean, it's not worse that AVP: Requiem) and you'll enjoy it for the most part.\n\nThe acting was decent for what they had to work with in script. (Remember, the actors are given direction to do something and the editors/director does the rest, so try to lay blame where it belongs.) The effects were fairly high budget, the cinematography isn't awesome, but it's fairly decent given the darker scenes. The list of actors are not all well-known or they used to be bigger names, but it's nice to see them on screen again.\n\nTL:DR Give this movie a shot, but don't expect to be overly wowed by it.

Just sit back, ignore the pseudo-science, chomp your popcorn and watch the pretty fireworks.

Director Shane Black (Acting in the Original) has brought the movie exactly what I was expecting, humor and fun. The film is far from some perfection, I absolutely agree, the story is full of holes, the tone is different from its predecessors, and the end of the film itself is the worst ending I have seen lately, but this is not a critical view of the film. I Watch a movie like a pop-corn movie, a fun of about 2 hours to put my brain off mode and laugh. Believe me I laughed more in this movie than in most comedies that come out of the last few years. In that way, I think the director succeeded and gave him a positive rating. Rating is a subjective matter and gets thumb up. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a Father to an autistic child, I have a few personal issues with \"The Predator\" but I'll put them to the bottom for the time being and try and talk about the film in more general terms.\n\nIf you're initial fears were, like mine that this was going to be an anodyne family friendly Predator movie, shorn of gore and violence to try and make as much money as possible then I have good news for you. It's not that. Limbs and heads fly off, spines are ripped out and blood accompanies all of it. It's not holding back in the language department either. Where the film does fall down more, is in plotting and characterisation. I understand the desire from the story to position Sterling K Brown's Military science unit (...Space Force!) as the villains of the film, but it feels a bit of a stretch that they would just make the decision to assassinate anyone who know about the existence of the aliens, especially when they're (for example) genetics experts who only know about the existence of Predators because they were invited in by that team. The readiness of McKenna's (Boyd Holbrook) team of misfit toy soldiers to risk their lives for his cause also comes a little too easy, after the films midway point and into the conclusion. I've seen some criticism of the film as having too many jokes, I'm still not sure that's really legitimate - but what the films does have is too many jokes that don't land and too many cute references to the original film, that grate more ingratiate. (Though there's one amazing Disney World joke in the opening act that I think might earn the film an extra star on its own, although I am also going to retrospectively remove that star for the awful reveal in the film's final scene).\n\nIt probably won't live long in the memory, or in the public consciousness but it was diverting enough whilst it lasted.\n\nSo, as a father to an Autistic boy - whilst it's not an offensive portrayal of the condition, it's not especially realistic either. Ignoring that not everyone gets that \"savant\" style superpower that seems prevalent in \"film autism\" - its effects are pretty inconsistent across the running time. Rory is overwhelmed by a fire alarm in the film's opening scene though able to act \"normal\" around a sustained firefight as the film reaches its conclusion, or whilst being bundled into a helicopter. It didn't ruin the film for me, but some of the discussion about autism being the next stage of human evolution made my eyes roll. Also, despite Shane Black being a sufferer himself, the use of Tourette's syndrome as a comedic device also made me feel uneasy and I'm surprised that hasn't generated more complaints."

It should have been a dead giveaway at the 5th minuts in at the poor quality and new profit orientated composition when the story relies on black and dark humour, intense gore and borderline parodical presentation that try to mimic the likes of Deadpool but fail miserably, to carry the film. Absolute disgrace.\n\nNothing about this film is gripping. Nothing about this film draws the audience into its concepts. I found myself actually LAUGHING at the ridculously corny one-liners from all cast members, no one is safe from Shane Black's cringe. This film was made for 8 year old american gamer boys who want their dads to take them to the cinema to watch something where people get chopped in half for the sake of it.\n\nLong story short, if you want to laugh at a movie because of how BADLY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED it is, see Shane Black's The Predator."

        "review_title": "Fun Sequel",
        "review_detailed_main": "I was quite intrigued when I heard they were making this sequel. I am a big fan of the original film, but had soured a bit on some of the films in the series. The official synopsis is when a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.\n\nWe start off this film with a sniper, Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) lining up his shot. They are trying to rescue hostages from a cartel in Mexico. This is interrupted by a spaceship as it crashes. Quinn checks it out and is attacked by a Predator (Brian A. Prince). He defeats the creature and takes some of the gear to keep himself safe. He sends it to a PO Box he has back in the States.\n\nAlso back in the states is his family. He is estranged from his wife, Emily (Yvonne Strahovski). They also have a child together, Rory (Jacob Tremblay). We soon learn that he is on the spectrum with autism. I really liked this concept to the film, as a doctor in the film, Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn), points out there are beliefs that autism is actually the next evolutionary growth for humans. This could make sense, especially with how Rory understands things and his memory is uncanny. He is bullied though in school.\n\nCasey is picked up by the government. This gets a little awkward due to the scene that was removed by Munn's request. We never actually get introduced to her. She is a leading biologist who focuses on evolutionary changes. She is brought in to help with the study of the Predator. Leading the investigation on them is Treager (Sterling K. Brown). He seems to know quite a bit about these species.\n\nIn order to cover up, so none of the information about this gets out, Quinn is going to be locked away in a veterans psyche ward. He gets on a bus with Nebraska Williams (Trevante Rhodes), Coyle (Keegan-Michael Key), Baxley (Thomas Jane), Lynch (Alfie Allen) and Nettles (Augusto Aguilera). They are all good soldiers, but the effects of war have messed with them.\n\nWe end up learning that the first Predator we saw is being chased by another one, one that is much larger and dangerous. The question becomes, why? I do feel that the film actually is paced pretty well, but there are just some scenes missing. Much like Casey, we never get introduced to Emily. The characters end up with an RV and I'm not sure how. During the climax, some of the characters kind of disappear for stretches and it just doesn't flow completely correct like it should. I do feel that the tension builds and we get a pretty satisfying payoff at the end, but it just still has some pacing issues.\n\nThis film actually has some really good acting performances. I thought Holbrook was fine as the male lead in the film. We get to know his character and he plays the part well. Rhodes I thought was solid in support of Holbrook. He actually was a fun character that I quite enjoyed. I'm still blown away by how good of an actor Tremblay is. It is just mind-blowing for how young he is. I picked up immediately from his performance that he was autistic and I like how his character develops. Munn I also thought was solid as the biologist. She kind of disappears a bit in the film, which I didn't really like. Brown was also good as the villainous government agent. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what they needed.\n\nAs for the effects of the film, for the most part I was on board. I liked the look of both of the Predators. One was clearly more CGI due to the size of it, but I didn't mind that. I did have some problems with the CGI in this film though. Any time they needed to show blood, whether it was human or alien, it looked fake. I was disappointed at how bad this actually looked. The dog like aliens also didn't look great. Other than that though, I thought the film looked good. I thought that was a strong portion of the film.\n\nThe last thing to touch on would be the soundtrack to the film. It doesn't stick out to me, but for a film like this it didn't need to. It fit the scenes and helped to build the tension during the battle or firefights. I didn't have any issues with the film here.\n\nNow with that said this film I came in expecting it to be fun and that's what I got. It has its issues, which I do think holding it back to be better. The film though does have a good story. I would buy that this alien race would be doing what they are. I liked the concepts of evolution and how it can be connected to autism possible. This film does bring up an issue that is debated in politics, which I could have done without. I do think this film did have some pacing issues. Not in that it doesn't build the necessary tension, because I think it succeed there, also having a satisfying payoff in the end. There are just some scenes missing throughout that make the film confusing. The acting though was really good as were some of the effects. Some of the CGI though doesn't look good and it was quite noticeable. I would also say that the score of the film fit what they needed it to. Overall, if you like the series, I would give this one a viewing as it is fun. I do think this film is slightly above average."

The good reviews are paid, I can guarantee you that. No one with half a brain or with some understanding of cinema can give anything above 4 stars to this movie.

What it lacks from the original is the consistent dark lighting throughout, with that feeling the Predator is right around the corner. The casting and actors were superb. Thomas Jane, Olivia Munn, and the rest of the cast have a comedic argument over something uttered, that I'm sure is in some part was something that has happened to Shane Black personally. And I give him credit for finding the humor in it. Though many on here rip on Black, I like all of his movies. Writing this version of the movie HAD to be a passion project. Considering he was the first person to die in the original film decades ago. Me personally, I enjoyed this version of The Predator movie series and look forward to seeing the next installment. Which was a phenomenal setup at the end of this one. Well done Mr. Black! Thank you for reading. I am a MovieFreak......rUaMovieFreak2"

Boyd Holbrook of Narcos is the sniper father and he is quite good in his action blockbuster debut. Jacob Tremblay the kid in Room has a pivotal role and he is cute. Yvonne Strahovski is mom - a bit underutilised.\n\nThe story is usually quite confusing in this kind of movie these days.

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Predator\" is a frustrating and confusing attempt to revive a classic franchise, but it fails in almost every aspect. The plot feels like a patchwork of ideas that never quite come together, leaving the audience wondering what the movie is actually about. The story is filled with strange choices, unexplained events, and characters who seem more like stereotypes than real people.\n\nWhat made the original Predator great was its tension, its pacing, and the feeling of a real threat. This version throws all of that out the window. Instead, we're left with a mess of over-the-top action, cringeworthy dialogue, and an overall sense that the filmmakers didn't know what they wanted to achieve. The result is a film that feels weirdly out of sync, with no clear direction.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original, you'll likely find this movie disappointing and frustrating. It tries too hard to reinvent itself but only ends up diluting everything that made Predator a memorable and iconic film. Save yourself the time-this is one reboot that truly misses the mark."

I happen to like the actors in this film and i thought the story line fine. Academy award potential? No. Good as the original? No. But a very enjoyable few hours and besides, I really like shane black's work. He was great in the first one. And i think this a fine directing job."

As a result of the hostility for this addition to the franchise, I gave it a wide berth...until now.\n\nFeeling more like a SyFy Channel rip off rather than an official offering, \"The Predator\"'s tone is all over the place. We have cheesy comedy, violence, horrible CGI and great physical effects...all fighting for dominance.\n\nThe acting veers between the acceptable and the awful. Olivia Munn manages to keep a straight face throughout, as does Yvonne Strahovski. All the other talent in this project are wasted (although I did enjoy seeing Jake Busey playing the son of the ill fated Special Agent from \"Predator 2\").\n\nBy the half-way mark of the movie, I'd accepted its shortcomings and decided I was onboard for the bumpy ride. All the while, though, I was puzzling over what was running through Shane Black's mind as he directed this beast.\n\nA sympathetic 7 out of 10."

I dont know how prominent celebrities did this to ruined their carreras i mean come on Boyd Hoolbrok (Narcos!!!), Sterling K Brown (This Is Us), Thomas Jane (1922, The Mist, The Punisher), babe hottie Olivia Munn, Olivia Strahovski (Dexter!), Alfie Allen (Games Of Thrones!) i mean its obvious that here the whole thing is about money because i think none should do this movie Shane Black i hate ya!!\n\nPD: Well done Arnie to steped down when they offer you money to return as Dutch!\n\nHorrible movie avoid it at all costs not even internet download worthy!"

I have to say that this kept me engrossed right to the very end and I was sad it had ended. All of the characters are very likeable. Especially the main man and his kid. When you like the characters you care what happens to them and that keeps you interested.\n\nI can only think the other reviewers haven't reviewed the film on its merit. I thought the storyline was well thought of and the action was really exciting!\n\nIf you are looking for a great action sci-fi film with no preconceptions of what it should and shouldn't be like then honestly give it a go.\n\nI really liked it so much that I scored it 9 and I'd watch it again and again.

Certainly, many people sat down to watch it with wide varying preconceived expectations. Some were pleasantly surprised while others were enraged this outing wasn't a simple remake of the 1987 original updated for the modern era.\n\nI found myself firmly in the pleasantly surprised camp pretty early on, and it wasn't just for the top notch visual effects or the crisp pacing. Rather, it was those other intangible things that caught my attention halfway through act 1, those variables that are sometimes sorely lacking from what could have been a great movie (and there are far too many examples for me to begin citing here.).\n\nWhat quickly caught my attention was how well the characters were both written and just as importantly casted. There is a palpable chemistry that so easily comes through the screen and raises the level of the entire movie from the mere farce it could have so simply been, to something so much more. Please don't misunderstand, this isn't the second coming of 2001 or anything even close. But for what it tries to be, it succeeds on many more levels than it misses.\n\nThe story is well thought out and presented with some great twists and turns, as well as a number of surprises you won't see coming; and some you will. In all, it's a fun over-the-top rollicking ride well worth taking."
