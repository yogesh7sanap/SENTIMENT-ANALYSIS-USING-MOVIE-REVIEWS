        "review_title": "Could the movie be THAT bad?!",
        "review_detailed_main": "As many of my readers have probably noticed, I have a strange affinity for bad films. Sure, I also enjoy foreign, independent and classic Hollywood films--but sometimes I enjoy a film so awesomely bad that it makes me laugh. Because of this, I periodically peruse IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 List to see which films are the lowest rated films of all time. And, aside from a few foreign language pictures which aren't available in the US, I have done a pretty good job of finding and watching these turkeys. A few of these incredibly low rated films are actually not that bad, though most are truly terrible--and many of also unintentionally funny--and these are my favorites. Birdemic, Prince of Space and Eegah are particularly funny examples from the list.\n\nImagine my surprise recently when I noticed something VERY unusual. A new film managed to not only make the list but vault all the way to #1. Coming from out of nowhere is the Indian film Gunday--a 2014 offering from director/writer Ali Abbas Zafar. And, considering my recent articles for Influx about my love for Indian movies as well as for bad films, I realized that this was a definite must-see. After all, if I praised Bollywood movies for their fun and originality, I have some obligation to mention the bad along with the good. So I wondered, since the movie is ranked as the worst film of all time on IMDb, is it really THAT bad?! Is the movie worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space or is it a case where folks are jumping all over a film that really isn't THAT bad (such is the case with Glitter or Gigli)?\n\nWhen Gunday began, I could see that it was completely unlike most of the Bottom 100. Most of these films are ultra-cheap films with tiny budgets and few were ever considered prestige films. However, Gunday clearly is a big-budget Bollywood film--with all the trappings you'd expect from such a film. It has handsome actors, huge song and dance numbers and tons of style.\n\nThe story is about two orphans who grew up in war-torn Bangladesh, Bikram and Bala. The two are starving and so gravitating towards a life of crime is understandable--and this sort of plot is VERY common in Indian films. They are in some ways like Robin Hood--big-time mobsters who have a heart for the poor and are their benefactors. Because of this and their toughness, no one would ever consider testifying against them and they have become the top crime lords in Calcutta. However, a policeman (the exceptionally talented Irrfan Khan) has made it his job to take down these criminals. And, in addition, the partner's strong bromance is threatened by a pretty young lady who both of them have fallen for big time.\n\nThe first portion of the film which shows the pair as children is actually very good. It is a compelling story and you feel for them as kids. They face hunger, sexual abuse and many other obstacles and the audience naturally pulls for them--even though they do begin engaging in criminal activities in order to survive. A bit later, however, the film jumps way ahead in time. Now the pair (played by Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor) are grown up and are becoming the top criminals in the city. They also have become incredibly silly--with extremely well-coiffed hair, rakish good looks, shirts ALWAYS strategically unbuttoned and STYLE, STYLE, STYLE! In fact, they look much more like models in a Vidal Sassoon advertisement than mobsters! And, to make it worse, they act much like Sacha Baron Cohen in Br\u00fcno or Ben Stiller in Zooolander-- though these two American films were intended as comedies, not dramatic musicals like Gunday! It's a strange contrast to see their terrible performances alongside Irrfan Khan--who, as usual, is terrific. Now I am not saying that Singh and Kapoor will always be bad actors--but the sorts of performances the director elicited from them are absolutely terrible.\n\nDoes all this bad acting and nonsense rise to the level of awfulness that merits the film being on the Bottom 100 List? Not really. While the film is pretty dumb at times (mostly, I feel due to the direction and performances by Singh and Kapoor), the film does have a few things going for it. The songs are terrific and catchy. Zafar can direct music videos--just not people acting like real people. And, as I mentioned above, Irrfan Khan is excellent in his role and this Indian actor has been getting a lot of well deserved attention in breakout films like Slumdog Millionaire, The Lunchbox and Life of Pi. Plus, parts of the story are interesting (though historically inaccurate)-- though I must admit that the film certainly does become tiresome after a while.\n\nSo why is this poor but not terrible film rated #1 in the badness scale? I can only assume because it was so well publicized, marketed and designed to be a mega-blockbuster. Like the examples I gave above (Gigli and Glitter), this is a case where the public really LOVES getting on the bandwagon to trash a mega-film. But unlike these two films, Gunday actually made a ton of money...yet people hated it! Perhaps this makes this movie the one that Indians love to hate! All I know is that if Zafar can make more 'failures' like this one, he'll become an incredibly rich man!!\n\nBy the way, if you're curious and would like to see the list, it's available at http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?ref_=nv_sr_1"

These movies worked primarily due to the brooding intensity and swag of Mr. Amitabh Bachchan plus his cracking on-screen camaraderie with co-stars like Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna etc.\n\nGunday has its plot and intent right. Its a classic 70s set up. But then.. neither is Ranveer Singh an Amitabh nor is Arjun Kapoor a Dharmendra or Vinod to pull off this kinda no brainer actioner. Priyanka Chopra,in various state of undress, has little scope to perform in her half baked role. Finally, Gunday doesn't even pass muster as an ode to 70s Bollywood. Skip it.\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).\n\nFrankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.\n\nThe only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays."

Rest is just another Bollywood weekend movie.Bangladesh liberation war was modified as Indo-Pak war without giving proper exposure to facts. Bangladesh was born from the war between India and Pakistan ! Thats the terrible blunder. So any person who knows the facts will be disappointed. As we know from the previous review Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces.The movie violated the sovereign feeling of Bangladeshi peoples. I'd rather prefer to watch \"The Busturd Child\" (2013) Hindi drama film directed by Mrityunjay Devvrat showing and emphasizing the real events that took place during 70's."

But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Does the director understand that this project has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done this film.\n\nAt the very beginning of your film,they are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film. It's tremendously humiliating for us (All Bangladeshis).\n\n3.According this story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!"

It should be edited without any delay. Me & all the Bangladeshi people respect those Indians who sacrificed their lives in the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 and we remember the contribution of Indian govt. at that time. But it doesn't change the history.\n\nBangladesh born in a long turmoil ending up a 9 month long war against Pakistan Army in 1971 but the liberation story starts far more from 1952 by language movement. India joined with their military forces in 3rd December 1971 and the Pakistan Army surrendered on 16th December 1971. Meanwhile India supported Bangladesh by restoring refugees, food, finance, arms and with many other things.\n\nThis is movie review page where I am opposing one specific content of the movie which is terribly hurting an entire nation. Yash Raj films still didn't respond in this matter where as Bangladeshi's are strongly opposing it specially the youth society.\n\nThe mindset should be changed and the history should not be presented wrongly through a movie."

How priyanka comes in between Bikram n Bala is the story. It a fun filled movie with small twists. The songs not all that pleasing but are average. The locations were OK n the screenplay was good. The movie was taken out well n it is no harm in watching if u r a fan of 6pacs. So if u feel u want to just enjoy n pass your time u can go for the movie.

If India didn't defeat and create Bangladesh, why did the Pakistanis surrender to Indian army in dhaka and not to the rag-tag 'mukti-vahini'. Wasn't Mukti-Vahini anyway armed and created by Indian support anyway? Bengali Muslims, even though butchered by Pakistanis in 1971, still hate Hindus more than they hate pakistanis, they continue to massacre and rape Hindu minority in their country which owes its very existence to India. Since 1971, Bangladeshis have managed to reduce their Hindu minorities from 20% to 7%.

The producer and director should be severely taken to task for manipulating history. Is is shame on the part of the industry to have such a movie. There is no fact. The movie is completely based on false statement and information. Shame on you Bollywood. You should have some ethics at least. This is totally unexpected. When the whole world knows the fact, you are trying to modify it. No story, poor acting, and falsifying of facts. Really unexpected from Bollywood. Most surprisingly, I did not understand as to how the sensor board permitted to release this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just began to watch the movie (though I do not watch Hindi movies a lot) but in the beginning, the timeline of 1971 war between Bangladesh and Pakistan (Which was later changed as Indo-Pak war 1971) was full of lie and manipulation. Bangladesh was never born from the war between India and Pakistan, 1971. It was a long history and clash between Bangladesh and Pakistan since 1952 Language revolution. Later India joined the war (3 December, 1971) and helped the Freedom Fighters' of Bangladesh. As a Bangladeshi, I am not denying the fact that India helped us a lot that time, but its my right to protest against the proper manipulation of a country's birth history! It was our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces. The instrument letter of surrender clears the fact. Anyone can search in internet and even in wikipedia for the truth : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"

By the way, about this movie, it is not an informative movie at all, they've changed the history of Liberation War of Bangladesh'71, which is so much humiliating for Bangladeshi people. It was not \"India-Pakistan war\", Bangladeshi people started their liberation war on 26th March and India came to help them on 3rd December of 1971. The movie also describes that Bangladeshi people are thieves and they are so desperate to get Indian citizenship which is not even close at all. Please, do some research before making a movie. Please :)"

But actually the reality is, Bangladesh fought for their language and land in 1971. We got out freedom with own credit and just at the last moment India helped Bangladesh. But according to the movie most of the credit went to Indian army. I know, India helped Bangladesh and probably that's because of their enmity against Pakistan, but they can't take away all the credits. This is definitely sending wrong signals and as a Bangladeshi I felt it badly. I can't accept it. The director and cast crew should knew this and presented valid and true information. They can't manipulate the emotion of one country just for the sake of making a movie for business."

Indian people have a lot of misconception about the history of Bangladesh. This is not very welcome, but this is understandable. Common people are not expected to have knowledge about the history of a foreign country. But when one of them is making a movie on that history. he simply can not do the same mistake. And from this well-known producer, this kind of negligence is never acceptable. The wrong history presented in this movie is definitely a punishable crime; and movie lovers, Do not believe a single word of this movie about the history of Indian subcontinent. Thanks."

Now, half of Bangladesh has turned out en masse to shoot this film down on account of their perceptions of historical inaccuracies. I beg to differ on two counts: 1: this is not a historical documentary and 2. there are many sides and versions of history. I have friends that have had to flee B'desh in the immediate aftermath of the war, leaving everything behind, losing their relatives, as they were of the wrong religion. No one can say that this did not happen. Ask the scores of B;deshi refugees in India and they will collaborate whats portrayed in this film. So there are many views on the aftermath of the war, with truth in each view, as they all represent experiences of different people."

Similarly, this terrible film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several sights. It depicted that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war when in reality; they had been fighting for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!"

Indian Government helped Bangladesh during this was, but it was NEVER a fight between India & Pakistan only!! This movie manipulate the history of Bangladesh liberation war and disrespect the blood of 3 million freedom fighter who gave their life for independent Bangladesh!!\n\nIndian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this.It is completely unexpected from a renowned banner like Yash Raj Films! However the first sequence of the movie put me in such a bad mood that I could not even enjoy the rest at all."

See at least in Wikipedia, you can get so many information about Bangladesh liberation war in 1971.In movie you said that War was between India and Pakistan. If war is between India and Pakistan then how Bangladesh was created.Bangladesh was created by sacrificing the life and blood of Bangladeshi people.India helped, but it does not mean that India is solely fight for Bangladesh."

The relation between Bangladeshi people & Indian Nation will decrease for this Movie. Stupid!!!

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched \"GUNDAY\" \u2013\n\nI heard somewhere that this movie is a tribute to Legendary Friendship movies of Bollywood like \"Sholay\", \"Kala pathhar\". Along with Multistar cast, Yash raj Banner, Heavy Promotions and not but least the director Ali Abbas Zafar (Who previously directed MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN) make \"Gunday\" a sure watch movie to me.\n\nThe movie starts with a very promising note. It took you in the year 1971 when a new country was born named \"Bangladesh\" and also born a new group of people called \"refugee\". It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor).They faced war, struggled for food, saved themselves from a pedophile and ultimately managed to escape to Calcutta and here the story starts. During the struggle for their existence they understand that there is no straight path written for them and starting from stealing 20 kg of coal, the two friends grow up as the Biggest Mafia of Calcutta controlling the illegal trade of coal, timber and fish. This part of the movie is so high paced that it will automatically tighten your seat belt for the upcoming ones. As the movie goes on Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), the most beautiful mysterious (?)Cabaret dancer, walked into their lives. They both fell head over heels in love with her. Now Enters ACP Satyajeet Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), to counter force for Bikram and Bala. Besides, a hardcore and no-nonsense but still having a good sense of humor cop Satyajeet(Irrfan) is aware of the fact that 'United we stand, divided we fall' and is extremely happy to see that the Bikram and Bala have forgotten the ages-old maxim . But ACP doesn't know that they both are two bodies, one soul. After lots n lots of twists and revelations, the Gunday of this story, i.e., Bikram and Bala reach their inescapable destination.\n\n\"Gunday\" is a tribute to the Amitabh Bachchan style cinema of the seventies when the movies contained a proper story, good songs, superbbb dialoguebaji, attitudes, when the movies were action-packed and anger-packed terming the system as the villain which directed the innocent individuals on the wrong path. This movie is old wine in new bottle but this old wine renders a highly enjoyable kick to the consumer, i.e., the viewer. Action along with the Dialogue of the two heroes(in childhood as well as in the adulthood) is the best part of this movie. The first half proves damn engaging for the spectator. The story dips somewhat to some extent in the post-interval session but, the script-writer and the director brought it back on track and ended it with a high-octane climax in a coal-mine at Dhanbaad and the movie does not leave any sense of dissatisfaction in the viewer when they came out from hall saying \"pyaasa usul bhai\" or \"total masala yaar\" or \"superhit hai bhai\".\n\nRegarding acting it's a challenge to overcome each other in such a Multistar cast(Ranveer, Arjun, Priyanka and Irrfan) movie where every one is a very good actor .But without any doubt I want to say that Ranveer Singh steals the show completely from frame to frame. Priyanka Chopra is just like a sizzler in the menu card. If you are a boy (whether single or engaged or married or father of 2children),you cant close your eyes for a moment and cant time to look other co-actors in the song sequences where Priyanka is performing.\n\nOn a whole a complete action packed masala movie you just loved to watch. As Friendship , Love, Betrayals(!) are on the air now on this valentines week this movie would surely be in your wish list.\n\nTake Home Massage: Don't Trust on a Bengali Person if he doesn't like or Play Football \uf04a"

Then a \"Bangladeshi army\" person raping a child. In last 42 years with millions of books written on the war not even one, I repeat NOT EVEN ONE states any BULLSHIT like that. Bangladesh army was still a force that achieved liberation for the people of Bangladesh in 1972. And they were all coming back to the family as heroes. why the hell something like that happen? again very abusive. then 2 child going to India from Bangladesh. A big laughter here.India was busy pushing Bangladeshi war victims back from the camps. And people coming back to home was the reality of time. Like every other aspect the movie is always ass on the front. Laughable. Abusive. And pretending to be a great cinematography with the heroine showing cleavage and bar dancing in songs."

The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al- Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II."

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings! I would like to introduce myself as one of the Bangladeshi movie lovers. You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you."

I have watched many Hindi movies, and almost all that came out this year, and let me tell you this one is in my TOP 5 list for this year of 2014 so far. some good movies came out like holiday, kick, ek villain, 2 states, but this to me stands at #1 for this year.\n\nin every movie there is some type of racism, cruelty, language, etcc. this does not mean you should take everything to mind and heart. Watch a movie for fun, if you want reality go watch a documentary. Take everything with a grain of salt please."

This movie deceitfully misrepresented the liberation war between Bangladesh (former East Pakistan) and Pakistan (former West Pakistan) in 1971.\n\nBangladesh became independent because of the gallantry of the Bengali people consisting of men and women, young and old, soldiers and civilians. All together the Bengali people fought for 9 months against Pakistani army and made their motherland an independent sovereign country with the sacrifice of 3 million lives.\n\nIt is a historical, world wide recognised fact that Bangladesh is the only country in the world's history which is liberated by it's people for their freedom of language. This movie misrepresented the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It is a disrespect towards Bangladesh and its people.\n\nThe movie director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Yash Raj Films should have taken the correct history of the Bangladesh Liberation War 1971 into their consideration before attempting this movie. When a movie is made based on any historical event, sincerity, preciseness and correct context must be taken into consideration. People associated with the making of this movie shown negligence and carelessness which is unacceptable.\n\nThe viewers should not trust the storyline of this movie. It is an untruthful movie. I request all viewers to reject this movie and show due respect to the martyrs and the people of Bangladesh."

Its rated 1 start by mostly those Bangladeshis who do not agree with the story of the movie. I understand they may not relate to the story but then if one was to rate the movie on its story I would rate it 8/10 and acting will fetch 7.5/10 but the climax of the movie is what really made me cry. Through out the movie I was slowly drawn into the close bonds the two lead characters share on the screen. It makes you cry at the end. Then climax is full 'paisa vasool' worth the money. It have seen the climax at least 10 - 15 times. Its when the movie ends you make sense out of the story, background narration by the two gundays makes it worth a worth second time. Don't go by the 1/10 rating these Bangladeshis have given because it shows how much Bangladeshis would like to be a part of this nation called Indian out of which they were born. 1 start rating is not due to bad story or bad acting but because it deeply hurts a Bangladeshis ego / sentiments. I have always considered Bangladeshis as brothers but then after all during 1947 they (as a part of Pakistan) had decided to part from India on the basis of religion - such stupids are difficult to find anywhere in the world."

Ali Abbas Zafar, the writer and director of the film, produced by Yash Raj Productions has really matured himself since his last film I saw\"meray brother ki dhulan\" meaning (the wife of my brother). There is a lot to say good about the film. The character archs are beautifully drawn, and the tone of the film is immediately set as the film begins. The story of two Bengali kids (fast friends) , Bikram and Bala, rendered homeless and orphans after the divide of Pakistan in 1971. They had nothing to eat and mean to earn, they run to the neighboring India as refugees. They are abused as refugees and are merely considered as filthy rats among the Indians. The city is Calcutta. To survive, they start to steal coal from the passing -by trains and soon they become dons of Calcutta. But because of them helping the poor,they are admired and loved by the entire city. Both are now grown up as men in their late 20's. We already is informed that Bala is a short-tempered guy while Bikram is a matured and sensible guy. Nandita, a cabaret dancer walk into their lives which we further get to know is a police inspector working for the Calcutta Police under Satyajeet Sarkar, ACP, especially appointed to arrest the outlaws for their unlawful businesses. Both of them fall in love with the so-called dancer but only to find out that she only loves Bikram. This breaks Bala's heart coupled with their newly appointed man (which later we discover works for the Calcutta Police but has his own agenda too, taking revenge of his brother, accidentally killed by the two outlaws), who triggers fire in Bala's heart against his friend Bikram. Bala blows Bikram's property which is left with him after they divided equally between them. This enrages Bikram and he comes in Bala's place and fights him out. Soon, they get to know that everything is planted by the police to get them separated and broken. Sarkar has almost finished with the job when the things turn in the favors of outlaws. In the end, both of them are killed while escaping the scene by the Police. Cinematography is great in the film with lust of music which to me is never up to the task. The plot has a few drawbacks, especially why the police officer Nandita when gets abducted by Bala shows mercy on him (she's isn't in love with the guy), why at this point she never unfolds her true identity? This is a weak point. I love the scene, when Nandita tells Bala that she only loves Bikram and she has no sympathies for him, he is left standing before a mirror merely looking at his soul. The other good scene is when the two outlaws fight with each other; a bird flies and vanishes away, immediately telling us what's coming next. Also, when at the festival, a ritual is performed of drowning god's idols in the water; we are intimated that something awful is coming next. Most of the dialogues make sense, not on the nose and have more meanings than the usual bollywood films. So, I would say \"very good\" to the writer who's also the director of the film. Keep the good work going."

India came to help with its military in December, just for one month before the surrender of Pakistan to bangladeshis. India helped bangladeshis by giving shelter and food from the beginning but they never joined the war directly. it was solely a war between bangladeshis and pakistanis.\n\nWe request the producer to apologise officially and change the controversial dialogues from the movie."

This film deliberately distorted the history of the war by claiming that it was a war between India and Pakistan. The historical bloody war commenced on 26th March 1971 between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian force joined with Bangladesh force just before the war ended on 16th December. Since then, we have seen India's effort trying to rip off the credit from Bangladesh in many forms but this time, it went over the top unlike anything else before. A film maker is a social researcher, whose role is to seek the 'truth' by repeated searching. Thus, he/she is bound to find a place to stand where he/she can trade off between being objective and being too subjective about the theme before capturing anything in the form of celluloid. From that aspect, the film is utterly a failure. A total crap."

Twisted historical events 4. Negligence to the actual facts 5. Bad workmanship 6. Weak acting I hope the director will take full responsibility of this totally fairy tale story line movie and will release a press note saying sorry to what he has done. he totally underestimated the independence war of Bangladesh and also he underestimated the contribution of the native freedom fighters who actually fought for their beloved country and snatched the independence. This is totally a time wasting, intentionally motivated political movie. I recommend that in future the director will study any historical event carefully and then decide to make a movie. Or else he can make some comedy movie not a serious one."

It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspects. They gave food, medical support and guerrilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this"

But on the subject of part 2, oh boy I was wrong. It depicted our Liberation War simply as a war between India and Pakistan. The script writers have cleverly re-written the entire history of the war and spat upon the memories of millions of people who were killed in dark chapter of our history. It also depicted a Bangladeshi Army Officer involved in Arms Smuggling to India and use children as sex slaves. This movie is a heresy and an insult to our country's history and our nation. I deeply condemn such deliberate misrepresentation of the history of Bangladesh and our people. The fact is, our struggle started from 1952. Though we are thankful for India's military intervention during the last stage of the war, but it does not give them the right to change the history of a nation which lost millions for independence."

Bangladesi people were a little outraged with the script's emphasis of Indian and downplay of Bangladesi contribution in the Indo-Pak war. Bangladesh and India each appeared in this ode to Kolkatta's plight. Factual evidence could have been clearly subject to bias for the target audience, yet the entertainment factor had been the main draw. Aditya Chopra produced one of the few Bollywood films having a superhero duo for a fun spirit like Dhoom!"

We always welcome and remember India for helping us during war, but it never deny the facts nor accept the fiction war between two other countries.\n\nI never see Indian movies because they are always low par on quality. They always throw something on the mud to start a movie hoping that it'll find along its way. I never had the intention to see this movie but this time they throw something on the mud that is very important to me. I can only say to the director of the movie is if you need to make a 3rd grade chick flick movie don't put serious staff on it. Why bring liberation war ? your movie is about dancing around and hanging around and doing stupid staff anyway !"

You watch a young smart man Nikram, an awesome man who moved to Bangladesh. India would never be the same. The action is so fun that you would rather die than have this movie taken away from you while playing. Once you watch the movie at least one time, you will never stop watching. It's so addictive to watch that weed and fapping will seem like a piece of crap in comparison. The visuals are astoundingly beautiful, pushing the low res bollywood hardware to the limit. I'm gonna be completely honest, when I saw a frame of India in the movie, I legitimately thought that I was in India! That's incredible! The dialogue is The Godfather tier. The story is very thought provoking, about what it means to be the ruler of the town or at least working for the government, and I'm not going to give spoilers, as the movie should be completely experienced alone and any twist should come as a surprise.. I can't explain anymore on why this movie is an instant classic, go and watch at least 20 or 30 times, however even that isn't enough to reward the creators, or artists as they should be called, for their work in creating the GREATEST movie ever made in ANY country."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gunday is clearly a very polarizing movie, as its historical accuracy (or rather, its lack of) has offended a very large demographic, which in turn has pretty much destroyed its IMDb rating. However, if one were to watch this film as a fictitious one (which is what it is, by the way), one would find a fairly above-average film that manages to set itself apart from the sea of mediocrity in Bollywood. The chemistry of the two male leads, Ranveer and Arjun, is incredible as they steal every scene they are in. Though the movie unfortunately devolves into a love story, the action, twists, and overall plot are good enough to keep viewers entertained until the end. Priyanka does a good job, as does Irrfan Khan (though I am not sure whether he is understating his character or simply bored. I believed in the former). The dialogue delivery can be a little ham at times, where listening to Ranveer say each and every word extremely slowly becomes frustrating to watch. However, this movie is loads better than the trash that Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar churn out year after year, whether its Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Boss, Khiladhi 786, or Dabangg 2 (honestly they're all the same), and, from a purely movie-quality perspective, Gunday is much better than all that. Though I respect the people of Bangladesh and elsewhere who have been offended, IMDb is not a place to spam a movie and lower its reputation because of that. Well-received movies like Inglorious Basterds, which completely undermines the efforts of soldiers in World War II, are not heavily critiqued because of the liberties taken with history. They are lauded and loved. This is not a documentary, and should not be critiqued as one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hash Raj films have hurt millions of Bangladeshis by sullying the history of their Liberation War aka Mukti Juddho. The story writers of Gunday are historically ignorant (probably because they never went to school) and this movie is the proof of their insolence and ignorance. This movie insulted & sullied the image of Bangladesh in every possible way and it even fabricated a new degrading war history of Bangladesh.\n\nIn the beginning, the narrator says: Bangladesh is the result of an Indo-Pak war but the truth is: This war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.\n\nIndia entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-planned air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.\n\nThe Bangladeshis are very proud of their war history because they fought and earned their independence. Without any provocation, the Gunday Crew and Hash Raj Films have insulted the Bangladesh and It's people. Therefore, they owe the entire Bangladesh an apology."

People see the language that Bangladeshis speak ads being wrongly showcased.I agree this is abusive on the part of direction, however the film is a mass movie and couldn't have been a success had it been picturized in real situations. Hindi language was used so that most people could understand what was being said.\n\nOne must note, Gunday is not a history lesson. It is a simple (and heavily flawed) story of two boys who were nudged into the wrong direction because of the circumstances. The director kept the main storyline real to a great extent and kudos to the director on that note.\n\nNobody questions the acting ability of any of the actor in the film. Though Ranveer Singh's dialog delivery is a bit incoherent.\n\nThe film could have easily been more entertaining had the director focused more on the script than on the emotions of the film, however the film is entertaining."

The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of NINE months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.\n\nThe war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini . which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces.\n\nmore read here ~ HTTP://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"

But, if you don't respect others history then how could you be so sure that people will not protest it. I don't frequently watch the Bollywood movies, but when i heard that \"Gunday\" movie is made of our liberation war perspectives then i was so enthusiastic to watch it. The first line of the movie is \"16th December 1971, the second highest surrender between India-Pakistan war after second world war and emerge new nation Bangladesh\"..what the hell is this line?? They clearly mentioned that it was a India-Pakistan war and after that war creates Bangladesh. Let me say, how many people of Indian army were killed in that war compare to Bangladeshi civil people. We dedicated our blood to bring independence on the other hand someone just came and say it was India-Pakistan war and expect us to calm and applause !!!!"

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film.\n\n1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.\n\n3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action.\n\nThank you-"

They are to pretending a winner where the real hero is Bangladeshi martyrs. Actually they are the looser who get solace by imagine themselves as winner in a cinema only. In 1971 Bangladesh had liberation war against West Pakistan for their freedom. The role of India for Bangladesh was as friend who gives training and weapon to fight against Pakistan. but in this movie they plotted bangladeshi as Indian land and bangladesh as crime zone which is a serious distort of history of bangladesh. this movie should ban because next generation will get a false message through it which is really bad for world history."

The film should be banned for distorting historic facts. At a time when the Bangladeshi govt is planning to screen Hindi films there, i think this movie should make that task difficult. Its true Hindi films have great market in Bangladesh. But to explore this market, Indian filmmakers should not come with something like this film which has made mockery with Bangladeshi peoples patriotic sentiment. Just a mere apology is not enough. Yash Raj films need to remove those controversial scenes from the movie and then apologise"

        "review_detailed_main": "...than watch this seemingly absurd, sheepishly long flick having 3 main characters and 1 special appearance where the latter does a more meaningful part than the main actors.\n\nFirst of all, I still can't understand why Irrfan Khan's appearance has to be quoted as a \"cameo\" when he shares at least 20 minutes of screen space. Secondly, what were the writers thinking while authoring the twist in this film? The twist is so feeble, a 10 year old sitting beside me guessed it right.\n\nStarting off with a childhood story about two friends who later become partners in crime, Gunday tells the story of how a woman can wreck havoc in friendship. But, after making this point, the plot fidgets. The twist actually smears the whole thingy with glittering banality. Love breaks friendship! Okay! That's cool! But why did you have to bring up a twist and re-frame the whole goddamn thing? That love did not break friendship. Why?\n\nArjun Kapoor's last stint in Aurangzeb was appreciable and it was one of the best movies of 2013. But, he overstates himself here, maybe due to the competition with ever charming Ranveer Singh. The latter does a better performance and has a better character, so to speak. Priyanka Chopra is a cabaret dancer, yet she tries to instill good values in other characters and request to stop the indecent act. Lame!\n\nIrrfan Khan is the only appreciable person, but his dialog delivery is poor. Maybe, it all has to do something with the extremely unprofessional direction. The cinematography is fine, but why so many slow-motion shots? Music is fine, but 6 songs aren't too much?\n\nAt the end, what was a relieving climax also is turned into another long, slow-motion scene which culminates to dramedy. Every single factor of the movie is unoriginal, not to mention how during almost all the dialog delivery, the poor direction shows up like a spinach leaf on your teeth after dinner. Many scenes involves discontinuity wherein we expect the scene to end with a short conclusion, but in we are shown a new sequence. This was particularly terrible.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Last week's Hasee Toh Phasee told a better story. Gunday, due to its bad story, direction, screenplay & editing is just 3.4 out of 10. Even the two child actors couldn't entertain me. I chuckled maybe 3 or 4 times. But, the question is: is that enough?"

The Film Portrays Bangladesh really badly, In 1971 Despite War, Bangladesh was Richer than India in terms of Wealth (World Bank), In Terms of GDP Per Capita. The Full Story is just imaginary and mindless, historically false claims. The director should have at least shown a disclaimer or something in the beginning because the film is not based on real event, The film portrays Bangladesh as the guilty one. So When You Watch This Film Don't take Everything You See Seriously because Indians have a serious Problem of Taking Credits from Someone Else' Struggle. War Between Bangladesh And Pakistan in not an Indo - Pak war,To All Indians, Please stop Manipulating History of Bangladesh."

Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors.

Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini . which engaged in guerrilla warfare against West Pakistani Armies.\n\nmore read here ~ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"

Pakistan was our common enemy but to claim our victory as your own, just because you helped with arms and refugees, is a plain hypocrisy. New generation of India and Pakistan have to know the true history of 1971. Do not listen to your government and media, who produces and promotes lies like Gunday. Educate yourself by reading. Tomorrow's world is ours. Bygones the age of darkness. Gunday is not a film or any sort of art. It is a proof of how attitude Indian Govt. has over it's neighbors. This has to be changed. This movie like garbage deserves no star and so I don't understand how it got 2 points something. Priyanka, Ranaveer have come a long way and they should take an equal part of the blame. How do they don't know about '71?! Just because they are movie star, they do not have to pretend they are not supposed to check historic accuracy of their movie plot. Specially, Priyanka, as an international superstar, should know better than me. How about Bangladesh make a movie about 1947 with derogatory perspective on Indian value. Oh yeah! There will be war. I know. Respect begets respect. New generation India should stand up. Start learning history and be part of anti racist movement. What happened in Delhi recently is a reflection of poor education system that shoves grades and not teach ethics and history. Wake up India. -one fellow neighbor."

I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land. It's tremendously humiliating for us.\n\n3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!

I believe world knows clearly what was happened on that time in 1971. We had to fight with Pakistan for our right and freedom,Indeed on 16 December, 1971, head of Pakistani solder signed in the surrender paper to Orora, who was an Indian solder, but on that time it was a stupid politics has been played by India with us. The reality is from 26 March our mass people started to protect to the Pakistani solder even without knowing how to shoot by a gun, but it was a strong mental inspiration that, we need freedom, and 9 months until 6 December our mass people and few solders fight with Pakistani solders without taking world help, at 5th December Pakistan attacked to India some how, and 6th December there only some solder came to Bangladesh and joined to the war with our nation under the direction of Orora. But in this film they hide the true story and published as the war was held between India and Pakistan, even on that time Our country already got name \"Bangladesh\" instead of \"East Pakistan\". I don't know why the published this stupid thinking in a film, after this film our nation feel ashamed and got annoyed. Because, there are 3 million Bangladeshi has been killed and 0.2 million our girls has been raped and uncounted child has been killed also by Pakistani solders. We got our country by exchanging our Blood with Pakistan. It was not like that, Indian solder or India gifted us our motherland. I strongly protect for this stupid thinking and India should beg to us to pardon."

You can't just digest Ranvir Singh and Arjun Kapoor as the most notorious bandits of Calcutta in the 80s as the film projects nor the police action against them looks much realistic. Overall, \"Gunday\" is weak in its story with unlovable characters and tastelessness. Performance wise too, the film falls short for the under performed roles of Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra.

This film is a great entertainer and you know that. Bollywood is one place where you should put in no brains because that is only going to bring headache to you and will make no difference to the film-makers. The film has already been declared a \"hit\" and the producer and director and actors are happy with it. Please don't make it #1 in the \"Bottom 100\" category. It does not deserve that. As far as the script is concerned, the film does have flaws and is almost predictable but the attitude and the energy the leading duo brings is mind-blowing. And the climax has such an amazing twist and unpredictability too. That's what makes it worth it. The first half of the film has some really good comic moments. You know it, the film is technically very sound. there are some really powerful moments that get your heart pumping. But there also are a few clich\u00e9s like the costumes of PRIYANKA CHOPRA and a few locations that don't look like 70's or 80's. As far as the performances are concerned, they are top-notch. RANVEER brings his usual \"mardaangi\" with himself and delivers his career's second best performance. His screen presence and charm is thoroughly felt. ARJUN gives us his best performance after a little dip in AURANGZEB. The two also have good comic timing. PRIYANKA is back with an eye catching sparkle after a few disastrous outings like ZANJEER. IRRFAN needs no words. He is simply magnetic. All in all, ignore that manipulation of history and what you get is entertainment, entertainment, entertainment, all thanks to the attitude, attitude and attitude of the leading men. It's an 8 for the film, 1 for the leading duo and 1 for the technical brilliance and climax. That makes it 10. But being fare, I'd like to deduct a star for that tweaking of the 1971 war. So that makes it a 9 on 10. No offence intended to anyone. It's simply my opinion."

Furthermore, the film awfully overstated the scenario in 1971 representing that the Bangladeshi used to discuss in Hindi! My foot! It's an issue of excellent disgrace when some foolish & insensitive scriptwriters represented the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Country, who are the only fearless nation who had reduced their bloods for declaring their native language returning in 1952!\n\nSuch is the condition and size of traditionally inaccuracy and dumbness!"

This is how they are even taught in their school's history books!!! They call it \"Indo- Pakistan war of 1971\". GUNDAY is NOT just another arbitrary example. This Hindi movie wanted to portray the same thought most of the Indians have in their mind about the history of the bloody birth of a nation. The people of Bangladesh fought for their freedom against the tyrannical Pakistan for 9 months. Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing 20000 innocent Bangladeshi civilians in just one night. Official name for that operation was 'Operation Search Light'. Bangladesh declared independence the very next morning. During this war 3000000 Bangladeshi gave their lives and 300000 women were raped by Pakistani army and their Bangladeshi Allied Forces (Jamate Islam, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami Chatrashangha). It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped the people of Bangladesh in every aspect during the war. This is what every friendly neighbor does in a war state of a country. They gave shelter, food, medical support and guerrilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters). Pakistan military launched preemptive air strikes on 11 Indian airbases on 3rd December 1971, and that's when India directly joined in the war. The Joint Force then fought for 13 days and finally Bangladesh got victory over Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Pakistani Army Commander Lt. General Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of Indian Chief of Army General Jagjit Singh Aurora and Bangladeshi Chief of Army General Osmani at Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. How Did India come to the equation that the war was between East and West Pakistan, India was only a sidekick who was on side of Bangladesh. If Indians claim 1971 war was Indo-Pakistan war, then it was also Pakistan-Russian war because Russia helped Bangladesh, or US-Russia war because US helped Pakistan. So when you watch this film, don't take everything you see seriously because Indians have a serious problem of taking credits from Bangladesh's struggle. I feel pity for that nation who doesn't know how to respect another country's history."

That's a crime. i hate this sort of criminals. Bangladesh achieved its independence through a blood shaded war in 1971. India just cooperated at the ending time and its clear that their calculation was different. They supported us for their gain not for the sake of humanity. in this film they have insulted our great freedom fighters. They have insulted our national identity. please don't follow this film as historical film.we Bangladeshi people is proud as an independent nation.we achieved it and we uphold it for the sake of our identity."

Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of the film,telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!"

By the way, in the beginning, the movie tried to manipulate the history of neighboring country, Bangladesh.

        "review_detailed_main": "I was so surprised to see the reviews on here, and the average rating of 1.2 before I went to watch the film, but it's unfortunate that due to one factual mistake, the reviews have taken such a hit! Nevertheless, the film hits a hard punch and delivers well.\n\nGunday being a Yash Raj banner film, with young talent such as Ranveer and Arjun, the ever dependable and beautiful Priyanka, and the powerful Irfan Khan in lead roles, you'd expect this film to be a hit. Being a Bengali myself, I loved seeing some memorable locations around Kolkata (then Calcutta) city. Every scene in Gunday is powerful and the whole film rides on the bromance of Arjun and Ranveer. They are both brilliant and their friendship off the screen has made it so easy for them to portray this on screen.\n\nRanveer Singh is just too good! The guy just oozes quality and style in every single scene he delivers. His chemistry with Priyanka is awesome too and I hope to see them paired together in more films in the future.\n\nArjun Kapoor has arrived! This may be his third film, but I feel he'll be really noticed now and it will certainly open up to bigger and better roles. Arjun is perfect as the hot headed Bala, with fantastic screen presence alongside Ranveer. Ranveer is the lead, it's quite clear to see that but Arjun matches him step for step!\n\nPriyanka Chopra delivers a typical Priyanka performance - She looks stunning, she acts with ease, she romances so comfortably so such a role is probably very natural to her. She is certainly one of the top female leads right now in the industry and performances like these will always help her stay here.\n\nIrfan Khan will always be one of the most underrated actors in the industry, but he never fails to give his best. He is too good as the ACP and I'd love to see him in more cop roles in the future.\n\nAnother big plus of the film is it's music. I was a little shocked that considering the film is very Bengali, why Pritam wasn't chosen but Sohail Sen has done a fantastic job. My favourite songs are Jashn-e- Ishq, Jiya and Gunday (title track), but all the other songs are excellent.\n\nOverall Gunday is a action packed masala film but unfortunately due to one mistake, it will not get the high numbers it should get."

Terrible making, terrible cast. A total garbage. The movie is set in a totally false historical backdrop as the real war started in March of 1971, yet the movie shows it to start at December. The bravado of the Indian army is over blown, and is frankly surreal. The cast couldn't capture the essence of the struggle and remained dramatically detached. So, a very sorry movie, and a waste of time!"

It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: Liberation Army), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched PR- emotive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defense's soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II."

Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this."

That's why we are not stopping ourselves from protesting and sending mails to Yashraj Films. We are demanding your apology from your core heart and this should not be in a less covered media. We know you are a film making giant and know how to make news. We demand apology from you calling on a press conference.

I want to raise my voice here to strongly protest the distortion of history by the film. This is not the true history at all. The true history is that there was no 3rd war between India and Pakistan and indeed Bangladesh fought their own war to win independence from Pakistan. India helped us in a great extent with armaments and strategy (and we have been always more than grateful for that) but it was us who fought an died in the field. So, better read the history first, come out of your prejudice about Bangladesh and then dare to make movies on historical significance."

On the whole, GUNDAY has a credible story to tell, is packed with unexpected twists that keep you on the edge and offers entertainment in large doses! Gunday's heart is in the right place but the plot gets overwhelmed by its own voluptuousness, its slick torsos and slow-motion slaps, its extended Durga Puja which leaves it lost between Calcutta's cabarets and Dhanbad's dark mines. However, Gunday's fun while it lasts. More depth, more fire would've sharpened this film. But Gunday offers glitter coating a grim tale."

I am proud to be a Bangladeshi and I do not prefer to call myself Indian and I believe that neither did my ancestors. If they did, they would not have fought so valiantly. Indian army joined OUR liberation war on 3rd December, therefore there was no way it was an Indo-pak war. A movie cannot distort the history of an entire nation in the name of creative freedom. And what saddens me is that not one person associated with this film corrected this mistake. Knowing history isn't so tough anymore, one search in Google will get you thousands of results. If a production house like Yash-Raj films makes this \"mistake\" in 2013 when information is readily available to anyone interested, I wonder what other facts were distorted before."

Shame on the entire unit of this movie including the actor actresses and whoever authorized the screening; they just don't bother to 'study' what they are performing and just blindly go for it as long as it brings in money?!Just go and get the facts right!! 1971 was never a war between India and Pakistan; it was a war between Pakistan and Bangladesh. If it was not the extremely brave ordinary people of Bangladesh who decided to face the then strongest military forces under the guidance of Bangabandhu with sticks and simple airguns in front of those hi tech Pakistani military tanks and weapons, instead of waiting for some foreign forces to come and help them getting independence, this war would have never ended. India did help Bangladesh towards the end of the war but they had their own interest in it too. In no way this war can be called a war between India and Pakistan. Please don't convey distorted messages especially something as sensitive as historical facts through your movies. I used to view YRJ film as a 'respectable' one , but now I will think several times before I want to watch any of your movie!"

In the same way, this dreadful film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several attractions. It portrayed that individuals of Bangladesh were engaged in various legal actions during the liberation war when in reality; they had been battling for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the film awfully overstated the scenario in 1971 representing that the Bangladeshi used to discuss in Hindi! My foot! It's a issue of excellent disgrace when some foolish & insensitive scriptwriters represented the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Country, who are the only fearless nation who had reduce their bloods for declaring their native language returning in 1952! Such is the condition and size of traditionally inaccuracy and dumbness! Poor foolish ass YashRajFilms!!! Better begin promoting pinup publications on the road - I mean it!"

Yash Raj films have somehow removed the existence of the freedom fighters who actually fought off the Pakistanis from Bangladesh and given the total credit to Indians who joined at the last moment.

The film has solid performances, catchy numbers like Asalaam-E-Ishqum and Tune maari entriyaan and a story that makes equal room for emotion and social relevance. There's a lot to impress the average film viewer. Six packs, bulging muscles, seductive dances \u2013 all the cinematic material required to make an audience friendly hit. Ranveer and Arjun are the soul of this popcorn action flick. Their energy, their chemistry and their good looks are paisa vasool. While Arjun portrays his character at the edge of darkness with perfection, Ranveer steals the show with his textbook good guy with bad habits character. Not far behind is Priyanka Chopra. It's a sight to see her in a cabaret and then hold fort with the two heroes in dramatic scenes. It's a pity her clich\u00e9d character doesn't allow her to do more. Same goes for the phenomenally talented Irrfan. He plays the witty cop with the right amount of restraint. But he should have been given the chance to lock horns with the two leads in a direct duel. That would've elevated Gunday to the next level."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie displays the fact that Bangladesh was born as a result of an \"India Pakistan war\" which is completely made up and utter bullshit. Bangladesh has been under Pakistani ascendancy since the birth of India and Pakistan in 1947. Pakistan ran a carnage in 25th march 1971 to swipe out the thin modicum of hope of a independent Bangladesh. The aftermath was a 9 month long war which took its toll of 300,000 Bangladeshi lives. India contributed to our liberation war a few days before our independence when the results could already be predicted at that time. hence making a movie out of such a false, misleading storyline is nothing but a display of mockery to the 300,000 lives the Bangladeshis lost. The soul purpose of a movie is to portray true facts/events/history and \"entertainment\" is just a mere ancillary. Hence deforming facts/history for the sake of \"entertainment\" loses movie's authority to be called a movie."

This is the problem with Non Bengalees who touch such sensitive and emotive subjects which are near to the heart of 25 crore Bengaless in West Bengal, Bangaladesh, rest of India and the world. I must say that this is pure callousness. when 3 million people died, 2 lakhs illegal children took birth due to the war you can't create a film based on imagination. Some real hardcore research would have made a much much better film. I condemn this casual approach towards this film making based on a subject which is a very very soft and emotional issue for Bengalees."

The war between Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) and Pakistan (erstwhile West Pakistan) began on the early hours of 26th March 1971 and after 9 months of battling, the Pakistani forces surrendered admitting their defeat which lead to the formation of a sovereign country named Bangladesh. There were actually two forces on the side of Bangladesh: 1. The Liberation Force (Mukti Bahini), commanded by General M.A.G Osmani and comprised of Bangladeshi military and civilian personnel. 2. Friendly Force (Mitra Bahini), commanded by Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora and comprising of the members of Indian forces. During the period from March 1971 to November 1971, the war was solely fought by the \"Mukti Bahini\" under the command of General M.A.G Osmani. During this period,the Indian Forces mainly contributed through providing training to the civilian members of the Liberation Force (Mukti Bahini)at their various training centers located in India. The Indian Forces joined the battle field with the Liberation Force in Novermber 1971, only about a month before victory of the Mukti Bahini. This was never a war between India and Pakistan. India was just a part of the war being a friendly nation to us during the time. But unfortunately, this history was massively distorted in this movie. We, the Bangladeshis do obviously admit the unparalleled help and support we received from the Indians during our biggest crisis period and do express our full gratitude to them but we protest such distortion of history of the liberation war of Bangladesh in the movie \"GUNDAY\""

Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action.\n\nThank you."

From that time there was many protest against Pakistani government and in 1971 Bangladesh declare War against Pakistan and Bangladeshi army fight against Pakistan and and won the war after nine month fighting. Bangladesh paid the liberation war by giving over 3 millions of martyrs.

And in this film they also made unrealistic statement for Bangladeshis. As a truly citizen of Bangladesh I'm totally against of this film only because of falsified our country's freedom war and they tried to present us as shameful people. that's not acceptable from Bollywood. those who don't know about Bangladesh's liberation war, after watched this pathetic film they have misconception of Bangladesh and her people."

A Chopra is of course not as good as Y Raj. There are number of arguments between and Indians and Bangladeshi brothers on social media because of this movie. It is a okay movie but the time line changed the rating to 1.4 and I will not be surprise to see if the rating goes down to 0.4 in next few years.

Its may be OK but to say that Bangladesh is created through the war between India and Pakistan is a clear issue of discrimination. Its a clear sign of ignoring the truth and making false history."

I don't know whoever that Yash Raj films guys are but if you want make a film which has historical relations with an event or whatsoever then you better check the accuracy.

India helped bangladesh by their weapon and bombing materials. thats all. in this movie they plotted India directly take part in liberation war with Pakistan which is 100% false and by this fake history movie director representing himself as vulgarian person."

Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces. The instrument letter of surrender clears the fact. Anyone can search in internet and even in wikipedia. But Your film is noting but an idiotic story which indicate our freedom was a result of India and Pakistan 3rd war!! I would like to call your script writer an asshole. The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not.

        "review_detailed_main": "It was not a bad movie, but there were some parts that were portrayed falsely. What stood out to me is one of the main messages you get out of this movie. The message being that at the beginning of the movie the main characters were against the partition of Bengal and India. The partition left them homeless, so they went against the system to fight back, and started to steal. But when problems had arisen between the characters they started fighting against each other. The solution to put an end to their problems was to partition their own property, money amongst themselves. The same wealth they had accumulated to fight against the system and the partition movement; was now being used to partition amongst them to solve their own problems. How Ironic. It can also be said that the characters had embraced the idea of partition towards the end of the movie which ultimately lead to their downfall. Overall, I don't think it matters if YRF got some or ALL facts wrong when making this movie, the takeaway message is that partition is never the best solution for a country when they are facing a civil unrest because countless lives are lost or displaced, as was the case with Bikram and Bala. If Bengalis feel offended from this movie, they should calm the **beep** down because firstly; this is a fictional movie, secondly; if you are complaining then clearly you did not understand the message this movie was trying to portray."

We fought against Pakistan and it symbolically started on 21st February 1952 from the Language movement. Then 1969 and finally 1971 war started. We did not forget the contribution of Indian Army and the then Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Gandhi.\n\nOur Father of Nation Bangabondhu Sk. Mujibur Rahman was the great leader of our Nation who led this war from Jail. He was our inspiration. We about 30 Lakhs Bangladeshis laid down our lives for obtaining the freedom.\n\nMore importantly, there were 90 thousands Pakistan Army surrendered to Joint forces (Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters and Indian Army), but in the film it shows Pakistan forces surrendered to Indian Army.\n\nBut very sadly say that all the truth did not reflect in this film rather it is full of fabrications. So to say, it shows follies of the storytellers and its directors. I think they do not have the right to distort history of other nation.

I also think they might have twisted or misrepresented the history of recent war in Indian Subcontinent. Yet for a viewer standpoint the Hero Ranveer could do better and that goes also for Priayanka. Ranveer's previous movies had some decent storyline and enjoyable moments. In this one he did not care about his role. With Priyankas recent exposure to Western media she could be more careful about the selection of her movie. Anyway, If someone has got enough time to waste on backdated action and some Stereotypical Bollywood dance in HD resolution I think this is the movie to go for."

I HATE THIS MOVIE. its producers,script-writer,director and the actors ( all of them are DUMB ASS,F*** you)\n\nAll most all the researchers discovered this rumors about the excellent Freedom War of Bangladesh way too difficult to take given that, at time the film is set- it was an India-Pakistan war occurred in 1971!! In the same way, this dreadful film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several attractions. It portrayed that individuals of Bangladesh were engaged in various legal actions during the liberation war when in reality; they had been battling for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the film awfully overstated the scenario in 1971 representing that the Bangladeshi used to discuss in Hindi! My foot! It's a issue of excellent disgrace when some foolish & insensitive scriptwriters represented the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Country, who are the only fearless nation who had reduce their bloods for declaring their native language returning in 1952!\n\nSuch is the condition and size of traditionally inaccuracy and dumbness!\n\nPoor foolish ass YashRajFilms!!! Better begin promoting pinup publications on the road - I mean it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Bangladeshi people fought for their independents in 1971. It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspects. They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they are working with something like this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gunday a story of two friends united by fate and desperation. The movie is engaging and realistic and will never let you take your eyes away from the screen for the whole period. You will feel emotional, deeply rooted to the story and you would be able to relate a few things about you life as well, specially when Priyanka Chopra arrives at the scene. A cute love story which takes the story away from all that fighting and action and gives the viewers a breather. Dialogues are well delivered by both the actors. Ranveer and Arjun have come a long way and has actually delivered great performances. Ranveer is specially always giving his 120% at the camera, very energetic and nice to watch on the other hand Arjun is this angry young man and always ready to fight. While watching the movie it actually reminded me of Sholay and the sets do actually give you that feel. Most of the movie is shot at Old Kolkata and still gives you a fresh feel. On the other hand the Coal mines of Dhanbad takes you to a dark world of Coal Mafia which still exists till this day. The songs are nice to hear, well choreographed. Gunday as a whole is a well made movie and definitely a blockbuster of 2014. It definitely lived up to its promise and will make the viewers happy while they come out of the theater. I have gone through some other reviews where I could see comments such as \" Poor Story \", but trust me nothing more could be done to make the script better. The director did not make it unrealistic which is the current trend now. So just go and watch it Yourself and I know you would love it.."

India helped Bangladesh by providing logistic support, military training, arms, food etc. Pakistan Army murdered more than 3 million Bangladeshi citizen and raped and tortured 200000 women. When Pakistan Army was about to accept defeat they decided to attack India, ashamed of being defeated to Bangladeshi people.

You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.\n\n2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.\n\n3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!

        "review_detailed_main": "The Bangladesh Liberation War was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India)against West Pakistan, and lasted over duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. 26 March 1971 is considered the official Independence Day of Bangladesh, and the name Bangladesh was in effect henceforth. In July 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi openly referred to the former East Pakistan as Bangladesh. Some Pakistani and Indian officials continued to use the name \"East Pakistan\" until 16 December 1971. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched air strikes on northern India. This movie changed the main history of the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971 against Pakistan. Shame Bollywood! Shame Yash Raj Films! I WANT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BY WATCHING THIS MOVIE and PLEASE RATE THIS MOVIE AS A DUMPED MOVIE.Thank you."

The war of 1971 was the war of independence of Bangladesh, why it is so difficult to admit for them? they could have made the movie acknowledging the facts and still get a very good story. This kind of things are not tolerable. Many movies have been adopted from, or made fiction from the history, but not by altering any facts. altering a vital piece of history means not giving a damn about the history, well that is certainly not acceptable to anyone now, is it? so i did not like this film at all. i am proud to be a Bangladeshi and i will protest anywhere the facts of my country is a victim.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the most cheap Indian film i've ever seen. In this movie they made fun with our freedom fighters. It means our martyred gave their life only for vain. About 3 million people died in this war. Indian army did what for us? They came at the end of the war for sake of peace keeping. Inside truth, they were only supporting themselves. Because if Pakistan divides into two pieces then it will be more easy for them to control or war between these divided countries. Don't make fun about our liberation war.\n\nBangladesh Liberation War.... ------------------------------ The Bangladesh Liberation War was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.\n\nThe war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (\"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias, engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.\n\nIndia entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre- emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defenses soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II."

        "review_title": "An Average Movie over-hyped to the point it being a Letdown.",
        "review_detailed_main": "GUNDAY is a crime film directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, starring Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irfan Khan in the lead roles.\n\nThe story revolves around two friends, Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) who are refugees who get involved in the coal business, eventually becoming Calcutta's biggest 'gundas'.\n\nThe marketing of Gunday was extremely good; the teaser, let alone the trailer, grabbed everyone's attention. The music was outstanding, the promos gave everyone the impression that the sizzling bromance between Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor could cause Gunday to be the next Sholay... or so we thought.\n\nGunday starts off with the characters' backstory, which later dissolves as we are introduced to the adult versions of Bikram and Bala. Initially meant to be a crime story, we are introduced to the romantic side of Gunday as Priyanka Chopra's Nandita enters into the plot. Nevertheless, the film is unable to have a solid plot, and so the first half of the film doesn't quite live up to it's potential. As we enter the second half of the film, it tries its best to live up to all the hype its created but, unfortunately, fails to do so. The very script, as well as its characters, needs quite a bit of polishing; it would have made it a great movie (and even a possible cult classic). You could say that the director wasted a huge amount of time in the first half and started to rather cram everything he wanted into the second half. However, by the end of the film, I wanted to love it so much but its blatantly obvious that the film is a waste of potential, considering it had GREAT music, GREAT performers as well as GREAT location backdrops.\n\nThe acting is first-class, to be honest. Ranveer Singh, is the best out of them all inspite of having Irfan Khan in the film. Singh handles his character with ease, and seems to be getting better with every film he does. Arjun Kapoor is great playing a gunda as well, however, he needs a bit of work in terms of emotions. Priyanka Chopra's role doesn't have much to it, therefore, its quite hard to judge whether she was necessary or not. Irfan Khan was great as usual. A special mention to the actors who play the young Bikram and Bala. They were fabulous and might just turn out to be splendid actors.\n\nThe music was just MINDBLOWING. Every song from 'Jashn-E-Ishqa', 'Tune Maari Entriyaan' and 'Aasalam-E-Ishqum' to 'Jiya', 'Saiyaan' and 'Mann Kunto Maula' are just great. However, one of the noticeable flaws in the film is the fact that the director kept cramming every song at every nook and corner. And to be quite honest, inspite of Jiya being a great song, its as unnecessary as 'Dil Tu Hi Bata' Krrish 3.\n\nThe dialogues are real good but its like Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobaara; no gangster ever cries out one-liners whenever he speaks. Nevertheless, both versions of Bikram and Bala say it with great macho that you actually quite enjoy it.\n\nThe one thing that actually does quite live up to its hype is the Ranveer-Arjun bromance. Its quite entertaining at it contributes to one of the reasons why some of the film's flaws are forgiven.\n\nIn conclusion, GUNDAY is over-hyped to make it seem like a must-watch Bollywood film, but in all honesty, its just a masala flick that's a great timepass, but by the time you realize that, you're so irritated at what a letdown the film actually is. If you want a great buddy film that has action, great one-liners, and some killer performances, then GUNDAY is your film. But don't go in expecting the best movie of the 2014 or a classic, because you are going to be extremely disappointed, just like I was.\n\nGUNDAY- 5/10"

It was a people war and we should honor people. Gunday should apologize for this, and they have no right to explain any thing as their own way. So far i understand, an anti Pakistani attitude is always work in Indian emotion, Its natural, But to prove an win against Pakistan, you can not avoid other hand, who was with you(Actually, you were with them). Indian Army worked their as a joint force. When you are working jointly you can con hijacked the success alone. Hope the director should understand it."

You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!

It's tremendously humiliating for us.\n\n3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in the film to be unintended. Therefore, do not only apologize to us BUT CORRECT the mistakes.\n\nThank you"

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your thought didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you."

Suppression- discrimination never be the sign of greatness but to say truth and give respect of others."

        "review_detailed_main": "The seed of the war of independence of Bangladesh was sown when the then east Pakistan and west Pakistan was made a single country only on the basis of religious similarity in spite of having a huge difference in culture, language and having a big country 'India' between the two lands. With the pace of time the situation worsened when west pakistanis tried to impose their own language and culture upon us and started to dominate us. And atlast when they found they can't control the bangalis any more they started killing them brutally on 25th march, 1971. The great Bangali nation took arms against the oppression and the war of independence started on 26th march, 1971. India joined the war after 9 months on 3rd December, 1971. We became independent on 16th of December that year. Of course the Indians helped our people by providing arms, training and shelter but it doesn't mean after this 42 years they would change the history of our country and ignore the sacrifices of our 30 lakhs martyred souls. I strongly protest such insult to our country and would urge the 'Gunday' team to take corrective measures or at least apologize formally."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bangladeshis across the world, mostly youth -- have reacted furiously to new Bollywood film \"Gunday\" -- directed by Ali Abbas Zafar -- after it was found out that the film misrepresented the birth of Bangladesh as a result of an \"India-Pakistan War\", and undermined Bangladeshis in its storyline. Connected and unified through social networks, youths have been pressing Yash Raj Films -- one of the most illustrious production houses in the industry, that is behind the film -- to remove that part and apologies for tweaking history. Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals. There's also insinuation that Bangladeshis prefer identifying themselves as Indians. As the news spread over Facebook, Bangladeshi youth strongly condemned the matter, and shortly after, organized an online campaign, sending petitions to the films production house, and bringing the matter to notice of everyone on the Internet. The campaign plan includes e-mailing a protest letter to Yash Raj's official account, their vice president, as well as flooding the social media presences of the production house, and the film, on Facebook . The message politely and cordially addresses the Yash Raj authority, summarily pointing out that India joined Bangladesh's War of Liberation on December 3, 1971, whereas the war has been going on since March, and three million people were martyred. It also addresses the undermining of Bangladeshis in the story, and asks for an apology and change in certain parts of the film. A social campaign is also underway on micro-boggling platform Twitter, with the hash tag #GundayHumiliatedHistoryOfBangladesh. Although there has been no official response from Yash Raj Films, the film's producer Aditya Chopra or director Ali Abbas Zafar on the issue, synopses of the film online have been edited to mention that Bangladesh was born after the war of 1971, and the film's Wikipedia page very cautiously mentions there might be scope for a 'misunderstanding' regarding the historic facts. This may not have been the first time Bangladesh has been looked down on or portrayed negatively in a film overseas, but the youth of the country, fully aware of the power of the connectivity of social media and getting its patriotic voice heard -- driven as a result of an 'awakening of spirits' last year -- have made sure the matter does not go unnoticed."

Similarly, this terrible film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several sights. It depicted that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war when in reality; they had been fighting for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!"

The story also humiliates Bangladeshis in several scenes. They showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war of 1971. It is a real shame not to know the history and try to sell misinformation by a film. Indians may buy it but Bangladeshis will strongly protest. YASHRAJ FILMS should correct the mistakes and apologise to Bangladesh."

Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspects. They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this."

You can say it was an attempt from a \"big\" production house to make a movie. But the video failed from the very beginning when it tried to twist the history of a nation's independence i.e. Bangladesh's glorious history.Just because you are one of the biggest production house in a country, it doesn't allow you to twist any country's history. I watched the whole video, just to make sure if there were any further references to Our(Bangladeshi) history. but believe me it was one of the painful experiences of my life. I had to skip a few parts for it was being too much for my nerves.\n\nLast of all , I would like the producers to change the controversial part and then release it. Or, if they are prudent enough, they should stop showing the movie for it will save them the humiliation of producing the worst \"attempt to make movie\"."
