Here at least there was a little bit of action, and of all the films, the ending was probably the best in my opinion. Of course, it's still bad. This whole series is bad for me, but I'm just saying that they didn't make it worse this time, they made it a little better. Probably a good ending for fans of the series, at least I hope there won't be another movie, and probably a very weak romance for the normal viewer. Without the previous films, all the worse. Unfortunately, to get anything out of it, you have to sit through the second part, which I think is especially bad compared to the first. To sum up.

October 6th I believe?). This was the first of the three films to disappoint me. Don't get me wrong...there are gorgeous lush lavish sets, a great soundtrack, lots of eye candy for both sexes, and well plenty of sex. What it didn't have, that the other two films did, was a plot and an ending. Nothing really happens in this film. Laura doesn't choose between Massimo and Nacho, her fashion business is left midway, Olga doesn't get married and Massimo never deals with the loss of their child.\n\nI felt like the first film roughly stayed true to book one, the second film veered off of the book fairly significantly...but it was kind of understandable in that they only have so much time to tell the story. I guess what I am saying is the second film still worked...I do feel like Laura comes off better in the films than she does in the books.\n\nWe start film three almost where film two left off, Massimo threatens Nacho's family for what they have done, Laura recovers and goes to work in her fashion house, Olga continues to plan her wedding, things are strained between Massimo and Laura because they haven't talked about her time with Nacho or the loss of their baby. Laura and Olga behave like their usual drunk, petulant selves that are never satisfied and Laura continues to dream about having sex with Nacho. That is pretty much the entire film...no plot and no progression of the storyline.\n\nMovies generally aren't a choose your own ending story but this one really leaves you hanging and for that I can't give it the high ratings that I have given the other films. It was sexy yes, Massimo and Nacho are both still major hotties...but I do grow weary of watching these two girls drink like lushes and behave like small children.\n\nI still would like to see more smoldering content, so to be encouraging I am giving this film a 7 star rating."

There weren't as many pointless scenes and there were a couple 3-minute windows in which the acting was actually passable.

But there is a story of friendship and showing you would do anything for those you love. There is a love triangle and the battle of what the heart truly wants. If you knew this kind of story wasn't your cup of tea, then don't watch it. Discrediting the directors, writers, and actors is unkind just because you don't like the plot. It was beautifully done."

Pun intended. This movie at least has a story, while not that good. It is paced and shot very well, so I will give it that. The relationships that are supposed to be the drive of these movies, are completely unrealistic and poorly done. Why anyone would be interested in a crazy nut-job like Massimo is beyond me. The actor always looks angry... all the time. The two leads have no chemistry, they just growl at each other. This new love interest that was brought in the last movie, is more present here, and while their relationship is still bad, it is much better than the one with Massimo.\n\nLike the previous film, this movie is like 70% music, 10% sex and 20% everything else. I don't know why they don't just have a well done conversation between two characters, instead of playing some pointless song over the top of it. Are Netflix getting a ton of money from these songs?\n\nDespite all the bad, I will give one good pointer to Anna-Maria Sieklucka. For the most part, her acting has been, average, but there is a scene towards the end of the movie, where she breaks down, and I have to admit, her performance was really good. This shocked me, as I was not expecting it. So, well done to the actress for that.\n\nAgain, these series of movies, delivers another bad movie, that could have been good with good writers. The Next 365 Days, is not a good movie, and I doubt any future installments will be either.\n\n3/10 - only because of the cinematography and Anna's acting in the last 30 minuets or so."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a die hard romantic and 365 days was shocking in its explicit content but I loved it regardless. People tend to forget that Mossimo had a NDE with Laura as his soul mate and that he isn't just some psycho kidnapper. The chemistry between the two was powerful in my opinion and both characters had room for character growth, so I was excited for the next two movies (I hadn't read the books so I had a completely different plot in mind apparently). Laura was shallow, bored, empty and unfulfilled. Mossimo was hard, lonely, sexually violent, and had the tragic loss of his father and by association his brother he needed to face. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the second movie which addressed none of these issues in either character. Mossimo's refusal to open up and/or face his past and Laura's emotional and selfish immaturity stunted the romantic bond and natural evolution of their relationship. Instead of speaking to Mossimo our Laura threw out her phone and ran away from the situation entirely. I could overlook her misunderstanding considering Mossimo's lack of candor regarding his brother. Still, she was married and \"in love\" but somehow moved on immediately which destroyed the efforts of the 1st movie completely. Add in the lack of chemistry and romantic development between Laura and Nacho and the entire film felt wrong. Granted she didn't actually do anything wrong but a few uncomfortable to watch wet dreams and Nacho is hot so okay, not my favorite but whatever we have one more movie. Now we have finally reached the final film and I am left feeling empty and deceived. The entire relationship between Laura and Mossimo was a lie, everything that brought them together was meaningless. Laura's infidelity and narcissism, her total lack of growth or substance of character made me wonder why this story was ever written and adapted at all. Mossimo now has the loss of his child, his wife's with another man mentally and emotionally and eventually physically, and he never faced his previous issues and you have a time bomb. Laura is the wrong woman for him and for herself, she needs to be alone in my opinion. Laura acts as if she has some deep seated daddy issues I think and doesn't need to be in a relationship with anyone. The compulsory addition of the gay sexual fantasy was thrown in because Netflix can't make a SINGLE adaptation of anything without shoving every kind of political agenda down our throats. To say I am disappointed in this film is an understatement but the I am more disappointed in the author and Netflix's personal interference. P. S. Netflix grow up and stop destroying beloved classics like \"The Wheel of Time,\" and \"Persuasion\". I just can't find anything romantic or worth while in this series. Like the other reviewers say I suppose the author was okay with her series being nothing but smutt. The complete disregard for plot, character development, integrity, and romance by this author (and Netflix) makes this series another nothing burger and a travesty to the romance genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "365 Days: This Day was the worst film released this year. At least, that's what I thought. After watching its sequel, The Next 365 Days, I believe that's the worst film released this year. My only question is why. Why does Netflix keep greenlighting these films, and who is watching them? As a connoisseur of terrible cinema, the 365 days franchise is easily that; Terrible Cinema. I can't think of many films that are worse than these. This has to be the worst trilogy ever created.\n\nInstead of giving this film more credit than it deserves, I will say ten things more enjoyable.\n\n(1)There's more enjoyment sticking toothpicks between your toes and kicking the wall. (2)There is more enjoyment in watching Ohio State win in any sporting event. (3) There's more enjoyment in burning your hand on the stove. (4) There's more enjoyment in getting food poisoning. (5) There's more enjoyment in giving yourself paper cuts between all your toes and fingers. (6) There's more enjoyment in suffering electrocution. (7) There is more enjoyment in being on a cruise ship sinking in the ocean. (8) There's more enjoyment in cleaning a circus porta potty. (9) There's more enjoyment in touching an electric fence. (10) Finally, there's more enjoyment in having your essay deleted before you finish writing it. This movie is like a day at Chesaning High School. The higher-ups are clueless about everything and try to suck the fun out of every possible moment. A bunch of stupid nonsense. Oh yeah, the movie sucks as well.\n\n0/10 A complete waste of space and a contender for the worst film ever created."

The two female actors make it look so cheap as if it wasn't enough. Seriously, this is a waste of time and if you want to make yourselves a favor, watch something else. Spoiler alert: there is a sex scene almost every six or seven minutes. Like who wants to see so much porn in a movie?"

The 2nd movie is basically a porn with music in background, no dialogue, and even if there is one, it's meaningless.

Hot, raw and on point. Whew Lawd!! This one? You get poorly simulated movements with Lara and whichever dude she was dreaming about then Massimo and Nacho making out in one of them? So her dilemma is which dude do I choose, or do they choose them? I heard one of those old game show \"you're a loser\" sounds going off: wuah wuah wuaaaaaah. Step it up for what is hopefully the last year of these poor people's life! My God this is the NEXT365 and look at all they've been through.

I could not be more disappointed.\n\nPERIOD !"

Across the whole run time, I think there's less sex than usual - that's not to say there isn't sex, there's plenty, but it seemed slightly less constant.\n\nThe only pluses, albeit very minor ones, I have are basically the same as before: it uses decent music and has some solid shots spattered in there. They remain pointless in their existence and very much overstay their welcome, yet I kinda couldn't not watch them.\n\nWhat are the odds on more sequels? There is no reason to continue the 'story', yet that hasn't exactly stopped Netflix before... has it? This one does end with something that feels like a final conclusion though, with no cliffhanger in sight, so we'll see."

All the pieces fit well with the picture. Surely, there are some annoying characters and unnecessary parts. As a result, the whole story could be squeezed in about 30 minutes time span.\n\nThe movie made my wife horny, so yeah... it does work after all."

Instead of wrapping things up, it feels like the film just stops abruptly. This lack of resolution makes the whole experience frustrating and unsatisfying. Overall, it's a complete waste of time and fails to deliver any meaningful or coherent storyline. The characters lack depth and their relationships are underdeveloped, which only adds to the confusion."

And also I am talking about the first movie and the second one ... and the cliffhangers they had. Of course I reckon those who have read the books might have known that already. I did not even know there existed books ... at least not when I first saw the ... first movie.\n\nBack then the movie was notorious - infamous even, for its sex scenes. Nudity is one thing, but the first movie was borderline porn. As some pointed out back then, there were even frames that were showing ... more than others. Which began with an oral scene on a plane. If that wet your appetite (no pun intended), by all means be my guest and watch the first movie. I reckon it was the best one, with a beauty and the beast meets 50 shades of Grey thing.\n\nOf course it ended on a note where we didn't know what would happen with our female lead ... something that the second movie did too. Damn those movies should be called Die Hard ... will the third one end on a cliffhanger too? Or will it have a final resolution ... to bring it home? No pun intended.\n\nOne thing is for sure: please stop complaining about these movies after you've seen them - and then telling everyone they should stop making them. The more you watch, the likelier it is that there will be more of this ... although I am not even sure if there is a fourth book? Not that this would stop anyone from making another movie - they are succesful, no matter what the rating says here. And I am proof of that too.\n\nI do watch a lot though, so what is your excuse? The nudity? The being able to talk about it after? Maybe you just like to watch machos doing their thing ... a woman playing many sides ... but still being cliche as ... well the f word that is happening a lot here too! Even though the doctor apparently is saying not to have intercourse ... well I guess if you are horny ... but what really makes her wet? By the way if you feel uncomfortable reading what I am writing, wait til you see what is in the movie.\n\nNot as explicit as the first one, but still a lot of naked bodies rubbing and pushing and pumping and ... well you get the picture - no pun intended. The story may be the weakest of them all, but at least it does concentrate on the three main characters we established ... even the (hot) mother is being sidetracked.\n\nThis could be the end - but as a character says: she will do what she wants to do - it's up to her (no pun or innuendo intended)"

The same thing could be done in 90 minutes (or less).\n\nI liked it in the previous films, that all sex scenes were steamy hot and very realistic. I thought those were the highlights of the movies. But in this one, I felt even the sex scenes were spared out. Only one of those were on the same level as the scenes of the previous movies. The plot is really not so well written to draw more attention to that, I think it is sort of a harakiri for an erotic movie to try and sell itself with a poorly written script instead of hot sex scenes.\n\nSeeing the ending I felt very annoyed that the story is left open, so one more film is yet to come. I think 365 has been already overused, even the third movie can be barely called interesting (or hot)."

Alongside this, the lighting, locations, and costumes are nice like the predecessors, but that does not make the movie good in any way. The movie struggles with almost every single element, both narratively and technically, making it difficult to enjoy.
