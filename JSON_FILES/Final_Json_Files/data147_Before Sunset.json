        "review_detailed_main": "\"Before Sunrise\" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.\n\nHere it is now, the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen, \"Before Sunset\" - made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed, but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. \"Before Sunset\" takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that \"Before Sunset\" might give answers to questions that shouldn't be answered in the first place. If \"Before Sunrise\" was a dream that two young people had, then this movie could only be the rude awakening, the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It's a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see, however, is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday, they have jobs and their future is more or less decided, but they're still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other, it's there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true: their feelings for each other. While they're talking it's like they turn back time and become the young, hopeful people they once were again. I'm getting a bit carried away, but that's the beauty of these two movies, \"Sunrise\" and \"Sunset\". The story sucks you in and you're not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.\n\nAnother thing \"Before Sunset\" did, it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously, I have gotten more cynical, because at times I was irritated by Celine's talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to \"bond\" with her character this time around.\n\nAnyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be, and thinking of Hawke's recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene - a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one, \"Before Sunset\" doesn't have a definite ending, though.\n\nIt's sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. \"Before Sunset\" has convinced me that it could work."

That first thing said, i have to recognize that i'm really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with \"Before Sunset\" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It's just a construction. It's just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn't felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It's the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.\n\nSo, i really recommend it, even if you didn't saw the first one."

It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says \"nothing that is complete breathes\", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.\n\nThe dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren't quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don't miss this film."

For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing back\u0085Exquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks."

Before Sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened, therefore if you decide to watch it Before watching \"Sunrise\" you have nothing to worry about.\n\nSome scenes are extremely well done. The characters are picture perfect, and the movie itself, is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular, that it will inspire young directors out there, to pick up their video cameras are start filming.\n\nAn 80 minute movie, about two lovable characters and what they have to say, may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset, will sweep this impression right off your feet.\n\nJulie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen, they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves, you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.\n\nJulie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely, has potential.\n\nEthan is also very very honest, he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie, and not a home-made video.\n\nBoth play with such honest expression, and such trueness, that they are so natural, Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment, that you never want to leave.\n\nBefore Sunset... 9.901/10*****"

This was a mentally bumpy ride for me.\n\nLike, did people actually talk like this in 2004, in prose with several random sexual plugs? Their dynamic has tension and chemistry, but what do they see in each other? Jesse is terribly cringy and un-charming, while both self-absorbed and self-deprecating. He had the grace of youth as the excuse in Before Sunrise. I was expecting he would mature in the 9 years before reencountering Celine, but nope! Celine is no saint either, lying directly to Jesse on occasion, but she has more likabilities. But maybe thats what this is all about: two flawed humans fall in lust. An imperfect love forms through space, time, and imagination.\n\nHow imagined or pure is the connection with someone you've spent about 24 hours in 10 years with? I guess we'll see in Before Midnight.."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.\n\nIn many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9,\" in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, Andr\u00e9 Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. \"Before Sunset\" is parallel in many ways.\n\nAt one level we have a romantic story -- two people who'd briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they'd started?\n\nAt another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.\n\nWhile Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the \"not-perfect-but-good-enough.\"\n\nThere are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, \"what would have happened if I'd pursued that relation?\" but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.\n\nThe film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.\n\nDelpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must've contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.\n\nGREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it's a great film."

Ethan Hawke is better, Julie Delpy is better, Richard Linklater is at his best.\n\nIt is outstanding to watch both Jesse and Ethan Hawke grow as a normal guy on a quest for happiness and an actor who has improved a lot since the first part, respectively. Julie Delpy's performance left me in awe in scenes where she describes her frustration with her sub-par love life, whereas 10 years ago her lines seemed emotionless and routine. Richard Linklater takes themes he would only touch superficially in the first part, and dives into them in the second part, much like how the characters are more callous and realize they have nothing to lose anymore.\n\nI must admit the first part did not impress me. I was enthralled by the excitement of the young adults' spontaneous romance in Vienna, but it all seemed so dreamy and stereotypical of how love should be. Well, I realize now that this is exactly what it was supposed to be. It was love in every meaning of the word: heightening, inspiring, and painful. It wasn't until I saw Before Sunset that all this dawned on me. The way Jesse and Celine look back at the time they shared 9 years ago, how beautiful their one night was together, how their lives have changed, and they contemplate what could have been, Linklater portrays not only a story of true love, but life in itself and it's never-ending series of ups and downs.\n\nI couldn't help but try to walk in Jesse's shoes in my own life 9 years down the road and wonder if I will make the same decisions. Is it inevitable that you wish you would have done things differently? Will ever I connect with someone the way Jesse and Celine do? Is it fair to measure happiness circumstantially? All these are questions Linklater makes us think about while witnessing a love that just doesn't \"fizzle out\"."

Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.\n\nIn any event, this is one of the few sequels that matches the intensity and integrity of the original. First, it has many simple, yet stylish and honest shots. Perhaps the Scorcese shot is used too much (i.e. following the actors on a long walk without cutting a la Goodfellas kitchen scene), but I don't think so because it makes sense in the context of the movie. Second, many of the shots have interesting emotive effect. For instance, towards the end of the movie, after these \"lovers\" are fighting the clock (because Ethan Hawke's character needs to catch a flight) and are cruising down the river, they are so engrossed in their conversation and the fact that they are trying to get so much out of the last few minutes they don't notice their ride is coming to an end. However, we the viewer can see what the characters either don't see or don't want to see, that the boat is crossing over the river to its destination and the departure no one wants to deal with. The viewer is given a wonderful sense of dread as the bank approaches in the background, because we know what is going to happen when the ride ends, and like the characters, we don't want it to end either. Even if the film borrows heavily from other great movies (e.g. My Dinner with Andre) it is independent of those influences.\n\nJulie Delpy and Ethan Hawke were great per usual. Making the dialogue ring true is difficult, but they pull it off. As before, they completely capture the nature of the intimate and friendly conversational style of friends or lovers that is normally edited out of most movies. When people talk, things are not always sequential or rationale, and unlike most movies this movie doesn't try and correct that. Not for a moment does the audience find themselves thinking that this is some sort of charade and no one would ever talk like that. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful, but that is because the characters are intelligent and have a knack for being brutally honest with their thoughts and feelings.\n\nThis is movie excellence, and I'm glad some film makers are still trying to make art. Despite the romantic themes this isn't a date flick, so be prepare to deal with the difficult and often unresolved issues of love and relationships that arise."

Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went through is just incredible. This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through. This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, \"Before Sunrise\", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of \"a certain age\", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment.\n\nI am 48 years old and have a wonderful romantic relationship with my husband. We are each other's first and only love. Even so, we have worked very hard to keep our marriage alive and mutually passionate. Over the past 25-30 years, both of us have noticed that satisfying relationships are very difficult once people hit their thirties and forties. We have noticed that many older couples never work out their differences and end up bitter and disappointed with life. Many acquaintances of our generation are divorced or still single, never having experienced the sweetness and stability of a true romantic and committed relationship. Romance can be found all the time, from fleeting moments to short-term relationships. One sees it all over the place nowadays, in TV shows and movies, as well as in most modern relationships. However, I would like to emphasize the lasting contentment that a loving commitment brings to one's soul. This is a rare and unique blessing that is missing from too many relationships nowadays, and I find this immeasurably sad. This is a classic movie (excellent story line and top of the line acting) which goes into my list of top romantic movies of all times."

        "review_title": "Charming but sophomoric",
        "review_detailed_main": "In Richard Linklater's charming Before Sunset, the highly praised sequel to his 1995 film Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), now married with a four-year old son, is in Paris on the last leg of a book tour. Celine (Julie Delpy), his partner from a short-lived romance nine years ago, shows up at a roundtable for his book signing and they pick up almost immediately where they left off. Jesse has eighty minutes before he has to leave to catch his plane and that is how long the movie lasts. They go for coffee and take a walk through Paris. They talk and talk, then talk some more. Without pausing to take a breath, as if fearful of a moment of silence, they engage in non-stop conversation about the world situation, the element of chance in their lives, the environment, relationships between men and women, and their memories of what actually occurred in Vienna.\n\nCeline talks about how unfulfilling her life has been and there is a sad undertone of remorse and regret for the things that might have been. Jesse complains about his unrewarding marriage but does not take responsibility for his lack of satisfaction or consider the commitments he made to his wife and son. In a strange sequence in a restaurant, they both light up cigarettes and blow smoke in each other's faces, a scene that is incongruous in light of Celine's passion for the environment. Does Linklater want to send a message to young viewers that smoking is romantic? One would have thought that in the intervening years, Mr. Linklater's characters would have acquired a reasonable degree of emotional maturity but such is not the case and all the sexual banter and philosophical posturing feels sophomoric.\n\nComparisons have been made to another film that consisted mainly of conversation, My Dinner with Andr\u00e9. That film was not only intellectually stimulating but emotionally satisfying, an experience that allowed us in the space of two hours to re-explore our own lives and rethink the way we see the universe. Before Sunset is not in the same league. Some are calling it \"breathless\", \"sweet\", \"smart\", and \"one of the supreme movie romances of the post-'80s era\", but to me it falls far short of those accolades. It is a well directed and well acted film with great picture-postcard shots of Paris (that carefully avoids the congestion and urban blight), some witty dialogue, and a very clever ending. What it lacks is an ability to communicate the unfathomable grace of love in a way that transcends banality."

        "review_detailed_main": "This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.\n\nThe tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance, and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion, this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end, but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into well-rounded adults, on the contrary in fact; the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains, and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.\n\nAmazingly enough, in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse; both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters, and have once again achieved a glove-like fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pent-up emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around, and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful, that's elementary, but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk, people chat away on mobile phones, walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.\n\nYou really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course, you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing; so what are you waiting for?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen the Before trilogy in the wrong order. Before Sunrise saw Jesse and Celine as two young travellers who meet on a train during a trip to Vienna and bond. They exchange little details about themselves and agree to meet up at the same place on a particular date.\n\nBefore Midnight released in 2013 is set almost 20 years after they have first met. They are now married, vacationing in Greece and have entered middle life and their relationships now show some cracks.\n\nBefore Sunset is therefore the filling of the sandwich. After 9 years, Jesse is travelling in Europe as part of a book tour. He again encounters Celine who has come looking for him in a Paris bookshop.\n\nWe find out that Jesse did turn up in Vienna but Celine could not has it was her grandmother's funeral. That event has somehow thrown both their fate in a different direction.\n\nOlder, wiser, with both having a career established. They still have much to look forward to but there is also now past regrets. Celine has had relationship failures and Jesse is married with a child but its not a happy marriage. Its clear that both carry a torch for each other and their initial encounter left deep marks.\n\nThe rest of the film is the couple walking in Paris or on a boat on the River Seine. We get to know a bit more about these characters as they fill the gap in between the years we last saw them.\n\nIts clear that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have a nice chemistry and comfortable with each other. They look like long lost lovers and of course they co-wrote the screenplay. Just look at Jesse's face when he finds out that Celine had lived in New York and worse he was also there at the same time.\n\nI do think that director Richard Linklater could had done more to show the beauty of Paris and to be honest the touristic element of Paris apart from Notre Dame. I have walked a similar route and taken a boat ride on the River Seine and the film could had done with the picture postcard scenes to break up the monotony of these two people walking and talking. Its kind of natural for Jesse who is after all a visitor to the city.\n\nThe conversation is interesting but not riveting. Its natural but does not flow again because the screenplay wants to unwrap its layers slowly and methodically.\n\nJesse is on a tight schedule as he has a plane to catch but its clear he does not want to leave her. We now know that there is more to their story and shall re-visit them again."

        "review_detailed_main": "A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.\n\nWhat really sickens me is the distorted view of reality depicted by these characters, who are obviously well thought of by the author and movie-makers. The way in which Celine and Jesse view the world is the view of spoiled Westerners who have no actual clue of reality, and criticize everyone else from their safe bubbles. Aside from the token concern for polluters, aren't they essentially mainly concerned with their own gratification?"

        "review_title": "what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here",
        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.\n\nLike Bergman's films, in particular Scenes From a Marriage (if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here), Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind, in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit, and Celine with her opinions on the world at large, family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection, it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy, to be certain, there would be no movie, but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna, and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened, and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart, functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres- Jessie is married and with a kid, but not very happy in it, and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship- but the singular, glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.\n\nLinklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties, even if it doesn't feel totally complete; I want to see how their story might end, however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life, aside from the practical-side of it all, yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This, plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors, as Hawke and Delpy, as to be expected, seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon, and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance, since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered, however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one, I still loved being around these two, who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about, almost shockingly similar (one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland), and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.\n\nIt ends ambiguous, maybe too ambiguous, as I found myself saying 'huh, what', but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film: one may take away something from this tale, or someone else another, but there it is, clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance, and proud of it, being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best."

Along the moments together, they realize that they are still in love for each other.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" is a delightful sequel of \"Before Sunrise\", which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful romances I have ever seen. The screenplay was written by Ethan Hawk, Julie Delpy and Richard Linklater and it is fantastic, with wonderful dialogs. It is also amazing the natural performances of Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy, who intensively live the characters of Jesse and Celine. It is impossible not liking this movie! The simple song sang by Julie Delpy is a great complement to this lovely fairy tale. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Antes do P\u00f4r-do-Sol\" (\"Before Sunset\")"

The film itself is beautifully shot, capturing the essence of Paris in a way that's both romantic and utterly realistic. The dialogue between Jesse and Celine is intense, filled with the kind of conversations you'd have with someone you deeply connect with, but not having seen 'Before Sunrise' first, I felt like I was missing a piece of the puzzle. Their chemistry is undeniable, and the way they talk about life, love, and what could have been is captivating, making me wish I knew what led them here.\n\nGiving 'Before Sunset' a 7/10 because, even out of context, it was a compelling watch. The natural flow of the conversation and the real-time unfolding of their afternoon together creates a unique cinematic experience. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the emotional depth and nuances of their relationship were somewhat lost on me. It's clear this reunion is charged with history and unresolved feelings, hinted at through their dialogue and shared glances, but without the foundation of their first encounter in 'Before Sunrise,' it felt like watching the middle of a movie. Still, it's made me curious enough to go back and watch the first film, to fully appreciate the depth of their connection."

The sequel Sunset movie re-unites them nine years later in Paris. During the nine year interval, much of the idealism they had as young adults has been been overtaken by the realism that comes with life disappointments experienced in the intervening years. The dialog in both movies is so compellingly real and so natural it borders on surreal. Its like being a fly on the wall. It doesn't seem like they're acting at all. The script was written by Director Linklater, and actors Delpy and Hawke. Any guy will fall in love with Celine. Thank you, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke for creating these two small movie masterpieces. Its a must see for all romantic souls. Best movie I've seen in years. 10 out of 10."

I really liked it, and made a resolution to see Before Sunset as soon as I could. It came on TV one day a few weeks later, and soon after became one of my favorite movies.\n\nTo start, these are two of the best, most human characters ever portrayed in a film. However, it doesn't hurt that they have all the dialogue they do to develop. For anyone wishing to see a movie that breaks outside Hollywood stereotypes (as well as crosses international borders), this is the best film for you to see. Every sentence Celine and Jesse speak makes you laugh or think. Also, the lack of music is very interesting. The only musical tidbits in the movie are Celine singing Jesse her song and the two of them listening to Nina Simone in Celine's apartment at the end.\n\nAh, the end. Just one more reason to love this movie. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (who collaboratively wrote the screenplay) left on an ambiguous note (just like the end of Jesse's book), a true test of whether the audience is a cynic, romantic or just not sure. After revealing their characters' naked beliefs, hopes and fears, they turn to the audience in the end for a beautiful twist.\n\nUnfortunately there are so many people who will think this film is boring, but all I ask is that you open your mind and just listen to the two of them speak. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

So please, if you haven't seen Before Sunrise, do not watch Before Sunset.\n\nThe atmosphere is so powerful, in the movie, and between the movie and me. Sometimes I felt like I knew Jesse and Celine in person, but more often I felt I was one of them. It's not about whether I am a guy or a gal or a European or an American or any identity. The characters somehow caught a part of me, a deep part. I could almost feel what they felt. This is the most successful component of this movie.\n\nThey were young and less experienced. They, I mean all of them, on the screen, behind the screen. Now, after 9 years, they came back together and produced a much richer film. Before Sunrise was a bit like a traveling movie for me. They walked from place to place. It was like that the director wanted to introduce Vienna to viewers. Jesse and Celine talked about their values of life and love on the basis of their ideals. In Before Sunset, they talked about similar issues again but on the basis of their own personal histories. It was so touching! This time, they didn't walk as many places as 9 years ago. They were not tourists anymore. They were much more certain about their journey.\n\nThe performances of both actors were excellent! I mean, it was like they were talking to me. They acted with their eyes and body. It was so attractive that I didn't care where they walked. I was really into their conversation and their reaction to each other. The story went along with the words they said. Because of their great acting, I did not feel any dryness of this movie.\n\n\"Everyone is independent. Nothing is forever.\"----This is what I got out of Before Sunrise. And I think it also is the ideal of the young Jesse and Celine.---- They went on their own life without each other and realized something could be forever and they were not as independent as they thought they were. People can live by themselves, feeding themselves and entertaining themselves. However, people cannot just live like that. People depend on others in terms of caring and love, even though the person who loves you is physically far away from you. Jesse and Celine were independent of each other during the past 9 years but also dependent on each other mentally. Apparently, memory is the most reliable thing you can hold on to and deeply dwell in. Beautiful, isn't it?\n\nI also love the endings of both movies. The story still goes on in my head. There is no \"the end\". I wish them happy as a way to wish myself happy."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's 9 years after the events of 'Before Sunrise'. American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is in Paris on a book tour after writing about that night with C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) in Vienna. He's coy to the reporters about that night. C\u00e9line shows up and they restart the conversation while he waits for his flight later that night. She reveals that she didn't make their planned meeting due to her grandmother's funeral. He reveals that he did return for the meeting. He's married with a son. She has a photojournalist boyfriend who is away. The conversation fluctuates between breezy and deeper material until personal truths start to be spilled.\n\nRichard Linklater has hit on something compelling by returning to the same characters years later. It's casual and improvisational-like. Hawke and Delpy still have the same chemistry but more adult. It's deeper. There is an addition to the material by being a sequel. It's more than repetition. It's a sweet return of old friends."

        "review_detailed_main": "(Just mild spoiler at the end) At first I thought \"Before Sunrise\" is best to never have a sequel and left the ending open to audience's imagination. However, the director, his cast, and his team prove that they can do it. \"Before Sunset\" is simply the perfect sequel to one of the most beautiful film I've ever seen.\n\nThe characters that I love so much are still themselves. They've grown, gone through good and bad times in life, but they are still the same two people we saw in Before Sunrise. The acting and the dialog is so real. It even makes you think of your own life, think of the love that has come and gone, the opportunities you've blown. However, love is still there. This film shows very well that no matter how you've blown your chances, the love in your heart doesn't go anywhere. It's just there.\n\nI like the heartbreak moment in this film. It makes you feel sadder than watching the first one, when the two were just young, honest, and romantic people that fell in love. I think Before Sunset makes it more real to life that the two people become more bitter by age and life experience.\n\nThe ending is a bit too abrupt, but I like it anyway. I like the way it doesn't give you a conclusion. You can think for yourself about how this two will turn out.\n\nNow I will go and buy the DVD. This is definitely something to treasure."

Acting by Hawke and Delpy is so artificial, these people couldn't have been lovers in a million years. you can feel 0 chemistry between them and the whole movie you just have a feeling of 2 bad actors pretending they once meant something to each other, with an attempt to cover it with a series of really, really boring stories and \"oh were having so much fun together laughing to our silly jokes\" type of talk.\n\ni again, do not know how is it possible for a movie so shitty to get so many good reviews. something ain't right here."

        "review_detailed_main": "Thanks goodness I'm watching this on DVD (though missing out on the chance of experiencing this on the big screen) and can almost watch it immediately after watching the original. Well I could have, but I'd like to let Before Sunrise sink it a bit, before finding out how my favourite lovebirds continue with their next encounter in this sequel, filmed some nine years later, which is a very, very long time to wait for a sequel to be made.\n\nI guess the length of time in between the making of the movies helped to bring about certain gravitas to the characters played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, in that they truly age physically, no two ways about that, and along with the physical age, come the emotional baggage and history they have built over the years. You can see it in their eyes, no longer the optimistic young adults, full of enthusiasm and hope, and all those replaced by a weary sense of worldliness, with chiseled looks and skinnier frames. I think Celine was more beautiful nine years ago, and am ruing the loss of baby fat, haha!\n\nAnyway I digress. For those who are left at the cliffhanger from Before Sunrise, you'll be pleased that what happened after, and what specifically happened that night, will be revealed in this movie, though the story teases you in not having it revealed in its entirety, toying with you with coy and playfulness, just as how the characters interact then and now. In Before Sunset, we are nine years from the last meeting of Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke, with a last name to his character) and Celine (Julie Delpy), and he's now a published writer making his whirlwind book promotion in Europe. They meet in a bookstore in Paris, which takes over Vienna, and now have to spend, in almost real time, a very limited late afternoon evening together reminiscing and catching up, before Jesse's scheduled flight home to the USofA.\n\nThe narrative style has also matured together with the ease with which the actors play their respective characters. You''ll notice the increase in the number of long, uninterrupted takes and dialogues, and sometimes wonder, it'll be a pain to flub your lines. Perhaps it's also because having Hawke and Delpy co-write the screenplay, they were able to inject material drawn from personal experiences to breathe life into their roles. Therefore their lines come across so naturally, you can't help but to start casting this voyeuristic look upon Jesse and Celine as you eagerly await their sharing of their lives from that moment in time, until now - their careers, their families, and the perennial what ifs, and there are many.\n\nI don't have a particular moment which I loved, unlike the previous movie, but there are certain dialogue discussed, especially during the limo ride, which struck a chord in me. Perhaps even made me understand my past relationships a little more, though regretting certain things I sure have. It made me wonder, if that was exactly how another felt, and if so, how stupid I was to have not understood, Then again, if I had, then things would be different now, wouldn't it?\n\nI'd say it again, that the movie was made enjoyable by the two main leads portrayal of lovers who can be exactly you or me, and of the fantastic conversational pieces that they have, be it flirting with each other, or discussion of serious issues. Wonderful, wonderful chemistry between them, and for fans of Delpy, you'll be glad to know that she composed and contributed 3 songs to the movie, one of which is worked into the plot, and performed on screen. I like.\n\nI liked the way it started, as if what happened in Before Sunrise was something from memory, from imagination, from the past retold in a novel. And depending on your mood, I'd like the way it ended - in a manner which could swing either way, depending on your personality, and the degree of romanticism which you have at that point. In the end, I too was made to reminisce about the one who got away, and regretting it big time. And it does make me wonder, what will happen if I chance upon her some years down the road too (I think it has now been 5?), how exactly we would react, and how we would have a conversation, if ever, during that chance meeting.\n\nTo truly appreciate this movie, watch Before Sunrise first. Better yet, watch both movies back to back, it'll clock in about 181 minutes, which should breeze by given the compelling dialogue and excellent chemistry. I know I will, sometime soon!\n\nThere's a slight improvement in the WB Code 3 DVD in that it contains a making-of feature called On The Set of Before Sunset. There are interviews with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, as well as director Richard Linklater. You can see how many crew were needed to film the seemingly simplest of scenes, and listen to how they collaborated across continents before finally getting together to shoot the movie. One gripe though, is that this segment lasts only 9 minutes and 40 secs long, and ends so abruptly, you'll not believe that it had finished.\n\nAs usual, the audio and visual transfers are great, and you have a choice of languages in English Dolby Surround 5.1, or Portugese Dolby Surround Stereo. Another extra is the theatrical trailer, and a host of subtitles available in many languages."

Celine appears to shrug it off but, no matter how hard she tries, it comes out that her life has also been affected. The entire film is a conversation between the two that says so much. I know the century is young, but this is definitely one of the best films so far.\n\nDirector Richard Linklater (screenplay/story) , Julie Delpy(screenplay) , Ethan Hawke (screenplay) , and Kim Krizan (story) have written a wonderful film that will stand the test of time."

By replacing cranks with philosophizing adults, he was able to create \"Before Sunrise\". A brilliant film that relies almost entirely on a single conversation. He then gave us this film, again utilizing that dense, brilliant script... but giving us the twist of the same two people meeting nine years later, without any contact in between. So clever, executed so well."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunrise was a beautiful movie that catered to a romantic ideal: Jesse and Celine share a single day together, conversation flows like wine, and it all ends far to abruptly to ever know if the love was real, or merely a figment of their own hopes. Jesse is the heart-broken cynic, Celine the romantic in search of a pair. It is one of the best examples of young love ever put on screen. At the end of the first movie, you are left on your own to decide their fates.\n\nThis is precisely why I never wanted there to be a sequel. It was a perfectly ambiguous movie, and the way you interpreted their future was just a reflection of your own cynicism or romantic nature. Yet Linklater decided to answer the question for us in perhaps the most beautiful way possible. For anyone who saw Sunrise when it first came out, nine years of their own lives have now passed, along with the actors. How has the passage of time affected not only the viewers' interpretations, but also the actors?\n\nThis time around, Hawke plays the romantic. For nine years he has hoped and dreamed of meeting up with Celine. Conversely, for Delpy her romanticism was snuffed out the day she should have met up in Vienna. What Linklater has done is essentially recreate the entire first story all over again, only this time it's from the perspective of a 30-something. The details that got in the way of their first affair: distance, fear, uncertainty -- have been replaced with the more practical (but more serious) details of marriage, children, responsibility.\n\nIf they could just go back to that point in time knowing what they know now, it would be so simple -- of course they'd get together. But life isn't that easy. Linklater has again given them a chance at true, perfect love, this time with the complications of mature adults. They both recognize how special their relationship is, but the sacrifices they would have to make to be together now have far more serious consequences. Is it worth the risk? The ending is again ambiguous -- perhaps Linklater will fill us in on the details in another 9 years.\n\nNote: while Before Sunset does reference Before Sunrise in occasional flashback blips, you really should see the original first. If you have the time, you might try waiting a few years before watching the sequel to truly appreciate it -- though this isn't completely necessary."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has a lot of things going for it: the acting feels realistic, especially at the beginning, when the characters meet and feel awkward after so many years apart. The conversations they have are interesting and character-revealing, and you wish you could join in. Some of the transitions between topics are clumsy--I heard that the director and actors improvised the script, so I guess they weren't able to connect some of the ideas they had on different days. But the dialogue still has more depth than most, and if you liked \"Before Sunrise\", you'll enjoy finding out what happened to C\u00e9line and Jesse.\n\nHowever, in spite of its virtues, I thought the film was really lacking something, and I think it was a topic outside of the two main characters. The first film always had as a subtext the idea of travel, and the transient experiences travelers have. This film behaves as though these two people are the most fascinating in the world, and the camera stays tightly on them, barely showing any of the Paris scenery. There are some interactions with other people at the beginning of the film, but that's it. It ended up making me feel that Celine and Jesse had become very self-involved--more so than when they were younger.\n\nIn pettier complaints, I kind of wish they hadn't explained some of the mysteries of the first movie, especially with the \"she says no when she means yes\" attitude. I also hated the part where C\u00e9line says \"it's a woman thing,\" to explain why she lied about something. Sorry, but I don't tell lies like that.\n\nA nice bonus is getting to hear Julie Delpy play the guitar and sing--I just wish I had gotten to hear the song about her cat!"

The flow of the movie was of calm river undisturbed by external things. I felt a sense of relaxation while I watched the movie. We get to see Paris and how when you spend more time with each other your inner feelings tumble out. Is it not strange one is able to connect to somebody 9 years later without much inhibitions?

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I went to see Before Sunrise at its June 26, 2004 Austin Premiere last night I read the reviews written here at imdb.com to get an idea of what to expect. However none of the reviews prepared me for the excellence of this movie.\n\nAs you probably already know, the entire movie is basically of one conversation between two people who (at least seemed to) fall in love nine years previously but had not seen one another again until this day having relied on one date for another rendezvous in Venice -- and having failed to exchange phone numbers, addresses, etc.\n\nFirst of all, the acting was nothing less than excellent, lacking self-consciousness and \"over the top\" theatricality. Much credit for this I'm sure goes to Rick Linklater, the Director, who told us last night after the screening that it was very important to him that it not \"get dramatic.\" Ah...a fine director, is like fine wine, no? Bravisimo!\n\nBy the way, I also learned at the Q&A last night -- which was with Richard Linklater and the two stars, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy -- and was fascinated to learn that ALL THREE OF THEM wrote this script. To me, that helps to explain how the script could have come out so profoundly well -- full of meaningful insights, questions that are asked by hearts with a bottom line of love and warmth.\n\nWhat I am going to say next is something I have said before about BOOKS, but never about MOVIES -- not for the same reason. That is, I want to see this movie again -- and again -- and again so that I won't miss a line. There is so much to think about and care about among the topics discussed -- about love and life and the world we live in. Some of the things expressed were so interesting to me that I found my own mind running off with a thread of thought for a few moments after hearing what was said. It was just so stimulating. But then I would have to force myself to drop the thought in order to put my attention back to what they were saying lest I miss out on yet another pearl of humor, enjoyment, wisdom, riddle or profundity. I tried hard, but for me hearing ALL of it in one showing could just not be done. I will have to seen the movie again and again until I feel satisfied I have eeked the \"last drop.\" And NO, I am not implying that the ending is a letdown; in my opinion it is a delightful ending and I hope-hope-hope that in another 7-8 years these collaborators will get together to write us another script. I want them to wait that long before writing it though, so that they can bring ever more wisdom and maturity to each sequel.\n\nThank you, Rick; thank you, Julie; thank you, Ethan! How REFRESHING and NEEDED it is in our world today to have MEANINGFUL entertainment where the bottom line is where it should be -- for and about thinking and caring human beings. And by the way, Julie and Ethan have noticeably aged; Julie is (indeed) thinner and more mature, a fascinating natural beauty with that sexy French accent; Ethan's resemblance to Tom Cruise startles me. Yet there is another dimension to Ethan and I hope I don't make anyone angry to say I also prefer his acting over the former's. I very, very, very rarely pay full retail price for my own VHS or DVD of a film. I can't wait to buy this one and I look forward to watching it again with happy anticipation.\n\n10 Stars!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie \"Before Sunrise\". They show the flashbacks of \"Before Sunrise\" and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is \"tre magnifique\". She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."

As we instantly got in love with it, we ran to Blockbuster the next day to get the \"Before Sunset\". What i must say is that are few valuable words to rate these films. Because this is about feelings. About that \"one in a lifetime love passion\" we once had, or we luckily are having, or yet, we wish we had had. Everything is perfect, Julie Delpy as Celine, Ethan Hawke as Jesse, Richard Linklater the director, the cleverest dialogs in movie history, the less known sites of Viena first, Paris after, etc, etc. Everything so \"real live\", \"real people\" that we viewers, become Jesse and Celine! They are us! We are them! Or we wanted to be... There were great love movies and there will be made great movies in the future, that's for sure. But these two will remain forever in my short top ten ranking. If you miss \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" you will never forgive yourselves! We get to the end of the movies, seeing the credits with a big and happy smile in our face. Next days later we search on the net more stories about \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\", the complicity with that young and then, 9 years older nice couple, grows and grows. And then we are addicted with these movies, and then we watch them again, and again... \"Baby, you are gonna miss that plane\" says Celine to an enchanted Jesse in the end. Was really the end?..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The two movies happened to me. I say happened to me because watching them was like going through an experience. Also because i chanced upon them each time. I had seen 'Before Sunrise' years ago when surfing through the channels i had stopped catching something interesting in the way Ethan Hawk was looking at July. It was the scene when they first meet on the train. I enjoyed the film and remembered it as one remembers distant but good memories. Years later in college a friend of mine saw Before Sunset and was raving about it. I said I had seen the film thinking that he was talking about Before Sunrise. It took me a while to realize that a sequel had been made of the film. And this time, it was a revelation.\n\nYes the film can stand alone as a story, but it would be a shame not to watch the prequel before watching this one. Brilliant acting and dialogs coupled with a most plausible situation that could be a day out of any body's life. Here I am talking about the start of the day. Unexpected meeting with a past. Something that had meant a lot. Which still probably means a lot. But would you acknowledge it immediately? Would you not want to find out if there was still any hope left? I would. And that is why I love this film. It gives you hope that chances missed due to bad luck, or pure bad judgment could still be had again. The idea is romantic and the presentation is probably the most mature presentation of it. This very fact saves the film from being sappy or overly romantic. The dialogs, the interplay, the advances are all so real and so well thought out that it must take a pair of extremely gifted actors to play well. Our actors do that and still manage to keep the proceedings interesting. It must require extraordinary skill and chemistry. Awards do not matter here i think as the film has been made out of pure creative urge. Just the fact that such a captivating yet subtle film exists must be a triumph for everyone involved. And a memorable experience for the viewer given he watches it at the right point in life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just sublime in \"Before Sunset\", the sequel to their 1994's \"Before Sunrise\". Essentially, it's a movie about nothing -- the two of them see each other for the first time after nine years and just walk and talk; yet, at the same time, it's about everything and anything we truly care, desire, and hope for in life. It's about love, our perception of it, our yearning to attain it, and our disappointments for our inability to put a grasp on it. Nine years later, we see clearly the signs of dissatisfaction and disappointments on their faces. Frustrated with the banality of life, yet imprisoned by the vast responsibilities to themselves and the ones they love to endure its miseries, the two of them are no longer as hopeful, nor as romantic about life and love, like they were nine years ago. There is less dreaming this time, more about reality, more about the pains experienced and the compromises made in life. There are also regrets, regrets about this lost love, and tears, tears held back in their eyes wondering what could've been. But the sparks and longings they saw and felt long ago were still palpable, just like they were the night they first met. By the end of the film, it's clear that not all is lost, their love is buried some where deep down in their hearts, cherished by their memories of that one encounter almost a decade ago. And for us, it's always comforting to know that perhaps, just perhaps, their love could eventually prevail, for after all, we are all hopeless romantics struggling to live a life of love and dream."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unfolding almost in real-time, this is a story about another chance for love that was once lost. Set nine years after they first met, Jesse and Celine find themselves older and wiser and still crazy about each other. They meet in a bookstore where Jesse is on tour for his best-selling novel which, incidentally, is a transcript of their magical night in Vienna long ago. He needs to leave for the airport soon and they have just about an hour to spend with each other in Paris. This film is going down in movie history for me as one in my all-time top ten favorite romantic films. It is even better than its 1995 prequel, which was already magnificent in itself. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their two characters are even more real than when they were first introduced all those years ago. Their love for each other just bounces off the screen. This is terribly remarkable film-making. The immediate sequences are a direct metaphor to the urgency of their situation, how little time they have. It is beautiful. I can't even spot the longest shot. It must have taken a real effort for those two actors to pull off these great performances, long dialogues and all. The best part about this film is that it can be seen as a stand-alone. You don't have to have already seen Before Sunrise. Watch it and I swear you won't regret it.\n\nhttp://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews"

        "review_title": "Intimate Sequel",
        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't see Before Sunrise. I think I should just come out and say that. I have been told that it adds an extra layer to the sequel and I have no doubts. It almost seems unfair for me to judge a movie this intimate without having seen its prequel. But on that note, it is impressive that the second half of this story could move me so. It's nothing more than one long conversation, probably a kin to ones that I have myself everyday. Yet there is something else here. There is something that is entirely relatable here yet still far enough out of our reach that we are sucked into the film because we want to know that magic that exists only in movies.\n\nThe story starts with a book signing. Jesse (Ethan Hawke), the author of a novel about a women he met once upon a yesterday and never saw again, is at the final stop of his tour of Europe here in Paris. This is the only part of the movie where he is alone and he sets the stage for what is about to come. He delivers a monologue to the press about a story he wishes to write about a moment that turns into another moment and that morphs into yet another and so on. He is basically describing what is to take place for the next hour. He spys a woman in the corner. He spys Celine (Julie Delpy) in the corner. After he wraps it up, they begin to talk. And they don't stop. Occasionally they travel to a new location be it a caf\u00e9 or a park. Topics flow into each other \u0096 just as Jesse told us they would.\n\nHow do you write a conversation specific to two people yet understandable to anyone? Even after seeing the film I honestly cannot tell you. There is something beyond chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. That has been transformed from life to the page by these two. The co-authored the film. In a time of adaptations from every medium possible, it is hard to pick out original screenplays that stand strong and defend their category. Before Sunset is one of those rare scripts that does. The writing is the strongest part here.\n\nThis is essentially Delpy and Hawke's two man show. There is no one else of importance. They are rarely separate, even sharing the shot most of the time. They wrote the film, they star in it and for all anyone can tell, they were the only ones involved. The direction is so minimal that it is virtually non-existent. And there in lies the genius but it's funny how one simplicity can overshadow another.\n\nBefore Sunset is emotional provocative in the most subtle way. Were the sun to actually set in the background, you would never notice the difference. The film is shot in real time and so the sunset would sneak up on you the way the film does. One minute there's a sun and then before you know it the sky is pink and you realize you care whether or not they end up together when it seems only minutes ago they were just two people talking about whether or not they had sex nine years ago. ****/*****"

What a waste..It's a great movie for romantics, especially those who believe in the endurance of old feelings regardless of how the romance ended.\n\nUnlike other viewers I found no mystery to the ending -- they do get together.\n\nJesse's inability to leave her when he finds her again, and his positive response to her last question in which he states helplessly that he will miss the plane is a clear indicator that despite the complexity of their current lives (breakup and divorce with their current mates), they are together this time. It's also implied by their mutual revelation of how unsatisfied each is in their current relationships. Jesse cannot love his wife as she expects it and Julie has suppressed her romantic feelings so much that she is satisfied with an intermittent long-distance relationship. Neither mate stands a chance to Julie dancing to Nina Simone as she seduces Jesse to stay.\n\nHis acknowledgment that he will miss his plane is delivered with a smile that reminds me of certain scenes in two early Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward films (Paris Blues but especially The Long Hot Summer) in which Paul simply cannot stop grinning at his real love Joanne when they are flirting because he is so nuts about her.\n\nThis movie was a treat..."

I feel though, it falls second to Before Sunset. The difference between the two and what makes Before Sunset superior is the vehicle that drives the film. In Sideways, it is comedy. In Before Sunset, it is emotion-heartbreak, arrogance, hopelessness, and love. These by innate nature make it more powerful and haunting than the escapades of Payne's great film. Linklater, a great director that makes a Texan proud to be Texan again, directs like a great conductor letting a world-famous soloist take the vehicle where it needs to go but just keeping the headlights on. These two performances are deeply earnest. You can see the heartbreak coming from their own lives inch out of their mouths and glow from the building tears in their eyes. Whether or not they are bringing experiences from their own life is irrelevant. They are channeling what they know these characters need to feel into the sublime script. I hope and feel this will be remembered along with Sideways, Colllateral, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Closer as redeeming qualities making 2004 a movie year worth remembering."

        "review_detailed_main": "A sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and a true testament to the virtue of patience. Filmed nine years after the first film, with the trilogy's third installment Before Midnight again jumping nine years into the future. And like in real life, nine years have also passed since the events of Sunrise.\n\nJesse and C\u00e9line, played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have not seen each other since the events of the first film, but now Jesse is finishing his book tour in Paris and runs into C\u00e9line in a bookstore. The whole film is simply their conversation from beginning to end as they walk the streets and parks of Paris. And it is fascinating.\n\nBefore Sunrise was already a good film. Especially in how it portrayed the age of its main characters. They were adults, if only barely, but not yet old enough to be comfortable in their skins, in their world views. I also truly appreciated how they were mostly attracted to each other's personalities and not just their respective looks.\n\nThat is present here, as well, but once again their age is reflected really well. These two have lived, have learned, have grown, but they still connect very easily with one another. There is earning to be with one another, because they get each other so well, but there's also caution brought on by live experience and past mistakes.\n\nAnd perhaps it's because I'm closer in age to the characters of this film, but I felt much more in tune with these two than I did when they were still in their very late teens. It's also fascinating that my favourite character has changed from C\u00e9line to Jesse. This time it's C\u00e9line that has views and attitudes that slightly annoy me, whereas before it was Jesse that was a bit too full of himself for my liking. Not that they're at all unlikable in either of the films, but they have clearly changed. And that feels real.\n\nWhereas Sunrise gave us a vision of perfection, of day dreams and hopes for the future, Sunset shows what might really be possible. Sure its plot and events are a bit movie-like in their sheer serendipity, but they still end up feeling more grounded. Very good romance film, no matter how you measure it."

Once you have seen the movie you want to go back and watch it again because it is like talking to an old girlfriend you have known more then half your life. You can tell when she is hiding something, tell when she is trying to block herself off emotionally, know that there are more feelings underneath her quiet charm then she will ever reveal. I haven't even seen the first movie but I feel as though I truly know these characters.\n\nThis is a highly intellectually, emotionally involved plot made for (and seemingly by) persons who know what its like to have lingering thoughts, doubts and fears about a person that could have been \"the one\". A must see for anyone who isn't the grinch and has read a book in the last year."

Don't watch this movie without watching the prequel (\"Before Sunrise\"), first; you will be playing an oft confusing game of catch-up, I believe, if you do (i.e., watch these movies out of chronological order). I watched this movie three times before returning it. It is a gem of a movie, and the actors and writers should consider a third installment when the time is right ... not in any prerequisite number of years (i.e., nine for example). Here is my unsolicited vote for J. Delpy for an Academy Award for Best Actress 2004 for her work in \"Before Sunset\"! Her performance throughout was captivating, engaging, engrossing. Her display of anger while riding in the van was such that only a Frenchwoman can manifest and it was mesmerizing!!! If she doesn't receive at least an \"Oscar\" nomination, there should be an investigation into Francophobia in Hollywood. Buy the VHS/DVD!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Before Sunrise\" was one of my all-time favourite movies, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I was nervous. The open ending of the first installment was so note-perfect in leaving people free to draw their own conclusions about what happened that I didn't want it to be ruined. As such, I delayed seeing this as long as possible.\n\nI should have delayed longer. Much longer. Like, forever.\n\nSimply put, \"Before Sunset\" takes a couple of intriguing, interesting, fully-drawn characters and turns them into insufferable cads, caught up in their own memories and having achieved nothing of note in their lives in ten years. It takes a beautiful, sweet chance romantic encounter and turns it into the cornerstone of these characters' lives. And it tries to make us believe that there's nothing better out there to hope for, ever. What a thoroughly depressing message! What injustice to these characters, who deserved a whole lot better! Of all the scenarios I ever imagined for these two, this was not it.\n\nThe first movie was great because it was about two people meeting by chance and truly connecting. But in the second movie, we're led to believe that since then, neither of them has managed to connect with anyone else. Both are in unsatisfying relationships when they meet up again - that part is not that hard to believe. But what is depressing in a creepy stalker-ish sort of way is that Hawke's character has devoted years of his life to writing about Delpy's, and that Delpy's character has devoted a significant amount of time to seeking out Hawke's character for a reunion.\n\nToo, the movie downplays the thorny issue of marital infidelity and home-wrecking; people rooting for Hawke and Delpy to get back together should stop romanticizing everything and take a good hard look at the fact that they're cheering for a guy to leave (or at least cheat on) his wife and ditch his kid for a girl he had a one-night stand with nine years earlier. As for Delpy, she's writing and recording songs about a guy SHE had a one-night stand with. And neither of them quite realize the irony - that they're throwing away everything real in their lives in order to chase a fantasy that never really existed.\n\nThe first movie was great precisely because the characters were practical about the circumstances of their meeting; they accepted the fact that their connection was strong but brief, and that long-distance relationships don't work, and that the future is unpredictable. But neither took their own advice - instead, it seems they have been living hollowed half-existences for the past nine years, just waiting to find each other again.\n\nAnd when they do, what exactly do they find? Is it realistic to think that these two will get along once they try to spend more than a single day together? It's all too obvious that they have nothing in common - even from the first movie, it's obvious that they differ politically, philosophically and culturally, and that the only reason they have such a great relationship is because it only lasts a night. By the second movie, they have grown even further apart on all those issues, plus they each carry around idealized, imaginary versions of one another that they have invented over a nine-year period and that will be impossible to live up to. Relationships - real relationships - are hard work, full of ups and downs, but they're *real*. What these two have isn't real. What they have is, well, just plain sad.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you not to, because once you have seen it, there's no going back. These characters deserve so much better - just use your imagination."

But I just wanted to put some comments down to try to express the way this movie has profoundly affected me. I cannot count how many times I've seen it. And every single time that I do, the ending STILL makes me *gasp*. Sheer perfection. This movie is all about the connection between two extremely passionate, intelligent and visceral people, and NOTHING that has been churned out lately, can even come remotely CLOSE to this archetype of cinematic brilliance. And the \"real time\" aspect, just adds to its perfection.\n\nThis movie has so much SOUL; perhaps TOO much for those soulless saps in \"movie-land\" to comprehend.\n\nIt is simply, a masterpiece.

        "review_detailed_main": "I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. I remember seeing its predecessor, Before Sunrise, about nine years ago when it came out on video and being pleasantly surprised by that little gem of a movie. I was slightly younger than the main characters, Jessie and Celine, but their dreams and the questions they were struggling with at the time resonated very much with my own. When I heard that Before Sunset was being released, I was somewhat hesitant about seeing it, fearing that the follow-up would not measure up to its predecessor or that I would find the characters' conversations to be annoying and sophomoric. But Before Sunset turned out to be even better than Before Sunrise. Though just as idealistic and romantic, there is a stronger current of nostalgia in this follow-up. Celine and Jessie are more aware of their own limitations and of the sacrifices they had to make for their chosen paths in life. They are giddy to be around each other but also fearful about confronting the unrealized possibilities of the relationship they have so deeply idealized. Yes, the movie is very much conversation-driven, and the conversations sometimes veer into the realm of pretentiousness\u0097but then again, who hasn't come off as slightly pretentious when they are trying to impress someone they really like? I felt a strong compassion for these characters who are smart, idealistic, but flawed in ways that are endearing and human. There is a real urgency in their interactions as they try to make up for lost time. Richard Linklater is a talented director who has genuine interest in and empathy for people who are adjusting to the difficulties and demands of adulthood."

It's what Jesse says at some point - nobody really ever change. Being of the same age group of the characters, I could identify a lot with what they say and feel. Which means that Hawke and Delpy did a great job, both acting and writing this film. It's subtle, delicate, and it needs to be listened to very attentively, not to miss one word of the great, deep dialogue. Well done to all of them. And, it's so true, the only problem with this film is that it ends..."

The connection they shared was equally possible as it was unrealistic, but it was in simplest terms a miracle.\n\nEven though I haven't witnessed such a miracle, I believe in it, as rare as it is.\n\nBut, in this life, there are no happy endings, and it's only the path we take to our miserable end which has potential for \"happiness.\" Without any reference to statistics and with no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone who might be \"in love\", 99% of the world does not experience this kind of love. Unfortunately for many, the love in this movie is \"true love\", which in effect means if you are not experiencing this kind of love, you are not experiencing true love.\n\nThe characters do, suggestively, end in a miserable end. But the moments they share is when they experience the greatest happiness known to man.\n\nDo yourself and the world a favour and watch and fall in love with this movie. Because I can guarantee that even if I don't find true love with a woman, I can be sure I felt it by witnessing the pure magic in the gem.\n\nThe only movie ever to bring me to tears! It had a profound affect on me when I watched it and still does. The original is almost as good, but this one had something extra in it to bring me to tears.\n\nIf you don't understand even one part of what I'm talking about after you watched this miracle, then unfortunately you have zero chance of experiencing true love.\n\nThis may me my favourite movie of all time!"

Soon, they're walking around talking about Important Things and all of that yadda yadda yadda.\n\nIn all honestly, I had to stop this film because I was falling asleep. Although it significantly picked up when they were talking about their relationship, all the other mumbo-jumbo I could have did without.

The picture began with Jesse wrapping up his book tour in Paris, and was blushing red while answering questions about his work which I found out as the movie goes along, was the romanticized version of his and Celine's love affair that did not happen. She came and saw him at the bookstore that he was in and went on from there. They reacquaint themselves with each other, spawning endless conversations from every conceivable topic. They also can't help but look back from that day in Vienna and wondered what if. I just recently saw Before Sunrise, the prequel to this film, and must say that I enjoy this one more, only because the topics of conversations were more mature, and the romantic notions were more realistic. Their connection is so palpable, it made me wish I knew someone with whom I can speak candidly without fear of being judged. The film is shot in location in Paris, and it certainly contributes to the aura of the film."

The frisson of engagement where all is in the subtext is just thrilling in both films, and, no, not everyone will get it, but for those that do, these movies affirm life and the power and subtlety of human love.\n\nSomeone in the postings said that the movie is unrealistic! Yep! It's a movie! Yep, the \"real\" characters (whoever they might be!) wouldn't say fascinating things every second together but this is a movie capturing the essence of the invisible electricity between two ordinary people. Listen to how we actually speak in \"real\" life.... We bumble and rarely stick to the point. To allow Linklater to edit their story (in the writing and in the cutting room) to the essence is called film-making and it does not represent a lack of truth but a heightening and intensifying of the experience of the two characters - akin to their own memory of what happened to them.\n\nThank God films like this get made, and for those that don't like them - go see the latest blockbuster of which there is an endless stream. The choice is between a bistro and McDonalds; a family run pensione or the Marriott. The vast majority choose the latter out of laziness, a lack of imagination and avoidance of risk. (Just the predictable story elements that Hollywood sticks to, to get the right demographics to get mass bums on seats.) Good luck to them."

As we find out how profound of an effect each of them had on the other, I would have thought they'd run out of small talk much sooner, faced with the reality of a life's obsession presenting itself in person.\n\nAt 80 minutes, including two sets of credits, there was time to delve much deeper into the possibilities. And the question looming large: \"If given a second chance at a past romance, would you do anything differently?\" is hinted at, but not played out. It felt like watching your sexy neighbors all through dinner, and just when they move towards the bedroom, the lights go out. Yeah, I have an imagination, but when I go to the movies, I suspend my own fantasies for awhile, and pay to see someone else's. And they weren't delivered.\n\nRather than a number grade, I would give this movie an I (for incomplete)."

We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking.\n\nIn the second this is all replaced with dialogue that feels contrived and scripted, and which reeks of pseudo-intellectualism. Let's just set aside the fact that the endearing young love of the first is replaced with a pent up lust in the second, so that we can focus on the fact that Hawke's character is married during this little escapade, which renders the whole attraction categorically repugnant. Maybe things won't to work out in his marriage anyway, but people with integrity honor their marriage until it is over. Are we suppose to identify with and/or sympathize with this character?!? Get a divorce and fool around, or exercise the most minimal amount of self-respect & dignity and follow through with your own commitment.\n\nMoving the promenade to the streets of Paris felt predictable and petty to me, it didn't save the movie, and finally, the film itself felt low-budget. I don't recommend Before Sunset to anyone who isn't middle-aged, divorced, and looking for consolation in a story of unscrupulous mediocrity. I do say that reluctantly, and apologize for its harshness, but that is the brutal truth. It's a middle aged, unaccountably cynical, and trite remake of the first, but 10 years later in Paris."

I always wonder what have happened to Celine (Delpy) and Jesse (Hawke), and all the questions about whether they had met up six months later and one night stand still lingered. I could not forget the dynamic relationship between these characters and their thoughts about life, death, their friends and their relationships, although mundane but brings out the extraordinary side in everyone of us.\n\nNine years later, I am now living in UK. Whenever I screened the DVD for this movie, the college room was always full. I found a lot of friends who loved this movie. By the time when I was told that the sequel is out and it's entitled \"Before Sunset\". I could not believe it, and it's like the Tolkien fans waiting to watch the trilogy.\n\nI have just watched the movie today, and realized that the characters have evolved. The way which they viewed their relationships. There is still the magic between them. As most of the issues that came to my mind from the movie are resolved elegantly in \"Before Sunset\", I cannot help but feel the same way on how this movie gave me the idealism to believe in romance. I felt that Celine and Jesse have shown us that how important beautiful moments are to our lives. The conversation they had about the environment, the politics of the world and things in the movie, is so much like what I would experience being in their age.\n\nAlthough the ending is not what I expected, I still think that the maturity and chemistry between these characters will live with me as I grow. I hope to hear from them when we all reached 40s. This is a movie which grows up with the audience, and every time you revisit it with a different notion of what life is all about.\n\nDefinitely without doubt 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although I hadn't seen the prequel to this film, my date had and she filled me in on many details. The experience of the film would be enriched by having seen the previous film first, but it certainly stands on its own.\n\nIt reminded me of one of my favorite movies of all time, \"My Dinner with Andr\u00e9,\" in which only 2 characters talked for the entire film. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner. At that dinner, they caught up on what each other had been doing. Andr\u00e9 Gregory and Wallace Shawn played themselves and represented opposite sides of a dialectic, say romanticism against conventional reality. \"Before Sunset\" is parallel in many ways.\n\nIn one sense, it is a romantic story -- two people used to be lovers and lost touch nine years ago. They meet again and spend an afternoon together. Will they decide to continue their relationship?\n\nWe also have the charm of conversation and exploration, reminiscing, feeling out what we have in common and finding out what we have in common now. - where has this individual been? - what are they capable of? Can that other individual make decisions, and how much freedom do I have?\n\nDespite their ability to relate and talk, Celine and Jesse view the world and relationships differently -- Celine is more cynical and reserved, while Jesse is more open to settling for the \"not-perfect-but-good-enough.\"\n\nPossibly there are a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship where one wonders, \"What would've happened if I had pursued it?\" but most people have. There is also the dilemma of meeting that person again but being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my current life. What would happen to them if I pursued my own happiness at the expense of theirs? Can I do that? Can I value my own happiness above theirs?\n\nIn spite of the fact that the film doesn't answer these fundamental questions, it nevertheless brings them to our attention.\n\nI feel sure that Delpy and Hawke contributed greatly to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.\n\nAlmost half of the voters gave it a 10/10 when I wrote this. For those of us in that group, it's fantastic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is my first review ever on IMDb on a movie. I simply can't resist the temptation to express my happiness after just seeing this movie. It is so simple and plain, no background music, no frills, nothing superfluous and nothing lacking. Just a simply story told in a masterful way and the only movie I've seen so far, where I could close my eyes and just listen from beginning to end and not miss anything, just like listening to an audio book. I love this movie, probably due to the same reason most people who post reviews about it love it. We simply see ourselves in the 2 main characters and realize we're not the only ones in the world trying to live dealing with the same emotional problems. I recommend it to everyone. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset is a cinematic dance of emotions that earns a solid 7/10 in my cinematic diary. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's performances are a nuanced masterpiece, carrying the weight of years in stolen glances and unspoken words. The film editing seamlessly weaves through the streets of Paris, mirroring the delicate dance of connection and separation. Its strength lies in the authenticity of human connection, and though it occasionally stumbles into the realm of overly intellectual dialogue, it's forgiven for its genuine attempt to explore the complexities of love. The music, or the lack thereof, allows the silence between words to echo with unspoken sentiments. The cinematography captures the golden glow of a fleeting romance against the backdrop of a timeless city. Before Sunset is a poignant exploration of love's evolution, leaving a lingering ache that reminds us of the beauty and impermanence of the moments we hold dear."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well once u have seen Before Sunrise there is an innate curiosity to find out what happened in Dec in Vienna and Before Sunset not only answers the curiosity but creates one of its own through carefully well written dialogs and great screenplay. The movie is about coming together of two people who met each other a long time ago and fell in love but circumstances did not allow them to, they talk about politics, environment, love, sex, relationships but the feelings that evolve after meeting one another is what I feel is the USP of Before Sunset. If u see Before Sunrise and u come to know that there is a sequel to it u will go for Before Sunrise before too long. Before Sunset goes well beyond weaving the emotional drama then its predecessor, and the question it asks of viewers towards the end is quite sentimental. Through an answer from Ethan at the start of Before Sunset the director seems to make his point of view of why keep the viewers in dilemma. The chemistry between the lead pair is superb and no wonder Julie and Ethan were actively involved in dialog writing for the movie. The ten yr gap between the two movies seem to be well thought out in the script as well as well as the makeup of the artists. The movie is not for those who cannot stand the marathon dialogs between same two characters for a continuous period of one and a half hours. After seeing the movie you seem to be looking for the next sequel and whether we will get another romantic fiesta from Ethan, Julie and company is a question that remains in mind for the viewers"

        "review_detailed_main": "We pick up the lives of Jesse and C\u00e9line in mid-stride. When we left them at the end of Before Sunrise, they refused to exchange addresses and last names, but were going to meet in Vienna in six months. Nine years later, we glimpse their lives again. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has finished a book and is giving a reading/discussion and Shakespeare and Co. in Paris. At the end of the reading, he spies C\u00e9line (julie Delpy) watching from the wings. They go for a walk to catch up before he has to head to the airport. During this walk we learn that they did not meet up in Vienna, and have both attempted to move on in their lives.\n\nThere are several things that make this movie stand out. First, this is a movie of dialogue and discussion about live, living and one's views, beliefs and outlook. There are no explosions, chases, kisses, heists, plot twists, etc. This is just two people talking. What I loved about the two films is the easy and open way in which these two discuss trivial and deeply personal subjects and how they are intermixed. What else made this film engaging was the warts-and-all approach to life. These characters weren't glamorous or glamorized, they were just people. And the fact that they picked up and explored the people they had become from mid-20s to mid-30s, who had strayed quite a distance from the idealized vision of their future they had had nine years earlier really brought it home. I too, am different and worse than the me I had planned on being 9 years ago. The only problem I had with this film was the character of C\u00e9line, it didn't ring true to me, too much idealism left and until she wigged out in the taxi, I didn't buy into her life.\n\nThis movie is like crispy french fries and special fry sauce. In the west, fry sauce is a big deal. It is usually a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise with various spices and flavors added. Special fry sauce is a sauce the cooks (me included) used to whip up at Carousel Ice Cream Parlour in Provo, Utah in 1995 for ourselves and a few other employees. It had regular fry sauce, BBQ sauce and more mayo to make it a little tangier and better than the regular. Now this movie doesn't have much to do with the flavor or texture of special fry sauce and crispy French fries, but I only worked at Carousel in 95 and the experiential phenomena surrounding this dish (that I only ate during one year) overwhelm the taste in my mind . I was a different Poco back then, and thinking about the super fry sauce take me back to a more idealistic youth and the big plans I had for myself. 7/10\n\nhttp://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film 4 weeks ago on a Cable channel in Australia. I just happened to watch it on an off chance, and within minutes of the movie starting,I got completely absorbed in it. The movie was simply told, but the story was anything but simple. It was one of the best films I have seen so far! The entire movie was shot in a few scenes, and with a moving camera. All the two characters do is talk to each other.\n\nJesse and Celine have met after a 9-year hiatus. Jesse is an American and Celine is French. They met in their early twenties in Italy. After a brief Romance, they agree to meet again in 6 months in the same place, but due to Celine's grandmother passing away she is unable to make it. But we find out that Jesse did come, and years later he writes a book about the incident. This compels Celine to come to his book signing in Paris,(which is where she lives),as she identify's that the story he wrote is about their liaison.\n\nAfter they meet they start talking about their current lives and it is revealed that neither of them are blissfully happy in their respective circumstances. Jesse who is married, obviously is not in love with his wife anymore IF he ever was, and appears never to have got over Celine, and Celine, who never got married, appears never to have got over Jesse either. Neither of them where able to forget the romantic ideal that they had held for the other.\n\nThe day that they spend together walking around Paris gives us an insight into the characters and their mindsets. It also fills us in on their first meeting, and what happened consequently, and also their present lives and the dissatisfaction they have in the same. I just loved the way this story was told, one afternoon, two people, good conversation, and no embellishments. Some of the conversations where SO normal, that you didn't feel like they where constructed dialogue at all. As the day progresses their conversations become increasingly honest. Almost painfully so, and many things about their depth of feeling for each other is revealed.\n\nEthan Hawke was at his best in this film. His performance was honest and heartfelt. I loved it, and Julie Delpy's performance was equally good. They had a great on screen chemistry that added to the authenticity of the story.\n\nThe story basically ends ambiguously, and it is up to us to decide if they are going to get together this time or not? We are convinced by the end of this afternoon that Jesse and Celine are meant for each other. We are left hoping that they feel the same!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't remember seeing the first film of this series, \"Before Sunrise\" until some of the footage from that film was featured in its sequel, \"Before Sunset\", also directed by Richard Linklater. The premise of the story is that in 1995, Celine (Delpy), a young French woman and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are two young strangers that meet in Vienna and spend the kind of night together anyone with half of a brain and an ounce of romance in them would envy. They walk, they talk, they sit, they talk, they have sex, they talk. And throughout the evening, they realize that they are probably meant to be together forever. She has to leave, but they tell each other that they will meet in Vienna in six months. \"Before Sunset\" picks up 9 years later, and Jesse is on the last leg of a European book tour, in France. The book is based on his experiences that night, so it of course shocks and awes him when he looks over at the patrons of the bookstore and sees Celine. They proceed to spend the next 75 minutes or so walking, talking, sitting, talking, and figuring out what \"could have been\".\n\nThe story is so much deeper than I actually portray it, but the film is indeed a simple one. Essentially done in real time, the camera never leaves the two characters as they walk around Paris, sit in a coffee house and ride on a ferry boat. Because the film is so simple, the story has to be substantial, and it is. Even if one has not seen \"Before Sunrise\", it is easy to not only figure out the back story (thanks to the use of clips from that film) but to become emotionally invested in the characters of Celine and Jesse. The chemistry between these two actors is substantial, and the characters themselves are so likable that even though I normally have a complete disinterest in either actor separately, together I find them charming. The actual conversations (ranging from the regular \"catch-up\" stuff to existentialism) are really so natural; they did not seem forced or staged, an easy hole to slip in to with such a dialogue-heavy film. I'm sure that the incredible backdrop of Paris didn't hurt the romantic undertone of the film. There were a couple of conveniences that seemed to betray the otherwise intelligent feel of the film, namely the fact that Jesse's marriage story is a complete clich\u00e9, not unlike any number of stories someone hears at a cheesy pick-up joint. Fortunately in that instance, (though I can't completely forgive it) the connection between them is so obvious that it somehow (though not completely) seems a little less sleazy.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" is nominated for an Oscar for its screenplay, a choice that I find very interesting and agree with. It is worth of its nomination (though will doubtfully win), and it's also one of the few romance films made after 1968 that I actually enjoy \u0096 because it has a brain. 7/10 --Shelly"

I simply do not see the attraction at all.\n\nHawke is unlikeable again, Delpy is devoid of the charm she had in the first and the whole film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first with yet another ambiguous finale.\n\nI like the idea of the simplicity behind both films, I guess I just didn't appreciate the lines of conversation or the way they ended them both.\n\nI believe the films would have been a lot more appealing if they'd both shut the hell up, strapped a go-pro camera on and just given us 90 minutes of of the wonderful country and it's architecture."

I don't remember details about the characters or even their promise to meet again. That didn't matter. My companion didn't see the first movie at all, but that didn't lessen her enjoyment. Hawke and Delpy proved themselves to be good writers before this movie. They have created full, complex, interesting characters. My only complaint is this visit could have been about 15-20 minutes longer."

The two protagonists are more complex. They have both suffered disappointments, yet - as Celine observes - their personalities are essentially unchanged, just more finely carved. The film's ending is inspired. The only mild criticism is that the characters are almost too eloquent. As a sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) this could not be bettered."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't seen the first part, Before Sunrise (1995), but many around me had and did not stop telling me how a beautiful movie it was. So I went after Before Sunset with the feeling that I will see a nice romantic movie. Well, I did not get it. This can be a nice movie for some, but for me, it is not something I would take my girlfriend with me to have a night out.\n\nThe film tells about Jesse and Celine meeting in Paris after their romantic night in Vienna 9 years ago. Jesse wrote a book on their romance and gives a small talk in a local bookshop where he meets Celine. They start talk and they go on talking.\n\nBasically, the movie is about their conversation, which is very authentic. Jesse has the man type \"jump in where we left off\" style, immediately starting at the intimate level, while Celine starts from the distance and slowly warms up to the intimate level they had before. At the beginning they go along the more superficial themes, what has happened during the nine years, what is life about at the moment, then they pass on to tell their feelings, motivations, their memories of that night they passed together.\n\nYou see 90% of the movie Jesse and Celine talking to each other in premier and second frames (only the face or the face with upper body). The movie presents the story \"real time\", the 80 minutes you spend in the movie is actually the 80 minutes of their conversation in Paris. Therefore the camera never leaves them; you always see Jesse and Celine on screen. On the top of that, you are given very long runs between cuts. Like when you see them from the front talking to each other walking along a small street - you get it from entering the street to the corner, with the same fram, without any cut. For me, it was just too much of the same image - although they walk, so the background changes - and felt quite uncomfortable in my chair. It was not boring, but made me feel somehow anxious. In fact, after the first 30 minutes, I changed my place 2 rows back in the cinema, because I felt \"to close to the screen\".\n\nThe end of the movie was the major disappointment to me, as there was no end. In the middle of a special moment suddenly the music and the picture fades out and the black screen with the list of the actors come up. We all stayed silent in the hall looking at each other with the face \"what's up, is that a joke?\". But it was no joke, the lights turned on, so slowly we decided to get up and go as the film is really over. I came out from the cinema mentally still hungry, as the story did get neither a sad nor a happy - or whatever - end, it just stopped. I wanted to see a nice romantic movie with some happy end, but I did not get it.\n\nIf I consider this movie in itself, as it is, without any expectations, this is a great film, that breaks in something unusual to nowadays' action-romance-thriller movie with all the bells-and-whistles style pictures you get used to. Before Sunset gives conversations, feelings, situations and atmosphere, that you usually only get from independent European directors. It gives you time to digest and makes you consider whether you ever were in such a situation.\n\nHowever, when you go to watch this movie, you do it after hearing how beautiful the first part was and how romantic it was. So you sit in \"I will see a beautiful romantic movie tonight\" in your mind, but this is not a romantic movie. This is an unusual film of an original idea. I think that editor Richard Linklater should have filmed this story on its own, not as a second part of \"Before Sunrise\". Like that, it would get a 9/10 from me. However, like this, I can only give a 6/10.\n\nTo answer your question, whether should you watch it or not, yes, you should, as I plan to watch it once again myself. However, you should do it without the romantic-movie expectations in mind."

I only saw it because of limited film choices at that time. I guess I had a broader range of films to see when the sequel Before Sunset came out and only saw it recently because the high IMDb user rating sparked my interest.\n\nFirst off, it is better than the original. It's been the case with several movies that the sequel bettered the original e.g. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Spider-Man 2, LOTR: Return of the King and (I know I'm stirring up some controversy) The Godfather - 2.\n\nBefore Sunset starts out very well. We are given a short and sweet recap on the events of Before Sunrise. You can comfortably watch Sunset without having seen the original. We then have Celine and Jesse walking through Paris chatting and catching up on their lives. They also take a short boat ride on the Seine and eventually a car ride to Celine's flat while continuing their conversation.\n\nThe entire film is a conversation between two people with no action. What makes the film unique is that the conversation sounds very natural, the kind of conversation two normal, intelligent people who click would have. That, plus the beauty of Paris makes this very viewable and romantic. We have a bombshell or two dropped along the way about what the two have been up to in the past nine years. It adds to audience interest and the complexity of where they find themselves vis-a-vis each other.\n\nSunset comes badly undone in the last 10 minutes. The moment Celine starts singing \"Let me sing you a waltz\" and mimicking Nina Simone, the film nosedives. The conversation becomes unreal and forced where throughout the movie it had seemed so natural. The ending was a cop-out. The story needed to find an end and me being a noir fan, you can guess what end I would have preferred."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is interesting that most of the critics like this one better than Before Sunrise because the characters are \"more mature\". My take on this is: most of the critics are closer and above this age range (early 30s) and it is simply more difficult for them to relate to the first movie. However, these two movies are even more worthwhile considered together especially from the point of view of the audience that were 20 when the first one came out and are almost 30 now. Back in 95 Before Sunrise resonated with me because it was very relevant to the way I and my friends looked at the world, we had similar dreams, concerns, it was the way we talked. And of course we imagined meeting this one soul-mate with whom you understand each other without having to finish sentences, and you have exactly the same doubts and look forward your life ahead and are reluctant to commit right then because who know what else may come your way. Today Before sunset has exactly the same effect, I am almost 30 and I have changed just like the characters and I have similar problems and again this the way I would talk and the themes I would discuss in a conversation. I am sure this is roughly true for this whole generation. I don't think the open ending is intended for us to guess what happened in either of the two movies, although Jesse says in the beginning of Sunset: well it depends, if you are an optimist they meet in 6 months and if not.... I think the open ending in both movies emphasizes the fact that it does not matter whether they end up together or not. The point is that they are both enriched by meeting and spending a few hours together and by having a good conversation. Sometimes we choose not to be with someone that we feel is our soul-mate, simply because it would cost too much (kids, other people getting hurt) and that is fine, we still have experienced this connection and we will treasure it for the rest of our lives. It is not about letting your true love slip away, we don't know for sure if this is true love, what we know is that we made a connection. I find the brief episode when Jesse tells the journalists the topic of his next book very descriptive of what the movie(s) is all about. This connection that makes our lives richer and better may happen in a night, or in a few hours or in a few moments."

The growth of the relationship within the boundaries of time is as realistic as it can ever be, but unlike reality TV, this film possess an artistry filled with beauty. Bravo! The acting was very natural. Choices were made by the demand of the previous moment rather than for the mere Eggo. Both actors were very much into what they were doing. The listened to each other and really heard one another. Cinematography could have been easily sacrificed if it were not for the wisdom to let the actors do their thing and you just there to record.

Basically, the movie shows what is and what could be. I still haven't seen the third entry in the series, but if this is any indication, then I'd better see it. From what I've seen of his work, Linklater is a director who can't make a bad movie. Definitely see it."

They just walk and talk, discovering a lot, sharing a lot and probably deciding a lot. Might sound cheesy, but it's worth every penny and every minute spent on it. Don't miss it for the world.\n\nTruly an unique movie experience."

After a while we understand how much the brief encounter i Wienna really meant to them and their lovelies after that. For about 1 and a half hour the couple walks and talks about real stuff, the dialog is interesting and very honest. Ethan and Julie are truly believable.

It doesn't obey by standard romantic drama films. It is simple and the action/conversation is more realistic. But, on the other hand, if you're looking for that standard of romance in which the two engage in a wild ride of romance, you are going to be disappointed because at this point in the story, that happened already...9 years ago.

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw the ad for Before Sunset on a trip, and had to wait for 12 days before being able to see the movie. That 12 days seemed like ages. I felt that I was waiting to see an important friend after losing contact for 9 years, with all the curiosity what happened to him/her (here, for both Celine and Jesse). I felt fortunate to have seen Before Sunrise exactly 9 years ago without seeing it again so that I have exactly the faint 9-year-old impressions while watching Before Sunset.\n\nI was astound after seeing Before Sunset.\n\nWhat I did not expect was how much more serious Before Sunset is, compared to Before Sunrise. That 80 min conversation echoed so many things in life, e.g. why/how one stays in dissatisfied relations, our responsibilities and compromises, our occasional fall-back into feeling sad about life, while keeping our eyes on things still worth our effort and hope. The indirect allusions are so effective.\n\nWhile some has complained about a relative slow pace, I found the pace very powerful. I was practically grilled by those moments of suspense or uneasiness or hesitation. I was also surprised and shocked when the pace was fast at certain points. I don't know whether they are intended or or, but such emotions engaged me like no other movie.\n\nIt is a very good movie even without hitting anyone's \"soft pots\" though a lot of the reviewers reported being \"badly hit.\" The movie itself, the acting, and the story itself are all extremely charming. It definitely surpasses Before Sunrise, which has lent from scenery and is a little too sentimental at the very end. The atmosphere in Before Sunset is created entirely internal, which is amazing. It is also fortunate to have all the natural 9-year change in appearance and maturity in the cast. I cannot help suspecting that the makeup was made intentionally to feature a kind of aging into 32-33. I believe most actors and actresses at 32-33 look much younger on the screen.\n\nThe technique to have a continuous flow was also used in \"Rope,\" which also delivers to the audience a good deal of emotional engagement for reasons described above.\n\nFinally, this movie is really for an extreme minority, but it is nice to hear from others from within that minority group!"

It just so happened that the book signing was a bookshop which was also Celine's favorite. Of course they meet, and then went around Paris the rest of the afternoon until Jesse's plane will be leaving at sunset. As with the first film, we see them talking about how their lives went since that fateful day in Vienna years back.\n\nJulie Delpy (as Celine) did not age too much, but Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) looked significantly older. But the years did not diminish their chemistry with each other. The script by Richard Linklater this time was shorter, more sober, with deeper issues and mature emotion now, compared to the first one which was generally lighter, whimsical, with palpable youthful vibrancy. The transition over the years was perfectly reflected in the words they spoke. Again, we are drawn into their conversation, until that open and puzzling final scene.\n\nOK that is it. I will definitely go watch \"Before Midnight\" when it opens in local theaters next week."

Both films are interesting enough to stand on their own, I guess, but this is truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nThe fact that the actors are themselves 9 years older is one of the reasons why the film feels genuine. At one point in the film the Hawke character says that people stay essentially the same throughout their whole lives, even if their circumstances and lifestyles change. I'd say that seems to be true of these characters, and is done in an interesting way: The two characters - and actors - are 9 years older and how are in a different phase in their life, but the same spark that made them interesting to watch in the first film is true here as well.\n\nThis is not a film to watch if you're interested in action, or even plot. Essentially all that happens is that two people meet up and talk for about 80 minutes, and that's it. But the conversation is so interesting - particularly since they have the first film to draw on - that it really holds your attention the whole time.\n\nI've heard that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have toyed with the idea of making more movies about these characters every few years, and I hope they end up doing that.\n\nOverall, a great film, and one that really makes you think."

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly i would like to express my disbelief about the rating this movie has received here: an 8.0/10, and the same as 'Before Sunrise'? You've have got to be kidding me!!!! And I cannot believe that it hasn't won an Oscar either, for me this is hands down the best movie ever made in Hollywood.\n\nAs for the movie, it has so many dimensions that are imperative; it is difficult to pinpoint one single aspect of the movie as the most overriding one. Yet, this movie conveys one simple message: the importance of youth. Life is only worth living when you are young at heart, it does not depend on age. Jesse and Celine are living miserably because they have forgotten what it means to be 'young', even though they are very successful in their lives. Youth is better understood by those who have passed (and lived through it)it than those who are living it. Love is better understood by people who have loved, and lost it. This is the simple reality, and this movie tells us that.\n\nWhat makes this movie far superior to its predecessor is the fact that the actors have matured, and are understanding youth/love better than they did in the first movie. This is evident by every sentence Jesse says, every look Celine gives; simply stunning. I have loved before, and lost her: i feel myself not only compatible with Jesse but Jesse himself. Everything that comes out of Jesse's mouth is what i have said to my love.\n\nAs for the movie itself, the setting that it takes place in could not have been better: Paris. It is every person's fantasy to go there. The lighting is great, and everything else to. About the movie, the way it has connected the beginning to the finish is amazing. The way Celine dances in the end is exactly the same way Jesse described it in the beginning of the movie. I was extremely sad at the end of the movie, as to how little time Jesse had to capture the magic in Celine's apartment. The playing of the song was a brilliant idea, as well as how she dances in the end. Jesse's reactions in the end are precious (even though they hurt so much, when he's realizing what a life of misery he's lived in the past 9 years). He doesn't want to leave her, but life is not like that. He has a kid, wife, responsibility and everything else that he needs in his life; without the one thing he truly longs for: youth. Unfortunately, life is like that.\n\nEach and every moment that Celine and Jesse had together in this movie was a moment to savor. Unfortunately, time is of the essence and not on their side."

Maybe I saw the film when I was at the correct age...

The way that both actors were on the first film was as they were connected somehow making it so real that you could caught yourself thinking and hopping that there will be a classic -Hollywood made- happy ending to make sure that's just a movie and nothing more! But no, no compromise whatsoever! And now to \"Sunset\" which starts with both characters acting awkward, playing hide and seek. They are now older, 9 years older, which make every person change a lot and they are both afraid each other. You need less than 15 minutes in the movie and you realise that you feel like the first movie, but now is even better! You are sure that this is real life, you can easily be convinced that it's a home-made video or a movie based on a real life! As the minutes go by and you see them revealing themselves to each other once again after all this time you feel no acting but real feelings between them. The act of deception in all it's glory! Hawk and Delpy better than ever before and Linklater just brought reality in a way that no one could ever imagine as possible! If I had to chose a film to watch for full 24hours that would be it. Every time you see something more in it, something that makes it more real! One of the best films I've ever seen.... EVER!!!"

In my opinion it lives up to its predecessor but with its own unique tone, with each offering a unique experience that the characters go through in different stages in their lives.\n\nThe excitement and youth of the first, stays in that very moment locked away. A moment they refer to often, as maybe their most memorable or fondest night ever shared with another individual, while here in the present, we find a slew of new emotions evolved from the first experience, but now with more mature and worn out individuals, that find themselves going through a similar scenario.\n\nI watch these incredible performances where practically, all they are doing is walking around and catching up, yet I find myself captivated.\n\nWhen I think about it on a technical aspect, most of the scenes, are shot in one shots. Personally, I can't help but feel as if it's a live performance that was all done in single takes. This footage feels so real to me, more like a play than a movie.\n\nYet another thing that helped me connect so well with these characters, is the feeling that I've had almost identical conversations or thoughts myself, and to see them be played out feels so personal.\n\nIn the end of the movie, we are still left wondering, how does it work out for Celine and Jesse? It ends as ambiguously as the first did, and in a way, it's even more ambiguous if we take in consideration what happened the last time they were in a similar situation.\n\nIt really can all boil down to our own outlook on life and love. With everyone having their own experiences and finding themselves at different stages in life.\n\nFor now, I consider myself somewhat hopeful. I guess we'll find out in Before Midnight."

Well, have I got a surprise for you. This movie contains little more than A and B long shots, which to you non-film uber-nerd folks means person A talking and then person B talking for long takes with few or no cuts. There are also very few ellipses, which means that the story is in real time. Therefore, all this movie contains is talking between the two characters for about an hour an a half on any mundane subject from religion to love to world pollution to politics and on and on and on and on. Enjoy!"

Even with movies I love, my enjoyment is usually of a very abstract, aesthetic kind...I admire this or that thing, this bit of dialogue, the way that scene was lit. With Before Sunset, I can't even comment on it so bloodlessly. I felt like I was face to face with my own joys and disappointments when I was watching it. A masterpiece. Richard Linklater is probably the most gifted and humanistic director alive...which is strange, because he's so unprepossessing, and has no particular aura of auteurist holiness. (Bully for him). Film students are probably still more influenced by Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorcese than Linklater, which is a shame."

Ethan Hawke, gaunt, hunched and withered, and Julie Delpy, wiser and better, accidentally (or did fate set it up?) meet up a decade after their previous single day together to spend another day reliving it, and catching up with a decade that they eventually realize was all about that one day. What a love story this is! No love-making, but intelligent conversation that is orgasmic, covering the environment, Buddhism, the modern self, psychotherapy, relationships, America and Americans, sex and gender, God \u0096 pretty much everything that young people care about in ones and share about in twos. This is an even better film than the first one, sharper and tighter, and benefiting from the ground laid down by it, so that we now care so much more deeply for this couple that were essentially strangers to us the first time around. America meets Europe again here, as the couple walk around talking over Parisian backdrops that are not at all hard to look at. This is a must see, but only after you've seen Before Sunrise. I loved these two films with only a day in between viewing them. What would it have been to have seen Before Sunrise when it first came out and to then see Before Sunset a decade later? The heart aches at the thought\u0085\u0085."

In the end of before sunrise they promised that they will meet in Vienna again after 6 months. But Celine doesn't show up because of her grandma's demise. So after they meet we find out that Jesse is married with a son and Celine is dating a photo journalist. They then travel around France sharing their past experiences until Jesse has to catch his return flight in evening. I loved before sunrise as I feel its a best love story I have ever seen. In sunrise they spent a whole day together and part ways the next day. So as a audience we also feel like we have spent a memorable day with them. But in sunset we get a feeling of an unsatisfied one day picnic we have on Sundays because they spend very less time together. Another drawback I felt was with its abrupt ending without any proper conclusion. And last thing I felt disappointed was that Jesse and Celine don't have the same chemistry which they had in sunrise. But there are some great scenes. My favorite scene was in the cab where Celine shows her frustration of not being in a committed relationship and in return Jesse talks about his failing marriage and both wanting but unable to touch each other. On the whole, before sunset falls on those category of sequels which only partially captures the magic of its predecessor."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Before Sunset\" is definitely one of those few select films which are great sequels to their predecessors. The funny thing is you don't ever feel inclined to critique such films, you just want to bask in its sunlit perfection, walk with the characters in the eternal city of Paris and get lost in a reverie. It's like a capsule of time taken out of the entangled lives of these two dislodged yet strangely connected souls, a page in their journal. You seem to project those unexplained emotions in your heart in the brilliantly portrayed characters, lose yourself in the meandering by- lanes of Paris and the words and repartee of the protagonists and you realize slowly with the characters the cost of missed opportunities and those painful could-have-beens. Despite the expected pragmatic, mature tones of the characters neither Jesse nor Celine could fully escape the effects of that intoxicating night at Vienna all those years back as we are left to imagine how it must have been in that original moment for it reverberate through the rest of their life leading up to Paris. And just like before, they set out to create another litany of vignettes that will surely go on to have repercussions in their lives. At the end you feel like it's the perfect sequel to \"Before Sunrise\", like you have always imagined Jesse and Celine to steal a few lost hours from the eternal flow of time and continue the conversation they had 10 years back in Vienna. The script, the walk and talk shoot, Nina Simone and that waltz song goes on to show the burgeoning brilliance of Linklater, ably assisted by Ethan and Julie. Echoing Jesse at the beginning of the movie here's the perfect test to examine if you are a romantic or a cynic - if you love Before Sunset you are bound to be a true romantic."

This is a sequel to Before Sunrise and what one notices at first is that the filmmakers actually waited for the characters to grow older in real time so that now we meet Jesse and Celine they have actually aged, which makes their dialogues and relationship all the more relatable. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have no problem going back to their older roles and it is refreshing to see them talk and act naturally- they have great chemistry. Do watch this if you enjoy realistic romantic films."

It doesn't drift into conventions, it makes its own rules. This film is what romantic movies should always be: true to life. It doesn't shy away from the fact that these two may not get together, it doesn't provide a simple answer. It asks the audience to take the journey with them. The last 20 minutes of this movie is some of the most honest, heartfelt, and emotionally draining moments I have seen in film. Looking forward to Before Sunrise 3 in 2013. 10/10"

I suppose there will be some \"spoilers\".\n\nThe first movie introduces 2 characters Jesse and Celine who meet up in a train en-route to Vienna. They feel a connection and decide to take a tour of the city together. The movie chronicles their tour and ends with them going their separate ways. Throughout the movie, both Jesse and Celine talk & exchange viewpoints. As they see the world in very different ways, there are a lot of enlightening conversations about life, death, the state of the world at the time etc.\n\nThe second movie picks up nine years after Jesse and Celine's original trip to Vienna. Jesse is now married with a son and has authored a book based on his experiences with Celine. During a book tour ending in Paris, he meets Celine once again and once again they roam around the city sparking up a variety of conversations. The director leaves the ending deliberately ambiguous as to whether or not Jesse gets back together with her.\n\nOverall, while they do tend to drag sometimes, these 2 movies are very original and worth watching at least once, especially if you're sick of the hundred odd rom coms beating around the bush but admittedly the second one is not as good as the first.\n\nI would rate the movies individually Before Sunrise-8/10 Before Sunse-7.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The sequel to the adorable and dreamy Before Sunrise from 1995, Before Sunset meets the original film's characters, American writer Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French social activist Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years in the future, in the year 2004. The turn of the century definitely made it's impact on our two heroes, as did the turns of time. Now being 32 years old (as opposed to 23, the character's age in the first film), they are both much more mature and much less naive about what life has to offer them. Sure, on the outside they both made it well: Jesse is married with a child he thinks the world of, and is just visiting France during a PR tour for his recent published best seller (loosely based on his night with Celine, by the way). Celine, on the other hand, is engaged in a meaningful relationship as well, and after living several years in the states, where she finished her second degree, she is now an active member in several environmental organizations. Alas, underneath the surface, they are both aching inside. Neither of them is happy with the life he or she is leading, and they both find themselves compromising in cozy relationships and careers, with the memory of that mid-90's night still very much alive in their hearts and minds.\n\nThis time around, Jesse and Celine stroll around Paris rather than Vienna, and as much as this city is beautiful and filled with inspiration perhaps even more then Vienna, it is something we have seen in many films as well, and the cinematography doesn't really indicate something new about the city. As opposed to Sunrise, the two lost souls now only have time until Sunset to catch up with each other, when Jesse's flight back to the states leaves. They spend their few hours together talking about their 1994 rendezvous and how it altered their lives, then exchanging their mutual disappointment from the twists and turns of life, touching numerous social ideals on the way.\n\nSunset deals with some interesting concepts of second chances and becoming sober from all sorts of promiscuous ideals one might have as a young individual. It is a mature, self-aware film, that meets our heroes now leading a much more realistic, yet extremely disappointing, life style. While all this might add up to a positive overall viewing of this feature film, I myself found it to be quite anti-climatic in comparison with Before Sunrise. Since I know real life is often depressing, and rarely leads one to his true calling of his heart, I often turn to movies in search of a more escapist experience, that'll shed some light on my life, rather than paint my future in very bleak colors. As a 25 year old young adult currently writing this review, I would like to think that life has more to offer than yearning for some old sweetheart while watching my years fade away. Whilst Jesse eventually gets his second chance to meet Celine in Before Sunset, the movie never really lets you know what happens with them afterward, and instead leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied for large periods of times. Being such a stubborn dreamer, you would have to excuse me for not buying into this perspective of life (yet?).\n\nFor what it's worth, I could have been much more satisfied have I had only seen the first installment of this love story, being left with much hope and desire, rather than being faced with the biting reality in the second installment."

        "review_detailed_main": "As with its predecessor, 'Before Sunset (2004)' is at its most successful when it focuses on the relationship between its two core characters, this time painting it as a painfully accurate reunion. This focus on 'what could've been' and 'what may be yet to come' is where the piece really shines, crafting a palpable dynamic between its two long-lost lovers and giving the story a strange sense of suspense. Of course, a seventy-five-minute conversation is going to meander. This is especially noticeable when the topics of conversation turn to philosophising, with changes in direction sometimes being as drastic as going straight from \"how are you?\" to \"do you believe in god?\". When this is the case, the dialogue reflects the writers far more than the characters - I mean, you can practically hear Linklater saying some of this stuff - and the experience is worse for it. Still, it's all remarkably compelling for what it is. Despite being slightly theatrical, it feels incredibly 'real' as compared to others in the genre. There are no grand gestures or arbitrary break-ups, there's just an excellently evolving relationship. It's also great how the space in-between words is sometimes as important as the words themselves, indicative of subtle writing that really knows what it's doing. Overall, it's about as good as it's predecessor. As an experiment, it works rather well. It's not always the most engaging affair but it often makes you smile and it has a decent pace considering it's a constant 'talk-fest'. The core relationship is what really keeps you watching and it really is one of the best in its genre. 6/10"

This isn't a flaky/surface romance; it runs extremely deep, and it is every bit as good or better than the original, only with a different flavor. It's the same type of blunt honesty between the characters as in the first film, and the chemistry is tangible.\n\nThis film puts Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy back together about 10 years later, and the results are intriguing and incredible. The way these two interact is so genuine and pure; it sets the tone of realism laced with magic. The whole movie explores a build-up of feelings between them, with a sort of phony 'everything is fine' wall which slowly crumbles as the movie goes on, and with this journey, you see the cynicism and the experiences that have shaped them over time. There are some definite twists to the story, but they are realistic twists, and seem to be for realism's sake only, rather than for viewer appeasement. Whoever wrote this screenplay should receive an academy award, if they haven't.\n\nThis movie runs so deep, it helps me rekindle beliefs of love, and challenges me to trust so much more in what I know is true in my heart. It really addresses the issue of how so many people get stuck and caught up in what they think society expects of them. They forget that the heart knows; the heart is what you start with as a child- it's what makes you yearn, desire, hope, and burn for someone; it is the essence of a human being.\n\nThe characters demonstrate the cold logic that takes over with age, combined with a loss of the youthful hope from so many disappointments. You can really see these things in the characters, but there is a glimmer that really returns throughout their experience together. Julie Delpy truly threw herself into her role, and I can't help but think there is something more going on between her and Ethan Hawke; it almost seems too good to be true. Anyway, I gave this movie a 10. It deserves it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I never thought 1995's \"Before Sunrise\" was any great shakes perhaps because the concept felt like a romantic conceit albeit an intelligently scripted one especially for a film about a couple of kids in their early twenties. Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths. Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from caf\u00e9 to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's \"My Dinner With Andre\" than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.\n\nLooking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screen writing credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie."

Some profane lines in between, as the movie is wholly a conversation between two opposite sex adults. I felt there wasn't much of back-ground music in this. Still there are number of songs which are nice. The movie too gets boring after a while, still happy it is just for 80 minutes. The bottom line : Like a typical adult male fantasy to meet a nice girl traveling, still I feel a tiny-bit yawning."

Ethan Hawke's answers at the beginning did not feel like real answers to me (\"Isn't everything autobiographical?\" - What does that mean?), and Julie Delpy's role didn't seem personable or that deep. The dialog to me seemed so stilted that I got uncomfortable just watching the movie. The neat thing about this movie is that it really is centered on just those two characters. When that is done well, it can be riveting. But that makes it high risk - if you don't like the characters, there is nothing else in the movie. I didn't like the characters, so for me, the movie was a turn off."

It is very simple yet so deep and meaningful that sticks in your mind for a while. The movie barely has plot but it captures you from the beginig till the end. Before Sunset as the other two movies is not just a love story, it's a movie about life. Two characters are demonstrated as two human beings with their own strengths and flaws just like all of us. Therefore, watching the movie and moving on with them and listening to their conversation during time is like taking a look back at our own lives and having chance to reinvestigate our thaughts about what actually matters in life. It's within those lines that the movie sets It's points. It reminds us that how small moments can change our lives. That how time can be cruel and forgiving at the same time and that you got to enjoy the ride not just looking forward to the destination. The atmosphere is similar to the first movie. However, dialogues wisely show the effect of time on Jessie and Celine to further develope their characters and their relationship. Performances are so natural that you reckon everything is spontaeous. The shooting and frames are beautiful and the movie finishes with a magical ending, keeps you wondering about what will hapen next."

The best moment of this film, actually while the lead characters, Jesse and Celine, meet again, their having conversation to each other so on. We know as viewer, they are attract each other, but something in their way. They are 'perfect match' but not in 'perfect time'. The director/writer do a great job for the shot and scripts.

Like its predecessor, Before Sunset a romantic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:\n\nAs with Before Sunrise, the emotional impact and reward from this movie comes from the level of resonance one experience with the characters - more dialogue will hit home, train of thoughts will be relatable, and they will undoubtedly be more sympathetic. Audiences younger or older risk losing a lot of value and emotional satisfaction because of this very reason.\n\nAn important thing to be aware about is the tone in the dialogue. Before Sunset is cruder than its the prequel, and there are frequent gags and talk about sexual subjects which can risk upsetting conservative or sensitive people, or at least detract from the overall viewing experience. The moral grounds in itself is also quite loose, as it becomes more and more apparent throughout the runtime that Jesse and Celine are tempted by the thought of leaving their current partners for each other, which doesn't feel entirely in line with the people we got to meet in the prequel. This can be perceived as quite questionable.\n\nFinally, the resolution to this movie can also by some be perceived as unrewarding, as consequences are not really dealt with as consequences, or at least one in the same way as one would expect from the prequel. It is hard to say more before giving away the plot, but before watching Before Sunset, one could benefit more from being less conservatively consequential here than in Before Sunrise. Do remember, however, that this movie impacts you depending on how much you can relate with the life situation Jesse and Celine are in, and that nothing in this review thereby can be taken as a final say.\n\nMy personal grade: a disappointing 6/10.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ultimately, a satisfying little movie; even for a late 50's non-romantic, such as myself. Congratulations to the two principals for carrying the entire movie on the strength of one nonstop dialogue....indeed, I have never seen a movie that even attempted such a premise. Hawke and Delpy actually carry it out. I was tired, and listened to much of the first half of the movie with my eyes closed. Yes, I might have even nodded-off for a few minutes. But the thread of dialogue kept my interest up enough that I had to start watching at about the same time the two were at Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now I know I don't need to see Paris - this movie was the ultimate travelogue of the River Sienne. The shoreline promenade evoked memories of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and it's dramatic end. Now that I think about it, I doubt they really had such elaborate concrete work in the days of the French Revolution, only in the Liam Neeson movie of it. Funny, how the setting had such a timeless aspect to it. Anyway, I digress....could they have pulled-off this eighty-five minute conversation (in real time: probably about three hours of relationship time) on a blank sound stage, without the beautiful backdrop of Paris to enhance their every word? Only with your eyes closed.\n\nStrange, that the writers and principals would decide to reprise the original movie, nine years afterward. It works well, and has a very credible feel to it. I suspect that this one will be \"an all time favourite\" of many a young, sophisticated, and well-educated female; it's niche audience is most certainly in the female dormitories of many a college campus. For them, it is the ultimate \"chick flick\", for me....I'm just surprised I liked it as much as I did."

        "review_detailed_main": "I love Richard Linklater. He's a terrific filmmaker who's made some of my favorite films. I think Waking Life is absolutely brilliant. However, in my opinion, he's also made some duds. But that is the price of pushing the envelope and I don't want to discourage that. I too thought that Before Sunrise was a warm and wonderful film. I'm a huge Julie Delpy fan. I think the idea of having the actors from the original film contribute to the screenplay of the sequel is inspired. Bravo Richard, Bravo! I love that about you. What I didn't love was the result. Basically it didn't go anywhere. Flat beginning, middle and end. No magic. Maybe that is what it was trying to convey, the loss of magic, inability to recapture the magic. But why make a film about that? Why end the story of these two characters on a down note? You should have avoided the sequel and let us imagine a better future for them.\n\nI wouldn't be writing this except that I was perusing the top 250 list and was shocked to find this on it. Now I accept the fact that the list contains goofy choices and omits some outstanding films. I'm used to that. But, WOW! Its just getting wackier."

I had heard some \"rumor\" of this being a follow up to another film but I paid little attention.\n\nTruth be told, this is a brilliant film. I'm not quite sure which part is the best - the subtle acting or the casual conversation in which this film is written. From the very first instant, the audience is drawn into the story as a sort of \"fly\" who happens to be listening to two long lost friends and lovers. Both Hawke and Delpy are so comfortable and casual with each other that you feel as though this really happened and is not just some movie.\n\nHilariously witty dialogue and true to life observations, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. There is a definite passion that emits from both actors, creating an even stronger sense of belief in the possibility of this happening. Absolutely brilliant, this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Brilliant acting is only the beginning of the greatness of this film.\n\n10/10 A MUST see!"

No, the truth is that I wasn't expecting an ending, I was too occupied immersed in the story.

It is not only a story about two people, but also a history of Europe during these 20 years.\n\nThis film is full of beautiful intellectual dialogs and beautiful shots of Paris.

Surprisingly short, yet shot in 'real time', the acting is strong and the script is a magnificent piece of work.\n\nSome may feel that this was more mature than the first film, but in ways, that's how it should be. The film is completely about two characters and the world around them is passingly incidental. However, years have gone by and they are now in their 30s, dealing with concepts of marriages and relationships that are running into difficulties and pondering questions of faithfulness to practicality vs daring pursuit of happiness... and perhaps fate.\n\nCould not take my eyes off the film and the ending hits the mark perfectly. I particularly loved how the performances were top notch and natural, nothing went 'over the top' and the dialogue captures the spirit of the first film without trying hard to reproduce or 'go own better'.\n\nHighly recommended and this \"Before...\" series is magic and moving, as is the scenery and direction. Surprised that it's an American production. Can't wait to see the final installment and Boyhood."

This is the only movie I can recall ever having seen in which there are no time-cuts; the movie is 77 minutes long, both in runtime and in \"movie-time.\" In every other movie I have ever seen, there exists a story, and then it's like the story is run through a series of un-reality filters to crunch it into a certain amount of time, and distort reality in such a way as to make the characters seem more dramatic and more real than real life, while at the same time being very unreal if you actually think about it. This movie doesn't do that.\n\nThey took a moment in time that was a powerful memory, and they didn't translate it to \"movie land,\" they just show it. And that's all..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Notice that I said \"continuation\", as opposed to \"sequel\", which is mostly a Hollywood term applied to cashing in on the success of an original film. There is nothing \"commercial\" about Richard Linklater's inventive, playful, wistful, and ultimately piercing story of two people many of us felt a deep cinematic bond with in the first film. For everyone who was content and beguiled by the aching ambiguity of the ending of \"Before Sunrise\", who felt no need to explore what became of Jesse and Celine, I think it's safe to say that our hearts still yearned to see them together. What \"Before Sunset\" does so beautifully is to show the effect of time on these two soul mates, how young love and youthful idealism have given way to life's weary compromises and bittersweet memories of what might have been. The torrent of glorious dialogue is back, only this time it's as remarkable for what is not said as much as what should be said. Jesse and Celine circle around each other with small talk, a rudimentary update of their lives in the intervening 9 years that slowly, irrevocably, and anxiously builds up to confessional regret. To see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy again 9 years later is like running into two dear old friends we haven't seen in a long time. Their rapport and chemistry together is extraordinary. To those who feared this film would somehow diminish the specialness of the original, it feels like an unequivocal homecoming. And the true miracle is it leaves you wanting more. Something tells me that many of us will never get enough of Jesse and Celine, and in that creative spirit, I'm sure Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have Truffaut's \"Antoine Doinel\" films with Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Michael Apted's \"7-up\" series well in mind. For the time being, we have this wondrous little film to be thankful for."

It is a movie that is achingly romantic, yet features not a single kiss, or even hand-holding.

Before you watch this movie, i would recommend you to watch the previous part. By the end of first part, the two characters decide to meet at a spot which they were expected to do by the beginning of the second part, but quite contrary (yet very realistic) to it, they couldn't. The way they find each other is awesome which is depicted in a very beautiful way. The movie then again runs on a smooth note and they start rediscovering each other again. Hawke and Delpy are the only two faces you are gonna find throughout the movie but you feel like witnessing two worlds walking languidly.\n\nThe climax of the movie is more than what one could ever expect. It ends at a note that's as sweet as a jack fruit and keeps revolving inside your mind for the next couple of days. This movie falls into the category of Sweet Land, Lost in Translation and Finding Neverland.\n\nI would rate this movie a 10 upon 10 and highly recommend it for sensible viewers like me who know how deep an uttered word could go and how deeper an unuttered word could run."

I like how the location is now in Paris, that most of the movie's length features the great sights of the great city; it's walkways and alleys between tall old buildings, the cruise on the river, and also of course the famous Parisian garden walkways. I also like how this time the movie ends more in conformity to what the audience will prefer more when they see how Before Sunrise ended. Yet I score this movie lower than its predecessor because the whole thing only feature a faster time than the former. I like how Hawke and Delpy still managed to stay consistent and kept their connection nicely, even after literally nine years."

Though I wont discuss any technical details about the video or audio quality of the video I got. What I will be discussing is a about how did they manage to fuse Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Those nine long years of stillness. An open ending that we just wished that someone knew how it ended. That's what kept me clinging on to Before Sunrise. It ended not with a happy nor sad ending. But it made some of us empty in some way making us want to know more about them. So what we did was to watch it all over for so many times over and over and over. And with every end of the movie we learned more about them. A hundred and five minutes of pure conversation with one another. Their glances and stares. The empty streets they've walked. The topics they discussed. Even though we watch the film for so many times we can never end this movie. They never exchanged phone numbers, never gave their address to one another. What they only have was just a promise to meet again after six months at the train station. If ever one of them gave away their phone number. We could just probably generate a happy ending, because either one of them can call the other to meet sometime. And just because of those digits, we can be rest assured that they'll see each other again.\n\nFinally after nine years of waiting we finally have a sequel. Though I hate the idea of having a sequel because it might spoil those special moments in the movie. But I just can't blame them to make one, because there are times that we should know about it. Because the movie moved us so much in a way that Jesse and Celine were more than just characters in a simple movie, but it slowly seeps into our minds often that they've became a part of ours. Before Sunset was seamlessly appended that those questions we used to ask ourselves were answered, like 'did they ever meet again?' or 'what happened after six months?' Just don't be surprised that a measly eighty minutes is short for a sequel. The film runs in real-time where Jesse has to board a plane to New York. Jesse or Jesse Wallace(they finally figured out a surname) attended a book signing of his first published book in Paris. And there she met Celine. Then the story continues where they just both walked on the streets of Paris on their way to the caf\u00e9. By just watching them together again made a feeling of joy and contentment within me that kept me glued to their dialogues. Again, the best thing about this movie is the simplicity. Before Sunset was just showcasing ordinary lives of two strangers who have met nine years ago on a train. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, even though you haven't seen Before Sunrise. And if you liked Before Sunset, without delay try to watch Before Sunrise to complete the picture. A+"

Before Sunset (2004) is the result of three intelligent minds working together.Those three people are the director Richard Linklater and the actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.They all were also writing the movie.The dialogue between Jesse and Celine remains interesting all the time.They're at the same page with the interaction.That makes you believe these people belong together.The chemistry between the main actors hasn't faded at all.Not even the least bit.It's not impossible if the relationship of these two takes a further course and the movie series goes on in the future.Hawke has suggested such an idea.I wouldn't mind that if they succeed to keep it as interesting.These two movies certainly have worked.Both of them are kind of movies that make the world look a little less cynical."

So when you've experienced what the writer was trying to do, but you won the real McCoy, then its easy to be critical.\n\nTo me the movie lacked substance, the actors didn't really appear in love, but more like a couple of actors trying to appear this way.i never saw the first movie, as i was unaware that it existed, but i feel it must have been far superior to this one.\n\ni can well imagine that people who have always dreamed of true romance and mystic, but have never obtained it would enjoy this movie, because they are looking through a different keyhole.\n\nits a shame the world could not see through the keyhole of my romance, it would have been a box office hit."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset follows Jesse and Celine 9 years after they first met as they meet up once more and hang out for the hour or so before Jesse has to catch a plane.\n\nSimilar to 'Before Sunrise', this is a movie about the same two people talking. And that's it. No real plot or anything, it's just a reunion. And it still works. These characters haven't lost their flair quite yet, it's still interesting to watch them interact with one another.\n\nOnce again, the acting is all pretty solid as well, with both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy pulling off great performances. And as per usual, they play off of each other very well.\n\nAnd yet again, the writing is good. The characters have realistic, yet semi important, conversations that are rarely boring or uninteresting.\n\nStill, with a movie like this the pacing does suffer. There are scenes in this movie that dragged more than they should have, and they were noticeable. It was noticeable when they picked up again, and they were noticeable when they started, for no particular reason really. It's just how the movie is structured.\n\nThis review has been a rehash of the one I wrote for 'Before Sunrise', although I do have one new thing to say. There's a scene towards the 1 hour mark where one of the characters has a sudden outburst and it's kind of out of place. Everything's going well and their conversations are wrapping up and suddenly one of them just gets super mad and starts ranting. While it wasn't totally out of nowhere, it noticeably changed the tone so quickly that it was hard to ignore.\n\nOverall Before Sunset is, while good, not as good as it's predecessor. Everything good about the first one is good in the second one, but tonally this sequel has some challenges. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you liked the first one. There's really nothing new here from the first one."

And yeah, I'm surprised how they did it in a great way.\n\nThe plot of the first movie showed almost 24 hours of beautiful, realistic, and kind of mysterious romantic relationship development of the two strangers, of course, cut into 90 minutes. But what they did in the second movie, they filmed that 80 minutes real time, in a \"one shot\" (using different camera angles), so you literally walk with the couple across the streets of Paris without any cut or interruption. And there is continuous dialog, very similar as you would have in their situation. They talk now mostly about their lives in their 30s and typical life events for this age. This can be for someone exhausting because there is literally no pause or distraction but people who likes long dialogs focused on details in human interaction, they will love this movie.\n\nAgain, it graduated from the beginning, the interaction development was done amazingly, and I loved the end so much - that is where the chemistry between them is again at the very height."

        "review_detailed_main": "I purposely waited over a space of about 11 months in-between viewing Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (they were after all made nine years apart) in order to create some sort of feeling; some sort of atmosphere; some sort of reaction. Although this tactic required patience and tolerance, I feel it actually worked in a way. What made it a reality is when you first get a glimpse of the character of Celine (Delpy) and then Jesse's (Hawke) hilarious reaction. I myself recently met up with someone who means rather a lot to me; I hadn't seen her for the best part of a year and although our rendezvous was actually planned; Before Sunset's encounter really was all about the girl seeking out the guy and surprising him in the shop so although I can't relate to Jesse's surprise as he wasn't expecting her; I can relate to his emotions of reunion.\n\nI mentioned in my review of Before Sunrise the feeling of luck and chance that was evident (and pretty much acted as the theme for the film) and also the atmosphere of 'fly on the wall' film-making \u0096 it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in an English speaking film before but Before Sunset feels more cinematic; it feels more like it's a film with a setting, characters and a script but I do not mean this as criticism it merely proves what a good director Linklater is when it comes to his own universe of films. If he had done what he did before with Before Sunset, he would have pretty much made the same film as he did nine years ago and that wouldn't have been good.\n\nWhat I liked about this film more than its elder brother is the feeling that we know the characters and I felt more settled with the exchanges flying to and fro. The characters repeat to one another what they've done in the nine years in-between films without actually showing it meaning you have to listen to catch up. This happens quite early on and thus; draws you in immediately as a film that's dialogue driven like this one has to have the audience hooked from the start and the back stories are a great piece of nostalgia; not only for the characters but also for us: the viewers who also want to know what's happened to them.\n\nWhen these two people talk, they deal with issues only people who know each other or have shared something very special together can talk about. In the first film; these issues that revolve around first loves, what you look for in a partner, etc. were dealt with in a rather colloquial manner that I found a little odd as they'd only really known each other for half an hour and had only met on a train through a chance encounter, but here it fits perfectly since they actually know, remember and probably love each other.\n\nThe film makes good use of its location in Paris as it did in Before Sunrise with Vienna and it really doesn't seem like its only 77 minutes short. The long takes and nothing-ness dialogue make it so that it feels like the whole day goes past but again, this isn't a bad thing as it's 'this kind of film'. If you can look past the way the characters overreact nearer the end and some of the 'filla' in the script at various times; you'll find a film that comes close to adding a new definition to the genre of 'Romantic/Comedy'."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of the time, sequels are for big budget summer blockbusters when studios realize they can double their profits by releasing a movie that's basically the same. So I assume most people were surprised that Before Sunrise, a small romance that only made about $5.5 million would warrant a sequel. But it did. I haven't seen the first one, which was released in 1995, but that didn't stop me from seeing its sequel, Before Sunset. I have learned that you usually don't need to see the first movie in series to understand it. Some enjoyment may fall out of it, but it's still coherent nonetheless. Before Sunset is a sequel where you don't need to see the first. In fact, I think I probably benifited from not seeing the first.\n\nJesse (Ethan Hawke) is promoting his book, which is largely based on the events of the evening in Before Sunrise, where he had met Celeste (Julie Delpy) in Vienna and spent an unforgettable night. They had agreed to meet up again in six months in Vienna. Celeste finds Jesse after the book signing and they talk. They walk around Paris and talk. And talk. And talk.\n\nIt's movie like this that you recognize as being great, yet you can't really explain it. It could be how much I seemed to get to know and like these characters just by hearing them talk. The camera never leaves them, which makes us seem like intruders and eavesdroppers to their life. It could be the simplicity of their lives that we find fascinating, and how we can relate to both of them in more ways than one. It could be the sophistication of the dialogue (which was written by director Richard Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy). The spontaneity of the dialogue makes the movie feel more real. And it's all in real time, which adds a sense of urgency to the movie.\n\nBoth Hawke and Delpy, who are basically the only characters in the film, put in good acting jobs here. They exhibit the normal characteristics of life-they aren't over the top or caricatures. They seem just like average people, and that adds to the charm and the overall real feel to the movie. They have forgotten some of the events of the evening nine years ago (as would the viewer). The constant barrage of dialogue doesn't hurt it; actually, it's very entertaining and interesting. They talk about various subjects, and you never feel time dragging or anything of the like. Before Sunset is simply a beautiful film. It's simplistic and down to earth. You may not like my lack of words to describe it, but once you see it, you'll be at a loss for words, also.\n\nMy rating: 10/10\n\nRated R for language and sexual references."

From the conversation we learn their current situation and they referred to an event from the last film.

The problem is that the real film only starts somewhere in the middle of the film, until then they talk trivial things and nonsense.

Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, it was very dialogue-intensive and some of the dialogue is just incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing stuff.\n\nBefore Sunset is still very dialogue-intensive. This is still an irritation in that you want some respite from this, some period of reflection and calm. However, in this case it does propel the story forward, unlike Before Sunrise where the dialogue seemed to go in circles and not really go anywhere.\n\nThat is where Before Sunset is so much better. By setting it nine years after the first movie, you get a a more complete story, more character development, more a sense of what they mean to each other, more genuine emotion.\n\nFor these reasons, making this sequel is a stroke of genius on Richard Linklater's part. Instead of a snapshot of these two people's lives, we have a timeline, a sense of lives progressing and changing, of memories and regrets. Not ships passing in the night (as the first movie made them out to be), but soulmates."

In Jesse and Celine, he has found an attractive couple who play well together and what's more important, they get our attention from the beginning.\n\nJesse and Celine belong together, as it's obviously noted in the film. In spite of the movie being a continuous dialog, it never bores, but one can see that the picture is not for everybody. Mr. Linkletter's great achievement has been the fact that he kept it at 80 minutes long, anything more than that would had bored us, perhaps.\n\nJulie Delpy has a radiant beauty. She seems to be more mature for her years. On the other hand, Ethan Hawke shows more chiseled features; he seems to be older. Delpy and Hawke play well together. As it happens when people that have a lot in common and where there's a real friendship, these two can stay away from one another, but the moment they meet, they pick up where they left off.\n\nSince the director and his two stars collaborated with the screen play, it is easy to see they all were very attuned to the material and it shows on the screen."

There isn't to much I can say about it because its already been said. The acting is fantastic as well as the writing. The directing has a low budget feel. And I love the scenery.

How amazing were the uninterrupted scenes! How stunning is Julie Delpy! Can anybody pass me her number? Ethan Hawke does a great job as well.

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a film that many people relate to, but most who relate to it will be ashamed to admit it. It's unconventionally romantic, emotionally complex, and much too real at times.\n\nOne of the reasons why I love this film is it's difficult to deal with. You find yourself wanting what they want, yet you know you shouldn't. It's as if we all become the characters the moment the film starts and we are taken on a journey of deep existential and moral questions. We know the answer to the moral questions, but we pretend we don't know. We pretend Jesse and Celine are the heroes we are rooting for to win, but we know they are the villains of the story.\n\nWhile Before Sunrise was an innocent movie about two young people with innocent and pure intentions, Before Sunset is about how the same people are now impure and not innocent. They are manipulative from the very beginning, manipulating themselves and the whole situation, but their passion and love is the same as in the first movie.\n\nThis is an incredibly sexy movie about two people; one is up to no good and she knows it deep down, and the other is a dirtbag who pretends to be an innocent good guy. But Linklater lets us pretend that they are both innocent for our own selfish benefit, then at the end we are left secretly shameful of what we've done. It's almost like we ourselves directed the story where it went and we are left feeling guilty that we did such a thing. However, it couldn't have happened any other way.\n\nJesse and Celine are good representations of humanity. Maybe once in a lifetime will someone have a passionate love like this, and Before Sunset shows us how we are often slaves to that passion. It's appeals to the 15-year-old in us even though we are now 30 years old.\n\nIt sounds like I'm down on the film, but all of these complexities are why I love it."

Art, movies, love, sex, dialogues, conversations, music and theater? Is that why society sometimes condemns art forms of sorts? To prevent a movement of unpredictable thought? An artist, like a person inlove with symptoms often operates in a dream world like a Henri Rouseau painting, this state is comforting and discomforting to the individual, and this discomfort often results in chaos which is artwork. This movie shows all of these components wrapped in to one."

        "review_title": "HK Neo Reviews: Before Sunset",
        "review_detailed_main": "Tagline: A genuine attempt at recapturing missed opportunities\u0085 Review by Neo: Perhaps it is almost truism to say that it is human nature to desire what we cannot have. It is part life that people will have to endure through situations where it will leave them with the feeling of what if and what could have been. While, people may say that what has passed has already passed and there is no point pondering or going back to asking what could have been. That is why Before Sunset is such a good movie as it is able to depict all these underlying and deep emotions that we have all kept within ourselves and soul.\n\nLife is never easy, meeting the right people requires the right timing and the right place, it may well be the right timing for you, but for someone else, the timing may not be right. The person may be still letting go out their past or may be the couple could be separated by distance. I remember a girl asking me, why we didn't meet earlier, at that moment, I just said that if we did, we might never be together. Thinking back, at this very moment, it makes you realised that while the timing was perfect for me personally, having just graduated, about to start a new job, and being able to let go of the past completely for the first time, but love is always a two way thing. Perhaps for the girl, we probably met 3 years too late.\n\n9 years on after their fateful meeting in Before Sunrise, they meet again in a bookshop in Paris and what is so wonderful about this movie is definitely the realism and the underlying emotional core which coincides perfectly with the witty and thoughtful dialogue. Once again the Wong Kar Wai's theme is evident here, love is all about timing, and it is no good meeting a person too early or too late. For the case of this couple, it is more of a case of everything being right, except for fate playing a game on their love. All these lead to further feeling of regret and the ever lingering emotion along the lines of unfinished businesses.\n\nLike Before Sunrise, the unfulfilling sudden ending gives hope to the audience to engage in their own sort of thinking. Perhaps, they won't be together, but at least their second meeting allowed them to give it a shot and finally a way to possibly put the regrets behind them. Then again, one needs to look no further than the current cinema running of Two Days in Paris for an answer.\n\nEthan Hawke is perfectly cast as the guy and Julie Dephy has this undeniable likable nature about her that makes her character so believable. Their chemistry together is just radiating off screen and on screen. There are moments in the car that allows Julie to expresses her acting chops and director Richard Linklater wisely engages some memorable flash back to evoke further emotions.\n\nAll in all, Before Sunset is by all means a good little movie that goes only a little longer than 1 hour. Not unlike the situation within the movie, perhaps Julie was right, maybe their relationship is only good for short term meetings. It is a pity that they weren't together 9 years ago, but what made the movie better is the manner that Ethan realised that his love for her was not just single sided and knowing the fact that at the same time when he was lonely and thinking about that someone, the feelings are mutual. As we venture to the end of this review, it is now 2:17 pm, on the 25th of March 2008, a moment that will not come back again and with a brink of an eye it have already been exactly 3 months since that fateful meeting. We might meet again one day or perhaps not, but I guess no one really knows. Let's finish off with a beautiful quote from Julie: \"memory is a wonderful thing, if we do not have to deal with the past\u0085\" A quote that rings so true and real\u0085 (Neo 2008)\n\nI rate it 8.5/10"

I've taken some time to reflect on the film and I think the ending in particular may be close to the best I've seen. Two simple lines that I don't think I'll ever forget.\n\nI could listen to the dialogue from this movie for the rest of days and not get sick of it. It feels so natural, but it is also incredibly thoughtful without feeling pretentious. Not a single line feels out of place. There is never a moment where you question whether that character would actually say such a thing.\n\nThese films are taking a lot out of me I have to say. They're hitting me hard (in the best way possible). I have one more to go, 'Before Midnight' and I can't wait to see it. This was perfect. 10/10."

        "review_title": "A Sequel That Compliments The Original",
        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this film's predecessor, \"Before Sunrise\" (1995), a lot because of its intriguing characters, the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy that never let up, and the dialogue that never felt written even though it was. The original movie could have easily done without the sequel, just as many films not based on comic book characters could. With that idea in mind, this film could have also brought the story of Jesse and Celine to a happy ending that felt like a cop out, which I expected it to do. However, director and writer Richard Linklater manages to bring these characters into full circle in \"Before Sunset\" without giving the romantic comedy fans what they want, which is why \"Before Sunset\" is just as good as its predecessor.\n\nTaking place nine years from where the original film left off, Jesse (Hawk) is no longer a slacker, but an established author who wrote a bestselling account of his one night with a French woman he barely knew. Since he did not exchange contact information with Celine (Delpy) when departing Vienna, writing this book was more or less the best way of contacting her, which he does successfully as he visits Paris and attends a book signing. She meets him there, and they discuss their lives since their previous encounter, as well as where their lives are headed. Perhaps the most pressing question, at least by eager audience members, is if they are actually going to stay together this time.\n\nAmazingly enough, its very easy to find this movie on DVD, and far more difficult to find \"Before Sunrise\". The latter film was released once on DVD in 1999 and, as of the date of this review, is out of print. It's surprising too, because I go to video stores and see the \"Two DVDs for One\" set of movies all the time. Sometimes the movies go together for obvious reasons, such as \"Cocoon\" (1985) and \"Cocoon: The Return\" (1988). Other times, I've seen \"Kids\" (1995) and \"The Rules of Attraction\" (2001) together in the same set for no apparent reason. \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" deserve to be watched in the order they were made, because I doubt moviegoers who had seen the former would not care about the characters in the latter. However, considering this film received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and its predecessor received no nominations (other than an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss), I could be wrong.\n\nAgain, though, this film is on par with the original in the excellent dialogue and the undeniable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. In this movie, there are longer shots of them walking and talking together. In the first movie, the cameras cut back and forth to show each one of them talking to the other. Here, they're in the same frame, so it's even more amazing that they engage in their conversations and never even come close to missing a beat.\n\nBeing a fan of the original film, part of me longed for Vienna over Paris. I know that's hard to believe, but the shots of the film in the original were so good, and the places Jesse and Celine visited were not touristy. In this film, they go around Paris, but they don't stop by the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre a.k.a the real touristy spots. They venture through the cobblestone streets and coffee shops, and eventually through gardens and aboard a ferry. All this great scenery, meanwhile, didn't distract from the characters' conversations.\n\nAnd again, Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy gave reason for why you wanted or needed to care about these characters. Especially in the case of Jesse having a troubled marriage and Celine having relationship problems, the dialogue reflected situations you could sympathize with if not relate to. And this script had an upper hand on the original in that the characters were far more mature now with problems that went beyond finding themselves. The ending also had you guessing, will Jesse leave his wife for Celine after all? Will he make his flight out in the end? These questions are not even hinted at before the end of the film.\n\nLast but not least, Julie Delpy's songs cemented this film's memorability for me, especially her song \"A Waltz For A Night\", which should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song that year. It was just one of the reasons I kept watching this film until the very end, not even stopping in between to use the restroom. It's all a testament to Linklater's ear for an intriguing film that does not necessarily tell a story. \"Before Sunset\" lives up to its hype, does not pander to unfamiliar audiences, and is just as good as the original."

The movie is brilliant and sincere and I don't even want to cheapen it by getting into it. See the first, see the second, love them both, and get over yourself. This movie isn't about you.

And even more poignant, because now, second time round, you know they mustn't let the other get away, so throughout you sit holding your breath, waiting to see whether they do end up just talking again, just making the brief connection, or whether this time they really seize the moment and are prepared to risk allowing the connection to be permanent. I didn't realise how profoundly it had affected me, how many little bits of it have kept playing on in my subconscious since I saw it the first time round. And it's so subtle, like with the first one, the emotion is portrayed with just a glance or a gesture. A hand reaching out to touch the other but pulled back at the last moment, a look of longing or sadness, an angry outburst that you know is misdirected, but genuine nonetheless. It's harder to be as cynical about this one than it is about the first because they themselves aren't so naive, so even jaded people who don't believe true love happens outside of the movies, but still deep inside wish that the happy endings could be true if only life didn't get in the way, can find something to identify with."

I hope they get the next one together and out soon-- they only have 2 more years! But seriously, Richard, Julie, Ethan: forget the 9 year apart time line-- give us another Jesse/Celine fix asap! And then another, and another! Never stop, it would be the most fabulous thing, to see Jesse and Celine throughout all their life together. Awesome! And btw, I thought it was Ethan that should have received the Academy Award for \"Training Day\", not Denzel- even though I love Denzel, and admire his work very much. It was sort of the same situation as in \"Rainman\"-- Tom Cruise did a more incredible job than Dustin, but Dustin had the showier part. Just a btw, sorry to leave the gist of the thread. Just a shout-out to Ethan, ya'll. A wonderful, wonderful, and I feel, greatly under-appreciated, actor."

Clearly, Linklater is a raw filmmaker and all involved are practising what they preach, they aren't proselytising, but they are making films about people who are segments of themselves.\n\nStylistically and tonally, it's a totally different film, it feels like it's grown, it's radical in just flowing almost in real-time, it follows from behind or infront, just watching them as they snatch just a little more time, something movies can rarely show well.\n\nIt has the most exquisite ending I've ever seen. A soft and generous compliment to the cab ride moment where we see the deep empathetic sadness of two people somewhere they never dreamed they would be.\n\nI found it really cathartic and emotional at the end. Not sure why. I guess I'm their age now, maybe that's it. This has always been my favourite, but viewed as a trilogy, it's a perfect middle part."

        "review_detailed_main": "When \"Before Sunrise\" was released,it was a very bold attempt that time,a movie based on just 2 characters all through running time was a risky attempt but Richard Linklater handled the script flawlessly off course aided by most natural acting in a romantic movie by Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy..\n\nIn 9 years the first movie had made so much fans that when it was announced a sequel was on the run,many fans like me felt a chill after we saw blown up sequels of Batman/Matrix.Amongst all these fears,I watched the movie but when it ended,I watched it again,this is only movie I have watched back to back so far.What made me do it: The movie runs for 80 minutes and from start to end you can't move your focus,one blink and you may miss a valuable dialog which might definitely change the way you think.The background is same that Ethan and Julie mainly walk and converse throughout the movie but its the conversation which has matured 1000 times than first movie.\n\nThere is nothing to complain,Before Sunrise excellently depicted 2 very young people meeting,Before sunset deals with more mature talk as their aging with time is so natural.This is which really makes this dualogy more interesting in repeat viewings.Without before sunset,the first movie was a great effort,addition of this masterpiece creates a synergistic original flavor to both movies.\n\nWhile the first movie was a great direction effort,here dialogs rule the show,many quotes of this movie can be complimented in real life (Believe me,have done that).Julie Delpy/Ethan Hawke/Linklater worked a lot on the script and it shows.This movie hits you like a 10 ton iron,somewhere you will find yourself in it.\n\nBefore Sunrise was 100 % duo perfect performance of Delpy and Hawke.This time Hawke is not bad but Julie really passes him by miles in her performance.May be its because she has more dialogs,may be I felt more sympathy for her character,but whatever,she is lovable,innocent and so natural in this movie.\n\nThe direction is flawless,the scenery mesmerizing and music score so penetrating,you fall in love with this movie and think about it for days.\n\nIn short,If you like romantic movies,this movie is holy book of all romantic movies.10 out of 10,too bad I can't give more..."

And yet it's entrancing; I was never bored or impatient, I felt like I knew the characters myself by the end of the film. It's not perfect; nine years is a long, long time to maintain an attraction, however deep, that only had one night to develop. But, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of watching these two characters reveal themselves with such subtlety and grace. The ending was absolutely perfect for the tone of the film -- if it had ended in the expected way, I would have liked the film far less. As it is, I can only once again emphasize how daring it was for the people involved in this film to make it exactly as it is in a time when movies increasingly rely on car chases, guns, bombs, and ever more explicit sex to attract their audiences."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset picks up right where the first film, 1995's Before Sunrise left off. For those who have seen that film, one would not expect a sequel especially a decade later. But this sequel captures the magic the first film left us as well as the charm, romance, and the ideological dialog. All this film is two people walking the streets of Paris and talking to each other, but we feel connected to these characters for the eighty minutes this film is on screen. The screenplay is very sharp and not once can we tell if the dialog is forced. This film is an example of how an excellent conversation should be, especially between people who haven't seen each other in ages.\n\nRichard Linklater's sequel reintroduces us to the characters of Jesse and Celine. Jesse is now a bestseller author who has written a book based on the one night the two of them had nine years earlier. While promoting his book in a bookshop, Jesse runs into Celine. With Jesse returning to the states that evening, the two spend the afternoon together catching up and reminiscing on what could have been.\n\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy continue to show such natural chemistry between each other. If I didn't know any better, they could have been two ordinary people having such an engrossing conversation on love, politics, and more ideology of that nature. This film doesn't need a large cast and I feel that both Hawke and Delpy were perfect in their roles.\n\nOverall, Before Sunset is an excellent sequel to one of the best original romantic films I have ever seen. Both of these films succeed without being sappy or forced. I liked the natural feel of this film and it's a shame Hollywood doesn't produce more films like these. They are the perfect compliment to the special-effects era of movies. This is a sweet, romantic modern-era romance film and a fitting sequel to Before Sunrise. I rate this film 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "In 1995,director Richard Linklater introduced movie audiences to Jesse(Ethan Hawke)and Celine(Julie Delpy),two strangers from America and France(respectively)who meet on a train,stop in Vienna,drift through the lovely,historic streets and architecture as they converse,bond and,ultimately connect,only to part ways,unsure(as was the viewers)as to whether they would ever see each other again.\n\nAlmost ten years later,Linklater,along with Delpy and Hawke,decided to continue the stories in real time,and this time an impromptu(and the script and story gives the viewer the right to doubt that)meeting during a book tour that Jesse is a part of to promote a novel he's written(regarding the fictionalized encounter he and Celine had)that stops in Paris,which just happens to be the home of Celine. They are elated to see each other at first,and then for the next(almost)two hours,proceed to take their conversation across the city. The mood changes in waves,as each examines their lives since their encounter and come to various philosophical realizations(or even un-realizations). Once again,as they both long for each other despite practically everything(i.e. he's married with a son,she's afraid of deep,ever-present relationships),and their closeness over this second bonding opens the door for perhaps another chance at romance that was kindled--and was extinguished just as quickly--and once again,you the viewer are left wondering: will they do it? Will it take this time? The possibilities.\n\nI was very pleased to see these character brought back. I was very impressed with the first movie,which I saw for free as part of a studio promo when I was in college,and felt after I saw it that this merited another look-see. A script penned by Hawke,Delpy,Linklater and Kim Krizan is written and rehearsed with such sharpness that,like the first firm,the feel of the conversation is relaxed and almost improvised in feel. Thes characters have grown up--in fact,in some ways,it feels like they've grown up possibly TOO much--but they still hold their memories and feelings with some of the same passion they had when they were twenty-somethings. Being of nearly the same age,I feel like this was the closest of just about any movie I saw out of the 90s that had ANY relation to my generation IMHO. This was not a widely released,nor wildly popular movie and that surprises me none.This is,like the last one,a purely conversational film and many people just simply have the patience for a film like that. I had been somewhat lazy about getting around to see this(on DVD,no less!)and maybe that came from subconsciously was afraid that a follow-up to the first movie might blow some of my theories or desires for the characters would not get realized or abused. I am happy to say after seeing this that none of that really happened. If anything,it actually carried along these characters in a natural arc that made them even MORE likable and real to me than previous.\n\nPersonally,I'd love to see an Act III of Jesse and Celine,maybe this time in the states. And like before,there should be no rush,since these characters had plenty of time to develop for a largely satisfying Act II."

Can you imagine that none of them is not even nominated for an Oscar? Speaks volumes about the Academy once more.\n\nThis is a very difficult movie to make. The ingredients need to be just right.

There's no background music (like in the Dogma movies) and the scenes are simple. For example there's this scene in a cafe (a great, old french cafe with fantastic athmosphere). They sit there and talk .. for about 20 minutes of the movie. and it's not even boring for the viewer. I mean, it's so \"real\", and so exciting to watch them getting in touch again.

Jessie and Celine are riding a train through Europe, but they are sitting in different parts of the train and have never met. An argument between a middle-aged couple causes Celine to leave her seat and take the one across the aisle from Jessie. They share an uncomfortable smile when the fighting couple rushes past the two of them. This leads to a few words, which leads to a trip to the dining car and one of those good conversations that can appear from nowhere when two people are open and ready to have such a conversation with a stranger, even if both of these strangers are twenty something and attractive."

They were occasionally vulgar, or rude, or annoying, but we never stopped liking them.\n\nThe truest accomplishment of \"Before Sunset\" is that these same flawed characters remain steadfast in their imperfections, but have gained an additional wordly-wise maturity. What's more important is that in the follow-up of the one night in Vienna, we see how profoundly the experience shaped the two characters in the same wonderfully eccentric, artful, and pensive ways.\n\nThe growth of these characters in the interim seems so natural, it literally feels like we're reunited with them, following this conversation with the same curiosity and shyness. What's more, is that the artistic spirit of the original film carries with emotional resonance through the picture's conclusion. There are no easy questions, and no easy answers, provided in the film.\n\nBest of all, it sensuously exposes the audience's predisposition for \"canned\" plots - where we strive to see things neatly tied up and concluded. I must admit that more than anything else, the unanswered questions in the film are more interesting than the loose ends that they tie up. At one point early on in the film, Jesse remarks to three readers of his book that one is a romantic, one is a skeptic, and the other is neutral. The romantic fills in the ending in a way that holds true to romance, the skeptic toward realistic pragmatism, and the neutral simply accepts the ending at face value.\n\nAnd I loved it. It's so atypical of any \"romance\" or \"drama\" film out there because it's so unabashedly human, imperfect, awkward, sensuous, ambiguous, and ultimately, perhaps even hopeful."

        "review_detailed_main": "This riveting film \"works\". Who could not fail to relate to, or aspire to, connecting with someone at a spiritual level that transcends mere physical reality. Herein lies the strength of this film, for in abandoning the screen writing convention of \"show don't tell\" for exquisitely crafted dialogue in which the characters actually share \"real\" experience and emotion the film conveys what pictures alone cannot, the interior of the characters, and humanity in its \"natural\" state. The documentary style and intimacy generated by the dialogue leave the viewer feeling like they are right alongside the characters and actually sharing a real time experience. Who could not fail to be moved by the notion of deeply connecting with someone years previously, tearfully parting, suffering the pain of separated souls yearning to be re-united, and the self torture of wondering what might have been. Imagine years of being unable to remove the indelible imprint of a twin soul from the psyche, and the shock and exhilaration of meeting again years later. This 70 minute microcosm, packed with intervening life experience, personal development, emotions, blame, recriminations, and love that goes beyond the physical, undimmed by the passing years, induces alternating laughter and tears in the viewer. This is achieved by what is said, and also by what is not said but untuitively known by the viewer because they are drawn so integrally into the film, and by skillfully \"underplayed\" performances that generate empathy. The spellbinding performances subtly depict nervous and uncertain actions reminiscent of innocent and naive teenagers not knowing what to do for the best. For anyone interested in the human condition this film is quite simply unmissable, and worthy of multiple viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm the type of film-goer who normally indulges his video appetite with crime drama, intrigue and Cold War suspense flicks. However, I now find myself vicariously watching this momentarily reunited couple walk and talk through the streets of Paris. What's going on here? What kind of bourgeois sentimentality is this? Why am I watching a romance film?\n\nI'll tell you why: it's a gas! I had been so amped up with Iraqi war fatalities, Va. Tech. shooting news analyses, etc., that I needed something to watch to chill me out just a little. And this was just what Dr. Feelgood ordered. At first, I wondered whether Ethan Hawke was going to be another phony self-serving existentialistic pseudo novelist or was he going to lighten up and go a little further into his character. Alas, he did lighten up, and he and Julie hit it off from that initial meeting onward. But, to me, the real carrier of the thespian torch was undeniably Julie Delpy: No holds barred emotional outpouring, but without any accompanying self-pity. She encapsulated modern day woman, with all the verve, intelligence, beauty and also, the vulnerability. No shame in her game in an outstanding performance!\n\nThe two of them continued along their Parisian stroll with soul searching dialog and the usual \"what have you been doing?\" stuff, but, more importantly, with so much free-flowing wit and zest for life. My bottom line proof of enjoyment is while watching this movie unfold, I had a constant grin on my face, eating up the sequences of events and enjoying the related inevitable tension that was building up along their soulful journey.\n\nBut in the end, Julie's gorgeous 3/4 time song with her own vocal and guitar accompaniment coupled with the Nina Simone song shortly thereafter was an ever so poignant conclusion to a most memorable movie. As Ethan said about the plane to catch in the final scene... well, you see it for yourself!"

        "review_detailed_main": "We saw a sneak preview of Before Sunset last night and then rushed home to revisit its precursor--Before Sunrise--on video. I can sum up the appeal that Linklater's diptych holds for me in a few words, spoken by Julie Delpy's character in the first film, which both works live by:\n\nYou know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something... I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.\n\n\n\n(you can read the whole script here, if you're in the mood--although I wouldn't recommend that; in general, it's not the matter of these conversations which is so compelling, but the manner in which they are conducted--and you've gotta watch the film to experience that!)\n\nIn keeping with my preference for revisiting the old, rather than scratching vainly at the scab of \"absolute originality\", I liked the second film even more than the first. Or perhaps I should say that the second has added lustre to the first. And a third, if made in the same spirit as these two, would undoubtedly have a similarly intensifying effect. This is, of course, why I love corporate comics so much--I truly do believe that, the more you think earnestly about anything you ever loved, the better it gets. These films stake out a philosophic/aesthetic position which is in direct opposition to the one that Charlie Kaufman puts into the mouth of \"wise fool\" Donald, in Adaptation:\n\nI loved Sarah. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want. You are what you love, not what loves you.\n\n\n\nNo way! A memory is never \"yours\". It must always be rebuilt through narrative. And a story is always told to someone else--even if that someone else is an idealized projection of your own mind. You aren't \"what you love\", you're a part of whatever you help bring to light through interaction with others. Implicit in Donald's statement is the idea that the artist's task is to nail down the way he/she feels about the world--capturing objects in the treacle of love like flies trapped in amber. I can't agree with this at all. I prefer to see art as the attempt to create \"a soundtrack, magnetized, out of sync, to the filmstrip of the (intersubjective) Sublime\".\n\nNear the beginning of Before Sunset, Delpy asks Hawke why he wrote an entire novel about one night that happened nine years before the events in the sequel. After hemming and hawing his way through a bunch of stock responses, Hawke finally admits that he wrote the book in the hope that she would see it, read it, and show up to discuss it with him. In other words, it was an attempt, as Hawthorne would put it, \"to open up an intercourse with the world.\" He gets his wish--and the discoveries that these two make about what \"really\" happened to them in the first film expose the proprietary theory of memory for the sham that it is. Our lives don't belong to us. We rent them to each other at sympathetic rates."

        "review_detailed_main": "The best way to describe this movie is by the following comments of a film critic\n\nquote: -------- \"Sunset\" plays out in real time -- in 81 minutes of unfolding getting-to-know-you-(again) conversation -- and its tug of suspense comes not only from that waiting plane but from the need to grab at chance and from the larger looming deadline of age.\n\nIt's a movie about how people woo each other with words, looks and glances. And though some will complain that \"Before Sunset\" is all talk, it struck me as real, highly diverting talk--beautifully staged, acted and visualized.\n\nDelpy and Hawke co-wrote the script with Linklater, and they keep Jesse and Celine iridescent and fresh, one of the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples. A lot of that charm comes from the speed of their patter, the way they keep the words spinning between them like two great tennis players on an endless, brilliant rally. And since they both show so well how the characters have grown, they can believably break into anger or anguish at their current frustrations and the memory of desire.\n\nAll three of the film's primary collaborators take advantage of their own opportunities with this one, layering Jesse and Celine's 80-minute conversation with a freshness, a surprising urgency, and two characters full of desire, faults, and - still - hope.\n\n--------\n\nThe movie has a brilliant script and dialogues.\n\nI just love the conversations between the two lead actors (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) in the movie. The chemistry between them is electric.\n\nThe best moment of the movie is undoubtedly the climax of the movie where Julie Delpy sings a song. She sings an improvised little nonsense song about lost love that keeps skidding into pain.\n\nquote: -------- Celine: (Celine's song) Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts / Let me sing you a waltz / About this one night stand / You were, for me, that night / Everything I always dreamt of in life / But now you're gone / You are far gone / All the way to your island of rain / It was for you just a one night thing / But you were much more to me, just so you know / I don't care what they say / I know what you meant for me that day / I just want another try, I just want another night / Even if it doesn't seem quite right / You meant for me much more than anyone I've met before / One single night with you, little Jesse, is worth a thousand with anybody / I have no bitterness, my sweet / I'll never forget this one night thing / Even tomorrow in other arms, my heart will stay yours until I die / Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my blues / Let me sing you a waltz / About this lovely one night stand\n\n--------\n\nI thought 'Lost in Translation' was the best Romantic movie I had seen in the recent past.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" is a few notches better.... :)\n\nSo, What's your favorite movie of 2004? :)\n\n~Nirjhar"

We should just focus on the magic they create when they are together. We should just live like them in that particular moment and periodically looking back to the past. The best part of the movie is it created the magic between them instantly as it did in Before Sunrise.\n\nAwesome movie"

Both are scared that their memories of what they connected to so much in the other won't be accurate, and that a moment that has been fixed in both their lives like a shining diamond will be tarnished.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" pulses with the melancholy inherent in growing up and maturing. You don't necessarily regret how your life has changed, but that doesn't mean you don't look back with fondness at moments that seemed beautiful in their simplicity.\n\nGrade: A+"

Neither Ethan Hawke (Jesse) nor Julie Delpy (Celine)were able to portray any real interest in their own conversation let alone bring the conversation alive and draw the viewer into their lives. These two young people who had met 6 years earlier in a \"passonate\" fleeting moment (The subject of an earlier film)seemed intent on destroying any pleasant memories that they had each carried of the other! This was the longest stupidest movie I believe I have ever watched! The use of brief \"flash-backs\" from the movie filmed in 1995 was unique and interesting because the characters had changed (matured in appearance) but not unrecognizably so. The Movie set was very nice (maybe it was really Paris?). But the streets of Paris and the \"flash-back\" technique could be put to much better use elsewhere! The Movie contained a lot of unnecessarily nasty language - maybe in an attempt to make the conversation provocative? Don't waste you time watching this movie!"

The movie is completely dialogue-based, and in order to pull a movie like that off, you must have an amazing script and amazing actors. In this case, both are present. The movie flows so well, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy interact so well, you would think that Linklater encouraged them to improvise practically the entire movie, but during the Q&A session after the screening he said that not one line was improvised. It's rated 'R' for some language, but nothing is too shocking because it all fits together so well.\n\nI would strongly encourage everyone to see this movie - especially those true romantics out there. Depending on the marketing of the movie, it might come across as a chick flick, but I saw it with a group of three guys and another girl, and the guys all loved it also.\n\nI would also like to point out that though this is a sequel, you don't need to see \"Before Sunrise\" to really get and enjoy this movie. It stands alone quite well.\n\nOn a side note - As well as being the lead actress, Julie Delpy also was one of the screenwriters, and also wrote and performed much of the music in the movie. She is amazing!"

        "review_detailed_main": "So I just saw Before Sunset. It is such beautiful movie! I can see why this ranks # 112 in the top # 250. I can't believe I didn't think to see it before. My mom and I just about always watch DVD's and video's together (we have the same taste most of the time), she'd probably think this one is boring because it's all talk and no actual action (in sense of fighting or running and stuff). I usually go for a little speed in movies as well, don't get me wrong I like movies like this but when I'm in a videostore I don't go out of my way to find a jewel like this. I tend to go look for a good action/comedy or a thriller, but I just loved this movie. The story has no elaborate scheme to it, it was just so simple, the whole concept and how everything played out. It was so serene and just calm but up beat (it's somewhat contradicting I know) and in a real sense. The movie has a pace but like real time, it's not like a day went by in several minutes. It was very romantic and I was just intrigued by their conversation. The whole movie revolves around these two characters Jesse (Ethan) and Celine (Julie). I just love the simplicity of the whole movie.\n\nIt's amazing how a night, nine years ago, can make you realize that have so much in common with each other. Its funny that they can strike up a conversation after nine years that actually has some context to their experience and feelings, they make each other laugh, almost cry. They're just a perfect match, after knowing each other one night that happened nine years ago, they still have so much to talk about. Yeah, sure some of it (the beginning) is pure superficial BS and just politics and such, but still their conversation had a lot of substance to it. I just find it incredible that someone is able to know another person like that and be able to 'pour' their heart out after one night. (sorry, I can't seem to get over the one night thing.) It is just so unlikely that 2 people that met each other nine years ago, spent one night together and still remember everything that happened, meet again to find that they still feel the same way about each other. That one person, one night, deciding to show up or not can make someone dismantle their whole believe system on what love should be like, what life should be like. To be able to have such an impact on another life is just amazing. (it is to me, I've never met someone who had such an affect on me) Everything that happened in those nine years makes them the people they are today, they've changed but still they find that they're just made for each other. That one night can make such a difference in you're life...\n\nThere was never a dull moment in the movie, no real awkward silences, every silent moment had a purpose. I was an absolute pleasure to see the interaction between Ethan and Julie on screen. I was on the tip of my seat and I didn't want to miss and word that was spoken. This basically never happens to me! I was just so amazed by the connection and conversation between the two characters. A while back I met a friend from grade school, we hadn't spoken in 6 years and we had absolutely nothing to talk about. It was so weird, 'cause we were friends back then and we got along fine, but now it's like there's nothing there. I guess that's why I was fascinated by these characters.\n\nAnyway, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it is just, I don't know I can't explain, you just have to see it. And if you don't like it, well I don't know what to think of that but I'd definitely like to hear why not.\n\nThese are a couple of quotes from the movie that I really liked.\n\n\"Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.\" \"I guess a memory's never finished as long as you're alive.\" \"If you don't believe in any kind of magic or mystery you're basically as good as dead.\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Initially, I had planned to watch Richard Linklater's Before trilogy in three days, watching one film after another. However, upon viewing Before Sunrise, along with writing the review, I took note that this trilogy was about time, time progression, and how people respond with being in company with one another for either an extended period of time or, in contrast, a relatively short period of time sporadically. I thought in order to make the trilogy bear a wee bit more relevance and realism for me, as a viewer, seeing as impatiently waiting nine years between each film to see them in theaters was an option I missed, I'd distance each film by about two weeks (and with the amount of films I watch in between, there would hopefully be little obsessing over what happens to the characters in between that time). My confession to you, the reader, is that it took all of my strength not to watch Before Sunset sooner than I had scheduled it; Before Sunrise is the kind of film that blindsides you so greatly, and tickles your human spirit so tenderly, that when it's over, knowing there's more films of the like makes you want to seek those others out immediately. Unfortunately, I had to exercise some restraint in the process to at least add some personal realism to this series; like I was impatiently waiting with these characters to see one another again.\n\nBefore Sunset picks up exactly nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, which focused on an American man named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a Frenchwoman named C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) met aboard a train in Vienna and spent the entire day roaming and conversing through the city, agreeing to meet nine years later in the same place. Jesse is back overseas, however, this time in Paris, doing a book tour for the novel he wrote about his encounter with C\u00e9line and how it changed his life. During the book tour, he runs into C\u00e9line, shocked as can be, as he recalls how their original meeting didn't go as scheduled because she presumably forgot about their agreement to meet. It turns out, a personal tragedy occurred in C\u00e9line's life, making her unable to meet up with him. Now, however, they are together and spend a brief but glorious day in Paris together, again, roaming the streets talking about philosophy, personal happiness, their own lives, their own musings, and so forth, all captured under the beautiful streets and attractions that Paris has to offer.\n\nHawke and Delpy have officially made themselves comfortable in the roles of Jesse and C\u00e9line. In this effort, they seem more relaxed with one another, especially Hawke, who has made his character assume more of a pleasantly comic role, but never to any particular fault. Delpy's character, on the other hand, has grown more cynical to the idea of love and attraction, remarking how the past two guys she dated wound up breaking up with her and finding love immediately following the break up. \"Why couldn't they ask me to marry them?,\" she asks Jesse, in a crying fit in a taxi, \"I would've said 'no,' but the least they could've done was ask.\" Jesse, on the other hand, is married with a kid, and breathlessly doing a handful of book tours. He's not happy, surprisingly enough, but just passively content with his life. He admits his marriage isn't provided with the romantic/fairy-tale idealism that he's madly in love with the person he sleeps with every day, but that he respects, cares for, and trusts his wife as a person, which, he believes, is what it comes down to ultimately. However, any thinking person can see what Jesse and C\u00e9line share is true love. After nine years of no contact, and not even knowing each others last names of full backgrounds, the two can assimilate back into a particular environment and pick up a conversation that's laid dormant for nine years as if it was just discussed on the previous day. On top of that, it's important to note how comfortable the two souls are around one another, sharing personal opinions and diving into past experiences in a way that only happens with one other person once in a blue moon. If you can recall one experience you've had with another person where you and them divulged personal details with one another because you felt explicitly comfortable and safe in their presence, you are an incredibly lucky soul. If you can hold on to that, you're an even more fortunate person.\n\nBefore Sunset, above all, is a continuation of Linklater's fascination and study of time and human interaction. He has constructed two very interesting and complex characters and has given them the ability to reconnect with one another every nine years. With that, he toys with settings, ideas, and philosophies, and essentially uses these two souls to communicate thoughts and ideas about how we interact and how times heals, impacts, and effects all of us, especially our relationships, in different ways. Before Sunset is a beautiful continuation; a love-letter and joyous appreciation for the human spirit, with two great actors even more adjusted and oriented to their roles than ever before, leaving for seventy-seven minutes of rich and potent dialog. If you don't extract something from this film, or feel something, I may need to check you for a pulse.\n\nStarring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater."

The manor-isms in their conversations felt real at times, yet at times it seems as though they were trying too hard to make the conversations(the jokes, laughter, stories, playfulness) seem realistic to the point that it was annoying...i feel as though they did not pull that part off in this film...things i did enjoy about the movie were the following shots while they were walking instead of a lot of cuts, the long shots i feel like are harder to pull off...and i thought that the ending and storyline was good...unfortunately it just did not intrigue me and i became bored with it...if anyone else felt this let me know"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Before Sunset\" is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.\n\nEven in our age of full disclosure and no privacy there remain moments that this viewer, anyway, has never seen captured on film before.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" captures some of those moments.\n\nTwo adult characters converse. Watching them, you wonder -- and you know that these two characters are wondering the same thing -- where will this conversation go? Is it just an exchange of banal, prepackaged rants and scripts? But, the two characters keep talking, keep talking past rough moments, and awkward discomfort, and strange anecdotes.\n\nAfter a while of this, they come to say shockingly open and intimate things to each other.\n\nBefore you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.\n\nThese two characters are using mere words to reveal hopes, and pains, and vulnerabilities, that we usually sweep from our consciousness, because the world has no room for them ... except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.\n\nThere was one aspect of \"Before Sunset\" that didn't work for me. Ethan Hawke, especially, gives a poignantly visual performance. He says things with his eyes and face that he does not convey in words.\n\nOtherwise, though, this film is not visual enough to be fully satisfying as a film. Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script. That being the case, \"Before Sunset\" would perhaps have been better as a radio play.\n\nThe director cheats his audience; he doesn't care about using his camera to allow his audience to view Hawke, Delpy, their powerful and magic interaction, or Paris in a new and high impact way.\n\nBut that's a minor complaint. \"Before Sunset\" swept this viewer off her feet. Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell. It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language. What language does here is truly magic."

This is a type of a movie that could encourage you to make a change in your life first time you get up in the morning. Or gives you the feeling to call that certain someone that you have been seeing in your dreams for a long time time now.

It was nice to see both characters had evolved, yet remained the same. I felt both ethan and julie did a fantastic job of recreating their connection.

This time, I felt the city was less of a feature, and it also feels more urgent snd purposeful as you know how the characters feel about each other already. It is charming, with phenomenally realistic performances. The conversation topics, stories and perspectives from both characters give a completely realistic impression of how these people have developed in a decade but also captures the essence of 30-something adulthood vs 20-something adulthood."

One word occurred to me throughout the whole experience: unnecessary. Plus, there's some real painful dialogue to go through this time around, namely from Celine's character. Lame, clich\u00e9d, ill-written. The location is once again a mere postcard, but even that works less good than Vienna did.\n\nPerhaps the worst thing though: this time it was virtually impossible to feel the attraction. Null chemistry. What I saw were two actors trying to rehash their old hit. Acting the whole time. And using \"right?\" at the end of every 3 sentences.\n\nNow if I could just unsee this and stay with the magic of the original movie..."

If you have lived life, you would have known the anguish, the pain, the bittersweet and the what-might-have-been wistfulness that comes with romance.

Changing facial expressions, the way they talk they both do this very - very realistically and IN ONE SCENE / CUT\n\nThe subject of the discussion they talked about was also quite heavy and related to their life problems, the climax of which was when Celine and Jesse were in the same car, where Celine and Jesse's very realistic expressions and body movements really depicted the figure of loving one another,each other and I repeat again hindered by their current status.\n\nIn terms of acting and concept, this film is truly extraordinary, for those of you who like action/romantic films that are even more dramatic, I'm sure you will be bored and even sleepy watching this film.\n\nThis film is a very unique and beautiful Masterpiece, I recommend this film for those of you who are tired of the same Romance films and try new things.\n\nRest assured, if you are people who watch this film carefully, surely this film will feel very extraordinary.\n\nThat's all from me, Bucek Alexsander\n\nCheers."

It's a way to be sure that they're still on the same page romantically and the scene works perfectly.\n\nThere are others great tidbits--including a natural conversation about past lovers over a pinball machine, a guy playing a harpsichord, a ferris wheel ride, when they say 'goodbye' early in the evening to avoid it later--I mean, so many. Most of these scenes are edited in long, single takes, that can't help but feel realistic. There are no quick cuts in real life.\n\nI can't stress enough how everyone should see this. There is no big sex scene. At the end of the film, we're not sure what exactly happened between them and we don't know if they'll ever see each other again. There are arguments for every position.

However, this film was made to find love.\n\nDirector Richard Linklater uses his real life experience to tell both this story and the one from \"Before Sunrise\". Linklater met a woman, had an incredible night back in the 90s, and then lost touch. This film was made in an attempt to find her again. Unfortunately, that woman passed away before even the first film was shot, but he didn't find out about until after this films release.\n\nThat being said. The heart that is put into telling the story is simple, yet beautiful. While I found Hawke's and Delpy's chemistry to be not as strong as the first film. The words and the body language came across poetically. I get there has been a passage of time, but I would've thought that the chemistry would be stronger than what was portrayed.\n\nWhile the acting didn't get to me. The story did. \"What if you had a chance with the one that got away?\" This part of the story touched me deeper as I've had this thought about a girl and so it became more personal on screen.\n\nThe fact in the movie that they have a rekindling after such a long time apart and they think about the \"what ifs?\" gives it a human connection that lots of people have thought about in their own lives.\n\nThe story is even more encapsulated by the cinematography. It's simple yet captures the moment. We're living these two individuals lives for 80 minutes in real time. The continuous shots and the walking of the environment just absorbs into itself.\n\nOverall, a great romantic sequel that portrays a real world \"dilemma\", but tells it in such a poetic way that you care about what's happening. I would definitely recommend the \"Before Sun\" series, but only if you don't mind the odd explicit conversations about sex, because remember real world circumstances.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"

It sounds cheesy, and even normal, and that's what it is, completely normal. All human beings are supposed to belong, to adapt themselves. Even the criminals adapt themselves to a certain way of living, to a certain group, and they follow the description of their role in society like it was a prescription. I'm not implying to be different, or special, but the contrary, I am totally common, totally normal. Just another human being with an existential crisis, suddenly trapped in her comfort spot\u0085 comfortable, but frustrated, adapted, but miserable\u0085 fearing life, above all. Just recently I watched a film that made me feel like I had been raped. Like someone came and saw my naked mind, my naked soul, possessed it and wrote it down to shoot it later in \"before sunset\". I am nothing like the perfect beautiful blond actress, and certainly I am not a successful intellectual activist\u0085 although I do like the \"wonder woman feeling\", helping here and there once in a while. And neurotic? maybe I am a little of that. One of the scene shots in that movie, named \"Dying inside\" told my love life story in less than 4 minutes. It's funny how insignificant you feel after such a thing happens. My concepts of love, romanticism, independence and frustration are there, in those 4 minutes\u0085 along with the funny story of boyfriends that break up with me and get married, and call me later to thank me for showing them what love was. And that passive anger of not having been asked\u0085 of not having deserved that honor\u0085 While I am sure I would have said no, and I am sure none of them were the right one\u0085if such a thing exists. I've been hiding for 5 years behind the wall of rationalism. Logic, strength, independence. And all these years I have longed for that experience of romantic love that was stolen once, or many times in my past. It's funny when it doesn't matter anymore to tell the truth out in the open, for anyone to see it grasp it and maybe\u0085 get the courage to tell their own\u0085 I am just another woman\u0085 longing for her blue prince to pick her up on a white horse and take her to his castle\u0085 well not that simple of course. In my long 5 years of single life, I have managed to put together the most ridiculous huge and complicated list of perfect attributes for that blue prince\u0085 In the end though, I guess it would be enough to know someone that makes me shiver just by the encounter of sights, that threatens my rational arguments and with whom I can forget the bullshit and simply be myself\u0085 but believe me that alone is too complex to even get close to reality\u0085 It's funny how human beings love to complicate the beautiful simplicity of life\u0085 and when it becomes a vice\u0085 I doubt it has a way back. I have a confession to make, I am a weak daydreamer of romantic love, like any other cheesy woman\u0085 And I am dying inside\u0085 pretending all the time the strength and independence I don't have. I saw my self in that movie, like I dared to face a mirror for the first time in my life\u0085 and found a tiny little creature too scared to even look straight into her eyes. I wish I could thank the writers... for \"stealing my story\", in the end maybe that's the story of everyone... and somehow, that's a relief. In the meantime, I'll keep on laughing at myself\u0085 until I am too tired to continue my own acting role and decide to show the real one\u0085 if that ever happens.\n\n22/11/04"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunrise, released in 1995 was a phenomenal film about young love and as someone who does not care for romance movies, I really really enjoyed Before Sunrise. Knowing that there were two sequels, I was even more intrigued. Well, in 2004 Before Sunset was released. The film was written, directed, and produced by Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, School of Rock, and Waking Life) and stars Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Assault on Precinct 13) and Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Three Colors: White). The film was a financial success and also a critical success as well.\n\nJesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is on a book signing tour and just so happens to be in Paris where he meets back up with Celine (Julie Delpy) of whom he met nine years before in Vienna and where they both had a night they would never forget. But now they are older and the question about what the future has in store for them still looms over head.\n\nBefore Sunrise did a great job at portraying young love in how it can be quick and spontaneous and the ending was open ended enough for one to draw their own conclusions. Before Sunset was not a sequel that anyone asked for but Linklater does it again and gives another smart and powerful film. Before Sunrise was about young love and so Before Sunset is the growing up and wondering if love is for all. The big question anyone watching this film is gonna ask is whether or not Jesse and Celine get together and seeing where all the conversations go throughout the film. The acting feels natural as I always have seen in Linklater films and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine (while at first awkward) picks right back up as they practically pick up right where they left off. I cared enough about the characters in the first film that I was wanting to know more about them and what their lives have been like in the time since. Once the film wraps up, I find myself wanting more. Luckily, there is Before Midnight for that.\n\nBefore Sunset is just a really great film all around and while I cant find it easy to recommend (it's unconventional style as with a lot of Linklater films will turn many away), it's definitely one to check out if you really enjoyed Before Sunrise."

The acting is to be praised, an important part in a story which focuses as strongly on just the two main characters as this one. Overall, I did not like this film much, as it lacked in originality and especially in the writing."

Twenty years ago I too let the one that got away get away. I am Canadian, she was Italian. My story's setting was Rome. So similar.\n\nBut the characters in this movie get another chance; I found myself almost shouting at them \"take that chance - take it\". This movie brought tears to my eyes - lots of them.\n\nTo anyone who has ever chosen to take a path in life, or chosen not to take that path, I say \"please see this movie\".\n\nI also say \"follow your heart\" - If I could have watched this movie 20 years ago, my entire life would be different now. Few movies can make that sort of claim.\n\nThe story is great, the acting is natural and superb, and it is almost impossible not to fall in love with Julie Delpy.\n\nWow."

It's like spending 90 minutes listening to two people talk about nothing, absolutely nothing. Oh, and they just had to spend 10 of these minutes bashing everything about America and Americans. While the actors do a decent job especially on the continuous shots, the characters are uninspiring and uninteresting. Don't waste you time or $$ watching this or Before Sunrise.

Every gesture and every expression that Ethan and Julie make is just perfect, which is what makes seeing this film over and over again so worthwhile. The fact that Ethan and Julie were so stunning at what they do has inspired me to get off my proverbial and get on with what is important to me.\n\nI know this film will be one of the most worn out in my DVD collection.

It tiptoes on the thread between logic and emotions and culminates as an ode to fate, achieving to present randomness as ultimate inevitability. Setting cynicism as the prevailing approach was most refreshing when one deals with the exploration of issues like love, experience and choice in a realistic manner for people in their 30s living in a modern western society. At the same time, conscious that it is dealing with the most fundamental of concepts it takes an aristophanic approach using regular swearing as an ideal means of the pervading cynicism. The combination of swearing and cynicism and the ultimate conclusion that love and choice can still be possible in todays cynical world has a massive impact; assisted by Nina Simone in the background it plays a tune of optimism to us all."

Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are great in the movie.

It just ends and it leaves without any sense of catharsis. After watching the first movie I felt I didn't have to watch it in the first place.\n\nNow having watched the sequel and hoping this would bring something to the trilogy, I can honestly say that this is part 2 of \"The movie without purpose\".\n\nUsually great movies have a plot that by the end pays off in a way or another (either good like The Dark Knight either bad like The Last Jedi), but they all pay off. That's part of why people watch them and other movies. Because by the end the movie has somewhat of a finality that makes you look back on the movie and say \"it was worth it to watch this movie\". Here on the other hand, there is no finality, there is no ultimate purpose of the movie with the characters or with the story. I never felt relieved or inspired or with a sense of catharsis when I watched either of the two movies (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset). Sure it's enjoyable and lovely to see these two guys walk around a street talking about different things from life and making you question how do you relate to those things, but ultimately this movie has no deep meaning or a main theme runing throughout the movie so that by the end you could feel moved or inspired or feel that movie was worth it.\n\nI don't understand who would consider this movie a masterpiece or the best movie of the year since there are way more movies that have also a realistic feel to them but above all have purpose and a message. This one does not!"

I'm sure my wife would love to know that I met an ex-lover and we spent half our time together in Paris talking about sex. Perhaps this is why relationships today don't work out, but this is just my own musing. And it might be one of the worst endings ever. The best part of the movie is that it does indeed end and in only 80 minutes. I hope my wife appreciates how much I love her that I would even sit that long through this drivel. Enjoy!!"

The continuing story of two strangers who can and should be but simply aren't also reminds us of the short story by Haraku Murakami \"On Seeing The 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning\" The sadness of the fleeting moments and how even as we grasp at the here and now it still manages to slip through are fingers, seems to be what Linklater as down to perfection and the everyone should see this film and it's sad predecessor before they die. The seen where Julie Delpy almost reaches for Ethan Hawke is absolutely perfect in it's quiet sadness.\n\n10 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year.\n\nThe movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.\n\nJulie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates a late famous singer's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.\n\nEthan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space.\n\nIn the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference.\n\nIt's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation."

The basic premise is two past lovers chance to encounter each other again years later, but their lives, of course, are different now.\n\nThe movie is all dialog, save one musical performance. While this itself is not a turn-off for me it may be for some. I've enjoyed other movies of the format, but this wasn't one of them. The dialog is mainly between the two main characters. And the conversations, while many of us have experienced these dialogs with friends and lovers, past and present, and have probably enjoyed them and have fond memories of them, it's a completely different issue when one is not the participant and instead an involuntary voyeur. There's none of the same satisfaction or heightened emotion and instead I mostly wished I was somewhere else. After a while I'd pretty much heard all I want to hear and I'm thinking, \"Why don't they just sleep with each other already and be done with it?\" But instead the viewer is forced to witness, not though action but through talk, 80 minutes of the past and present lives of two individuals who still haven't given us reason to afford them any empathy.\n\nThe writing does nothing to save it. It's not particularly humorous, witty, or interesting and so basically comes of as if the camera picked a random couple in Paris and decided to follow them for a day, giving us the full unedited account. I understand that this is a sequel and I did not see the first in the series, so understand that my lack of empathy might be thrown off because of it. I can only hope the first one is not as painful to watch.\n\nBut if you play the movie with the sound muted you get a nice videography of Paris. Maybe then you could make up your own interesting dialog."

'before sunset' is a very nicely made film. this time the two lead characters got older and wiser. and it reflects in their interaction. this time they met in Paris and spent few hours before sunset. during this time they shared their memories, the events in their lives since the first film. the whole film is centered on their interaction. but you will never get bored. you will love it so much. the dialogues were great, cinematography was nice, music was awesome. most of all, julie delpy and ethan hawke seemed so made for each other. they gave the performances so real that it seemed like they really met after nine years. and at last credit goes to the director for making such a wonderful sequel."

In fact it barely fits the notion of \"movie\" or at least what is has become.\n\nThe film takes you to Paris where Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets a lady (Julie Delpy) he was blessed to be with for only one night back when they were young and innocent. So many years has passed since then, so many hopes were broken, so many dreams were achieved and now that they live in two separate worlds they look back on what has changed in their lives and eventually between them, if anything at all.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" is a master piece. The flow of conversations, the jokes and the glances are so real that it seems like you literally live through it, as if you happened to be there.\n\nYet to me personally the beauty of \"Before Sunset\" was not only about marvelous acting, but the very idea that hope is inevitably eternal."

There really is nothing but character development which may be a turn off to many (no effects, no big plot surprises, no stunts,,, really nothing but dialogue in both movies). I will say, you absolutely MUST see Before Sunrise first or this movie will be pointless. This is one of the most original movies I have seen in years, and is incredibly risky for the makers of the film. In today's short-attention-span society, a movie like this is really hard to pull off with most audiences. I was incredibly skeptical about a second movie when I heard it was coming out. I was afraid they would \"hollywood\" it a little and kill the magic of the first. Yhis, however was the perfect conclusion to the first. Everyone wanted to know if they re-met 6 months later, and that was answered, but the mystery of their future together (the best part of the first film) was retained. You need an open mind to watch these movies (and a bit of a romantic side) but they are well worth the couple of hours you put into them. This movie shows what 2 fantastic actors can do with a good script and incredible chemistry and not much else. I reserve 10 ratings for movies that define genres or change the way movie-making is done like the original Star Wars or Ben Hur, but I gave this movie a strong 9...maybe a 9.8 if they gave me decimals."

        "review_detailed_main": "The strength of the Before Trilogy is it's writing. It's a momentous task to write dialogues which don't feel scripted. One way in which this film achieves this is by making the two leads write the screenplay themselves.\n\nThe screenplay, combined with Richard Linklater' s fascination for real time, makes Before Sunset look like a beautiful recording of the conversations unfolding between Jesse and Celine. Linklater uses long takes and gentle camera movements to ensure the realism. Neither lighting nor editing call any attention, and thus, the feeling that one's just watching a movie is never induced. . Before Sunset reveals a lot of thematic depth if the viewer has already watched Before Sunrise. After 9 years Jesse and Celine meet once again, and like the previous meeting, their time is limited. This time, their talks are mature and introspective rather than instinctive.\n\nAs the tension builds up, the dialogues become more revealing, and this reaches its zenith as they get into the car. It's then, when they reveal the greatest stings of their hearts. Their experiences shatter the delusion of \"the right-one\". And tough, they never directly confess, but in these moments of tension we get to know how much they regret the missed opportunity and that how much they mean to each other.\n\nThe final song just kills it. It's so emotionally engaging that one cannot choose to escape the calm echoes of the melancholy. Before Sunset, like the other films of the trilogy, is more of life unfolding on screen rather than a movie. It's great!"

Sure they were young and naive then, but that gave them an excuse for spouting optimism and romance. Here they're a bit older and wiser and the conversation feels less natural and more forced. The randomly deep insights, while impressive, clash a bit with the other insecurities and awkward jokes. Their current relationship is possibly too stuck in romanticising the original, therefore giving them false expectations of what they have now, but this doubt can probably go down as a plus for the film. A definite minus was some of the occasionally excessive false smiling, which I have to mark up against Ethan."

The maturity and chemistry between the main characters are incredible. The conversations, a major component of the film, are real and spontaneous, thanks to Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan's wonderful script. The entire film focus on the two main characters (Jesse and Celine), and the camera switches between them. Most of the shots are long and close, which makes the audience feel that they are actually in the scene with them. This really tests the acting skills of the cast, who pulled off wonderfully.\n\nHighly recommended."

I really didn't feel any chemistry between them.\n\nI should add that the high point for me in this film were the songs that Julie Duply wrote and performed. She has a lovely singing voice."

Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches.

I was amazed how the chemistry of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is still phenomenal and there is no difference or performance that has decreased from the previous film. This proves that ethan and julie's chemistry is truly amazing and is at the top level in film.\n\nI really like the continuity of the story here. Even though it's not complex, you will still be able to enjoy it very well. The dialogue that is delivered still reflects the ideas, thoughts, and feelings of the two characters here. I also really like the linklater directing style with lots of one-take shots, not too aesthetic but still very beautiful. technically, a film like this doesn't need a captivating filmographic aesthetic, because the characters and the story itself have succeeded in making this film great."

While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed."

Ethan, if you ever read this, please find more films of this kind. You give us a nice break for us seeing you in a strong character role instead of having some form of FBI agent character. One other actor has that affinity and funny enough he is said to be a close friend of yours.\n\nI see this film like a tribute to simple nostalgia (especially in this high running lifestyle we all live in), a tribute to the ability for us, no matter how old we are, to pick up a lifeline we have left and more importantly, a tribute to the kind of film making which I almost though was disappeared. Bravo.\n\nI do find myself as an emotional film critic because very few films do get my respect and result afterward in a personal session analyzing it.

You could almost use the famous film quote: \"You got me at hello\". When these two people meet, the question was more when then if. Being so obvious this didn't by any means destroy the true plot of the film. The plot to follow the unavoidable fact that when we encounter something so right for us, we do grab it and seize it without having any scruples and success in our life's.\n\nGreat film. Thanks"

So I guess that explains the sharp division in opinions about this piece.\n\nThe story is pretty simple and you've probably read about it already. What makes this movie special is that its not standard \"Hollywood\". In real life, and to my experience - and believe me I am an expert by now - when you meet your ex after 10yrs sparks don't fly. There are no happy happy joy joy moments with violins playing. Time has changed you both and the pain and love have both dulled with time. There is however still something there no matter how much you hate to admit it. So I was surprised to see a movie that tries to tell it like it is. The dialog sounds like they went and recorded a real couple and just sneaked it off as a screenplay.\n\nOK, so there are stretches where the dialog becomes trite. But then, just when you're about to lose all attention and go order a pizza, there is a scene that cuts close to the bone. The most memorable is a scene in the car where the two main characters stop side stepping how they feel and let it all out. The ending, is exactly right. I won't spoil it for you.\n\nFinally, I am just happy there are still film makers out there like Richard Linklater and Alexander Payne who don't pander to the perceived common taste and try to create something special that feels real and touches you deep down."

An excellent movie that celebrates life and love without the Hollywood treatment ... I thought it very real and believable, the characters, the conversations etc. and has been mentioned elsewhere, the obvious chemistry between the two. A refreshing change to see 'intelligent conversation' the centrepoint of a movie ... the desire to get to know another intimately thru questions and answers, and the toing and froing banter between them. I loved the duologue (except for a few crudities them seemed out of place and unnecessary), the observations about the big things and little things of life, and the way conversation flowed so naturally between them. The camera shots gave us plenty of time to observe the nuances in their facial expressions (and appreciate Julie Delpy's beauty). The enthusiastic awkwardness of their initial meeting ... the developing relationship with time as each other's lives are revealed ... very well handled. Hmmm ... think I preferred the first movie even more, for it's novelty etc., but this one was a pearler as well ... well done to all involved for coming up with another great script and performances."

OOh, I'm so guilty of loving this film. But, as soon as I get to see Before Sunset again, I will be guilty of loving a sequel as well.\n\nI love it. I love the divine simplicity of mid-nineties precocious pseudo-boho banter. I love it. I love semi-art house love stories that really cater to main stream audiences searching for film-junkie street cred. I love Ethan. \"Jesse\" defines the \"every boy\" American boy you wished every American boy you met was like. Nine years later, I still want one of them to be Jesse. ~sigh~ I can dream, can't I?\n\nAnd while Julie Delpy may be the bane of my(or every other raging jealous loony of a girl's) existence, there is simply no other actress that could BE \"Celine\". Her character is so honestly portrayed in the \"sequel\"(Ugh, I hate calling it that). Celine's songs will flatten you, period. And Ms. Delpy wrote them!!??!! GAH!! so jealous! You know what? I love Julie too. what a talent!\n\nI have been known as a film snob and I can acknowledge that. Yet out of all the films that have fans salivating for a \"I-know-they-shouldn't-make-one-but-I-wish-they-would\" sequel, this one nearly made me pass out with pleasure. I didn't even realize I wanted a sequel. I don't normally like sequels. But thank a higher power this one was made. The characters actually developed. And they developed over the nine year span as the \"rest of us\" did as well. It's remarkably satisfying to have actors acting human.\n\nParis was shot so naturally. You'll love the look of the alley-ways and eye-level walking views. Makes you all wistful for the Vienna of the last decade(errmm..\"first one\"). A lot of the scenery really goes for a throw back of Before Sunrise. Which, yeah, is totally awesome. For a second, when I saw the boat on the River Seine, I thought it was part of a flash back. My heart was in my throat. Then, that ending. No spoilers, I promise. But. ..I've never been moved to near-tears by a -ugh- sequel in my entire life. Had I not been in public, I probably wouldn't have held 'em back. You CAN NOT ask for a more perfect ending. And this is coming from a girl that makes it a point to hate endings. Yeah, I'm pretentious. But You're reading a film comment, so you are too. ha ha.\n\nMaybe my life was a bit too busy over the last decade to have been thinking about what was happening to Celine and Jesse, but \"milkshake!\", I should've. If you haven't seen Before Sunrise, please see that first. Then, I hope, you'll be able to understand why us \"fans\" actually held our hearts in our throats and tried to swallow down tears over this film's \"what might have been.\"\n\non that note, anyone want to see this again with me?"

But I loved the sequel because the makers successfully satisfied the expectations of the audience and - in my case - did even better.\n\nIn the beginning there is a distance between Hawke and Delphy. Both are older now. They seem more reasonable, more secure. But after a while they approach each other step by step. And the more they talk, the more they reveal of their inner constitution, the more the audience is drawn into the films atmosphere.\n\nIn a way it turns 1995 again, but its not the same, its different because of the experiences they made since that time. The dialogues are intensive, realistic an very funny too, everything sounds natural and it could go on for hours. So the end turns out as a surprise, I would say a brilliant one.\n\n9 of 10!"

This is because if they mean something to you they should mean a lot. If they do not mean anything in particular, then you probably didn't like them at all - and probably didn't bother with the sequel. Without going into any details (I don't need to - you can get the official storyline from the general critic's reviews), here is how I rate them.\n\nBefore seeing Before Sunset, I gave Before Sunrise a 3 out of 4. But the two together rate a 4, or more precisely an 8.5 out of 10. I have to leave room for such masterpieces as Hotel Rwanda and films in that class - totally different. It is also interesting that these movies are played out in real time. But I won't elaborate in order not to spoil the plot of the movies as a pair. We are lucky that as of now, we can see them together, or even better, one night apart, as I did.\n\nAs with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity to these movies and a nagging question which is resolved at the end (of Sunset).\n\nWhat do you think?

That is the brilliance and reality of the first film.\n\nI never met this woman again. However, Before Sunset has dialogue that I think would happen if we met again.

From the tentative exploration of the emotional landscape in the Parisian caf\u00e9 at the beginning of the film, to the more intimate open closing scene with its mixture of sexual tension and regret over missed opportunities and choices wrongly made, the script, filmed in apparent real time, stays very close to life. However, like some nineteenth-century realistic novels of which this film reminded me a little (e.g. George Gissing's New Grub Street), realism does not necessarily make for compelling viewing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the film, not even in the acting, that lifts the everyday story to a higher plane so as to invest it with more meaning. It would seem that just like its protagonists, the director failed to make good use of an opportunity."

The movie just focuses on the meeting of the two lead characters after a gap of 9 years since they met on the train. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return and in addition to acting they also helped with the screenplay and are credited for the effort. The acting is effortless and the fact that the characters as well as the actors have aged exactly the same way adds to the realism that this movie aims for. Richard Linklater does not disappoint with the sequel that manages to stand as a great film on its own without comparing it to Before Sunrise. My only grievance for this movie is that it tends to get overdramatic in certain moments like when Julie Delpy breaks down while explaining that she always fails at relationships.

Very well written and it's quite mandatory that it is as the entire movie is just one conversation. I would've rated it a bit higher had it not dragged a bit somewhere in the middle.\n\nJesse (Ethen Hawke) has a one day encounter with a French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) during his college days and has a wonderful time. They decide to meet again on a set date in the future when Celine doesn't show up. After 9 years, Jessi writes a book on the incident and gets quite famous. On the Paris leg of his book tour he meets Celine again and strikes conversation which is the content for the rest of the movie.\n\nFor a wafer thin story like this, it requires excellent screenplay and a tremendous chemistry between the leads. The talent behind this movie sure delivers the required goods and a special mention should go to Julie Delpy for her excellent presence and contribution to writing. Only problem is that, it feels a little long to reach what it wants to show. There is a little drag just before they both get on the cab which spoiled my mood though it picks up soon after and ends fantastically. It operates on a shoe string budget and never deviates from the core of what it wants to show.\n\nIt is extremely enjoyable and a good opportunity to showcase the writer's prowess and they do it with great panache."

Before I watched it I read only good reviews - how does IMDb classify them? So I thought it would be worth dropping a few slightly more alternative thoughts on a film I so wanted to enjoy. 1. The main characters are soooo boring, honestly I cannot imagine spending any more than 10 minutes with them in real life. Gauche and self obsessed; not my cup of tea and definitely not people to care about. 2. The script is weak as water. It honestly sounds like they were making it up as they went along - badly. It was like watching Big Brother - boring people saying boring things. 3. There's no atmosphere to the film, no colour, no spark. I mean nothing - no characters, no character. It's great to see Hollywood drag itself out of its natural home - the west coast, and even better to attempt a film like this, but it never really works. Setting a film in Paris and employing a French actress doesn't make it worth watching, I would suggest trying one of the other 499."

This movie surprised me a lot. It's a beautiful film with excellent acting. The film is brilliant crafted, the moving camera just follows them walking in the city. Very simpel. But so effectful, because you just begins to follow them too. And that is the actors fault, they play their characters so heartfelt. It just seems like we're looking at Ethan and Julie. The story is again very simple. They meet again.\n\nThis film makes you in a good mood. Because it's so subtle and sweet and loving. It's easy to love and easy to hate. People that hates this film might think it's boring. I don't think so because it's a fascinating film because of it's simple approach to filming the film. Only when the characters are sitting or standing still the camera is steady. That is what the film do so great. Because it let's the viewer be the camera. You are camera, you just follow them..\n\nPersonal I got inspiration from this to make with this kind of moving camera effect. Not exactly the same way but I hope it has the same effect.\n\nTo people that haven't seen film yet, see it and enjoy it, let yourself follow these two characters talking and walking in the city of Paris. I really people should see this film..."

What is important is that she is a moon virgin, Venus Scorpio, water and Mars archer, terrible reason and self-esteem, terrible passion and love to heaven and earth; he is a moon archer, water Venus Scorpio, Mars archer, and will not forget when he falls in love, Spiritual flesh is one. This ending is not ambiguous at all, I believe that this time, they will not let go of each other again."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must start by saying that finding Before Sunrise on DVD turned out to be just as taxing as finding this wonderful followup in theaters. Apparently limited release means just that, and if you don't live in NY or LA, its very possible you wouldn't even know these movies exist. While its not necessary to have seen the first to enjoy this one, you owe it to yourself to know the entire story. Before Sunset picks up where Before Sunrise leaves off. Well, not quite. Its well after the six months agreed upon for the next meeting. Jesse has written a book about the fateful night he spent in Vienna, of all things. He's on the last leg of his book tour, which just happens to be Paris. As he's fielding his last question he catches a glimpse of a familiar face and somehow manages to wrap up the session w/o totally losing it. After a brief chat outside the bookstore, Jesse has the idea that Celine could show him around Paris before his plane leaves that evening, which she gladly agrees to. As the two learn more about the years that have passed they can't help but to be drawn closer. Closer to what is the only real question... Much like the first, this film is a great date movie, exploring the various insecurities we all have, the emotional baggage we accumulate over the years. It also goes into the whole \"what if\" factor of situations that don't receive the necessary closure and expands on how some moments really do stick w/us longer than we intend. Ultimately the film revolves around the many faces of love and the different roads that the search for it can lead us on. This movie provides tons of conversation material and is a must own once its finally released on DVD. I rated it a 9/10, but really could've given it a 10, I may change that shortly."

(Thank you, Julie.)\n\nThis movie started me thinking about what's important in life. What is worth talking about, sharing with a stranger or a loved one. Some of the ideas are totally usable: for example, the imaginary phone call to a friend. I think it also teaches about not being selfish (even though \"love is the most selfish thing\")."

Now, where will this brief encounter lead to, where ever it would end p, the path is for sure gonna be beautiful and that's how it is.\n\nWith a beautiful romantic work already done, the director ups the ante this time and how? By making it more time bound and more mature. Jesse and Celine have grown up now, what they thought as everything beautiful is not so as it turns out. They feel imprisoned in their own lives, they have learnt to embrace the shortcomings of what we call is an imperfect world, they speak more fluidly and are more comfortable with each other s they already had a meeting earlier.\n\nRichard Linklater seems to be a master in telling what he would like to tell and in his own inimitable style. He has got aides in Ethan Hawke as Jesse and Julie Delpy as Celine who have added so much to dialog in what is primarily a conversational movie. Can you believe that the whole movie is shot the way the characters speak out, that is as they speak for an hour long, the movie is precisely that much duration only. Now, so many interesting things come up in this conversation.\n\nGoing with 5/5 this time too and I love this so much to have a repeat watch."

If you watched \"Before Sunrise\" you can see what difference nine years make. They both have their lives, they both are less adventurous then they were back then. But as they wander through the beautiful set of Paris, talking about anything, the two remember and regret what they had back then and what decisions they made. What could've been? And what could be? The movie follows a slow pace, Celine and Jesse just walk through Paris, talking. But the movie is far from being boring. After it was over I couldn't believe over an hour had passed. I don't know if you have to be of a certain age to really like this movie. If you don't need action to enjoy a movie give this one a try."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked Before Sunrise a lot. It spoke to me, at the time, of recently remembered times in my youth, when travelling in Europe, I met, and spent time with someone and then parted never to see them again. The important thing is, it spoke to me. Most movies don't. I've never taken part in a mission to deflect a comet from a collision course with Earth. I've never battled zombies while besieged in a deserted shopping mall... you get the picture. Movies are very often about escapism, but Before Sunrise was about real life.\n\nThese fond memories of Before Sunrise kept me from seeing Before Sunset for a long time. I didn't want to spoil a happy memory. But now I've seen it, I regret waiting.\n\nBefore Sunset is a masterwork, as its IMDb rating (8.4 at time of writing) affirms. The acting is so natural it is impossible at times to believe that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are acting. While both of these actors are perfectly acceptable, in these two movies they shine. And the near ten-year gap between the movies brings out a new assuredness and maturity in their performances.\n\nBut it is the dialogue that really sets this movies apart, not least because that's all there is really. OK, there is a pleasant meander through the streets of Paris, but the camera rarely wanders from the action. And the action is the words, the expressions and the body language of the two leads. Tarantino is celebrated for his dialogue, but to my ears it is clich\u00e9d, bombastic and comic-book in style. Here the dialogue flows like a real conversation, it is almost impossible to believe that it is not really the excited outpourings of re-united lovers. Never do they put a foot wrong, never is it awkward, or forced, or unbelievable.\n\nThe movie tells a story of a tentative re-union, each afraid the other will have forgotten their past tryst, each afraid that it will have meant less to the other than to them. Slowly, gently, they discover that each holds it dearly, they also discover that the special connection between them is still there. They recriminate tenderly over past mistakes, and then they reveal the very core of themselves to each other... the gaping chasm of yearning below their seemingly content exterior facades.\n\nIf there is a single person in whom this movie does not strike a resonance, I think that person still has some living to do."

Ethan Hawke isn't one of my favourite actors, I had never heard of Julie Delpy, nor the director Richard Linklater, before.\n\nI have watched the movie twice. Actually I wasn't fully paying attention when I watched it the first time, but starting with Jessie (Ethan Hawke's character) fielding questions about whether his novel is autobiographical, it got me good, and never let go for one second; up till the very last scene where Jessie said \"I know\". Fade- out. One of the most remarkable thing about this movie is the continuity. The whole movie felt like it was just one take, lending it such authenticity and immediacy. Of course, I had to see Before Sunrise afterwards; and I must say that I like this second installment a whole lot more. Before Sunrise is much more \"ordinary\", and I don't know whether it is because I watched Before Sunset first. In fact, I might end up thinking Before Sunrise is superfluous. In other words, in a way I wish I had not gone ahead and watched Before Sunrise.\n\nThis is not so much a love story. To me, a love story can only be told, in whole, afterwards, with a definitive ending. This film is more about romance, and feelings. It may yet develop into a love story, if there are more installments to come.\n\nThe film should not be compared with epic love stories like Doctor Zhivago, but surely can stand on its own merits as an example of a \"perfect\" movie.\n\nFinally, as I was brought up in a \"gentler\" age, the few instances of the f-word did jar my sensibilities, but I can put all that down to context, given the world we are living in now."

It plays out in real time as the characters spend one afternoon together in Paris.\n\nIt has been nine years since events of Before Sunrise happened. Now Jesse has written a novel named \"This Time\" accounting the happenings of his time with Celine as per the prequel of the movie. To promote his sales in Europe, Jesse on his last stop at Paris happens to met Celine, though this time it was not accidental and Jesse has to leave Before Sunset to catch his flight back home. Jesse is now married and has become a writer. Celine is there with boyfriend of hers ,who is a photojournalist. CONVERSATION continuing from the last movie has gone a level or two ahead and maturity is pretty much visible\n\nFirst it appears that both leads are leading a pretty happy life. In fact it is not. It becomes clear in the course of their talk that both are dissatisfied to varying degrees with their lives. Jesse reveals that he only stays with his wife out of love for his son. Celine says that she does not see her boyfriend very much because of his commitment towards his work. A meaningful personal talk at wonderful locations of Paris and great shots of steadicam followed by awesome Screenplay says enough in itself. Life is unpredictable. If Jesse and Celine exchanged some contact information with each other, the story would be different. But there were not so many \"ifs\" in life. You must grasp the opportunity or regretting is unavoidable. The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime. Personally to me,Before Sunset is better than its prequel because the characters Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves inspired from their respective personal lives & conveys message of many unsaid things regarding LIFE in a pretty convincing way.

The acting was phenomenal, for a film, shot in real time, involving only 2 characters walking through Paris talking about nothing and everything it held my attention and I think that was due in large part to Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who I forgot were acting and almost believed were really their characters. This movie isn't flashy or loud or anything like that, it doesn't try to convey some huge philosophical message, it's just two people who met each other once and are now trying to make up for all the things in their lives they couldn't do with each other...so normal and sad and hopeful. If you enjoy dialog driven, character based films this movie comes highly recommended...definitely 10 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never heard of 'Before Sunrise' and I'm not a fan of romantic movies at all. But 'Before Sunset' was excellent. It's hard to explain but I recommend this movie to everyone. This is what would really happen after a fleeting romance. And they did it right, and they did it in the positive way. There could have been an awkwardness in the movie, or there could have been suppressed lust that would have flown out the gates. But we see real adults in these characters, and for once in a movie. Everyone involved with 'Before Sunset' did an excellent job.\n\nSet nine years after 'Before Sunrise,' Jesse and Celine meet each other again and catch up.\n\nAn amazing thing about intimacy is that it never has to be physical. Throughout this movie, Jesse and Celine talk. The fact that they talk to each other so openly and honestly is where the intimacy lies. You don't have to see them hold hands, or hug, or touch each other every five minutes to see that they contain a certain intimacy between the two of them. They let themselves go by just being themselves, and we see that unfold when they converse about how they see the world and what they feel. This movie is an accomplishment and success in itself. It deserved its nomination for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards and hopefully it will be a further success throughout the test of time."

        "review_detailed_main": "After reading a number of the negative reviews, I was expecting a real stinker, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the naysayers are, in my opinion, off the mark. \"Before Sunset\" is a fairly good movie, if not as absorbing as \"Before Sunrise.\" The first flick had one thing going for it and that was the young Julie Delpy as Celine. In the sequel, she is older, thinner, and (if possible) sexier, adding a degree of sophistication and a greater sense of style to her youthful beauty and innocence. Despite having become rather cynical and pessimistic, she carries herself with more confidence and has developed her talents, which she illustrates at the conclusion of the film when she sings the song she wrote for Jessie about their night in Vienna. After hearing that, he wasn't going anywhere, at least, not for awhile longer.\n\nEthan Hawke as Jessie has matured and perhaps become slightly less annoying, but the last decade has definitely taken its inevitable toll. The long wavy locks of his youth are gone, replaced by a sort of unkempt, quasi-butch haircut that doesn't suit him very well. Otherwise, he has neatened up his appearance considerably. Older and presumably wiser, he is still arrogant, yet is now more pretentious and has become rather flip and deceptive, while both he and Celine are cigarette smokers. That's something of a turnoff, especially in her case. The dialog is occasionally interesting when they are not shoveling a complete load, yet the tension of their meeting after so many years apart is palpable. The scene in the car, in particular, is a catharsis, at least for Celine. Finally, she gets good and angry with Jesse (the dope), then almost crying, reveals how much she is hurt by the way he has gone on with his life, suddenly showing up as if he could squeeze her love into his busy itinerary (a second time) without any commitment to their future. His answer, designed to temporarily unburden himself of the baggage he has brought along, I found to be slickly self-serving and somewhat cloying. How that young fool could have been absent as the lovely Celine lived out her twenties and lost the edge of her youth is utterly beyond me, but (we are to believe) that's life. The ending, as such, is somewhat more hopeful than the conclusion of the first movie. At least Jessie is willing to miss his plane in order to sleep with Celine one more time, but one suspects that is all he will do, even considering her beautiful song, in which she confesses that he will own her heart until she dies. I suspect it is wasted on Jessie, who remains a self-absorbed jerk. Hopefully, there will be another flick concluding the series and somehow resolving the dilemma in which they now find themselves, if that is possible."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, isn't this what life and love are all about? Consider the dynamics of two characters with an obvious untold passion for one another and you have the makings of a dynamic and intimate exchange of the heart. This movie is not big on special effects and mundane for those who desire visual excitement, but therein is the essence of a human drama which takes place on the streets of Paris, a coffeshop, a tourist's boat, and a chauffeured vehicle ride to a quaint apartment.\n\nMy first play of this movie was less than interesting; on re-play, I paid closerattention to the dialog between the two persons played by Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy .. and hence was almost bored on the first viewing; but the second time around I finally watched closely the conversation between two people ... it so reminded me of my dating relationship .. that I began to identify with the character .. it could have been my story, and, perhaps it is all of \"our\" stories as we pursue that special person in love and life.\n\nJulie Delpy pulls off a strikingly warm and witty performance, very much in control of the conversation and the dialog. A good use of camera-close ups pulls the viewer into her eyes and smile and ... soon she's your girl .. the one you desire, the one who erases the stresses and deadlines of the day.\n\nEthan Hawke depicts a character who is the faithful husband, father and an accomplished author/romance novel writer .. his first encounter with Delpy is but nine years before and they have gone separate ways .. experienced different loves .. and yet the chemistry of their relationship is about to ignite in this touching and heart-felt exchange of commentary.\n\nOne quickly sees an arresting chemistry between two ordinary and yet complicated people who have learned that life is never simple; and love is fleeting .. the honesty with which they exchange their world views .. and more importantly their personal desires is what draws the viewer into the dialog. We learn, sometimes in Griffie language, of hurt, pain, and wantings of the heart ...\n\nThis is a movie that warrants a close inspection of the dialog; and while the clues are all there ... it is not until the ending that you see the pieces come together. Adult situations without Griffie sex -- a thinking person's movie. Those who have lived and lost in love will appreciate how the message is articulated; those who've never loved, probably won't get it .. but are destined to learn the lesson another way."

Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy.\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater.\n\nTo start things off I usually hate romantic movies. I find them very predictable, the characters make me sick, and I usually feel depressed after i view them. I was lucky enough to see \"Before Sunrise\" when it came out to video and I was amazed to see that the guy who made \"Dazed and Confused\" was brave enough not to do another commercial film. Since then I have always been a huge fan of Linklater's work. I loved his Animated \"Waking Life\", and I enjoyed his family flick \"School of Rock\" Richard is the only director I know who can make both big mainstream movies and small independent films and not look like a sellout.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" continues nine years after \"Before Sunrise\". Jesse wrote a book about his one night in Vienna with Celine and is in France at the end of his book tour. Celine shows up and the two of them decide to spend the afternoon together before his plane leaves.\n\nWhat takes next is a series of conversations, and this is where the real gem of the screenplay comes into focus. Because this one does not use pop culture references to get you into the story. It's just normal people having a conversation, but I assure you that it's not boring. I was interested in everything these characters had to say. On their afternoon together they begin to let down their guard and tell each other just what that night really meant to them. Jesse and Celine are both currently in another relationship, but it's clear that these two should be together. It made a true love believer out of me when most films assure me that it's dead.\n\n\"Before Sunset\" is a perfect companion piece to \"Before Sunrise\", but you don't need to see the first one to enjoy this. It stands on it's own as a very good contemporary love story. I hope Oscar voters are wise and nominate Julie Delpy for best actress nods and one for best screenplay to Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, & Julie Delpy. More actors should take cues from them and write their own sequel."

I found myself re-watching the movie just to listen to the soundtrack.\n\nThe script, written by the director and the lead actors, is amazing. I love the fact that the actors, the closest people to the characters, had great parts in the composing of their own text. In this way, the words are more natural, closer to the personalities of the characters themselves. Jesse and Celine are ordinary people, and yet they aren't. They're normal, in the sense that they lead lives and discuss utter randomness that becomes meaningful in the manner that it is spoken. They are extraordinary because they have each other, two chance encounters that can be played out only on film. But that's what movies do - they capture the extraordinary. And that's what sets this one apart from the rest - the sprinkle of surreal in a sea of the ordinary. And what a beautiful sea it is!\n\nNeedless to say, one of my favourites."

Save your money and watch it on free TV in a couple of years. I really do not understand the need for Linklater to make this film in the first place. A sequel to Dazed and Confused would have been a more interesting undertaking on his part."

I have been like a kid on Christmas Eve ever since I found out Before Sunset was being made! Being the same age as Jesse and Celine, Before Sunrise resonated strongly with me then, and Before Sunset resonated even more strongly with me now. Thank you Richard, Ethan and Julie for wildly surpassing even my highest expectations for the continuation of Jesse and Celine's story. It was one of the most beautiful and well made movies I have ever seen. Beautiful, tender, honest, powerful. . . I can only hope there will be more chapters to follow!!!!"

Therefore, when you watch sunset, you literally cry in many scenes, just because of one word, one smile or one look which means so much implications behind it.The most touching part of love is that when you realize the person you keep thinking of is experiencing the same feeling and missing you that much."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before Sunset, 3 out of 4 stars 80 minutes Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Directed by Richard Linklater\n\nA Review by Jimmy Geurts\n\nBefore Sunset can be seen as movie-making in the moment- a film that requires the audience to focus their attention on the movie for a meager 80 minutes if they hope to find themselves swept away by this pleasant albeit fleeting piece of film. And those who let their minds wander from the amiable characters and their coincidental meeting may notice some of the script's shortcomings and as a result might not enjoy Before Sunset to its highest potential. Despite myself I found myself enjoying the sequel to 1995's indie favorite, Before Sunrise. One of Before Sunset's strengths is that it is not a sequel made for financial reasons, so it as a film does not need to be held by a need to satisfy commercial demands. (It was made on a budget of only $10 million). Rather, I like to think that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy, like many of us, wondered if Jesse and Celine ever met again in Vienna six months later like they promised each other to after that unforgettable night. When we see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy on screen, the two seem to be reuniting with the characters of Jesse and Celine just as much as they are acting them.\n\nBefore Sunset picks up nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) parted ways. It turns out for one reason or another, the two never did meet up in Vienna. Jesse is now married with a kid, and Celine, while not betrothed, is currently dating a photographer. Jesse has still not gotten over Celine, and has written a book about the trip to Vienna in the past few years. He is in Paris on a book tour when at a press conference Celine appears into his life again. The two make small talk, about everything from idealism to sex, and try to avoid bringing up the inevitable question: why they never met again after that one magical night in Vienna.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency to Before Sunset's proceedings because instead of sharing a day together, Jesse and Celine only have eighty minutes to reunite until Jesse must take his plane back to the United States. Hawke and Delpy play off each other very nicely, and share a chemistry that hides just below the surface. Hawke as usual does a very good job, and Julie Delpy is just radiant as Celine. The way Delpy plays Celine I could see how someone could become smitten with her.\n\nFor the most part I found Richard Linklater's script to be well done, but especially later in the movie, the conversation between Jesse and Celine does occasionally feel stilted and uneven. In addition, the transition between friendly chat and long-held feelings seems to be a little rough. I can appreciate that this probably intended on Linklater's behalf to emphasize the sudden shift of heart of the two characters, but for a director who I see as having such an ear for earnest truth in his films' dialogue, I would hope he could find a more natural way of changing the mood of the film. Only minor complaints but they did hurt the film for me nonetheless.\n\nThe film plays out as if we were right there with Jesse and Celine, being careful not to cut away from the conversation of the two. Before Sunset is shot with a steady camera and fairly successfully manages to balance both an intimate feel and a good sense of Paris' beauty. And while the movie does use transitions but not to the point where it becomes a distraction. In other independent movies like Running Time, it might've benefited the film's strengths more. Before Sunset is not of those movies.\n\nBefore Sunset is like a light meal: pleasing, light, and ultimately forgettable. Fans of the original who wondered what ever happened to the two after the credits rolled will probably enjoy the sequel. Anyone that disliked the first Before Sunrise aren't going to find much here that will change their minds. For everyone else, it provides a healthy alternative to the Hollywood action blockbusters of the summer."

They part at the end of the movie, with a promise to meet each other back in Vienna 6 months later after the most incredible day of both their lives.\n\nThe sequel begins 9 years later, in Paris (Celina's home town.) Jessie is on the last leg of his book tour - a book written about his brief brush with his true love 9 years ago. This movie follows the same format as the first, dedicated purely to dialogue and human interaction.\n\nThis time around though, Jesse has even less time before his flight back home. The film is simple, but wonderfully romantic. Two people so obviously this connected very rarely happens in real life, and this is a movie about taking your chances when you have them. The acting is natural and unforced, and so is the dialogue.\n\nIt is a slow film, and doesn't use dramatic effects, action, or even strong score to help set the scene. This is a story written about a real life situation, about real people trying to make the best of the time they have been given together.\n\nBeautiful, unassuming and shamelessly romantic, it will make you think, and feel much more than any blockbuster rom-com. When it ends, you feel a sense of loss, because the glimpse into these two characters life can help add so much meaning to your own for a short while.\n\nFor sappy romantics everywhere :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Before Sunset\" is one of the most exquisite romantic modern films I have ever seen. It is reminiscent of the following two movies: Claude Lelouch's \"Un homme et une femme\" (\"A Man and a Woman\" 1966) and Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Trois couleurs: Rouge\" (\"Red\") in that it is a magnificent study of the inner workings of a relationship between two people who meet accidentally: a man and a woman. But their ages, nationalities, and successes (things often used to classify people) are not why the characters in these movies connect. These films are brief glimpses of details that make relationships so intense and so special. The backdrop of Paris adds a lushness to the film's beauty, and it is a comment on the themes of movement, transience, and touring or visiting a place as opposed to living there and it becoming fabric in one's day-to-day \"real life.\" At first viewing, the conversation between the two characters feels so natural, making it surprising to learn that there is no adlib in this film. However, at second viewing, (We stayed for the very next showing of the film!) the brilliance of the construction of the conversation became obvious. Every word is fraught with risk and meaning, even in the beginning of the movie, as the characters talk around the subject of their relationship so masterfully, while using it as every referential point in their dialogue.\n\nThe themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime.\n\nThe ending of this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It makes me think of the Woody Allen film \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" in that the viewer is tempted to leave his/her seat and walk into the movie itself. For, this movie portrays a world where the possibility of returning to pivotal people in our pasts and revisiting the most important moments in time, where our lives irrevocably change is possible.\n\nJulie Delpy, Ethan Hawke, and Richard Linklater are brilliant."

        "review_detailed_main": "First to begin with , I was personally enthralled with the role Ethan Hawke played in the award winning film 'Training Day'.I developed a certain penchant for his character in that very film and his method of acting in general.And so as soon as I heard about this movie (mind you i never heard of the first one in 1995) i immediately got it.\n\nAmidst all the chocolaty romantic bull which usually hits the screen this movie was by far THE BEST ROMANTIC FILM i have seen i.e. even if you can categorise the film as a romantic one. In my opinion Richard Linklater (Director) has done a beautiful job in maintaining a parody with 'Unity of Time and Place ', which is usually a parameter in theatre.The film more than elaborating romance between the two characters explores the helplessness of them both . Separated by time and distance the conversations between Hawke and Deply are a glaring reality of society today. Over the past 9 odd years both seemed to have moved poles apart in terms of lifestyles as Hawke is married (rather unhappily i feel) while Deply is more freelancing than anything else. But what connects the two of them on screen so well is their underlying hate for a 'submissive relationship'. Much more than the meandering conversations the location chosen and shot is PERFECT. The stereotypical characters of Jesse and Celine have give original performances, free of any acting guidelines. At the end of the movie a feeling of nostalgia, hits you whether of the past you have already experienced , or the future which may very soon be your past!.\n\nBrilliant script and memorable acting makes this movie a must watch."

That is basically it: Love is talked and debated to its best. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delply are helped by their sound chemistry and a perfect use of their hidden emotions to show profound love.\n\nA very spontaneous script is softly produced as we travel over the charming settings on the french Riviera. This movie is recommended for quiet, peaceful moments in couples. The lack of dynamics and the somewhat little change of scenario make it dense, but there's no issue if you fell in love hearing the honest dialogs.\n\nIf you are a romantic person; then this movie is for you."

Both movies focus on two very interesting characters, an American (Hawke) and a French woman, when they meet at junctures in their lives.\n\nIn the first movie they meet for the very first time on a train and take a whimsical walk around the streets of Vienna. It's about discovering a place, memories, love and relationships, all of which are pieced together with beautiful dialogue and a fantastic story.\n\nBefore Sunset is the sequel, set and filmed nine years after original. This time it follows the couple around the streets of Paris, and amazingly the dialogue surpasses the beauty of the previous movie. The cinematography is passive, yet intensive, which only enhances the stunningly crafted monologues. The couple meander, discussing what happened on that night all those years ago and how their lives have been influenced by their encounter.\n\nThe dialogue is mesmerising - a real insight to both sides of emotion and love. I recommend watching 'Before Sunrise' before watching 'Before Sunset' to fully appreciate the magical journey of this romantic masterpiece."

The first film was made out of a simple and exciting journey of two free, passionate young minds, whereas this film is set into a scenario where both the protagonists are engaged, in fact one of them is married with a kid. So it was relatively more challenging to continue from where the last film left off and maintain the same plot, like they meet, they have a chit- chat until one of them have to leave for a flight. There has been a change in mentality and lifestyle for both of them, and it was necessary for the movie to depict the same, which the director has done incredibly well! The whole film basically revolves around a continuing conversation just like the first film, only this time around the director didn't have plenty of choices for the environment, like a pub, or riverside, or rooftop as it was in the previous version. What amazed me the most is the way the story unfolds, how they initially appear really happy about current life, but as the movie progressed we gradually get to know how they are actually not fully satisfied with their current relations, and how they try to forget that night, but can't...for obvious reasons. There is so much conflict throughout the dialog sequence, that even though it was just two people walking and talking, you never feel awkward, or bored for a moment. Truly an outstanding piece of direction by Richard Linklater."

It is a simple story that is constructed from dialogue with the two characters. This is about second chances, in this case both begin to question themselves if they love to fantasize about the possibility of being together and lament about how fate has separated.\n\nBoth the plot and the characters are very human, we handle something as normal as it is a reunion, and through that we have a history.\n\nThe two main actors relied on the script, which shows in his performances, then, both know their characters and naturally react to everything and anything that helps the film feel forced and dialogues are very spontaneous.\n\nIt's a film that ultimately leaves us wanting more, and that could be frustrating. Shows how the first love never forgets and leaves a big footprint. The fact that long after you return to be with the person you fell in love and know that you only have a few hours before separating again is what affects them the two characters and the richness of the film is to see them bring that situation through almost pure dialogue."

Before my wife and I saw Before Sunset, we rented Before Sunrise. I'd recommend that to anyone interested in seeing this movie.\n\nOne final comment: Notice how little music is in the movie. The lack of a score allows you to actually experience the movie the way you want to, without a director/composer suggesting how you ought to be feeling about it. That's a brave move for any movie."

Nearly a decade later, Linklater reunites with the film's stars (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk) to produce this sequel. The motive clearly wasn't financial, given the rather limited success of the original; this was a labour of love for all involved. I haven't seen the original film, but having seen the sequel, it has now become a major priority. I must see where this all began. The plot is minimalist. Jesse (Hawk) is now a successful writer, and is touring Paris when he encounters Celine (Delpy). Jesse and Celine wander around the city for an hour and a bit, with Jesse's imminent departure the film's ticking clock. The plot is not the point; this film relies on dialogue and the strength of the two actors' performances. French actress Julie Delpy is truly radiant as Celine, instantly becoming one of my favourite actresses. Ethan Hawk, who has done little work seen by me since Dead Poets Society, is also great as Jesse. No other actor has more then a couple of lines. The dialogue of Before Sunset is wonderful, all of it feeling natural, never forced. Like the first film, the ending of this film is open-ended, although there is a very obvious (and correct) direction for series to take. Bring on Before_______."

Ethan Hawke looks anorexic, almost like an aids patient at different times in the film. He also seemed almost as bored as I was watching throughout most of the never ending dialog. Julie Delpy is only slightly more believable. I rented this film based solely on the fact that it was highly rated (in the top 250 films as rated by the voters of the IMDb. However, really, no matter how high this seems to be on the IMDb's top 250, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! UPDATE! (8/30/08) Still remember how much I HATED THIS MOVIE!"
