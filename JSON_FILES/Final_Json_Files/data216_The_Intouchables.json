        "review_detailed_main": "Do not look at this through the prism of \"Foreign Films\". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.\n\nHollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, \"Intouchables\" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.\n\nSy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless \u00e9migr\u00e9. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.\n\nThe film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).\n\nThis is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile."

        "review_detailed_main": "In less than two months, \"Untouchable\" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success.\n\nMy biggest disappointment in 2011 was with \"The Tree of Life\", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with \"Untouchable\" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism' \u0085 unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it.\n\nSo, I saw it \u0085 and loved it.\n\nThe story of \"Untouchable\" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either.\n\nAnd this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but \"Untouchable\" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in \"Untouchable\", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul,\u0085 well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.\n\nSome movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in \"Untouchable\", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old \u0085The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding.\n\nMany of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title \"Untouchable\" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.\n\nThere are real people in \"Untouchable\", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. \"Untouchable\" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue.\n\nAnd yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011."

        "review_detailed_main": "It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored.\n\nIntouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as na\u00efve as it may sound, the universality of humanity.\n\nThe story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen.\n\nThe audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter.\n\nAgain, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc.\n\nThe audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris.\n\nOn paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of \"best movie of the year\".\n\nI cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored.\n\nPS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way \"The Departed\" did for \"Infernal Affairs\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie \"The help\" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.\n\nPhilippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title \"the second breath\" (in French \"Le second souffl\u00e9\"). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.\n\n09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under \"Crazy credits\" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification."

Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.\n\nThe movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.\n\nWhat makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.\n\nThe story is based upon a true story, and real characters.\n\nIf you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.\n\nThere are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?"

Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.\n\nPhilippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. \"Intouchables\" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.\n\nThe screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.\n\nThe cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good.

It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clich\u00e9d and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).\n\nThe film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA"

And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).\n\nIt is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable"

This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your \"average\" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that.\n\nThere's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me.\n\nClearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you. It's put together well enough to be enjoyed, but for me personally it left little impact, and I can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list. I give it a 6/10, and a generous 6 at that."

Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.\n\nThe fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc\u0085 The clich\u00e9 goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.\n\nThe jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater."

This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.\n\nAnyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.\n\nIf just by the word \"quadriplegic\" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.\n\nA very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.\n\nWow !!! that was some movie. Go get this movie guys and see it today, no now."

        "review_title": "A carefree (yes, carefree) comedy about a quadriplegic",
        "review_detailed_main": "This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as \"race-relations\" feature.\n\nI've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.\n\nI'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.\n\nAnd what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.\n\nAdditionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.\n\nA lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot."

        "review_detailed_main": "According to IMDb, \"The Intouchables\" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.\n\nAs for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.\n\nWhile the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.\n\nGuess that I really like contrasts in movies. The two main characters are complete opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable. Driss is poor, Philippe is rich. Driss is vibrant, Philippe is a quadriplegic. Driss is black, Philippe is white, etcetera. They are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends, which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable.\n\nThey don't just become good friends, they also learn from each other and I believe that they also become better persons because of that. This is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from, in my opinion.\n\nIt doesn't ever dwell on it that Philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head, or that Driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family. If anything, this movie is a celebration of life, rather than than a movie that will bring you down. The effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it, also since the movie doesn't shoves its drama down your throat constantly.\n\nThere are some small side-plots in the movie but the good news about them is that they don't distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the side-plots or its secondary characters. It keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject, throughout pretty much the entire film.\n\nIt's a great movie, in every way. It has a good look to it, that isn't cheap or rushed. It's a respectful and professionally made movie, which all paid off for it.\n\nAlso the acting is just great. Everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie. Of course Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet and Omar Sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this.\n\nIt's just a movie I can't say anything bad or negative about. It's well made and effective, which makes this one of the better genre movies out there!\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Why did the filmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a Senegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every clich\u00e9 -- pot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be refreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply artificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and hair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the adopted daughter -- or further clich\u00e9s -- e.g. the police. Mildly amusing at times, way too long, just watchable."

Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment. Definitely, a must-see picture."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a clich\u00e9 these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.\n\nThe better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment.\n\nThe acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.\n\nThe movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.\n\nIt is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its clich\u00e9 concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.\n\nUnfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clich\u00e9s and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***.\n\nI'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables.\n\nThe Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.\n\n2.1/10"

Holding everything I have to the most, loving everyone I have on my life and really living your life.\n\nThis movie makes you want to get out and breathe, loving your world, how beautiful it is.\n\nI completely recommend it, I've rated it 10 out of 10.\n\nI'm sorry for any mispelling as English is not my primary language."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm 21 and have lived in France nearly all my life. My cousin recommended this film to me and when I saw that Omar Sy was one of the main actors, I just laughed. For those of you who don't know, Omar Sy is one half of a famous Canal + sketch comedy show called Omar & Fred. To sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet were best friends in real life.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was \"Ne Le Dis \u00e0 Personne\" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.\n\nI have seen my fair share of \"touching\" movies but this completely blew me away. If you have 1 hour 40 minutes of your time to spare, please, use it to watch this film. You will not regret it."

This was something really impressing! To all out there who not have seen this movie, I really recommend doing it. You may be thinking this is a another boring drama, but after seeing it I can tell it is more than drama. Comedy mixed with love, feelings and friendship makes this movie something out of its own."

        "review_detailed_main": "A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clich\u00e9d, patronising and predictable.\n\nIt's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times.\n\nAt others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.\u00a8 Intouchables is a remarkable \u00a8feel good\u00a8 French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.\n\nPhilippe (Francois Cluzet) is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter. He is hiring a live-in carer once again (since most only last a couple of days with him). Driss (Omar Sy) happens to be applying for the job, but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work. He's been in prison for the last 6 months and away from home, but Philippe decides to actually hire Driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesn't look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person. Driss and Philippe come from very different backgrounds, but they seem to complement each other very well. Philippe is a millionaire who's interested in art and classical music; while Driss comes from a poor African background, who's interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. Driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with Philippe. Together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts. There are some other secondary characters whose names I don't even remember because they are not very important to the story, but mostly revolving around other house servants.\n\nIntouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his Arab carer who ends up befriending him. The directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it. One of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others. It is truly an emotional and powerful film, a story that will stick with you long after the film ends, and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face. It is a feel good movie, but never feels cursi or anything like that. I was really surprised with Omar Sy and hope he gets many more roles. This is really a great French film, very different from Le Prophet but just as good. I had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

I came to like Driss and Philippe as real characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they go. That is the kind of emotion this movie generates. It has everything you could expect from a great movie : story, characters, laughs and cries, tension and so on. You won't regret seeing this movie alone or with someone.

        "review_detailed_main": "Western filmmakers tend to make stories where someone poor who has zest for life meets someone really rich, but tired of life and turns their life around. In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope."

And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch. The drama Well done.\n\nTen stars would be more than it deserved."

As time goes on we see how their bond tightens, and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve.\n\nI'll say this: the film is super straight-forward, accessible and simple. The pacing is quite fast and solid. The soundtrack is fun, the cinematography is actually better than I expected, beautiful shots here and there. Some of the jokes fall flat, but some made me laugh out loud. I had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters, though nothing truly moving. Just enough to keep me interested, to get me to care.\n\nYeah, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it's genuinely so...I don't know, basic? That I don't have much to say here. Nothing in this film is truly special, the way I see it at least, but The Intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments. Just enough to make it a good movie, actually. It's not an extremely rewatchable film, but it was definitely a fun, good watching experience overall, with a couple of heartwarming scenes. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one."

And Omar Sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in. It felt natural, as if there were no acting involved. If it was made today it would sweep the ceremony, no question. At times it made me laugh uncontrollably, and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies. Although this is not strickly a comedy, it falls more under comedy/drama. It tends to get serious at times. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible.\n\nThis is an absolute \"Must see!\". If you haven't already, do it now!\n\nAnd by all means stay away from the soulless American made remake called \"The Upside\". This is the only version you will ever need."

        "review_detailed_main": "It was very exciting to hear that 'Untouchable' would finally be shown in the UK after appearing in so many other countries first. Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!\n\nDespite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.\n\nOne of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.\n\nThe film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clich\u00e9s here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable."

From the subject matter I assumed at some point during the film I would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully I didn't.

However, the overall feeling I'm having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece; is a calm and thoughtfulness that I haven't felt since I watched the almost six hour long Italian film, La meglio giovent\u00f9.\n\nOne would think that the main two characters, Philippe and Driss, had been living together for 20 years before the recording of this movie. The chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary. Something intouchable.\n\nTogether, they complement each other in a way that is unusual in today's films. Driss, who embodies a \"'pragmatic'\" African french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage. Philippe, being in the state that he is, can't use his body language the way that Driss can. He has to rely on his facial expressions. Something he is mastering very well.\n\nI didn't want the film to end. I wanted it to continue as a TV series, one can come home to and watch after a stressful day at work.\n\nI don't want to say anything more about this lovely 112 minute long touching movie without spoiling the experience for the ones that still haven't seen it.\n\nBut, who could not love this one?

There are no action heroes or good-looking women necessary to make this film perfect. It's all about the story and the development of its characters. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy did a great job there. Their performances were memorable and well fitted. The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way. The movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds. So I strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie - try to enjoy the jokes, but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie. Totally worth every second! 10/10"

I must pay my gratitude to Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet! Both manage to create a realistic and moving friendship on-screen! The thing is that they are two entirely difficult individuals, Philippe (Cluzet) is a wealthy man in a wheelchair, Driss (Sy) is an ordinary, poor guy with a lot of siblings! You follow how a friendship can evolve between these two entirely different persona's, and what their ordinary day would be like, together. Cluzet and Sy gives humanistic and brilliant performances, worthy of an Oscar nom for the both of them! The film is a masterpiece from start to finish, with deep messages, humor and remarkable performances! This movie would be my pic for \"The Best Foreign Language Film\" at the Oscars! Heard that Weinstein bought the rights to the film, with the intention of doing a remake. Dear Hollywood: Don't bother..."

Members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out, but I merely shrugged.\n\nI remember thinking, early on in the film: \"It seems they sort of know what they're doing\", what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography. But as the movie went on, all traces of artistic flair were lost for good.\n\nThe characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good. Then again, I found myself smiling at various points of the movie, but I only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context: by the end, it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes. Francois Cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic, but Omar Sy makes the most of his (very) limited part. It is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development.\n\nLet's sum things up this way: the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story, Omar Sy's performance is really engaging, and yes, the film is VERY entertaining and beautiful, but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't really pinpoint exactly what gives this movie the feel that it has. It's goofy and feel-good yet touching, all without being a definite genre. I've never seen a French movie before I watched this, and I only watched it because it's so highly rated. Prior to viewing, I was minimally interested in the plot, a little doubtful, and kinda iffy about having to read subtitles. But now I'm so happy I saw this. Just listening to the beautiful piano pieces at the beginning and end of this film fill me with emotion that isn't sad nor happy, just one that gives me that feeling of a long quiet night on the road, silently enjoying the company of a great friend. This film doesn't have huge questions to ponder, and it doesn't have melodramatic characters and subplots, at least not too obviously. This is a caring, charming movie that can calm a restless mind, bring a spark of hope and fun to anyone's life, and make you think about it a lot. I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie just because it's in a foreign language!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano, the duo who wrote and directed \"Intouchables\", made a clever creative decision by setting the movie's goals up right away in the first scene through a break of expectation. The viewer is initially induced to assume that the pair of main characters - Driss (Omar Sy) and Philippe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) - is dealing with some kind of emergency, but the soundtrack, actors' facial expressions and the general tone of the scene suddenly change when it is revealed that the characters were faking the \"emergency\" and merely having fun. This is deeply related to what the film is about: The lighthearted, comic and happy moments of a friendship tale. Even though \"Intouchables\" doesn't completely ignore melancholy, suffering and tension, it doesn't give excessive attention to them like most films about people with disabilities do.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the movie is full of hilarious scenes makes it a fairly good option for those viewers who merely want to watch something for fun. There are even some moments which mix sadness and comedy up, in order to not make the story feel utterly depressing at any point. Besides that, the plot also deals with some serious social criticism regarding privilegies and socioeconomic inequality (a factor which is creatively enforced by the colours and scenarios).\n\nIronically, the film's main negative aspect is also related to oppresion and minorities. Driss makes a few mean jokes about overweight people and other groups throughout the movie and frequently takes some annoyingly sexist attitudes towards a female side character. However, although such unnecessary moments might make the viewer mildly uncomfortable, they don't even remotely ruin the full experience. Also, Sy's character doesn't become detestable, given the fact that he is presented with a lot of likeable and relatable personality traits.\n\nIn conclusion, except for a mildly offensive line here and there, \"Intouchables\" is a great movie with a phenomenal and diverse soundtrack, sympathetic characters, splendid performances, and a creative use of colours and scenarios, so it certainly deserves to be watched."

        "review_detailed_main": "This review is mainly a critique, not of the movie, but of the American Movie Reviewers.\n\nTo start off, i'm not from the United States, I'm from Spain. There have been good TV shows and music coming out of spain for years, but films is the one thing we cannot do, due to all films having to be comedies which a part of them are not understandable by international (specially American) audiences due to the politics and very vast culturl differences.\n\nYou may think that had nothing to do with the critique, but it does more than you think. Just like Spain, France does have a very different culture, being even one of the European countries with most differences to the United States. Most of the critic reviews i've read about this film state things that are true in the states when talking about social class levels, but when it comes to France, it is completley different.\n\nThis films is very captivating, and incredibly emotional, one of the best foreign fils I've seen in years, comparable to 2019's Parasite (not as good), and 2018's Roma. Also something that may bias me, it that i have seen this movie religiously, and knowing a basic french understanding helps.\n\nIf i were to reccomend 3 french films these would be the order: 1) Intouchable 2) Le Choristes 3) Les Miserables (2019) {Not the musical}"

        "review_detailed_main": "The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & \u00c9ric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.\n\nThis film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.\n\nAll that being said, the story is clich\u00e9d. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.\n\nStill, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories. It is a well-crafted film, after all. If the premise interests you, by all means, give it a watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a film that works very well at the core. It's true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for mass-market appeal. I can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating. That, however, seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees.\n\nThe acting is superb from both Sy and Cluzet. They deliver force, touch and humour, and have strong chemistry. Although they act out stereotypes frequently, they never become the stereotypes. I think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping, which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away, but must be overcome through force of character. The leading duo (and for that matter the supporting characters) are both believable and likeable.\n\nIntouchables is full of light-hearted humour and adventure. Aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level, there's also a strong life message within. Life is something to be lived, not passively observed. Themes of curiosity, self-awareness, courage and responsibility come across strongly. In this sense, the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy. If these guys can expand their horizons, find joy and adventure, laugh a little at themselves, and take charge of their life and families, then surely we all can.\n\nFinally, there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline. Old aristocratic France is stuck, and relies on immigrant France to keep it moving (literally), and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too. The two don't often come into such intimate contact, or invade each other's space. But if they did? Lots to think about."

The protagonist is wheelchair bound, a quadriplegic or worse, as a result of a hang-gliding accident, which might have been predicted because he risked gliding in bad weather. His wife is almost certainly dead of an unnamed illness (I did not quite understand that part) but that is doubly calamitous since she was the most wonderful woman ever to have lived. He has a spoiled adopted teenage daughter who is involved in a bad relationship. As we meet him he is interviewing for a caretaker/companion and the successful candidate is a Senegalese man who has jumped the line in order get his unemployment form signed so he can leave. The star tells him to return the next morning to get the signed form back, so he leaves, stealing a Faberge egg on the way out. Surprise, surprise when he comes back the next day he has gotten the job. The perks include room and board at a Paris home that Jackie O would have been quite comfortable in. The rest of the movie is so cliche ridden and cloying it is actually insulting to the viewer. Do not waste your time. (And the editing sucks as well.)"

It is Dell-a former prisoner, released from prison, who. Needs work, moreover , they completely find common language. And Filip becomes see on life on the other hand.\n\nI just found this movie absolutely amazing. It expected me by plot, by this history about two different persons who help each other to change outlooks on life. It shows brightly how important is supporting in our live. There are now effects no blood or exposions, it seems to be very easy but we cant get away from the screen while watching this masterpiece. The bright beauty of this film is added by the fact that it is based on real events that took place in real life and this makes this film even more attractive and interesting.\n\nOn top of that, artists, who played in this film are professionals of their doing. Omar Si, who played one of the main roles, is excellent as always. He is also hilarious, sometimes sad, for example, when he asked another assistant to go on a date with him and she denyed, sometimes even angry when he had arguments his family, in particular, a mother who didnot realy love her son for his criminal past. Fransua Kluse also is very professional artist All in all, I was amazed that, that I like this movie, because its realy rare thing.\n\nI recommend this picture to everyone."

The casting was great, and both Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet did outstanding jobs, and the relationship between them seems natural. It was also a very funny movie- though watching with subtitles, i couldn't help but fall for Dris's charm and laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned just isn't enough to qualify this movie for being considered great.\n\nI expected a sensitive, understated French film- what i witnessed was nothing but a feel-good Hollywood movie with little to no substance. Where was the point of conflict? Philip and Dris's relationship, which was- I believe- the point of the movie, suffered no breaking points, no hardship. There were a few points of conflict in Dris's life, which never really resolved themselves.\n\nIn addition, the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes, while useful for comedic effect, blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends. There was very little substantial storyline, replaced by various amusing scenes.\n\nI mentioned before that this was a feel-good Hollywood movie, and that in my opinion is the worst part. The film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters, a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us.\n\nLook, I did enjoy Intouchables. But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDb top 100, and I believe it was a wasted opportunity."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a \"feel-good\" buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.\n\nOther stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical \"magical negro\" stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.\n\nWhen I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).\n\nSo in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.\n\nIf you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive."

        "review_title": "Tweaked a Known Formula",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Intouchables\" took a tried and true formula, tweaked it a bit, and made a sensational movie. The idea of \"The Odd Couple\" has been around for ages. We see it most in buddy cop movies, but it also rears its head in other genres. I, for one, have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends. It's not that I don't appreciate or like the idea, it's just that it has been done so often. The very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes. \"The Intouchables\" takes the idea, guts it, and gives us a gem.\n\nFrancois Cluzet and Omar Sy star as Philippe and Driss. Philippe is a wealthy, paralyzed, white Frenchman who is in need of a caretaker. Driss is a poor, somewhat hood, African Frenchman who is just looking for a job. Driss has no passion for healthcare nor is he at all sensitive towards Philippe's condition, he just wants a paycheck. What you don't expect is that Philippe admires this about Driss. Philippe doesn't want a caretaker who feels pity for him, he wants one that treats him like any other able-bodied human being. And I think that's where the movie distinguished itself. Instead of us suffering through a contentious relationship that slowly transformed into something special, they were practically friends from the start, even if they didn't recognize it. Philippe wanted Driss as a caretaker and Driss wasn't going to pass up a good paying job.\n\nTheir relationship grows over time from one of employer and employee to friendship. It's a funny movie that seems to hit all the right buttons. Driss is not so hood and criminal as to repulse you while Philippe is not so steeped in self-pity so as to depress you. I think their personalities were perfect for each other and perfect for the big screen."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form.\n\nThe characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.\n\nWhen Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Faberg\u00e9 egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10. It's insane that this is a 10 in anybody's rating."

        "review_title": "Tender, beautiful & very funny. One of the French joys of 2012.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Intouchables / Untouchable **** 10 September 2012 I hate having to start like this but, based on the discontented grunts from the morons who walked out in the first minute, I regret I must begin with: Intouchables is a French film. Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.\n\nFor the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.\n\nIntouchables is the true story of Phillipe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.\n\nAnd so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.\n\nThere are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.\n\nThere's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.\n\nCluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.\n\nI really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.\n\nBut these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it if\u0085 Oh, just go and see it. It's beautiful, warm and very, very funny."

The actors play a splendid role to depict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer.I only watched this last night and i watched the original - in french. It is a very recent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to \"chavs\" smoking and speeding Maserati's. The Humour is captured best in the original version as i would imagine a few humorous jokes may not work in translated English. I Loved it."

You don't know how it's going to end and you are smiling when the movie is over, wishing there was more. I usually don't laugh out loud while watching a movie but found myself doing so because even the jokes in this movie were so genuinely funny without being crass.\n\nBoth the lead actors did a wonderful job. The chemistry between them can be felt and you really feel as if you are watching the story unfold in front of you and not on the screen. All the characters were well developed in their own roles and there were no loose ends (something most movies neglect to tie up).\n\nWatch this movie. You will surely recommend it to others as I am doing right now."

Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.\n\nThe real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.\n\nIt's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless. This is the first time I've seen a French film that didn't leave me depressed and suicidal by the end. I hope many more like it will follow."

There are few characters, and the main focus are on two men, who very obviously come from two different life's and struggles, but develops a friendship I have never seen anything like on a movie screen. I almost have trouble describing what this beautiful story does to you. You feel like you wanna run down to the streets and hug a stranger and let them know that whatever they are facing in life that it's gonna be okey.\n\nThe reason i LOVE this movie is because of the story and the people portraying the main characters. They have really done an excellent job both on the cast and the script. You can relate to the characters, they suck you in and you have no other option but to listen and laugh(and cry)with them. The story is unique and original, it touches you in ways you didn't think possible. Don't mistake this movie for a sob-story because it's anything but.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, and think for a second you are not going to either - well then, the jokes on you. Because it doesn't matter where you are, who you are or what kind of situation you are in, it will bring light and love right smack into your little beating bloodbox."

        "review_detailed_main": "Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.\n\nThe film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, \"a flash-back\" so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.\n\nPhillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like \"a nosebleed\" as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.\n\nThe directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.\n\nUntouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!"

The white man is rich and paralyzed from the neck down; the black man is an ex-con from the projects. The former needs a caretaker; the latter needs someone to turn his job application down, so he'll be eligible for unemployment benefits. They meet. They clash. And, against all odds, they become friends.\n\nThat's the plot of The Intouchables (based on a true story), and that storyline has prompted many American critics to label the film \"racist.\" Maybe it's coming from a misunderstanding of some journalists, or from a cultural difference between USA and France, but race is absolutely not the subject.\n\nIndeed, the French title Intouchables which translates literally as untouchable, refers to the 5th Indian caste, these people ostracized by society, as the two characters. Philippe is rich but quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Opposite, Driss is full of life, but he is poor and comes from the suburbs. His disability is purely social. Using humor to explore the sensitive topics of class inequality, and quality of life for handicapped individuals is a tall order for filmmakers of any country. However, directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano accomplished all of this.\n\nAn irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility, The Intouchables depicts an unlikely camaraderie rooted in honesty and humor between two individuals who, on the surface, would seem to have nothing in common.

Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.\n\nIf all this sounds like a series of clich\u00e9s from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.\n\nDriss shows Philippe a good time."

Usually French films are not that popular or familiar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite surprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a film from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and successful marketing.\n\nI also watched it today, and I definitely recommend this film just like others did to me. So fun, moving, beautiful. While watching the movie, the audiences including me burst into laughter or tears for every single second. very priceless moment."

        "review_title": "Defines \"wholesomeness\" and then some",
        "review_detailed_main": "Now here is a film that perfect defines the word \"wholesomeness.\" The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.\n\nThe man, named Philippe, played by Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.\n\nThe next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.\n\nI'm aware the story sounds like clich\u00e9-after-clich\u00e9, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly clich\u00e9 premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, clich\u00e9, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.\n\nThe film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.\n\nAs of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.\n\nStarring: Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet and Omar Sy. Directed by: Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano."

The fact that the film was based on real persons and events makes it even more special. I would recommend it for every audience : each person can learn from the film. Its a story of life, love, daily problems, tragedy but it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the maximum. Also, it shows how two totally opposite people can build an amazing relationship. We just need to forget the prejudice we have about each other. I'm planning to watch it for the fourth time in short notice - that's how good the film is."

That paragliding scene made me want to go paragliding.\n\nBeyond the obvious plot, I see the movie as a look at France's - and much of Europe's - growing diversity. Even if a person in France or Germany doesn't like immigrants, he's still bound to have exposure to them (much like how racist southerners in the US are going to have exposure to blacks whether they want it or not). Of course, most important is the different backgrounds that the men have: Philippe is a modern aristocrat, while Driss is from the ghetto.

Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.\n\nUntouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.\n\nThe film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together."

As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads \u2014 particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely.

As the French entry for the Oscar's Best Foreign Film picture next year, I was glad I held out against watching this while on a flight, patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here, which it finally did outside of the 2nd Rendezvous of French Cinema earlier this month.\n\nThere were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie, especially coming from caregiving, which is never an easy thing to do. Those who have never done it, I'm talking about full time, real time, on the job alertness, and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party. There's no Off button you can use, and anyone in this for full time employment, gets my utmost respect. And watching how the characters here go about their routine, bring back memories that are forever dear to me, and needless to say, these routines and close contact interaction, bring about a new level in relationships.\n\nLifting someone up from bed in back-breaking fashion, it brings new meaning to \"He ain't Heavy, He's my Father\". Tucking someone into bed. Did that too. The gloves for the toilet visit, nothing new, gross that it may be at first. Wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of one's home, well, it may be the most inconvenient, but seeing someone's face light up for the rare trip out, is priceless. And these life-affirming, relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks, and tasks we take for granted, such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction, but to the physically infirm, it means the world.\n\nAnd this is what The Intouchables is about, the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employer-employee relationship that develops into firm friendship, a bromance even if you'd like. Inspired by a true story, Francois Cluzet plays the rich aristocrat Philippe, who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident, and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day. But his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week, given his rather stiff (pardon the pun) ways, until Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with not the most polished resume - he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare - gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview, and soon, a bet turns into what's life-changing for them both, bringing out the best in each other.\n\nYou can half expect writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background, with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff, obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family, with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law. But their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth, that it's hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display, going by the adage that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or by one's background or resume. One may be rich, but getting someone else to wait on you, even if providing him or her with a comfortable life, is a different ballgame altogether, especially when one is not kin or kith.\n\nBut throughout the story, one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way, with wealth on display, and if there's a minor grouse about this, is how old money gets flaunted around, with Meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life. Then again, this is part of the true tale, so it's not debatable. Not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) amongst others who pepper the scenery, the former serving to fill in the blanks for Driss as he tries to gather background, while the latter coming in as an object for Driss' romance, with a little surprise up in store.\n\nThere's no qualms The Intouchables is a delight to sit through, being a story of hope and friendship. And in some ways, even for the most able amongst us, this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour, which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations we'll encounter from time to time. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put in amazing performances, and their delivery of their characters, screen charisma and banter, are more than reasons enough to catch this. A definite recommendation!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.\n\nPhilippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.\n\nThe rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.\n\nThis is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.\n\nThe film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers. There will be a US re-make of this one, but the two lead actors here (especially Mr. Sy) make this one worth seeing."

I don't know how else to explain it, it's just a wonderful movie. You must see this one, that's all I can say.\n\nMust watch!"

In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely G\u00e9rard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film \"The Intouchables\" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of \"the haves\" and the \"haves not\" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people. \"Intouchables\" has broken all box office records in France as it honestly portrays a poor man's entry in the life of a rich man."

Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well, and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story is wonderfully touching, without any syrup.

I will say I was little skeptic at the beginning because I usually watch American/English movies mostly and I usually don't like non-English movies, I found them almost every time boring and I lose interest very soon, but this one kept me watching without a brake. Its just a WONDERFUL story about friendship and courage of two men that came from totally different backgrounds, but they fit together in this movie PERFECTLY. I gotta say Omar Sy performance was Oscar worthy, he was just great, he made me laugh through the whole movie and he was incredible, and Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, what can I say about him, he was just great, playing such hard role, I think no one would have done better job then him. Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT. The story was based on true events and I believe that fact made the movie even better because it has one thing that most other movies don't have and that is REALITY. When I think about this movie and these two guys and I realize somewhere in the world they exist it makes so happy I just want to be a better person, better friend, better man...\n\nSo if you ask me this movie is MUST SEE, believe me you will not regret it..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I NEVER post a professional review BUT now - - ROGER EBERT reviewed this and said exactly what I felt and wanted to say about this film. Rather than trying to paraphrase his review I am simply posting his original review found on his web page: (since links are not allowed i have put spaces in the link. you need to remove the space to follow the link)\n\nhttp://rogerebert.suntimes.com/ apps/pbcs.dll/ article?AID=/20120530 /REVIEWS /120539995/ 1023\n\nIt might help to think of \"The Intouchables\" as a French spin off of \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" retitled \"Pushing Monsieur Philippe.\" A stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the Paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana. This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.\n\nThe film was an enormous box-office hit in France, and indeed, it is easy to enjoy. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Driss' cheeky irreverence is refreshing, and Philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men, based on Driss' confidence that Philippe will improve if he escapes his stuck-up lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from Africa. There may be a certain truth in this, but the education of Philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clich\u00e9s. Driss, you see, has rhythm and soul, and if only Philippe can absorb some of that, he'll be a happier man. He'll still be a French millionaire surrounded by a protective staff, he'll still be paralyzed, but he'll be happier. How many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face? \"The Intouchables\" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world.\n\nThe success of the film, despite its problems, grows directly from its casting. Francois Cluzet, who acts only with his face and voice, communicates great feeling. Omar Sy is enormously friendly and upbeat. He reminded me of the African immigrant played by Souleymane Sy Savane in Ramin Bahrani's \"Goodbye Solo\" \u2014 a film that avoided the traps that \"The Intouchables\" falls into.\n\nThe appeal of a film like this, and it is perfectly legitimate, is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters, what makes them happy make us happy. Caught up in the flow of events, we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged. The writer-directors, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags, and their style is ingratiating. But at the end, by looking through the foreground details, what we're being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes.\n\nThat was also true of \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" but it was a period picture set in the South in the late 1940s, with older characters who had been shaped by their times. There was a plausibility there. \"The Intouchables\" is more of a soothing fantasy.\n\nby Roger Ebert - May 30, 2012"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so my first concern why I didn't want to watch The Intouchables was the story itself. Like it was scavenged from a Hollywood studio's thrash can: \"A disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a down-on-his- luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid. The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after.\" That really sounds like something Hollywood might cook up. Like Scent of a Woman or Flawless.\n\nBut here's the catch: This movie is based on true events. Not in the sense as Titanic for example, where the only historically accurate fact was that \"the ship sunk\". It really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie. Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo (the real life billionaire who this movie is about) personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and Abdel Sellou (his aid) as realistically as possible. Sure, they took a little artistic license here and there, but it's mostly accurate.\n\nThe thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people don't know how to handle them. Dr. House said it best in the series, that once people know you have cancer, from then on everything will be about cancer. People will feel obligated to feel sorry for you 24/7. They will be overly attentive, overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you. They will never ever just be themselves around you. Even if you've accepted your condition a long time ago, and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease, you'll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot NOT see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you.\n\nWhat this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this. Driss is brash, brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for Phillip. He acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic, and he slowly learns to take care of him, but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy oh-I'm-so-sorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be. Instead, he makes fun of Phillip's condition on many occasions making even Phillip himself laugh. He introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into Phillip's life, which makes him see the world in a new light. Instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past, he starts to look to the future, take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has.\n\nAll in all, The Intouchables was a really positive surprise. It's not a perfect movie but it's a perfect story."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the \"professional\" applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.\n\nThe film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.\n\nIt's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.\n\nI liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks. A wonderful soundtrack, the Chamber Orchestra scene was great."

And what's wrong with that???\n\nThe movie is about two people who can not be any more different. One has his health, he is tall, strong and playful but no money and education what so ever. The other has all the money in the world but everything below his neck is paralyzed, he is reserved in manner. After they meet they quickly connect. It is as if they both find, in each other, the things they have been craving for a long time.\n\nThe movie was a hit with audiences when it came out but it is not that popular with critics because according to them it is too stereotypical. Well i don't agree with that one bit. I thought the movie handles all the moral issues very correctly. I was also sad to learn that this movie wasn't even nominated for a best foreign language film award, it is such a shame. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie please do, because it is one of those movies that make you feel good from the very inside.\n\nAs for the technical stuff, i thought everything was spot on. the movie is put together in a way that makes you wonder if their even is anyone behind the camera which is a good thing because it shows how the actors are so natural in their rolls."

        "review_detailed_main": "Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, \u00e0 la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.\n\nThe cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.\n\nThe only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant!\n\nGrady Harp"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Intouchables is a French comedy/biography from 2011 and stars Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet (Tell No One, Little White Lies, French Kiss) and Omar Sy (X-Men Days of Future Past, Jurassic World, Samba). It was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano (Samba, Those Happy Days, Tellement proches).\n\nThis film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named Philippe (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) who hires a lower-class man from the projects called Driss(Omar Sy). With help from Driss, Philippe finds humour in his situation and Driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates, listening to funk music and even giving him a joint.\n\nThis film is propelled by the performances by Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet and Omar Sy. Fran\u00e7ois gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements. Surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour. Omar Sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues. Whenever the two are on screen together it is gold. I would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper.\n\nAnother aspect of this film that I admired was the dialogue. Since there is no real plot other than the story of two men, the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue. For example, when the two are looking at a piece of art, Philippe asks Driss why he thinks people are interested in art, Driss replies with because it's a business when Philippe tells him it's because it's the only thing one leaves behind.\n\nThis film is basically the French version of Driving Miss Daisy, that is not to say this film is bad. This film's strongest points are writing and acting, but after that it's pretty thin. Directing or cinematography isn't anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film. Yet this is still a heartwarming film it seems like it is a little overrated."

        "review_detailed_main": "After missing last year's 'The Help' on principle (the principle being: black people have moved on; why can't Hollywood?), I couldn't help but approach 'Untouchable' with similar trepidation. My preconception was a misconception: It is one of the best films I've seen all year, and is by far the best foreign one. It's about platonic love between polar opposites. It's about hope and happiness.\n\nSet in Paris, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's heart-warming film stars Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet (a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman) as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic widower and Omar Sy as Driss, a brutish ex-offender from a Parisian project.\n\nLooking for someone who will not pity him, Philippe hires Driss as his carer. Driss almost leaves until he sees his lavish quarters \u2013 and Magalie, Philippe's sexy auburn-haired secretary, who Driss makes it his mission to bed. Driss does pity Philippe, but never makes the mistake of showing it. Instead, the two make jokes at each other's expense and a bond very quickly (and believably) develops. They introduce each other to their worlds. One is replete with operas, art and literature; the other with girls, spliffs and street knowledge. By the end of the film they are inseparable.\n\nThis could easily have been a tale of race, like 'The Help' was, but that is inconsequential in this film. It is purely coincidental that Philippe is white and Driss is black. When Philippe's personnel look disapprovingly at Driss, they do so because of his rough manner, not his colour. One of the film's strengths is that it doesn't mention this detail, which is after all as irrelevant as it being set in France. One thing that ought to be mentioned is that Omar Sy is not just the help in this film; he's the star, commanding the screen with confidence, charm and credibility.\n\nWhat cautions me from classing this as a perfect film is the few but prominent clich\u00e9s. Philippe has a daughter who's so much the stereotypical spoiled little girl, and Driss's own family hates him. Also, the setups are overly familiar. Driss scoffs at Philippe's love for classical music and abstract art, but then learns to love Vivaldi and Bach, and then, astonishingly, creates a painting of his own which sells for 11,000 euros! This film is based on real people (Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his carer Abdel Sellou), so these things may be accurate, but this isn't a documentary of their actual lives.\n\nHowever, I can easily forgive these clich\u00e9s because they are outnumbered by the many wonderful laugh-out-loud moments. Returning from a hiatus, Driss insists on shaving an unkempt Philippe. He snips away leaving Philippe looking more absurd upon each stroke, leaving him with a hitlerian moustache!\n\nAlready 'Untouchable' has achieved a phenomenal level of success. It is making and breaking records across the globe, and is beating such films as 'The Artist' to awards. It has rightly been entered as France's entry for next year's Oscars. It is sure to win.\n\nwww.moseleyb13.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.\n\nIntouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.\n\nIt is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.\n\nAnd with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.\n\nThrough his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.\n\nThe amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.\n\nI don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.\n\nIt's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "Feel-good French film The Intouchables tells the true story of the burgeoning friendship between an old, aristocratic invalid and his young, impoverished caretaker. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of film that, at some point, seems destined to travel down one of two paths, descending either into a lecture on the class differences between certain socioeconomic groups or a comparison between the relative hardships of near-poverty and living with a severe disability.\n\nAnd therein lies the excellence of this film. Not only does it avoid both topics and, in so doing, keeps itself from becoming overly melodramatic, but it actually subverts audience expectations by persistently looking, as those Monty Python boys suggested, on the bright side of life. A big part of the film's charm is the effortless interplay between Omar Sy (caretaker Driss) and Francois Cluzet (Philippe), who clearly have a lot of fun with their roles while concurrently displaying total immersion in their characters.\n\nIf managed poorly by directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, Driss's avalanche of one-liners and practical jokes at the expense of his handicapped friend could've come off as misplaced and in poor taste. However, the acting pair's wit and comic timing turns virtually all hit-or-miss jokes into gold and contributes greatly to making The Intouchables...well...just plain funny.\n\nIn the same way that 'fun for the whole family' has comes to be interpreted as 'a living hell for anyone over six' by contemporary viewers, the classification of a 'dramedy' has come to imply a meagre handful of humour, quickly pushed aside to make room for a sob story. The Intouchables gets the formula right, injecting varied forms of comedy in between a genuine, emotionally investing subplot involving the lovelorn Philippe's pen pal Eleonore (Dorothee Briere). A toe-tapping soundtrack brimming with disco classics serves as the icing on the cake for this potentially Oscar-winning delight.\n\n*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

The movie showcases the turmoil, a quadriplegic faces in his life and shows how little things in his life bring about great joy. It also stresses on the point that how the small things we generally ignore, provide with relief n happiness in times of adversity when focused upon.\n\nThe acting in the movie is brilliant. Francois Cluzet has given an outstanding performance as the quadriplegic. As far as Omar Sy is considered, I couldn't say he was acting at all. It was as though I was actually seeing things happen in real life as they unfold. He was deeply in character and has delivered an award winning performance.\n\nOverall, the movie is thought provoking one, rich in emotion n detail. I give it a 8/10."

A wonderful and emotional story about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic who requires a live-in caregiver.\n\nOne the plus side, the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time. In this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the job to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.\n\nPhilippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic. In this movie you will discover a story of love and close friendship.\n\nMoreover, this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot even more real and attractive.\n\nGo and see this film.

I felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments - a clear summer sky where the clouds are full, loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings.\n\nThis 'glow' is because the principal casts are excellent. I cannot direct a negative to any of the casts, pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation. Omar Sy is infectious as a performer. He struts. He dominates with his energy. Whoever cast him deserves praise, as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding. Francois Cluzet pedigree dates back decades, and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to Sy's exuberance. Trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance. It would be easy - and a major oversight - to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing. Funny, moving, idiosyncratic, unexpected, real, intimate, soul praisingly positive, and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film.\n\nI stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background, and its a gem of a film. One of them films you watch and yell, 'yesssss to life'.\n\nThe fact that its based on a true story is inspiring in itself. The production value fulfilled the necessary parts to realise a wonderful and life inspiring story, achieving for once, the medium of film to rank in the spheres of great art. An aesthetic tonic for the soul."

The part were the man is talking on the phone with the woman he says ''don't forget to ask her about her weight'', was that supposed to be funny? Literally nothing in this movie was funny, there were just the same old repeated unfunny conventional jokes. And I know that a rating below 5 is something bad, a 6-7 is good, and something over 8 is excellent(most of the time), so one may think this is next level, but it wasn't, just from seeing the poster I knew how this was going to be, and I hoped I was wrong, but I wasn't.

        "review_title": "A Magnificent Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "A French movie with English subtitles enters the finicky American movie market with two strikes against it.\n\nIt's French -- strike one.\n\nIt has subtitles -- strike two.\n\nWhich is a crying shame, because one of the year's most enjoyable and uplifting films has pretty much come and vanished from theaters, unable to garner much attention during another summer filled with mindless action adventure \"thrillers\" and sleep-inducing \"comedies.\" The Intouchables is a marvelous film. Carried by two outstanding lead performances by Francois Cluzet (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Cy (who deserves an Oscar nomination for a movie-stealing performance), this film has wit, candor, humor, sadness, and ultimately great inspiration. The film's credibility is boosted by it being based on a true story.\n\nCluzet plays a quadriplegic, which means he is confined to a wheelchair unable to feel any sensation below his neck. If there's any upside, it's that he's also very wealthy, giving him considerable options that would not otherwise be available to a person of lesser means.\n\nCluzet is utterly bored with his life, not the least of which has anything to do with his physical impairment. One senses that even if he were not parked in a wheelchair, he would still need something more. A great deal more, in fact. What Cluzet needs is stimulation, excitement, and most of all \u2013 someone he can call a friend.\n\nHe finds all of this in the unlikeliest of places.\n\nOmar Cy plays the part of unemployed street thug to absolute perfection. He's a Senegalese immigrant languishing in the slums of Paris burdened with typical urban family difficulties -- poverty, drug abuse, lack of hope and opportunity. One can imagine that there are many Omar Cy's living as second-class citizens throughout the modern world. In fact, the city here may be Paris. But it could just as easily be Sao Paulo or Chicago. He meets Cluzet in what can only be described as an unexpected encounter, and the two men begin to engage in an uneasy, but captivating friendship.\n\nEveryone can see what's coming next. And that's perfectly okay. Initially indifferent to Cluzet's condition, Cy will ultimately come to care deeply for the man who is not just an employer, but a pathway out of pointlessness. The man in the chair becomes a muse and means of escape, an emotional and spiritual home for a foreigner who instantly resumes the role of \"immigrant\" once he steps back beyond the threshold of Cluzet's luxurious apartment and back onto the streets of Paris.\n\nThe two men desperately need each other, in completely different ways. Eventually, they engage on a bucket list of activities, bonding in the process, allowing the rest of us to go along for the ride. And what a joyous ride it is.\n\nCritics have correctly pointed out this film gives a somewhat sanitized depiction of what being without the use of one's arms and legs must be like. While most of the film focuses on the role of caregiver, we are constantly reminded (or perhaps, I simply could not get it out of my mind) that not every quadriplegic receives such meticulous physical care nor emotional support. It helps to have money, no matter who you are.\n\nBut I was willing to overlook this and enjoy a film full of energy, comedy, and ultimately of happiness.\n\nAdmittedly, the conclusion of the film seems all too neat and tidy. But again, I am going to give the filmmakers a pass here for reasons you may understand only if you see the film, which enables audiences to come and appreciate how important people are to other people. After all, we are allowed to enjoy an uplifting film every once in a while. Never mind that it's all somewhat contrived.\n\nOne of my barometers in judging a film comes with a fundamental question. Namely, do I think about the film the next day, and perhaps the next.\n\nI did. I must admit I was moved emotionally by this film. So was everyone else in the audience, from the reactions I saw. I laughed. I teared up. And, I rejoiced in the end.\n\nCall me naive, but I wish all life ended just like it does in the movies. I know -- it doesn't.\n\nBut that won't stop me from dreaming and enjoying the fantasy."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Intouchables is one of the popular foreign movies of the last couple of years, rocketing to a comfortable position in IMDb's top 100 and succeeding the European box office. It is a really charming film, but charm doesn't make a film. It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.\n\nUnfortunately the film doesn't have a particular style or it tries things which feel jarring - such as the montage split screen music video style opening credits after a very strong thriller theme. The cinematography is nothing special and the editing is quite distracting with some scenes with time jump cuts that really didn't do it for me. It does focus on its strongest aspects which are the eccentric and charismatic performances, writing and soundtrack (a mix of R'n'B and classical to fit the characters). All the situations are things we've seen before and it's never dealt in a way we haven't seen before (such as Philippe having a long distance lover that Driss pushes him towards), it is the chemistry of the central friendship that makes the film. It is very pleasant. But those pleasant ideas only work for the 2nd act, after an awkward 1st and 3rd that doesn't really satisfy or close itself. It trades potential for genuine conflict or dilemma for directionless despair due to crisis of confidence and ultimately renders the film not making much of an impression. Granted, as a buddy film, it's pretty damn good and it certainly has its strong feel-good moments.\n\n7/10"

But in my opinion it was just a nice, sweet movie nothing more. I think that is very easy to make audience 'emotionally attached' to a film that has to do with a quadriplegic and his life and this is why I believe that it was a safe path for the production and there were not something new, something different, something that can make you wonder and admire the creativity of director or writer."

This movie finally gives an honest portrait of disabled man, at once gruesome and humbling, while keeping the focus firmly on his relationship with his carer instead of dwelling on his disability. Indeed this is a story as much about overcoming class divide as it is about overcoming physical disability.\n\nDown and out Driss, part of Paris's disenfranchised and unemployed black youth, applies for a position as millionaire quadriplegic Phillipe's carer in order to get a signature for his jobseeker's benefit. Phillipe, appreciating the young man's honesty and frank attitude towards his condition, hires Driss and simultaneously resolves the Driss's poverty and his own boredom.\n\nThe genius of this film, in spite of its dark subject matter and themes of disability, class and race, is that it is genuinely hilarious. Omar Sy as the no holds barred Driss oozes cool and yet is heartbreakingly affectionate towards Francois Cluzet's Phillipe.\n\nI laughed and cried in equal measure - what more can you ask?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie today and It's really, really hard to say to what wasn't said before. This is just a perfect movie. A simple story about a poor black guy taking care of old paralyze man. It's simple, sweet and at moments very, very funny. The actor who plays Driss makes excellent job by portraying character as street-wise and amusing. It's just a short of person who you would want to hang-out with from the very first second.\n\nSome of my favorite parts are the comedy which often take you off-gourd but drama is perfect as well. There where few small moments when movie felt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be happy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie Driss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that they show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help much."

I was also pulled by the two smiling faces on the movie poster usually these things means a lot to movie addicts like myself. As one go deeper into the movie, it gives an understanding of how life truly is and how people sometimes are not what they really seem. 'The Intouchable' is truly a fun, entertaining and meaningful movie.\n\nThe actors are great and unlike other movies I have watched recently, there is no over acting on their part. Every character adds to the colorfulness of the movie and the movie obviously was sure how the plot would go from beginning to end like most great novels. Since it is based on a true story, it makes you wonder how two people from two totally different world find a friend in such condition. I do not know how much this movie achieved, award wise but I am positive, it is a movie for all people who watch movies for all reasons.\n\nThis movie may not make the adrenaline going like Skyfall but no doubt about it, it is just as good. This movie is worth every penny & time."

No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them.\n\nThe film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons closely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal with them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.\n\nAnd last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and similarity) could be tempted to go for it..."

It displays the aspects of drama by showing a connection between the two worlds that the main characters live in and when the two worlds merge together, the story manages to keep you smiling throughout the duration of the film. The beauty of the film is that it does not force the jokes and humor, the moments kind of happen on their on thanks to the brilliant play of the main characters who have good chemistry.\n\nLast but not least, when I rate movies I tend to give 9/10 and usually that last 10th star depends on the music and job that the composers have done. In The Inouchables music fits perfectly into the settings and the emotions... 10 out of 10"

From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clich\u00e9s posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head. Would perhaps have been funny as an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Quite a trial to sit through."

And i'm really impressed, as this is Omar's first lead role in acting, he played it off really well, not just in the funny parts, but as well in the emotionally acted parts. This is defentily a movie i would watch over and over again and recommend to all my friends. Definitely one of the best french movies i've seen in a while. I'm so glad i saw it. You should too. Everythings good. The storyline, the screenplay and the directing. The acting is great as well, and the humor would probably go well in all countries, not just France. It's worth a watch and deserves an 8!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Intouchables had cult status written all over it. It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Omar Sy and Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, superb direction and astounding background score.\n\nPhilippe becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident and is in search of a care-taker to look after him. Driss turns up for the interview , not to get the job though but to get a signature for the welfare trust. Impressed with his attitude, Philippe hires him as his care-take. Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.\n\nDirected by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!\n\nI kept on hearing about this film for long time and am glad I took the decision to watch the film. There are so many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score that gels with mood of the film !!! Highly recommended : 4/5"

        "review_detailed_main": "After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) hires a young man from the projects (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker.\n\nThe Independent called it a \"a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago \u2013 uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?\"\n\nWhile \"the Independent\" is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as \"The Birdcage\" (at least the American version, if not the French one).\n\nNow, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250. A good comedy, yes, but not a film that offers any sort of deeper meaning or one that will remain important over the long term. While popular and a box office record holder, this is not a title one expects to be considered a \"classic\" later on."

Parsing letters, writing letters to his beloved, whom he could not even call. Probably, before Driss appeared, he didn't even want to live.\n\nOmar Sy played a wonderful man named Driss. It was Driss who taught Philippe to look at the world with different eyes. Through the eyes of an optimistic person who, even in a wheelchair, can hope for the best. He was real, without the mask of a cultured person, he was from a simple family in which, although there were cruel laws, they were correct and taught life. He looked at the world through the eyes of an optimistic person.\n\nThe director's work was excellent. Beautiful landscapes, everything was shown so well. Simply wonderful. In particular, the parachute flight and car ride at the beginning and end of the film were very memorable.\n\nThe music was pleasing to the ear. So calm, she approached every moment she played.\n\nThe film is wonderful, amazing, kind, sincere. It's worth watching for everyone. This is the truth of life.

Directed by Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano, the movie tells the story of Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat, and Driss, a young man from the projects who becomes his caregiver.\n\nAt its core, \"The Intouchables\" is a tale of friendship, empathy, and the transformative power of human connection. The dynamic between Philippe and Driss is both humorous and touching, as they navigate their differences and learn to appreciate each other's unique perspectives on life. The film beautifully captures the evolution of their relationship, from initial skepticism to deep mutual respect and affection.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths lies in its portrayal of disability and caregiving with sensitivity and authenticity.

Driss' role as his caregiver is portrayed with humor and compassion, showcasing the importance of empathy and understanding in providing care for individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe performances of Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss are nothing short of exceptional. Cluzet brings depth and vulnerability to his portrayal of Philippe, capturing the character's emotional complexity with nuance and subtlety. Sy, on the other hand, infuses Driss with charisma, humor, and warmth, creating a character who is both endearing and relatable. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, elevating their on-screen interactions to a level of authenticity that is truly captivating.\n\nIn addition to its powerful performances, \"The Intouchables\" also excels in its exploration of themes such as resilience, acceptance, and the value of human connection.

The movie is based on a true story about a beautiful friendship.\n\nThis movie is funny, emotional and shed light on subject most directors do not like to make movies about because it can easily became controversial, but I believe The Intouchables have done it perfectly.\n\nDefinitely will not regret watching this feel good, heart warming movie about a pure and true friendship.\n\nDo yourself a favour a watch this movie asap."

If I were to describe all the events that happen in the movie, you would think it was a TV mini-series full of episodic misadventures. But, with the way the movie edits its scenes, it moves along at a clip, never wasting a minute. Hearing that, you may think that the film is action packed. But no, it is a very mellow movie. The film is at its strongest when our two main characters are just hanging out. Whenever Philipe and Driss are sharing screentime together, it is a good time. It is whenever the movie jumps to a conflict it is less interesting.\n\nI'm glad to see that so many people enjoyed this relatively small French film from 2011. I genuinely wish I would have liked it more, I just found the conflicts with the kid, the egg and the family to be draining. But the time our two leads are just hanging out, it is a real good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "* i.e. as in black hero's name in the movie.\n\nI came to this unusually for me, through the trailer, coz it seemed to be such potentially feel- good 'based on a true story' inspiration: and perhaps it was: but for me the ultimate betrayal was to see in the final credit sequence the two it was truly based on, the one who the real hero was \u0085 (da, da, da credits plot spoiler alert) NOT BLACK!! He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH. The original inspiration has been marginalised/ 'white'washed outta da movie public's knowledge/appreciation/enjoyment.\n\nThen - as several have here also well noted - the (French?!) attitude portrayed towards women is positively neanderthal! Did they mean that? Or is that automatic to French storytelling? Even to excuse one women's (sensible) brush off of the black helper's unsophisticated bathroom overtures, in the end they make it all alright she declined him, by inferring the only reason she would turn him down is coz .. (da, da, daa) she's lesbian! NOT because she thought he was immature arrogant chauvinist \u0085\n\nAs in spreading the fact that it was 'based on truth', then certainly as uplifting as the Omar Sy character is shown doing for his paraplegic saviour (he's saved from a downtrodden marginalised poor life by his 'service'): otherwise, 'based on' bordering a travesty of the truth."

        "review_detailed_main": "When people for some reason are limited in their abilities and cannot live their own lives, they either begin to take an excessively active part in someone else's life, or try to realize themselves through another person. So, for example, single mothers act, having one beloved child, which becomes the meaning of their whole life. Or housewives merging into their husbands. Or that's why grandmothers at the entrance love to gossip so much. Or remember the hero of the movie \"The Benefactor\" played by Richard Gere. However, it is possible to realize oneself through another person both in a bad and in a good way.\n\nThe paralyzed aristocrat Philip, whose life is not to be envied at all, is sent by the Lord God himself, the gouging Driss. It is only in the opinion of others that Driss is the least suitable for the role of a nurse - a criminal past, uneducated, from the lower strata of society, and generally colored. Maybe Driss is not entirely attentive to details, but he has an excellent sense of humor and quickly \"cuts\" what exactly Philip needs - namely, fresh air, literally and figuratively. He is trying to restore Philippe's taste for life, to diversify it with the help of such simple but important little things - puffs with a joint, a quick drive through the evening streets of Paris, erotic massage. And Philip needs such adventures much more than the close attention of other - \"correct\", but boring to the point of toothache - nurses who also feel sorry for him. Pity and treating him like a porcelain figurine do not give Philip pleasure, but rather only irritate him. But he is delighted with the carelessness of Driss, who without a second thought puts a cigarette into Philip's mouth and rolls it at an exorbitant speed. Philip gets pleasure when Driss treats him like an equal (what a Senegalese thug can do, a wheelchair user can do). This new life experience gives Philip the opportunity, at least for a while, to escape from his sad thoughts - he does not spend all his evenings in the living room, dictating high-flown letters to his secretary. Driss succeeds in changing Philip's life for the better, helping him get rid of the fears and insecurities that prevent him from establishing a personal life. Charming Driss wins the sympathy of not only Philip himself, but also other inhabitants of his house. It is quite obvious that he does his job not just for money, but also gets real pleasure from it. Quite naturally, the relationship between Philip and Driss goes beyond the \"customer-servicing staff\" and turns into a friendly one.\n\nOn the example of Driss, we are once again convinced that it is not always worth evaluating a person by his appearance and making hasty conclusions. Here we see Driss in a sweatshirt and baggy jeans, and we are immediately tempted to label him as a dim-witted bum. But as soon as he changes into a suit and shoes, he immediately transforms. And when he incendiary dances to rhythmic music, setting the tone at first for Philip's boring and official birthday party, you can't take your eyes off him at all. This is the talent of Driss - defiantly, but organically deviate from the protocol, giving Philip the opportunity to truly feel alive. What can I say - Driss is just a unique character. For all his outward rudeness, he has amazing plasticity and acting skills. Even such a boring and unloved activity by many men as shaving, he manages to turn into something exciting. That's why Philip is so attached to Driss - because he \"breaks\" the standards that Philip is already fed up with.\n\nThrough Driss, the filmmakers are perfectly able to broadcast the installation to the viewer - you should not feel sorry for Philip. He is limited in his physical capacity, but not at all limited in his inner qualities. On the contrary, such a person is worthy of admiration - he does not slide into depression, misanthropy, but, on the contrary, is very strong in spirit, has optimism and retains human dignity. Of course, we must pay tribute to the fact that Philip has access to a lot that is not available to other people in his position, constrained in their means, because Philip is very rich. But, as the French say, \"se la vie.\" We deal with what is. The stronger the contrast of the main characters - the rich and the poor, the aristocrat and the uncouth resident of a high-rise building from an emigrant district, white and black. And this contrast \"holds\" the viewer throughout the film, as well as a very strict adherence to the framework of the tragicomedy genre. The result is a very balanced mix with neither one nor the other outweighing the scales.\n\nThe Untouchables made me associate with another film made 5 years after the release of The Untouchables, namely Me Before You. There we also deal with a paralyzed aristocrat who is hired a nurse, only in \"Me Before You\" the role of nurse is not an African-French, but a young, flowering girl who also manages to do for the protagonist what was not possible before. Others.\n\n\"The Untouchables\" is the perfect movie for a pleasant evening viewing when you want something like that. It is like the quintessence of everything French - simple but elegant. The film is moderately light, moderately touches on social topics without tedious moralizing and teaching, moderately provides food for thought, and, most importantly, is based on real events. \"Trust me,\" says Driss. And there is no better slogan for the film."

Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.\n\nThe movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.\n\nWhat makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.\n\nThe story is based upon a true story, and real characters.\n\nIf you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.\n\nThere are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I noticed some jaded critics on rotten tomatoes (generally very positive reviews but I wanted to read the critical ones to see WHAT they missed. it's what I do so I can see what makes one tick & their viewpoint) and wanted to address that first.\n\nWhat I think they wanted is to see more sorrow, heartache & troubling nature of being disabled (one mentioned the D/bell & butterfly which yeah, I've seen..I do appreciate but did NOT enjoy that one bit. Still, listen up.... this is NOT going in that direction for a reason!) You do KNOW some films regarding similar subject matter have varying things to say as it's multifaceted just like our LIVES are. We can be miserable, full of pity & sorrow one day & full of life & joy another. Thankfully all due to the variety life has to offer. No matter what your condition, physically or mentally. So I'm clear, they in NO way try to gloss over the harsh reality of paralysis OR poverty. I got that, think everyone did. But what of Humanity, what of friendship & of the power of hope, kindness? Is this not universal to all?\n\nFurthermore, to suggest there can be NO humor, emotion, attachment or soul to experiencing that ....then ALL we do is to shortchange human beings & life itself. These actors were simply fabulous & I was not only a willing participant to join on both of their journeys but most of all, good to be mindful that this wonderfully touching film is based on a REAL friendship so to address any suggestion of it being maudlin or sentimental (it's neither) makes me wonder what is wrong with YOU. We witness REAL struggle---even hopelessness. Again, who among us hasn't experienced this at least ONE moment in their life? In fact, for me watching one of our main protagonists wonderfully celebrate the joys of dance while the paralyzed man's face registers clear unfettered elation.... but can't engage in such himself! (yeah...I love to dance) actually caused me strife when I thought...\"...just WOW what if I couldn't dance OR hear music!\" Then next \"what a BLESSING it is I CAN!\" Have I counted my own blessings recently enough? Have any of us?\n\nSo start counting your blessings & know that life CAN, in all likelihood, be FAR worse. If that's not a good message buried in a great real-life plot--of humanity, friendship, HUMOR, exhilaration of being ALIVE-- well then, apparently I've missed something. But no, really YOU do if this all escaped you. Deeper than it appears.\n\nYes, you should see this. Don't waste your time on the American remake (the upside..I'm American, I saw it. I love Cranston but can't begin to compare! Know that missed the mark. How happy I was to read these two amazing men are still friends today, so yeah, something we NEED for the times in which we live, affirmation of something that is good. And maybe all coming from place of serious heartache & damage. Yeah, there's nothing manipulative here, I basically can't stand that sort of film...do not cheapen this one bit to compare it to lesser (someone on RT mentioned \"bucket list\" & I almost puked. Same goes for this critic's writing). Then lastly, here is from an American that says IF you are going to object on basis of race, you must be one sad, lonely person looking for trouble that is NOT there. This is about 2 men, to me wouldn't matter if they were purple, race has NOTHING To do with it, we are all just people. So the \"real life gent\" wasn't African American? So what? WHO cares? it's a movie, NOT a documentary. I can't imagine anyone in the role of the caretaker than this actor, he imbues the part with his entire being. They both do. Overall, I see no flaw in this production whatsoever. I see why the French embraced it so fully & wonder why America felt remaking it rather than seeing is as I did tonight, the REAL deal, made any sense. I'm sure that part was financial, they wanted to cash in. Just brilliant. Can't see how this didn't make nomination for every award going (and win it) but assume critics are often a breed most of us fail to understand, much less a snobby academy-award committee who often prefer odd esoteric material that in truth, they likely fail to understand themselves (or it's just plain political). BRAVO to all involved, from script, direction, acting & final piece of work! I know I will give this a second viewing, maybe more as needed. I believe it's an honest & straightforward powerful elixir, in addition to all else it quite successfully aims to do."

Its not a very exciting movie either. I would have liked some more depth, a deeper story, and to see more of Driss challenges. We never Saw which problems he had with his new job, comming with no experience etc. It was just so painfully unrealistic which is annoying, when its suppost to be a deep meaningful movie.

Of course, a disabled person who needs at least someone asks Driss to start tomorrow. He feels like no one else that this can be the beginning of a wonderful friendship.\n\nAs I know, this is a real story about the friendship of completely different people. If we leave the social problems of Afro-French and the heartbreaking drama about a disabled person, then there will remain a tragicomedy with a pure and captivating in its simplicity main idea.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Intouchables (2011) : Brief Review -\n\nThis French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work. The Intouchables is based on a true story of an quadriplegic rich man who finds a true friend in one of his hired reckless caretaker. The film is a big story but definitely it is time consuming as the narrative is strictly modified within 112 minutes. There is fun, there is love, there is life, there are problems and then there is a friendship bond and humanity values. I won't deny the fact that the story isn't overwhelming at all, of course it is predictable and too simple. But sometimes simple things works. The problem i have with the film is the hype creted by audience about it. When i am watching a film with IMDb Rating of 8.5/10 and also the Rank 44 film in IMDb Top Rated Films WW i expect something sensational or outstanding and this predictable tale is surely underwhelming by far. Critics didn't admire this film as much as audience and i would like to go with critics for this film (I always don't agree with Critics) at least. The Intouchables lacks the attractive elements but it is Highly entertaining flick by all means. It has laughters on consistent basis. Some of them are vulgar, some are organic and some are outdated but that all keeps it engaging. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put up fine performances and lovable chemistry. The background score works pleasantly while Cinematography is okay. Olivier Nakace and Eric Toodano has made a very good film but looking at all the acclaim it recieved globally it is certainly below my expectations. Maybe attending the biographical story didn't let them use cinematic Liberty upto the course but i have seen so many Biographicals being one of the greatest films of all time, haven't you? There is definitely something less in the film but if you can neglect that then there's lot to enjoy in The Untouchables for sure.\n\nRATING - 7/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest"

Turns out that this list tells much more about the viewers than the films.\n\nIntouchables is a case in point. First off, despite being a rom-com (more specifically, a bromance buddy flick), it ranks, nearly a decade after its launch, #44. Must be a masterpiece, something so unique and original that it has never been done in romcom before, right? Wrong.\n\nI regret to report that all of the comedy of this brom-com revolves around the defeat or support of deeply entrenched stereotypes of black people. If you invite them to the opera or a classical music concert, they will disrupt it. The quality of women of most importance to Africans in Paris is white booty. They eat Nutella with spoons out of a jar. They have never seen a full-sized bathtub. They live in HLM (Habitations \u00e0 Loyer Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, aka housing projects) with literally neighborhoods of siblings, all being cared for by a stressed-out single mother, as all of the fathers have disappeared. Black males resolve problems through resort to violence. But they love to dance (to Earth, Wind & Fire!) and are always up for a good ho-op. Please just put them behind the wheel of a Maserati Quattroporte, pass the doobie, and let the fun begin!\n\nBut, hey, it's all good: because one of these guys proves to the rich white world that a person corresponding to the above stereotype can also be a Mensch!\n\nMy guess is that most of the 10 ratings of this flick were given by people who have as friends no persons of color. These inflated ratings reflect the viewers' own pleasant surprise at how nice (and clean!) black people can be."

Even though the plot develops like a typical Hollywood-y romantic comedy (two people meet, they have a good time, then they break up and finally they are together again), in this case it's about a different kind of relationship, the friendship between two men, a quadriplegic, Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and his caretaker, Driss (Omar Sy). Driss' role goes way beyond helping Philippe overcome his physical limitations, he shows him how to have fun and enjoy himself. The movie's biggest asset is the performances and the great chemistry between the two leads. The comedic aspect is stronger than the dramatic, as the latter can get too simplistic, plus it can lose touch with reality due to its excessive optimism, not to mention it doesn't avoid various cliches."

It shows people as they are, often complicated and contradictory creatures who feel most alive when they are either with or doing things they love. It is a tale of friendship, love, and care that is too often lacking in an industry increasingly obsessed with grimdark lifeless cinema. My partner is disabled and this film has helped me see that nobody should be treated like an invalid but as the whole person they are.\n\nIt is not perfect, but it is very good and continues to be good every time you watch it. This film deserves the love it has received for being a light in the darkness."

        "review_detailed_main": "For starters, this movie is a true story. The film is about two men who come from different social classes. One being Driss who is from the suburbs around the city, and Philippe who lives in the center of Paris. The narrative of this film begins with the last scene of the film at the beginning of the film. The movie essentially unfolds as a recollection leading up to this particular moment. Throughout the story, we learn that Driss serves as a caretaker for Philippe. As the plot progresses, their bond gradually transforms from a professional association into a deep friendship. From the first time watching this movie in 7th grade it has remained in my list of my all time favorite movies. Its significance is not solely due to French being my primary language, but rather stems from the profound morals and lessons that I have taken away from this movie. Throughout this movie life's challenges, compassion, and the inherent beauty that surrounds us, that we take for granted.\n\nI truly recommend this movie to everyone, but especially, to people who are learning the French language. I have gone to a French school for the majority of my life, so the way I was taught French is very different from those who have been taught in an American school teaching system. Something this movie has to offer for the people learning the language is the non textbook French. This movie accurately represents the French language of this generation. In other words it will greatly help with improving french speaking. Now for everyone else who is just watching to watch. This movie accurately represents French people and not by the negative stereotypes everyone constantly associates the French with (rude, mean etc..). The dark humor and the expressions in the dialogue is exquisite and hilarious. Watching this movie while being so far away from my french environment, makes me feel comfortable and at home.\n\nAlthough based on a true story, the actors portraying Philippe and Driss showcased remarkable talent in encapsulating the emotions and real-life experiences inherent in the making of a profoundly wholesome and authentic bond between two individuals. I find it fascinating how society categorizes both of them, and has deemed them as lower class. In the sense that Driss is just a lowlife, criminal that is untrustworthy, and Phillipe being deemed as incapacitated. Despite these biased perceptions of their background, they are people who are incapable of doing anything for themselves. Both of them together prove society wrong.\n\nTheir unique friendship showcases to the public how two people from diverse backgrounds enriches a friendship, gives us experience and learns different things about each other, whether it was through them sharing their different music taste, or trying different activities for each other, and going out of their comfort zones. Through the respect they have fortified for each other. Driss treated Philippe like any other human, and not treating him differently because of his condition. While Philippe refrains from associating Driss with his past mistakes, acknowledging that everyone has the potential to grow and change, from the person they used to be in the past. Lastly, being there for each other emotionally, whether it was Philippe understanding and encouraging Driss to go back home and take care of his family that needed him. Or Driss being there for Philippe when he had his panic attacks, and soothing him.\n\nIn essence, their relationship stands as a testament to the transformative power of friendship, breaking societal barriers and teaching us invaluable lessons about acceptance, empathy, and the capacity for personal growth. It also becomes a profound platform for mutual growth and learning. You most definitely will not regret spending one hour and fifty two minutes of your life watching this movie."

On the contrary, you watch a sincere and sincere movie with a constantly smiling face. The temperature of the film warms you so much every passing minute that after a while you want the film to never end. It's a really special movie. But the lesbianism and tripartite compressed into the film damaged the spirit of such an emotional film."

This narrative, centered around the evolving friendship between a wealthy quadriplegic and his caregiver, is both deeply touching and refreshingly humorous.\n\nWhat sets The Intouchables apart is its approach to delicate themes like disability and social disparity. It addresses these issues with a blend of humor and honesty, steering clear of clich\u00e9s and patronizing tones. The movie is an honest portrayal of life's challenges and the power of human connection to overcome them.\n\nThe chemistry between the lead characters forms the core of the film. Their relationship, evolving from mere employer-employee to deep friendship, is portrayed with a sensitivity and realism that's both engaging and inspiring. The performances are remarkable, bringing authenticity and depth to their roles.\n\nBalancing emotional depth with light-hearted moments, The Intouchables avoids becoming overly sentimental. Instead, it offers a compelling narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining. It's a celebration of resilience, friendship, and the transformative power of empathy."

My wife wanted to watch it and I bought it for her as a gift and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst of all...I do not understand French...but I won't watch dubbed films. So we watched it in French with English subtitles. The humour does come across, although I'm sure I missed a bit of it. Referring specifically to some possibly French or Parisian in-jokes.\n\nThe flow of the movie was good, the translated script funny - even witty at times. The acting was better than what you generally expect from your standard Hollywood movie.\n\nWhat I did like about Driss's character is that he doesn't dance around the fact that his new boss is a paraplegic...at all. The bond that evolves between the Philippe & Driss is brought across genuinely...for the most part. I think a 90 minute movie will have a tough time to bring across the core of the relationship between these two characters, but they actors and the directors do a good job.\n\nOverall it's a movie to watch and feel good about yourself, whilst at the same time you are reminded to appreciate the things you have; served with a healthy dose of humour, a dash or two of romance and a smidgen of those earnest, emotional realities of life. A feel-good movie, one can actually feel good about having watched.\n\nCheers, OlivierZ"

Since then, I have watched this movie a few times and it has become one of my favorite films ever. Intouchables is a heartfelt story about friendship. The film is about the relationship and prejudice between two races. The film is loosely based on the true story of Abdel Sallou's friendship with a paralyzed millionaire, Phillipe Pozzo di Borgo. In the film, Phillipe hires a young man from the projects named Driss to take care of him and they both develop an unlikely friendship.\n\nThe story is very interesting and shows that two people from different races can confront their obstacles in life. The main leads, Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy, are fantastic and share great chemistry together. It also has great moments of humor that brought a smile to my face.\n\nI love how the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops from two people arguing against each other to becoming true friends. Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances; in Untouchables, it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. The soundtrack of the film is also brilliant and adds to the emotional scenes in the film.\n\nGreat movie, it's a must-watch \ud83d\ude42"

I can honestly say that I had a genuine smile on my face for most of the run-time, thanks mainly to Omar Sy's endearing and energetic performance. It also helps that the picture is legitimately funny and has a realistic edge that prevents it from slipping too far into sentimentality. Even though, at its core, the story is bare-bones and familiar, there's enough fun to be had that the fairly basic concept can be overlooked and the pure joy of two friends laughing together, despite their many differences, can really shine through. 7/10"

Directed by Olivier Nakache and \u00c9ric Toledano, this 2011 French masterpiece tells the true story of an unexpected bond between two men from vastly different worlds-Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic (played by Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet), and Driss, a young man from the Parisian suburbs (played by Omar Sy).\n\nThe film brilliantly balances humor and emotion, with Omar Sy's charismatic performance bringing a vibrant energy to the screen. His character, Driss, is unfiltered, raw, and refreshingly honest, providing a stark contrast to Philippe's refined but isolated existence. Their relationship evolves from one of mere necessity to a deep, mutual respect and genuine friendship, challenging societal norms and preconceptions along the way.\n\nWhat makes \"Intouchables\" truly remarkable is its ability to tackle complex themes like disability, race, and class with both sensitivity and humor. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is undeniable, making their journey together not just believable but deeply moving. The film's uplifting message, coupled with a soulful soundtrack, leaves a lasting impact, reminding us that genuine connections can be found in the most unlikely places. \"Intouchables\" is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, delivering a powerful and inspiring story that resonates long after the credits roll."

Some moments are pleasant and mildly moving though not as hilarious as they could be. Still, it was difficult to be taken into this film mainly because of the characterization of Driss. Frequently, he's rude, overbearing, arrogant, and bullying. The film goes too far when Driss is disciplining others who seem spoiled when he himself seems to need the most discipline. Nonetheless, actor Omar Sy does a fine job in the role.\n\nThe viewer hardly knows about Philippe's character and why he would take so well to Driss although scenes of upper-class stuffiness around Philippe might give some hints. Knowing more about Philippe might have helped.\n\nApparently, this movie is a phenomenon in France . This must be one of those rare times I miss out on French culture which I often admire."

Moreover, he deprived him of something that people had never appreciated in their lives. In this situation, you can not do without outside help. And if you can find a person who can help, that's good. But if you manage to find a person who can not just help, but illuminate your life, then here you can say \"lucky, so lucky\".\n\nThe difficult fates of two different people. The desire to live. Fight. Light, without which it is impossible in the first case. And the situation that makes you rethink is in the second. Strong weave.

        "review_detailed_main": "My Friday Night Netflix Treat. Needed a dose of joy and got it with the 2011 French film The Intouchables. Thought it might be too formulaic but it wasn't. The lead actor was hilarious and appeared to improvise at will. Dozens of worldwide awards & a box office hit in France. Stay for the end titles for a peek at the people on which it's based. 5% of the film's profits went to the Simon of Cyrene Society to help handicapped adults. Worth watching IMHO."

        "review_detailed_main": "At the job interview for the caregiver of Philippe, he is annoyed by the applicants whose answers are all stereotypical. I understand why he chose Driss among them. For the disability he suffers, the hardest challenge, more than pain or inconvenience, would be boredom.\n\nEven though Philippe is a rich and important man, Driss doesn't care at all. Philippe seems to feel comfortable because Driss shows no pity that would embarrass him. In Philippe's slight smile, we see how he is amused by Driss's behavior. Driss is a brisk and responsive man. Philippe has fun with Driss's blunt remarks on things, like painting, opera, and classical music. They enjoy their witty exchange.\n\nBeing completely opposite at first glance, they in fact share some kind of recklessness. They feel they have nothing to lose because Philippe has lost her wife, and Driss is in low life. But their friendship gradually encourages each other to overcome that.\n\nThe tempo is well controlled. Emotional scenes are slow and comical scenes are quick. It is like a piece of pleasant music. The indoor and outdoor scenes make a good contrast. Philippe sometimes feels suffocated in his palace and wants Driss to take him outside for fresh air. The shot where the two men run on the wheelchair is very exhilarating.\n\nYou might expect the film to deal with social issues, like disability or race, but it does not really. The film is about friendship and how it helps you overcome difficulties in your life. And it is truly heartwarming."
