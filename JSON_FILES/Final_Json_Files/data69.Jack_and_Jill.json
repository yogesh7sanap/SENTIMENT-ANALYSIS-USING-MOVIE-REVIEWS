I regret the decision to let my seven year old pick the flick tonight-- I hope other parents don't make the same mistake I did. It should have been rated PG-13.\n\nOn another note, the movie sucked pretty bad.... there was harsh/rude humor that gave you that \"OMG\" feeling and less than a handful of chuckles.\n\nDisappointed."

I've still not figured that out, and I don't think I'll devote much more time to doing so.\n\nThis film led me to create my IMDb account because if what I've said here can keep even one person from paying to see it then I feel it will have been worth writing.\n\nCheers."

Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.\n\nI have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The \"jokes\" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.\n\nI don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.\n\nThis movie is not a flop, its not an \"oops\", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful \"Grown Ups\" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.\n\nSorry Adam, it's over."

Every scene, every line every moment of this 'movie' was unfunny, awkward, unrealistic (even for an unrealistic movie) and seriously unentertaining (not a word I know).

        "review_detailed_main": "The standard that Adam Sandler movies has set is pretty low, but even with such low expectations going to the movie, the movie still felt terrible. The gag is twins and ignoring that healthy identical twins with different genders is impossible, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman. And, we get to see Adam Sandler dress up as a woman a lot, ridiculously lot and so much so, that Jack Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are just supporting actors to the almighty squawking of Jill Adam Sandler.\n\nWe could say this is just Adam Sandler up to his usual antics but Jill Adam Sandler hogs up the screen time and nothing about her really makes any sort of logical sense. There is Al Pacino as himself who falls for Jill, a possibility that the writers explain away as madness or nervous breakdown of Al Pacino. Then, there is Jill who is loved by the kids and Jack's wife Erin (played by Katie Holmes) for reasons that Jill doesn't portray on screen and we are never shown, all we are shown is the mean and manipulative Jill. The Jill that Adam Sandler portrays is his own immature rendition of a woman, filled with toilet humor and displays of uncharacteristic skills and strength as positive attributes. Jill is portrayed uninteresting and vacuous though written differently, and that being the center of the movie makes the movie uninteresting and tiresome.\n\nThe movie would have been an acceptable Sandler movie if Jill had been played by a woman who could actually portray a big heart. The previous Sandler movies were enjoyable movies, but Jack and Jill is a real stinker, barely watchable. The only thing I found interesting was the background opulence of everyone around, thrown around so casually that it really feels like the big guys involved in the movie have severely lost touch with their audience and given way to sloth where they think anything they do is magical. Avoid the movie."

Her character was one dimensional and boring. She might as well have not been there at all.\n\nAl Pacino, why did you do this movie? He is an amazing actor with amazing credits to his name. But this? Really?\n\nThe jokes were pointless and not funny. I'm really tired of 'fart' jokes. Been there, done that. Not funny.\n\nThe only funny part of the film was Jack's son, he had a couple of funny lines. Basically the only time I laughed was when he was on screen doing something.\n\nIf I had paid for this movie, I would have walked out to get my money back.

It's worth watching just to see Pacino do a film so completely out of character. Some of the cameos are fun, and Sandler is (at times) believable as his sister who absolutely annoys the hell out of him. It's a short, harmless 80 minutes. Compared to some of Sandler's other, truly fantastic, work like The Wedding Singer, it doesn't come even close. Go into the movie not expecting much and just try to enjoy it for its own ridiculousness and the idea of Al Pacino in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial."

In summary, do not waste your money, time, and life, to sit and watch this garbage, I'd rather watch a raccoon get run over by a bunch of cars, than watch any Adam Sandler \"comedy\" of the 21st century.

        "review_detailed_main": "I like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them.\n\nAs much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad.\n\nSo why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances.\n\nWhen I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently.\n\nJack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen.\n\nThe acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say.\n\nI was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either.\n\nWorse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.\n\nStory-wise, Jack and Jill lacks any kind of structure, it all feels very broken and rushed. As for the characters, they are either annoying, shallow or both, I finished the film not only not caring for them but also forgetting them.\n\nAll in all, Sandler's worst movie and one of the worst(I think only Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star, a movie I saw out of curiosity with little else to do, was worse) of a very hit-and-miss year. 0/10 Bethany Cox"

What was cute in his first films is now fingernails-running-down-a-chalkboard bad. He obviously has a following that is very loyal and he is wildly successful with his production company. He churns out movie after movie with former Saturday Night Live alumni with his production company. He has played it very smart in that respect. But, with the exception of Kevin James, his movies continue to do less and less at the box office. But, because of his early success, he is a bankable actor and producer, so he gets the last laugh. That doesn't change the fact that this is a squirm-in-your-seat bad film. It is surprising that his films continue to get green lit without question.

The audience was essentially watching a long Sony and Dunkin Donuts ad.\n\nThis film reportedly had a budget of $79 million. You can just tell that Adam Sandler pocketed most of that amount.\n\nDisaster Movie (2008), Batman & Robin (1997), and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) are still better films than Jack and Jill. Now that's saying something.\n\nThose films at least had writers, producers, and directors who all tried to entertain. They tried to make different films without scamming the audience.\n\nThe product placement from Sony in Jack and Jill is disgusting. It's pretty distracting in every other scene, and Sandler knows this."

This movie is terrible, that's the truth, which is sad because Adam Sandler used to be funny, with some great films such as happy Gilmore and the wedding singer but this is just sad, an attempt from Adam Sandler to be funny once again but failing.\n\nThe movie is about Adam Sandler playing two twins, one being a boy and one being a girl, watch the trailer, you'll think that this is all some weird joke but believe me, there is NOTHING funny about it. The characters are unlikeable, the story is forgettable and overall it is just a waste of time! If you want to watch a good Adam Sandler film they do exist (The wedding singer, happy Gilmore or even 50 first dates) but lately, I avoid any new Adam Sandler film like the plague, so PLEASE do yourself a favor and listen to this warning, AVOID THIS MOVIE."

Oh yeah, he's an \"ad executive,\" which gives them convenient opportunities to show actual full length commercials. This includes a massive commercial for Dunkin Donuts that is even longer than a normal commercial you would see on TV. They even incorporate Dunkin Donuts into the main plot.\n\nSo, somehow this....movie....has a budget of $79,000,000. This is a huge budget, and many fantastic movies have been made on similar or lower budgets. Yet this movie looks like it was made on a budget of under $1,000,000. There are indie films made for WELL under a million that look much better. WHERE DID THE MONEY GO? Oh, that's right, it went to paying Adam Sandler.

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I get to the review, I want to talk a bit about twins. While the film is about fraternal twins (all boy/girl twins are fraternal), so many of the jokes are about identical twins and how they think and act and look alike. Fraternal twins are no more genetically similar than any brother and sister....so a lot of the act alike, think alike, feel alike jokes in the film are wrong and the only way this COULD work was if either Jack or Jill underwent sexual reassigment surgery and both were born the same gender. So, for this film, it SHOULD have been about twin boys...identical ones.\n\nAdam Sandler plays both Jack and his fraternal twin, Jill. Jill comes for a visit and is about as welcome and pleasant as Ebola. To say she is incredibly annoying is right on the mark! And, not surprisingly, Jack is annoyed by her and can't wait until this visit is complete. The audience feels pretty much the same about Jill! All the scatological jokes involving this character didn't help any!\n\nSo does this film work? Good grief, no! The film is currently #38 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...and the film has set a record for most Razzie awards. This is because Adam Sandler was able to do something unprecidented...he won for Worst Actor AND Worst Actress!! In addition, it took home Razzies for Worst Picture and took home a total of 9 of these trophies!\n\nI think the reason it got so many Razzies and is rated so low is due to two things. First, the annoyance factor...Jill is so annoying and easy to hate that it's really hard to watch the film. Second, in recent years, Sandler has been in career freefall due to some very bad choices and it's become fashionable to hate his films. But is it among the worst movies I've ever seen? Not even close. An Ed Wood, Al Adamson or Willaim Grefe film would be much worse. But in the case of these filmmakers, they spent almost nothing to make a crap film...and Columbia spent a staggering $79,000,000 to make this crap! That's enough money to make an entire list of bad films!! So, while I hardly think it's among the worst films I've seen, it is, dollar for dollar, the worst...and it's a film that is completely brainless and annoying from start to finish.\n\nBy the way, a couple things saddened me about this film. I find it hard to believe that Al Pacino would appear in such an awful mess and playing a man who is infatuated with Jill AND I was annoyed to hear one of my favorite songs in the movie. I now don't know if I can ever hear \"Don't Bring Me Down\" by ELO again without thinking of this godawful film. I could, however, easily believe that David Spade, Vince Offer and Shaquille O'Neal were in this film...they were right in their element."

With that being said, Jill is one of the most annoying characters in all of Sandler's movies (Including Little Nicky himself) which obviously brings the film as a whole down too. There are some good jokes throughout, but it's forgettable plot, unlikable leads, and romance storyline make it something, very unlikely of getting anything more than a small following.

No other film in the history of films, has been done so well as this one. Al Pacino's best performance on film, same with Adam Sandler. The acting will be studied for years to come. The cinematography is of course beautiful, like any another Sandler flick. The brother and sister relationship between Jack and Jill are as good as it gets. I can't find the actress who played Jill, sorry about that. Dialogue is hilarious, Its really clever and original. The dunkaccino scene almost made me die from laughter, WHO EVER CAME UP WITH THAT IS A GENIUS.

Also this film is supposed to fit into the genre of comedy, but the only problem is that it's not funny at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Please support good movies and not bad ones, everyone who has suffered through this dreadful movie give it one out of ten stars, because that's what it deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have never seen a film this bad. Manos: The Hands of Fate, The Star Wars Holiday Special, these are Oscar-nominated films by comparison. I struggle to pare down the list of adjectives for 'horrible' that I'll use here.\n\nI'd summarize the plot, but other reviewers have covered that fairly well. Let's get on to the strangeness *behind* this surprisingly horrible film.\n\nThe interesting thing is that it's horrible by design, in the sense that it isn't bad because the people making it were inexperienced or simply among the worst in the entire film industry. Adam Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison Productions' has produced a fair number of films that have done well, if generally with questionable taste in every aspect.\n\nThe first thing you'll find puzzling when seeing this film is 'This had a budget of 80 MILLION - where did it go?'. 'Independence Day' cost 5 million less than this and you have much, much, much higher production values. The film's actual cost of production looks to have been closer to about 5 million, if that. The rest went to line the pockets of... Well, I'm sure you can make an educated guess.\n\nThe commercial product placement alone is beyond the pale - there is a full-blown TV style commercial right in the middle for a cruise line. It looks like a TV commercial, it feels like a TV commercial, then you're back to movie-land. The cruise line was so kind to shoot footage for them!\n\nDunkin Donuts also bears much of the shame for this entire debacle. They have a commercial at the end that is just... Well, it's so bad you have to see it. It will leave you with absolutely no respect for Al Pacino, if you had any left after making it through the majority of the film. I don't know what sort of bills he has to pay, but they must be horrific if he's accepting work like this now.\n\nThis is one of those movies that will end up in film criticism text books citing how bad things became at this point in history. If it were only so bad that it became unintentionally funny, it would deserve a spot on the wall with Mano: Hands of Fate. But it's deliberately bad, just the bare minimum to pose as a film and get money into the hands of the producer and his friends. The sad thing is, they did nothing illegal. Not even Uwe Boll financially questionable. They just figured out how to game the system, I congratulate them on that. The sales execs at Pepto-Bismol, Coke, Royal Canadian Cruise Lines, Dunkin Donuts and Sony really need to learn when to draw the line on product placement. But this is really a case where no one could say no, to the detriment of all that is good in this world.\n\nSee this movie at some point, but do not spend any money to do so. See it only to know how bad movies can be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ladies and gentlemen, here it is, Adam Sandler's worst movieI like comedy when it is funny. I have to admit though, apart from Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore I have never liked Adam Sandler. I often find his acting style irritating, his characters unlikeable and apart from five or six exceptions his films poorly written with not much point to them.\n\nAs much as I didn't think much of Little Nicky, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Funny People and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry(generally Anger Management, The Longest Yard, Click and The Waterboy I had mixed feelings on) neither of them are as painful to watch as this one. The trailer was enough to make me wish the ground had swallowed me up, and the film managed to be every bit as bad.\n\nSo why did I see Jack and Jill in the first place if I didn't like Sandler? One reason really. Al Pacino. I consider this man a great actor, and this is not just The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Scent of a Woman and Carlito's Way as I consider his performance in Godfather Part II one of the all-time great male performances.\n\nWhen I saw the movie on Tinyurl, having an inkling it would be bad but Pacino would be at least decent, in my opinion this is as awful as I was hearing. This is not just Adam Sandler's worst film, but also one of the worst of the year and one of the worst I've seen recently.\n\nJack and Jill is a cheap-looking movie, with not much attention to slick editing or continuity and the lighting also manages to be dull. Of Sandler's movies, Jack and Jill is perhaps the worst-directed, because the director throughout seemed to be rushing through it. The soundtrack at best is forgettable, and doesn't seem dynamic with what's going on on screen.\n\nThe acting is awful. Adam Sandler is a big part of the film's problem. None of his characters are likable, instead they are very annoying and Sandler's performance is samey and irritating throughout. Not only that, Jill is introduced too quickly with a severe lack of build-ups, and Sandler as a woman in all honesty is not pretty, sorry I had to say.\n\nI was hoping that Al Pacino would elevate just a little bit, as he was the only redeeming quality of Gigli, another example of a bad film. Alas, he spends the entire movie looking bored, almost as if what am I doing here, and the performance reads very much of him playing himself. The cameos don't engage either, they are not funny, in fact pretty much nobody seems to have a sense of comic timing, and just come and go. Nicky Swardson fares best, surprising seeing as I don't regard him very highly either.\n\nWorse are the script, characters and story. In regards to the script and the humour, Jack and Jill fails utterly. The dialogue is atrocious, very immature and hackneyed, while the physical and visual humour just left a bad taste in the mouth. I get that it was meant to be funny and not to be exactly subtle, but the poop jokes for example got really embarrassing and left me more disgusted than amused.!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In the 90s, Adam Sandler was one of the pillars of comedy. His films were enjoyable, his stand-ups were hysterical, and his jokes were well-crafted and thought out. Somewhere in the mid-2000s, it began to fall apart as the quality started rapidly slipping. Jack and Jill is unfortunately one in a long line of disappointing Sandler projects.\n\nWorking in advertising, Jack Sandelstein (Adam Sandler) is winding down for the impending holiday season. Inviting his older sister to spend the holidays, the brother-obsessed Jill (Adam Sandler) quickly overstays her welcome. Yearning to rid himself of his sister's childlike horseplay, Jack begins scheming to detatch her from his life. Juggling an impossible task from his advertising company & his sister's antics, Jack attempts to maintain his sanity against the odds.\n\nJack and Jill tells a story with little cohesion. While it centers on the Sandlestein family, the focus is mostly on annoying high jinks. The script feels as if it were written from the pages of a MadLibs, jumping all over the place in a confusing and bombastic manner. Adding in a literal full-length commercial for Royal Caribbean Cruises, the film seems to act as a thinly veiled excuse for a paid vacation, an issue shared with many of Sandler's lackluster movies. Matching the writing, the rest of the film also runs on less than half effort.\n\nAlthough VERY few jokes are actually funny, the majority range from white noise to nails on a chalkboard. While Sandler dresses as Jill, every word that comes out of her mouth is layered in the most obnoxious voice imaginable. Wisely, Norm MacDonald, one of the funniest comedians of our day, shows up and runs out of the film while barely forming a single line of dialogue. At a point, it feels as if this was made in an attempt to see how much annoyance an audience will endure before turning it off.\n\nThough filled with hilarious people, Jack and Jill fails to use them in any entertaining way. Though the runtime is a blissful 90 minutes, even that feels too long to be subjected to the mind-numbing torment throughout this film. Jack and Jill is the film equivalent to bombing a stand-up routine and, somehow, just as difficult to endure."

Adam Sandler plays both of the twin siblings of the movies name, Sandler literally creates the offspring of the devil in the form of Jill, not only does he make this high and whiny voice for her but he also just makes her the worst character of the lot.\n\nSandler looks bored in this film and at times it feels like he made this one week when he couldn't be bothered to think of anything at all. Of all the things that happen in this the cameos stick out for me the most with such celebrities as Johnny Depp, John McEnroe and Sandler's old buddy David Spade popping up. Hey I have nothing against cameos in movies but when their in a movie of such low calibre, well you just have to think what the hell did they think this was going to be I mean it's worse than awful, they were just unneeded by Sandler.\n\nOK so let's get onto that story, twins meet up, Jill the twin feels bad, wants to fall in love, yada yada yada it's all a mess. You know I could forgive the plot though if this movie actually tried in the comedic department I mean it's just like come on with every joke, whether it's a fart joke or another fart joke, or something to do with faeces this never fails to amaze me in just how poorly a joke can be done. If I had to name my one favourite part it's when anything bad happens to the characters, I just hoped these people in the story would fade away and be replaced by nothing, yes I would rather watch 91 minutes of an empty room than 91 minutes of this garbage can of a movie.\n\nI want to add that Sandler has actually gone down in my expectations; I know I know some of his other films have been way below average but to sink to this level, well it feels like an entirely new low for him. The fact that Sandler wrote this just makes it even worse, the direction is one bad thing but the writing is just terrible, the movie lacks any cutting edge material and even then it lacks basic run of the mill stuff in fact it breaks the mill and drowns it completely.\n\nSo yes Jack and Jill, there isn't really too much to add on this, a really awful movie that should never really have been conceived as an idea let alone a movie. Oh I almost forgot that Al Pacino was in this movie, that's right, an Oscar winning actor was in this movie and literally in one second of his first appearance in this movie threw his entire acting integrity onto a cliff-edge, how he decided this was the right move in his career I will never know, and how Sandler coaxed anyone who appeared in this into it, well it baffles the mind."

All the hallmarks are here - the shameless product placement, the racist and cruel humour, the fake sentimentality, lazy script, flat jokes, Sandler's autopilot performance, unfunny cameos from his former SNL friends and of course, celebrity cameos from actors that should know better.\n\nThe film is so bad, you'll be questioning yourself on whether your watching a real movie or a parody of a bad one."

Everyone has an \"ugly duckling\" relative who does not fit in with the family, and everyone tries to be nice in an attempt to compensate for what appears to be \"Nature's mistake.\" Jack looks OK for a guy, but the same features and athletic body build make Jill a freak or \"loser\" in the eyes of most people. What makes the movie funny for me is the way Jack's movie-star handsome, celebrity friends find Jill fascinating and attractive because she is big and strong enough to participate with them in male-dominated sports and actually wind the games. Could it be men really do not like the sweet and feminine type like Jack's wife? Could it be they really like the opposite, such as Jill? It seems Jack's friends are so smitten with Jill that they cannot get enough of being around her. It is the men's unusual reaction that makes the movie funny in an ironic way.\n\nWithout giving away too much, I found the jet ski scene incredibly funny. Jill tries too hard in everything she does, and the jet ski overshooting the swimming pool is the most hilarious slapstick bit of humor I have seen in a long time. My husband considered the film too much of a chick flick, but I have recommended the film to my friends, and we hope to see it on DVD on our next \"girls' night out.\""

None of the jokes landed, Adam Sandler's acting made him look like an idiot who had no apparent idea of what people actually like, and having Al Pacino in this movie made me want to cry.\n\nI actually started to believe that Satan himself went to Adam Sandler as he slept and said that he should be in a movie that will give him an excuse to dress up as a woman like Mrs. Doubtfire, except it will be much worse. This movie annoyed me to the 110th degree and it will always be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. If this movie belongs anywhere at all, it belongs in a trash fire. Do yourself a favor, and stay as far away from this movie as possible.\n\nDo not under any circumstance let yourself succumb to this torture, it is an utter waste of time and you would have more fun slamming your head in a car door 10 times or burning yourself alive than watching this.

This is a really terrible piece of shame. I was always hesitant to watch Adam Sandler's movies until I saw Punch Drunk Love, when I reconciled with him and gave it a chance. After that nothing seem to be too bad, definitely nothing was too good, but it came to this \"movie\", because I was letting girlfriend decide what movie we would see. I didn't even see the poster, nothing, didn't read reviews (WRONG), just went in the theater. My hipothesis is that Maybe some tech-head approached Adam Sandler and went \"Hey, look this new program, how easy and good a scene with the same actor in two characters can be done\"... and in some way, after some drinks and a winding road, this \"movie\" came to light. Low, cheap, tasteless, gross and disgusting humor are all together here along with the worst acting I have seen in years. Then the bold commercial endorsement, it's just disgusting. I just paid $10 for watching a freaking 2 hour long Dunkin Donut commercial.\n\nI think the worst of all is the load of famous and respectable people making cameos here. They will regret this appearance for the rest of their life, and the worst of all, Al Pacino boldly lending himself for this... the horror... the horror.\n\nAnd Katie Holmes... she will get a divorce after hubbie watches this."

It won the most Razzie Awards a movie has ever received (including the one for both worst actor and worst actress for Adam Sandler), here it has 3,2 and it's currently #48 in the infamous Bottom 100. These reasons alone bought me to finally sit through this movie some months ago, and unfortunately, I had to agree with almost all the haters.\n\nJack Sadelstein (Sandler) is a publicist that one day has the chance of having his big break if he hires Al Pacino for appearing in a new commercial about a new brand of Cappuccino named Dunkacino (pun intended). Unfortunately, it's the Thanksgiving period and Jack's sister Jill (again Sandler) comes for staying at his home for a few days, and she is anything than subtle! What follows is exactly lots of pointless scenarios including Al Pacino that has an infatuation for Jill, Jack's bum friends that come to his dinner and so on and so forth.\n\nI wanted to give JACK AND JILL a chance, but as it progressed, I thought the level of intelligence in my brain was lowering. The humour was very flat, it never made me laugh not even once and I waited 90 minutes for that ONE joke that probably could have saved this movie, but it never came. The acting is awful: Adam Sandler has made some great comedies including even some of his straight to Netflix ones, but he has never been annoying here as both Jack and Jill! Al Pacino and Katie Holmes look like they are here just for the paycheck, while David Spade and Shaquille O'Neal in tiny pointless cameos? They were right in their element! Only the cinematography and soundtrack were good, but at times the editing felt very rushed.\n\nIn substance, a cult classic of bad movies that should be seen at least once just for saying that there has never been anything like it before. Clearly this movie deserves to be in the halloweed Bottom 100 of IMDB."

But this is no Van Damme flick. It is a terrible movie. Fart jokes galore and a joke on Atheism people.

Other than that, you see him singing and dancing to a Dunkin' Donut ad campaign, which he gives his utmost energetic performance. This movie as Pacino says in the end needs to be burnt.

        "review_detailed_main": "Can you always get the best results with the best ingredients? The answer is YES, YOU CAN. Provided you have an actor/superstar who listens to his director, an actress/global celebrity who just glows on screen throughout the movie and if the big budget is totally justified.\n\nAll the credit for this extravagant movie goes to Sandler. The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the American Hollywood movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his, the scale of movie-making grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that.\n\nSandler is magnificent in this movie. In fact, he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Sandler. Sandler does what he does best, looking GORGEOUS.He has some pretty slick dance moves too but these go unfeatured in this particular blockbuster.\n\nThe Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an American movie. The CGs are spectacular. Sandler shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mind-blowing and totally unique to this movie. Sandler handpicked the locations for backdrops and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining.\n\nThis movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in the US and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers, distributors and the exhibitors all around the world.\n\nSandler redefines the fart gag. Truly, a legend of a man."

However I had to give in as the kids picked this movie.\n\nI watched it between the house chores and cleaning up after the Sunday dinner and sat down with a beer halfway through the movie. The kids looked dull and I had not heard any laughters yet - just to confirm that they made a bad choice.\n\nAdam should get the #1 goofiest movie award and get out of Hollywood. Seriously all his movies are just nerdy and this time he is playing a double role of his \"twin sister\".\n\nIt's a shame that someone dragged in Al Pachino into this dumb and dull movie - such a great actor has really sunk low in his old days. Why on earth does he waste his time on such crap? Then we have loser #3; Katie Holmes. She is probably still trying to convince her husband that she still can act. Cute as she is, she does not need to waste her time in Hollywood with Tom's millions of dollars that he is throwing around. She should stay home and raise the kids. That Tom Cruise is still flushing out money to the Scientology sect is just a shame. One day he will wake up and find out that he wasted half his life and millions of dollars to support the cult leader David Miscavige who is living a luxury life on his accounts.\n\nKatie! Last thing we heard in the gossip magazines was that you are leaving Tom because of Scientology? GOOD! Make him chose! Your acting might give you better roles and chances with him out of the picture.\n\nThis is a seriously dumb and dull movie. The kids didn't even enjoy it and next time I will remind them about Adam and his goofy escapades.\n\nNo wonder we never saw it in the theaters and it will probably also be very short lived in the RedBox stands.

I'm sure there were supposed to be jokes in this movie but I failed to locate a single one - and so did the entire audience in the cinema, going by the utter silence filing the place (only disrupted by Jill squeaking on screen).\n\nPositively not funny and not worth watching. Punching yourself in the face repeatedly is more fun than watching this and I really hope his next movie (should this one not end his career - it certainly has the potential to) will be better written and at least contain a couple of genuine jokes and funny bits."

The film is boring, unfunny and stupid. Sandler co-wrote this and all that tells me is how he should never write again. If this is his idea of a good script for a comedy he clearly has lost the plot. It feels like it was written by a child. But even saying that would be an insult to children everywhere. This awful film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's budget was a reputed $75m. They might as well have taken that money and set fire to it. This is an insult to writers and filmmakers everywhere."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jack and Jill Sadelstien are twins with very different lifestyles. While Jack is a wealthy commercial advertising director who runs his own company and has beautiful family with a gorgeous wife (Katie Holmes) Jill is a small town girl who grew up and lived with her mother all her life. Jill has not had any luck in her love life and is in some sorts quite clingy and needy and has very peculiar behavior patterns. Jacks largest client Dunkin Donuts is on the verge of a branding revamp and demands that Jack secure Al Pacino for the upcoming advertising campaign or they will cease all business with Jacks Company. Academy award winner Al Pacino does not do commercials! Meanwhile Jill visits Jack for the holidays and as usual is welcomed by the whole family except her own brother who find her disturbingly annoying. The story quite boringly rolls through until Jill happens to meet Al Pacino at a Lakers game and he falls in love with Jill head over heels.\n\nAdam Sandler is a talented Hollywood celebrity who isn't afraid of taking risk with his movies. Maybe that is because it is said that irrespective of the success rate of the movie he is guaranteed a 20 million dollar paycheck for his appearance in a lead role. How true that is I do not know. Even for Sandler JACK & JILL is an all-time new low. Being married to Hollywood's main man Tom Cruise did not save Katie Holmes from this disaster. The script was horrible and what's worse Katie's acting is equally on par. Long gone are the days of her cute smile wins the hearts of viewers like in DAWSONS CREEK. I am still a huge fan and I adore her work, but this is one of the hardest movies I have sat through this summer. The after taste of how bad it is still lingers at its memory.\n\nThe only saving grace for JACK & JILL are the Nick Swardson appearances, he isn't all that great, but clearly if there is even one chuckle in the movie, it comes from him. It's surprising how Sandler didn't write one good line for him since the screen play is done by himself. The character of Jill can be assumed to have been the big comedy Dennis Dugan focused on. The joke ironically is on director Dugan himself. Sandler's portrayal of Jill is nothing but annoying, it isn't acting but more of shouting. In an attempt to differentiate the male from the female, Sandler stretches his voice a bit too much. Now I agree that there is a thin line between love and hate, JACK & JILL crosses that line! I simply loathe myself for wasting my time on even writing this down. Someone needs to warn you folks.\n\nThis being said, JACK & JILL won 10 awards overall for this production. Surprising? Not at all!!!!!! For those of you who are not familiar of the Golden Raspberry Awards, it is ceremony held to honor the worst movies of the year. JACK & JILL along with the cast set a record breaking high of securing 10 awards early this April.\n\nDon't say I didn't warn you.\n\nTITLE: JACK & JILL DIRECTED BY: DENNIS DUGAN STARRING: ADAM SANDLER, KATIE HOLMES, NICK SWARDSON, David SPADE, ROHAN CHAND, ELODIE TOUGNE and AL PACINO RATED: PG RATING: 02/10 91 MINUTES"

Adam Sandler seems to have finally broken any connection with reality and positive criticism from his peers, and keeps on making supposedly funny movies when, in fact, all the fun has gone out of him. This ego trip that generates breaking the basic rule of comedies with guys in drag, rule that states that the audience is in on the joke, some of the characters in the movie are not, thus it creates a funny setup, is not observed by Sandler who is utterly unconvincing as a female character, being obviously Adam Sandler, and when the audience realizes that both the characters in the movie as well as the audience itself are the dumb ones that don't realize this character is obviously a guy in drag, then you get this extremely unpleasant vibe. What i felt bad about is that a couple of great actors joined this project, based, probably, on Sandler's reputation of creating those kind-of-stupid but funny movies. This one is the first I actually chose to watch, that I couldn't bear watching for more than thirty minutes, and it was a difficult time span. So disappointed..."

Their is literally a whole scene where the two main characters both played by Adam Sandler are both talking in what they call twin language, which is just them speaking complete gibberish.

Just why would a human being make a film which no one who has even a bit of common scene would say is a good film\" I mean for f***s sake Al Pachino is in this film. AL PACHINO!!! One of my all time favourite actors is in this piece of s***. If Adam Sandler ever see's this review (which I very much doubt) I have one thing to say to him. \"DON'T PULL GREAT ACTORS DOWN WITH YOU\"\n\nOverall I can say this is the worst movie I have seen in my life and hope to never see it again.

        "review_detailed_main": "Jack and Jill is a hideous movie that aims for the lowest common denominator. This isn't comedy, it's desperation and laziness. Like many a comedian before him, Sandler has decided to take on duel roles as brother and sister. When will these people realise they are not Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness. It takes great skill to seamlessly integrate yourself as more than one character. Here all I saw was Sandler in drag. Jack and Jill is about Jack, a director of commercials trying to land Al Pacino in a Dunken Donuts commercial. His sister arrives for Thanksgiving and she is the most horrible human being you can imagine. This was my biggest problem with the movie. There is nothing to connect us with this foul waste of space. Like Mater in Cars 2, this character is infuriating, She has no people skills. SHe is offensive, ignorant, loud, and just revolting. Sandler must feel destroyed by his family in some way, because with this and Click, he shows himself as a decent hard working man, constantly shat on my his family. Holmes is the worst wife in the world, not to mention a bland character. She repeatedly enables Jill to continue acting the way she does. The film tries to squeeze out some emotion, but fails, because we hate this bitch. If she was bullied when she was young, then perhaps the film makers should have shown this. Pacino has a lot of fun as himself, but the only way I wasn't embarrassed was by imagining his pay cheque. On top of all this the jokes aren't funny and the editing is abysmal. One scene sets up a joke, as Jill must find her way home without a car, and then it skips the punchline and gives us one to a scene they never showed us. It's confusing. As is the moment when the movie tried to get laughs from showing the face of Felipe's grandmother. I didn't know why they kept showing her, but once I looked on IMDb, I saw the same actor played both Felipe and the grandmother. This joke doesn't work if you don't know that. The film avoids the lowest rating barely, by having some fun jokes. Such as Johnny Depp in a Justin Bieber T-Shirt, or Spade mocking Rob Schneider. Predictable, crude, heartless, and annoying. This is a film that must be hated."

I like Adam Sandler and his new and more serious roles, this is not one of them and maybe the lowest point of his films yet.\n\nIt could have been more and with many good actors it should have been, but it centerers too much on the wrong things and becomes a parody of itself at a very early state."

It's like watching Dexter and Dee Dee but as humans with the same exaggerations and comic antics. i guess it's only funny when it's cartoons.\n\nit's just plain bad. I gave it a chance, but halfway thru the movie i must admit the painful truth that i wasted my money on such a movie. it can even top my list of worst movies ever."

Maybe one of the reasons was because the relationship and personalities of Jack and Jill were so ridiculously similar to two of my siblings. Okay Jill was a bit more over the top! But I think Adam pulled it off well. And I started watching this movie, not expecting very much because of the reviews. I've seen some real stinkers from Sandler, like that \"Zohan\" one (weird and gross) and \"Anger Management\". This was way better than those. Not quite as much crude humor, so that was a welcome relief. Sure, there were several parts that were not very believable, but I don't think this movie set out to be realistic. Al Pacino is hilarious - the scenes where he's onstage especially are gold. If you just want to watch a movie that makes you laugh and need a break from all the serious dramas, then I recommend it."

The film had some laughs (mostly captured in the trailers), but the movie was stalled by too many somber stretches with Jill (sister played by Adam Sandler) and the forced scenes with Al Pacino.\n\nSandler's regular cast of sidekicks (his cross-eyed friend, the dumb guy, Rob Schneider, David Spade) filled the movie. They provided a few funny moments, but most of their scenes bombed or were pointless.\n\nThe oddest role was Al Pacino playing a desperate Al Pacino. His scenes seemed to drag on with no purpose. The scenes were difficult to endure, as he tried to romance Jill (female Sandler).\n\nThe movie had many, many celebrity cameos, which are fun to see and even better if they are funny or add to the movie. Johnny Depp & Shaq were two of the better cameos.\n\nOverall, the movie probably isn't worth a movie ticket. Jack & Jill is more of a Netflix rental down the road. Or, better yet, check out a funnier old school Sandler film like Happy Gilmore, or one of his better relationship films like 50 First Dates or Just Go With It."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm pretty sure it has been said and written many times before, and like other reviewers, I am a fan of Adam Sandler's. I enjoyed most of his other films, but this movie was a mistake. I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with \"Yes\" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career. The whole main plot-line barely made sense. I mean, why would an establish legend in Al Pacino (playing himself) be attracted to Jill (Sandler in drag). I also didn't like how earlier Jill was introduced. There was no build up to her character, and no suspense.\n\nIf you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free or online, or basically anywhere in which you won't be paying!. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes. It really was a waste a time and one of the worst films of 2011 (if not the worst)."

        "review_detailed_main": "0/5\n\nOh Adam Sandler, how you have degraded. From his glory days of Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and Big Daddy, this is truly the unfortunate trough in his career. Remember when your parents stopped or discouraged you from watching a screen because it apparently eroded your braincells? Well, here's something that validates that particular nag. Being comfortably amongst the worst if not the worst film I have seen, I'm going to do something I've never done and unhesitatingly award this film zero.\n\nAfter becoming the talk of the town following its sweeping of the Razzies, the first time a film has ever done so, it attracted my interest. Ultimately, to genuinely appreciate works of art in cinema, we need to be able to identify and understand the flip side. This represents a pin-up example, one of those ill-fated catastrophes where there is nothing to praise in any way and everything to vilify. There have unquestionably been worse premises for comedies but it was execution that let this down miserably. Execution in every possible facet of cinema. The story was lame, predictable and exceeded the limits of senselessness and brainlessness that an individual can tolerate. The dialogue is unintelligibly stupid and unfunny. I couldn't help but disconnect from it. And in all honesty, even if I was paying rapt attention, I doubt I would have found anything that could be remotely termed as comedy.\n\nAdam Sandler is by no stretch of the imagination a poor comedian but this is the nadir of his work. Jack is the bread and butter Sandler character that we just seem to see in every film of his nowadays. Jill, on the other hand, is easily his most calamitous creation yet. She resembles a transvestite and I think that statement conveys my thoughts of the character best. There is just no clear distinction between the two characters Sandler played simultaneously. Playing multiple roles begs the ability to seamlessly absorb yourself into each separate character and forge an identity for each. In a comic context, Mike Myers did this brilliantly in 'Austin Powers'. In this case, without offence intended, all I could see was a cross-dressing Adam Sandler employing a cringeworthy, transsexual sounding voice. Jill eventually does little to dispel these negative perceptions, she's just an annoying, unintelligent pest.\n\nI'm unsure as to how I sat through this cinematic disaster but I did so staring blankly at the screen. I can waffle on about the deficits of this forever but take it from me, nothing redeemed it, nothing helped it and every minute made it even worse. The only reason you'll ever need to see this is to understand the lowest quality of cinematic art."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8His twin sister is coming for the holidays\u0085and it ain't pretty.\u00a8\n\nAdam Sandler stars in yet another disastrous comedy this year, this time playing two characters: a male and female version of himself. This is just one of those movies Sandler could make with his eyes closed. It requires no dedication from him whatsoever and I don't blame him. Why try to change what you do when it is having results? It doesn't matter that the critics don't enjoy his films because the audience seems to keep on coming back for more. I find most of his films pretty much alike and haven't enjoyed one of them in a long time, but it doesn't matter because Sandler fans will continue to support his movies and fill theater seats. One thing is for sure, Sandler has a lot of fun at work. He probably has a blast making these easy movies which don't have anything memorable about them, but sometimes are enough for a few laughs. I think I enjoyed Just go With It a little more than this movie, but I really had a hard time deciding which film was worse. Director Dennis Dugan has worked many times with Sandler in the past beginning with Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and ending with Grown Ups and Just Go With It. They seem to be making the same films over and over again and repeating the same jokes, but Sandler has his fan base and he stays true to them. I enjoyed his earlier films, but have stopped doing so in recent years. The jokes have gotten old and there are many other better comedies coming out these days. I wouldn't be surprised if this film actually wins every Razzie Award it's been nominated for, including Worst Picture.\n\nJack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) is a successful commercial producer who has a happy life alongside his wife, Erin (Katie Holmes), and two children, Sofia (Elodie Tougne) and Gary (Rohan Chand). They are expecting Jack's twin sister, Jill (Adam Sandler), annual visit for Thanksgiving. Jack doesn't get along with Jill very much although she thinks the best of him and misses the old days when they spent all day together. The truth is Jill is very loud and obnoxious and Jack enjoys his normal and quiet family life. What should have been only a weekend visit ends up being a long one since Jill feels lonely after her mother has passed away. She ends up staying and things get out of hand at times. In the meantime, Jack needs to sign Al Pacino (played by himself) for a commercial and so decides to try to convince him to accept the offer. Pacino ends up falling in love with Jill, but she wants nothing to do with him. Jack tries to use her in order to convince him to do the commercial but things begin to get out of hand. The film doesn't really have much of a plot as we have to sit down and see a Sandler double feature but that is pretty much all I can say about the plot synopsis.\n\nI don't see how anyone could actually enjoy this film, but I'm guessing most Sandler fans will like this considering they get to see two Sandler characters. The highlight of the films might be the special cameo appearances as we get to see Shaq, David Spade, Norm MacDonald, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin, Dan Patrick, Drew Carey, John McEnroe, and Johnny Depp among many others. I don't know how Sandler gets all these people to show up in his movies but somehow he manages too. This may be Al Pacino's worst role to date, I guess he just wanted to try something new, but he looked absolutely ridiculous in this film. Katie Holmes was alright, she didn't have to do much, and her character wasn't funny so she just played a safe role. Eugenio Derbez was the best thing about the movie. His character, Felipe the gardener, was by far the funniest thing about Jack and Jill. There is not much more I can say about this, It is really a lazy comedy, but I can see how all these actors might have had such a fun time playing together and making easy money. I was tempted to stop watching this movie right after it started, but I decided to suck it up and stay to the end. My favorite scene was when Jill was working out in the cruise with the two beefed up men and making them look bad. I really laughed hard at that scene, probably because I was just too bored with the rest of this terrible movie.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

One Sandler still making outdated comedies is more than enough. To have two Sandlers in the same film is the stuff of nightmares. The catalyst in creating a colossal black hole that will end the universe as we know it. Sandler dressing as a woman to portray a twin sister should be disallowed. Illegal. A crime against humanity. It's not even a case of the comedy being outdated, because I am one million percent sure it still would not be funny. Twenty, thirty, heck make it fifty years. Toilet humour isn't funny (including but not limited to farting in the cinema, violently excreting after consuming Mexican food and explicitly scratching one's testicles). Annoying characters aren't funny. Sandler isn't funny. Two Sandlers aren't funny. Sandler dressed as a female purposefully showing off his masculine shaved legs isn't funny. You see my point. I'm not even going to describe the plot, it would be a waste of a sentence that could be better used to decimate this atrocity. Holmes was underus...wait...wasn't used at all. The screenplay contained absolutely zero laughs. I didn't even smile, not even a smirk. Just large glaring eyes as I stared at the screen bewildered by what I just experienced. Pacino...why? The only one with a worthwhile committed performance, because he was playing himself. No acting required. Although subjugating yourself to an advertisement for donuts where you sing \"Dunkaccino\" does make you wonder why such an acclaimed actor would do this. The last line of the film is \"Burn this! Don't let anybody see this!\". Ironically, I feel the same about this film. Thinking about watching this? Go outside, run to the local store, buy (or perhaps steal...) a copy of the film and give it to your best friend. Then watch them suffer as you laugh maniacally. That'll make for a more amusing time then watching this. Sandler can no longer come back from this. His professional career is officially deceased in my eyes. Goodbye."

Going off the Sandman for a minute I thought I would comment on the other acting atrocities in this film, Al Pacino a 7 time academy award nominee and a one time winner decided to be in this film I can only assume he did this because he wasn't quite good enough to get in Danny Dyer's latest film. Katie Holmes is reasonably fit, I mean she's no 9 or 10 but she's at least a 7 and a half so she can't have been sleeping with Sandler, maybe she was emotionally distraught after not getting in the latest Danny Dyer film as well. Maybe Tom Cruise her hubby was too busy saving the world again in the stupidly named mission impossible to advise her not to do it. It is stupidly named as he always makes it, perhaps they should rename it mission improbable or mission unlikely but we've got a chance.\n\nAdam \"facking\" Sandler aka the Sandman is the white Eddie Murphy,(This makes sense if your familiar with my reviews)he really makes me as angry as a fat man walking past a closed Greggs. As the old Nursery rhyme goes Jack and Jill went up the hill and made an awful movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, so I'm not Adam Sadler's biggest fan. His films are hit and miss in my opinion, but I'm always willing to give them a go (I did recently enjoy Funny People). However, this is one time when I should have researched a film before I watched it. If you look at the online reviews you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe other thing I should point out is that my 'review' is only based on the first half an hour. That was all I could stand. I'm sorry. I hope I'm not doing this film a massive disservice by not watching it in its entirety. Perhaps it really picked up and I missed some real comic gold. However, from the opening act, I really don't think so.\n\nAdam Sadler plays two roles - twins Jack and his 'identical' sister Jill. Jill comes to stay with his family and 'hilarity' results. Unfortunately, Jill is the most annoying character ever to grace cinema screens. I know what you're thinking - you're thinking that you've seen the Phantom Menace and that no one can top Jar Jar Binks. Wrong! Seriously, it's like Jar Jar has had a baby with Ruby Rhod from the Fifth Element and produced Jill. All she does is shriek on and on, in between generally being rude and stupid and insensitive towards anyone who is unlucky enough to get near her.\n\nNow, I have nothing against annoying characters in films. If a character is annoying then that's part of who they are. My problem with Jack and Jill is how other characters deal with them. If we meet someone annoying, we stay well clear. However, in this film everyone extends her too much courtesy to make it believable. Yes, I know she's family, but even so, you wouldn't let her anywhere near you if you know what she's like. Yet, everyone makes massive allowances for her, even berating her long-suffering twin brother Jack (who is pretty unlikeable in himself) for not being nicer to her.\n\nIn short, there is not a rating low enough to describe this rubbish. Do not watch it, it's truly that bad. The only thing vaguely interesting about it is how they persuaded Al Pacino to appear in it. Does he really need the money that badly?\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

It gives Sandler a chance to do three (not two) characters, which he aces, and the effects work is so in-obvious that no one notices - Brother Adam dragging sister Adam, dancing together etc. Another thing people miss is the back story, where Sister Adam nursed their mother while brother Adam went on to put together the nice house, business and family.\n\nIt's really hard to keep up with all the walk ons - Bruce Jenner, David Spade in drag, Santo Sequra. Also love the cockatoo in the chocolate fountain."

The acting is all either bad or bland, except maybe Pacino who is in my opinion the best part of the film, and Adam Sandler as Jill is one of the most annoying performances I have ever seen. The story is generic, uninteresting and extremely boring, there are a few scenes that did make me chuckle like when the old hispanic lady gets hit in the face but most of the comedy just isn't funny. This turned out to not be as awfull of an experience as I expected and it's not nearly as bad as other films I've seen like Wrong Turn 6 or The Avengers (the 1998 film not the one from the MCU) however it's still really, REALLY bad. 2.5/10"

If only he had found an actress to play the role of the twin sister then maybe this film could have delivered but you only see, even with the trickery: Sandler in drag, very odd. In fact with black face white face issues maybe someone playing a straight female as a man might be questionable - are there no cross dressing actors in Hollywood?

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by saying that Allen Covert as a \"Homless Guy\" is probably the best part of this film. Now this movie right from the get go, seemed to have potential and this later shines through in some great laughs along the way, though two big problems rear their ugly heads early on.\n\nThe first being that Adam Sandler is not really the most attractive man in the world and it seems like the makeup department failed to realizes this, because they put forward no effort to make him actually look like a woman. There is a point in the movie where you actually get to see how much work he goes through in his gender change, lets just say I'm not impressed. The other actors that play opposite genders in there movie tend to do it about a 100X more convincingly, when I see Madea I don't think \"Hey that's just Tyler Perry in drag\" I look at Madea and see a hilarious black woman, that if nobody had told me was a man I would have never figured out on my own. This is not the case with Jill, who you think of as a woman, but every time you see her breaks this illusion by simply being Adam Sandler in a wig.\n\nThe second big problem with this movie is Katie Holmes, whether you love her or you hate her it just seems glaringly obvious that she didn't belong in this movie. I've never looked at Katie Holmes as a comedy actress and that is probably because she has never made me laugh and after watching this movie that record has continued. I don't think she's a bad actress by any means, but there were probably about a thousand better options for the role. She doesn't play off of Sandler very well and they really just seem like 2 people pretending to be married, this is probably the weakest paring that Sandler has ever been a part of on the big screen. By the time this movie ends if have anything at all to say about Katie Holmes character, I highly doubt it anything good.\n\nAll-in-all my opinion is that this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place, the weak pointless storyline, the shallow and mildly upsetting characters, and the fact that the estimated budget for this ridicules film was almost $80 million, all add up to disaster in my book, a disaster that you should probably avoid."

Not only is this movie one of the most terrible films to ever be put on the big screen (and yes, i've seen Troll 2), it is a scam. The amount of products being advertised - literally advertised - is unbearable, and made me sad. It didn't take me long to know that movies like this are ways to advertise products \"subliminally\" so that companies can make money. Seriously Sandler, it takes 79 million dollars to take a crap?

        "review_detailed_main": "Here's a nursery rhyme: \"Jack and Jill went up the hill to make a crappy movie, Adam Sandler joined in, but broke his crown, and Al Pacino made a fool of himself.\" Not really good, right? So, \"Jack and Jill\" stars Adam Sandler as Jack, a rich advertising executive, and Jill, his annoying and obnoxious twin sister (the female version of himself). She decides to stay with Jack for the holidays, but no matter what, she refuses to leave. Now, the torture has commenced. This is not only the worst movie of the previous year, but this is also the worst movie in Adam Sandler's life-time career. This is a surprisingly boring, painfully annoying, and incredibly tasteless, unfunny piece of junk that really tries it's best, really hard. For example, there's a Thanksgiving scene when there is so much dialogue coming out of people's mouths, that it's just not funny. They're repeating dialogue after dialogue, it's completely not funny, and you want them to just shut up. I'm just glad that the homeless person sitting at the Thanksgiving dinner in that scene was embarrassed to be a part of the stupidness, and left at the second. There is so many stupid scenes that involves characters getting hit either in the face or in their private areas, racism involving an obnoxious Indian child, fart jokes, 'crap their pants' jokes, and over-the-top complaining from an annoying twin sister. Who thought this stuff would be funny? Also, Katie Holmes is in the movie as Jack's wife. She's really cute, but she doesn't do anything. Another fine actor that looks embarrassed to be a part of this piece of garbage is Al Pacino playing...well...Al Pacino, who falls in love with Jill, because he thinks she's special. I don't know why! Jack wants Jill to date Al Pacino, so Al can be in Jack's \"Dunkin Donuts\" commercial. Oh, that's hilarious....not! Even if I chuckled at Pacino making references of his only Oscar being destroyed, and reciting old movie lines from his previous films, that didn't help save the movie, though! From the embarrassing cameos of such great actors, a script that's totally useless, to a cast that has no idea why this movie is being made, \"Jack and Jill\" is complete schlock from start to finish. You take a look at Adam Sandler's career, and see the other funnier movies that he has made in the past, such as \"Billy Madison\", \"Happy Gilmore\", \"The Waterboy\", and \"The Wedding Singer\", you start to wonder why the hell is Adam Sandler making such crappy movies these days. From the opening scenes to the end credits, this is one of the worst movies of this or any other decade, generation, or light-year from now. \"Jack and Jill\", in my review, \"Boring, tasteless, embarrassing, unfunny, and a giant piece of crap\"."

That being said, it wasn't so bad I couldn't sit through it, mainly due to the fact that the actors are inexplicable invested in the material. The acting never gets so dreadful or cringe worthy that you need to turn it off, if you can tolerate Sandler's nasally whining that is. I can definitely understand why so many couldn't though, and if the voice happens to be like nails on a chalk board for you there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to make it worth sitting through.\n\nI happened to have the variable effect of watching it after nearly 4 years of awful reviews from critics and us regular folk alike, then hearing from a credible friend that it wasn't AS bad as advertised. So I went in with a weighted approach, expecting it to be horrendous but allowing for a little more leeway before deciding to turn it off. Lo and behold I survived.\n\nIMDb has it at 3.5 at the moment and that's pretty apt. I guess if there's anything to take from reading this is it's tolerably bad for those who can get through a series of annoying character traits and those awful low brow Happy Madison gags that have sadly become a trademark of theirs, exposing an unfortunate side of Sandler's sense of humor that is painfully unfunny."

I can only imagine that he's gotten to that point in his career where he has surrounded himself with \"Yes\" men and women, or someone would have told him it's not working. This isn't Tootsie, nor Mrs Doubtfire, its just Sandler playing an annoying and mostly unfunny and unbalanced character. Unlike other films where actor/comedians are able to pull of multiple characters in a scene, (ie. Eddie Murphy), this film is just Adam Sandler and an annoying Adam Sandler in drag. Part of the limited plot surrounds trying to convince Al Pacino to lower his standards to do a Dunkin Donut commercial. After appearing in this film, I think it would be a leg up for Pacino's career.\n\nI made the mistake of watching this on Vudu as a Pay-Per-View film...the best thing I can say is that I fell asleep halfway through it. If you plan to watch this film, I'd advise you to wait a couple weeks for Netflix to feature it for free. Then, at least, you won't feel obliged to watch more than the first 15 minutes."

Full of childish potty humour and adult laughter, did this film seriously deserve to win every category in the Razzies? No. Believe me. It ISN'T that bad. Okay let me say it again. It isn't that bad at all. It's only critics and the Razzie awards going over their heads over awfulness. It's just a typical Adam Sandler film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Adam Sandler should be ashamed of himself for producing this movie. It is an embarrassment to the Happy Gilmore legacy! When I initially saw the trailers for this movie in theaters, I questioned why it was made because it just didn't seem to be believable. Now granted, Al Pacino was great as always and he delivered his lines with the professionalism that he dedicates to every project. However, not even Pacino could save this poorly written, ill-conceived, sad piece of drivel that permanently left a black stain on the Sandler franchise which will never be erased or forgotten.\n\nJack and Jill was lacking in imagination, creativity, humor, spontaneity, and any form of enjoyment that could even remotely entertain the viewer. Accordingly, I'm not sure why one of his friends that he repeatedly casts in his projects didn't quietly pull Adam aside and politely tell him that this movie was shite!\n\nWith the exception of Sandler himself, it was clear from the promotional interviews that all of those that acted in this movie were aware that it lacked to ability to be a breakout box office success. That just goes to show that his friends are willing to appear in anything Sandler writes, as long as it results in a financial bonanza for them. But if they would have been true friends, they would have told him just exactly how outrageous, flat, and disjointed this movie was w/ the exception of Al Pacino.\n\nJack and Jill clearly shouldn't have been greenlit by the studio since most of us could tell from the outset that it was an outrage! It ranks up there with other epic classics that failed at the box-office miserably including: Howard the Duck; Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000; Waterworld; John Carter; and Death to Smoochy.\n\nAfter seeing the movie trailer I decided to wait until this movie aired on cable to watch it, and that's exactly what I did because I was unwilling to invest any extra finances on it via Redbox or Netflix, and I certainly wasn't going to pay the price of a movie ticket to view it.\n\nI hope that Sandler has taken time to reflect on this film failure in order to learn a valuable lesson about writing more enjoyable future films. Also, let's hope that the movie studios will stop green-lighting disappointing movie scripts like this one.\n\nAfter all, people criticize Tyler Perry for his Madea character which they call annoying in some cases, but at least Mr. Perry makes profit with his movies because they are entertaining. Lately Adam Sandler's movies have become a disappointing means to a paycheck! And I hope that getting paid is not what's motivating him to write lately, or it just emphasizes just how sad the entertainment industry has become as an industry!!!!!!!"

I loved this film. It was great, it had its share of good moments and its bad moments, and I'm going to tell you them NOW!\n\nPROS: First of all, in my opinion, it's an improvement from 'Just Go With It', it has funnier jokes (and there are plenty, but there are 1 or 2 that are a hit or a miss) Adam Sandler is funny AND likable as Jill, even if she is very annoying, but I think that was the whole point of her character, as Jack, he's just the same old wealthy Adam Sandler character we've seen dozens of times in his other films, but is still likable, even though when he's not supposed to be likable. Katie Holmes as Jack's wife Erin was sweet in the film and really likable, she's also smokin' hot and actually does a pretty good acting job for a film like this, she acts concerned, angry, upset and happy when she needs to and is also quite funny, too! The children were funny also, but they weren't featured too much in the film so I'll leave it at that. We get the small cameos from the Sandler regulars, David Spade, Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran, the director Dennis Dugan, Allen Cover, and John McEnroe and Nick Swardson, and they were ALL funny, but the best part of the film HAS to be Al Pacino, I don't know why he doesn't do more comedies, he was hilarious in this film. The way he plays himself is so good, it's as if he lost his brain and just wondered onto the set so Adam Sandler said; 'Okay! He's in the movie!' He was easily the funniest part about the movie and I think he should actually do more comedies. I can't really say much about the story, it's just a family reunion caught on tape with the Al Pacino thing on the side, but it does all fit in.\n\nCONS: Like my other reviews, there's only a few small problems with the movie, there's only a few jokes that I didn't like. And that's it.\n\nTo summarise, I don't see what's so bad about it, it's not as awful as everybody else is making it out to be, it's just a silly film to watch and laugh at, and that's what I did! It's not THAT bad, in fact, the film is quite sweet, it makes you feel good after watching it. When I mean sweet, I mean Adam Sandler has this brilliant ability to create these stupid movies that don't look very appealing, but once you open up your mind and actually watch it, you end up liking it and actually liking the characters and some of the sweet moments incorporated into the film. It's a sweet,feel good comedy film where you can have fun, and that's what film-goers need to start doing, just have FUN and stop nit- picking!\n\n'JACK AND JILL'\n\nDirected by: Dennis Dugan\n\nStarring: Adam Sandler, Katie Holmes and Al Pacino"

This movie is childish and not in a good way, farting humor, sweating humor, screeching humor, oh my God this movie is awful. Adam Sandler what have you done? Why did you think any of it was even remotely funny? What were you on? Prescription painkillers? Because that is what you 'the viewer' is gonna need for the headache this movie will give you. It is beyond crap - it is worse than crap. It is so pointless and so unfunny it will give you nightmares! LOL Maybe not nightmares .... but maybe Adam SandlerMares... I do not know what was going through his mind when he decided to make this movie. Does he really think he is so funny - that unfunny things when said by him - in a squeaky voice - pretending to be a woman - is going to be funny anyway? What a disaster... How embarrassing would this be to walk down the red carpet and watch the premier of this movie with OTHER PEOPLE in the cinema. How could he hide his redcarpet face? Oh my God I do not believe this movie even got made. A spectacular waste of millions, better spent on buying up stale bread to feed ducks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen. There are some films that can get by because it falls into a certain category such as a bad horror movie can be good because its bad. Adam Sandler has fallen into this category as of late the phrase \"Its bad but its Sandler.\" is used more than often to describe his movies but I promise you this is just as bad as everyone has said. Sandler plays duel roles as Jack and Jill twin siblings which is a excuse for Sandler to dress in drag and do his high pitch Jewish voice, that's the joke and it goes on for about 90 dull minuets.\n\nJack is a rich guy working in advertising and his new goal is to land Al Pacino in a coffee commercial (who turns in the only funny moments in the film) His twin sister Jill comes to visit for the holidays and she is the most annoying person in the world. She is disgusting and knows nothing about the modern world, she proceeds to pick a fight with about every character in the film and then begins to cry after she does it, this goes on for the whole movie. I honestly don't understand this plot. Jack is played like a job obsessed jerk but he does everything to make his family happy. He takes Jill around so she can complete her to do list, setting her up on dates and letting her extend her stay longer and longer because you guessed it Al Pacino has fallen in love with Jill but she wants nothing to do with him but its the only way Jack can land him for his commercial.\n\nThere is no redeeming quality to this film and the only amusing parts come not from Sandler but the multiple celebrity cameos like Johnny Depp and Shaq. The first thirty minuets of the film contains so many jump cuts to different scenes that I thought something was wrong with the movie, conversations seem to end in the middle and we just move on to the next.\n\nI watched this movie with my 14 year old twin nieces and there 8 year old sister, no one laughed. After awhile the older ones stuck there heads in there Ipads and zoned out for the rest of the film leaving me to watch the rest.\n\nThere is a reason this won so many Razzies and it deserved everyone of them. If you think about watching this film just bunch yourself in the face until you have a headache and you will have the same enjoyment and can avoid wasting your time."

I have seen well over 500 movies and this is one I want to erase from my memory completely. Unfunny, torturous and horrid, this makes Cabin Fever look like the Godfather and Bucky Larson look like Citizen Kane. I am an avid fan of B movies but this one doesn't even deserve to be treated as a \"so bad it's good\" kind of movie. Maybe it's because I grew up and found overuse of fart jokes and gag humor to be unfunny. It tries too hard to be funny and fails miserably. It's like Sandler took a dump on the script and said \"write.\" Al Pachino's mildly homosexual performance didn't even make me smile. I've seen better movies on YouTube. If you are a fan of Sandler, this is a major pass. Disappointing and truly stupid, this movie puts stupid comedies to shame. Adam Sandler tries way too hard to be funny and truly fails. Do NOT believe all the good reviews as they were written by amateurs. It's an hour and a half of pure crap. I would rather watch a piece of paper burn than watch this movie again. And, for all you that were forcibly made to watch this or watched it, I am sorry. I rate it with zero stars as it deserves the lowest rating. I wish I could give it negative stars, but that would be impossible. Adam Sandler's worst career decision ever. As the soup Nazi would say, \"no star for you!\""

Anyone who rates this less than a 5/10 needs to get a sense of humor or be banned from leaving any more reviews on IMDb. This film doesn't take itself seriously, but you can tell that a lot of hard work and thought has been put into it. At one point Al Pacino was really struggling to keep a straight face which made the scene twice as funny. I loved that part.\n\nI've seen many films that really deserve a 3/10 rating (unfortunately), but this ain't one of them, and that's why I decided to write this review. Heh heh heh!

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently wrote a review of God's Not Dead 1 and 2, admitting that I used to like them, but I realized over time how awful they are. Jack and Jill is another one of those movies.\n\nNow, let me make this clear- I never LOVED this movie. But I did find it alright. I regret this wholeheartedly now, and let me tell you why, after I give you the plot summary:\n\nIn the movie, Adam Sandler plays Jack, a commercial director who's twin sister is coming home for Thanksgiving-but refuses to leave. The twin is also played by Sandler.\n\nThere are so many problems with Jack and Jill that it's kind of hard to know where to start, but here we go:\n\n1. Adam Sandler playing a man and his sister? I don't mind cross dressing in movies-Eddie Murphy does this in The Nutty Professor movies and Norbit(Not a perfect movie by the way but still WAY better than this), and movies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, and Some Like It Hot do this quite well, but Sandler just wasn't made for it.\n\n2. His voice for Jill is quite annoying, worse than his voice for The Waterboy. I dare you look up a clip of this movie and tolerate Jill's voice. Now consider hearing it for a majority of a 90-ish minute movie!\n\n3. There is SO much bathroom humor in this movie! There's literally a scene where Jill gets diarrhea on a date and at home she tells Jack about her horrible night in-between numerous farts and defecation sessions! In another scene, Baby Jill out-gasses Baby Jack in the bathtub!\n\n4. It's a pointless movie. What are we supposed to gain from it? Laughs? A Thanksgiving movie? If you want either of those, see Planes, Trains, and Automobiles or Dutch, both great works from John Hughes. But please don't see this!\n\n5. It's not that funny. There's a gag where Jill doesn't recall the name of It's A Wonderful Life, and it's predictable and not comedic. Fart jokes replace good jokes, and so much more. There's one decent joke where Jack dresses as Jill and his fake boobs are adjusted by a stranger but that scene doesn't amount to much in the end.\n\n6. And if all of this isn't bad enough- AL PACINO, the same one that starred in The Godfather and Scarface, plays himself and becomes a LOVE INTEREST for Jill! That makes me speechless!\n\nThat's probably not every problem that this movie even has! How this was ever greenlit is beyond me.\n\nI actually like Adam Sanlder. I enjoy Anger Management, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Grown Ups, and a few others. This, however, should be collected and burned.\n\nIf you are blessed to have never seen Jack and Jill, remain that way. At most, see it to mock with your friends. Otherwise, there's no need to see it at all! It would be preferable to fall down a hill with a bucket of water than see this headache of a \"movie\" ever again.\n\nReverse Recommendations: If you want any good movie connected to this garbage, see any other great, good, or alright movie that I mentioned in the review, here they are again:\n\nThe Nutty Professor, Norbit, Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, Some Like It Hot, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Dutch, It's A Wonderful Life, The Godfather, Scarface, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management, or Grown Ups.\n\nThese 14 movies are all better, if not perfect, uses of your time!"

The film try's to be something more than it is creating awkward and very stupid situations throughout the film. Al Pacino stars as himself and some of the parts he is in made me smile, and that was about it. But the movie is just unfunny, providing lame jokes, slapstick comedy which only really works if used properly. If i was you, i will completely avoid this one. I walked out of the cinema and vomited in the trash outside and it still was not as disgustingly painful as having to watch this absolute garbage.\n\nIf Adam Sandler doesn't come up with something, i will just give up on him forever."

Most bits are funny.\n\nWhat takes this to the next level is the performance of Al Pacino. The ongoing gag works and although a little redundant, it is over the top enough to make the movie worthwhile.\n\nWhile it is certainly not in the same league as Animal House, Superbad, or Monty Python, it does not deserve the universal bashing it has received."

I mean, what's next here, a feature length close-up of Sandler cracking 'jokes' to a hand puppet? Or maybe I shouldn't give him any ideas.

It's a light comedy you can watch to pass your time on a boring Sunday.\n\nThe dialog is not very well written and most of the scenes are not smart but you still can enjoy it.\n\nThe acting is fine. Not award-fine but fine. Sandler acted better than he had acted in other movies with better ratings. And if you prefer more \"classical\" actors, you have Al Pacino.\n\nWell, most people will go and watch the movie for Pacino's shake and only. This is the only movie to have him play himself. It's a rare thing to watch an actor like him doing that. It's also rare to see him in a comedy.\n\nAnyway, I think you shouldn't bash the movie before watching it."

Does it deserve IMDb 2.8 rating? No, it is not that bad, unfortunately it became the object of hatred for critics and public for no reason\n\n2. Is it better than average sandler fares? Not as good as any sandler film till 2008, better than 'just go with it' (which i thought was the lamest sandler movie till date), as good as 'grown ups' may be\n\n3. what doesn't work about this movie? the writing, the dialogues should have been more funnier, although its not totally lame, there are some funny lines in between and some physical comedy which saves the movie from a total fiasco.\n\n4. How are the performances? Sandler is usual, shouting and screaming which will please his fans as usual, he looks pretty funny as jill and pulls out good physical comedy, Al pacino is a great actor make no mistake, but i felt that he was a miscast, he is too serious an actor to mock himself and because of that in his screen time the movie loses momentum over the humour, i felt that an actor of sandler brand like rob schnieder would have done justice to that role, Katie holmes is there for 15 minutes which is as good as a special appearance.\n\n5. Is it going to be detrimental to sandler's career? No\n\noverall i did not find this movie bad, it was entertaining in parts and sandler fans can watch it, The strength of the movie was its premise which i felt was one of the best ideas, i mean sandler playing his own twin sister made me laugh from the first go, but the ordinary writing stopped it from becoming a happy gilmore or a billy madison...\n\n6/10..."

And yes, Al Pacino himself didn't embarrass himself too much here. And I got a kick out of what happened between Sandler and Pacino during the near-ending scenes. I mean, I knew the latter wasn't going to get another Oscar nomination here but, really, he seems to be having fun and that was infectious.

        "review_detailed_main": "'JACK AND JILL': A Half a Star (Out of Five)\n\nAdam Sandler for the majority of his career (in which he's been the most bankable star in Hollywood, for the majority of it) has consistently made crappy movies (with the exception of a few good ones like 'FUNNY PEOPLE', 'PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE' or 'HAPPY GILMORE' here and there) and they seem to be only getting worse. He certainly has never reached as low as he has with this film and I hope he can't go any lower. The funniest thing about it though is his films all (including this one) are huge box-office hits (except for the good ones, like the ones I mentioned). They all make over a $100 million a piece and huge profits. He's only making the films that people want to see, is what's the most ridiculous thing about it. Which proves that people love crappy movies. They may say they don't (and make fun of movies like this) but they keep getting made because people love handing over their money to see them.\n\nIn this one Adam Sandler plays identical twins Jack Sadelstein and Jill Sadelstein and the one joke premise revolves around the idea that Jack can't stand his annoying and grotesque sister when she comes to visit him and his family for the holidays each year. This time it turns in to an extended visit and Jack goes crazy trying to get rid of his sister. The craziest thing about the story is that Al Pacino plays himself as a crazed stalker who falls madly in love with Jill but Jill, despite always repelling men, isn't into the millionaire superstar. This drives Jack even crazier as he's been trying to secure a business deal with Mr. Pacino.\n\nThe movie is insane! It's one of the most painful experiences I've ever had watching a movie. The premise of the movie, in one effect, works because we as viewers experience fully how crazy Jack is going by having to put up with Jill but it's never funny. It's just disgusting and annoying. Sandler used to be funny and this is what he's seriously trying to pass as comedy these days. Honestly I don't seriously think he believes it's funny though. He knows it's crap but he knows that's what people want. He is a genius comedian but even more so he's a genius businessman and that's why he's the biggest star in Hollywood. He knows how to make a money making hit every single time. He produced the movie, wrote it (if you can call it that) with his buddies Steve Koran and Ben Zook, cast a bunch of his friends in it and hired his director friend Dennis Dugan (who directs most of his films) to direct. He made the movie for $79 million by allowing himself and his friends to pocket most of the money and put almost no effort into making a quality film because he knew it wouldn't matter. The studio still made a huge profit and everyone involved is happy. It seems the biggest joke is on all the viewers who paid to go and see it; Sandler is messing with everyone and getting richer and richer in the process. That's a genius comedian!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQaCI5Qk34"

It doesn't really distinguish itself from so many others of his movies.\n\nThat being said, then the movie isn't necessarily bad, it is just an indistinguishable movie - a plain and stereotypical comedy that he has been making for quite some time now.\n\nThe story in \"Jack and Jill\" is about an odd pair of twins, where Jill loves Jack and will do just about anything to spend time together, while Jack is ashamed of Jill and tries hard to avoid her at all costs. Having to spend time together over the holidays, it becomes a period of hardship for Jack.\n\nStory-wise, then \"Jack and Jill\" was alright, it didn't really bring anything new to the comedy genre, and it was all stuff that basically had been seen before in other movies. However, it did work out well enough and the story was entertaining from start to end.\n\nAs for laughs, well then there were a good amount of moments throughout the movie that causes laughter and smiles. I was thoroughly amused by many of the scenes in the movie.\n\nThe movie does have some good names to the cast list, but that doesn't necessarily elevate the movie out of mediocrity.\n\nFor a comedy, then \"Jack and Jill\" doesn't deliver all that it could have done, and that is a shame, because these types of comedies tend to be nice."

Well here I am saying the same thing. This film was so bad I joined IMDb so I could tell everybody. My main dislike regarding this films 'sheer awfulness', was the constant references to Judaism. Adam Sadler likes to remind us (every 3rd movie he releases)he is both Jewish and pro Israeli,Don't Mess With Zohan etc. Which is his business. But if the references in Jack And Jill were Christan or Muslim, the film would have rightly been sold as a Christian or Muslim 'comedy',instead Jack And Jill is trotted out as an Adam Sadler comedy. So disingenuous. Thank god I,unlike some unfortunate reviewers, downloaded it for free and watched it at home. Thank god for Bitcomet!"

But I had to think about those films that I had watched because 'others' wanted to see them and I was forced to watch to maintain healthy relations with the rest of my family. Strangely my wife seemed to go through a period of believing in the talent of Adam Sandler - strangely, because I have watched several of his efforts and have yet to recall even getting a smile out of this dolt, but then she has a habit of not understanding the concept of humour and, despite watching both apparent 'funnymen' Sandler and Will Ferrell attempts, does seem to come away very disappointed.\n\nThe funniest thing about this film was that it got made at all. Does nobody actually read Sandler's scripts or have the guts to ask him if he knows 'funny', or needs it explained to him? Seriously, had I watched this at a cinema I would have led a crowd back to the box office with flaming torches to demand our money back; luckily it was on TV, but it still rankles. All involved deserve to never work again. 0 out of anything - although I appear to have rated it one star?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I already knew after seeing the trailer for Jack and Jill (Dir. Dennis Dugan, 2012) that this film would not be a successful comedy, or even remotely funny. If you were one of these people, that presumed the same as me, then you were correct.\n\nEarly on in the film Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) says that Al Pacino would never stoop as low as to star in a doughnut advert to promote a Dunkaccino. This for me was the funniest moment of the film as it was ironic that Pacino wouldn't stoop as low as a cheesy TV ad, but would actually stoop lower and star as himself in another dated and terrible Adam Sandler film. The plot in this film is very basic and follows the classic cause and effect narrative structure, like most comedies do.\n\nNot only does Pacino sell himself out by appearing in this film, but he also sells out every other film he has ever made by rapping some of his most famous quotes from films like The Godfather Part II (Dir. Francis Ford Coppola, 1974) and Scarface (Dir. Brian De Palma, 1983) for the Dunkaccino TV advert.\n\nMany of the gags in Jack and Jill are slapstick orientated, which is rarely funny in the best of films; especially when it is overused, which it was. Jack's twin sister Jill (Adam Sandler) would fall over so many times, expecting the audience to laugh because a man dressed as a woman tripped up or lifted up weights that even body builders couldn't. However slapstick gags were not the only form of comedy within Jack and Jill. I was also able to experience the \"joy\" of hundreds of fart jokes, which might appeal to the 10 year old target audience, but not to adults. Finally I was disgusted at the amount of Jewish jokes Sandler had incorporated into the film. I don't think anyone laughs at those jokes unless they are actually Jewish, and even then I couldn't be certain. The comedy aspects of the script felt like they were written ten to fifteen years ago and Sandler just thought we have the same expectations for comedy in 2012 as we did then. We don't.\n\nAl Pacino is not the only star that appears as himself in Jack and Jill. Johnny Depp was also there with Pacino at a basketball game, and unusually Johnny Depp was probably the funniest part of the film. I will say that this film is seemingly aimed at American audiences rather than a British audience as Jack and Jill does have a lot of US celebrities that are unknown to me, and so the jokes they are involved in were just not funny.\n\nI did smile a few times during Jack and Jill but I never laughed out loud, which I would expect to do when watching a comedy film. Unfortunately half the gags I may have laughed at are in the trailer and therefore are no longer funny when seeing them for a second or third time. For a film in the comedy genre, it failed. For a film in general, it failed. Do not watch this unless you love every movie Adam Sandler makes. If you do then this film is probably right up your street with its unintelligent comedy, pathetic attempts for a laugh and tedious narrative. I will leave this review with the simple question of: How does Adam Sandler always get such attractive wives in his movies, when he just isn't that funny?\n\nIf you enjoyed this review check out others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"

It was loud, obnoxious, and a waste of time. I think the problem is Adam playing is twin sister. I could not stand that screechy character at all! I'm disappointed because I really liked his other 2011 effort, Just Go With It.\n\nDennis Dugan's film is about a guy named Jack, who is a very good advertising executive. Unfortunately for him, he has to deal with his annoying twin sister for the holidays and get Al Pacino to appear in a commercial. Will her survive?\n\nI don't understand how the great Al Pacino would fall for this tripe. He is a screen legend and should know better. That being said, he did deliver a strong performance. Adam Sandler, though tolerable as his manly self, was completely awful as Jill. He should not have done Jill the way he did because I never met such an annoying character.\n\nOverall, this is the worst Adam Sandler movie I have seen to date. It was not funny and I spent the majority of the movie cringing whenever Jill was on screen. I guess the kids will enjoy this, but everyone else will find this torture. My \"high\" rating is due to the saving grace of Al Pacino. I rate this film 4/10."

The reviews of this movie seem to be based on the fact that they compare this to an intellectual comedy or something very popular like Hangover in terms of laughs. However I saw it as an adam sandler flick and got what i paid for. Adam sandlers very rarely get a good review. I mean on rotten tomatoes, this got a 4% rating while movies I LOVED like Click only got a 33%, movies like Grandmas Boy got only 18%, and Little nicky got 22%. If you like any of these movies a lot, go see it. I found it funny personally. Parts were boring and other parts were hilarious laugh out loud funny. Adam Sandler isn't going down in quality, its that he isn't changing. His movies are always stupid funny and full of slapstick humor which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. He does other movies like Punch Drunk Love, Rain on Me, and Click which are a break from the norm but most of his movies are generally the same. And equally bad in terms of reviews. So again for me i liked it. Funny at parts but don't compare to a critically acclaimed movie because you wont like it then. Compare it to something Adam Sandler has done in the last 5 years and if you liked them then this might be enjoyable."

In the whole movie Jill is an annoying character that will always get mad at Jack. Every time this happens it's her fault because she gets Jack mad and when he gets mad back she cry's and runs away while Jack is the one being blamed. Also Jill won't leave Jack's house and go back to her house even when Jack wants her to go. If this character had more time in the oven and fix these problems this movie would have been better. In conclusion, this movie would be better if Jill's character and personality was worked on more."

It's actually amazing that this actually passed the idea stage.\n\nI recently found myself rediscovering The Wedding Singer, which I liked still.\n\nAnd I tried some other movies and they just aren't what they once were to me. But morbid curiosity got me to see this one; I figured maybe it's \"so bad, it's good.\"\n\nUm, no.\n\nNevermind all the product placement (though it's hard to ignore); what on Earth made Al Pacino do this movie?\n\nSandler stars as - you know the plot basically. He plays his sister. (Hard to watch) The jokes aren't funny; the gags about (ugh) \"chimichanga bombs\" was just so disgusting (why on Earth is this supposed to be funny? I'm surprised Sandler didn't make a comedy about how funny IBS is, or such).\n\nSo this is filled with flatulence jokes (nothing new there....) and with things like a kid, an adopted Hindu son, who you notice right away likes to stick things, tie things to him. Just completely bizarre. Adam Sandler does *not* deserve his wealth by any means.\n\nThis 91 minutes was just hard to stomach. Al Pacino bizarrely gives a reading like - well, like an actor basically, though this ain't The Godfather or And Justice For All..... One of the greatest actors lowering himself to be in this....\n\nAnd when this movie aims for some kind of emotional, caring scene that might move you, it uses gibberish. The same kind of speech as Billy Madison at the dinner table, practically.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for this movie to have ever been made, this is something that I'm sure a total Adam Sandler fan will at least want to see once (though many, and I mean many, big fans of his have stated that they usually love his movies but this is the worst - or one of the worst ones) - but this is something that you should try and avoid by all means...\n\nIf you're looking for a genuinely funny movie, I have to say this is not one, this just terrible, think about looking elsewhere, you may seriously regret having seen this - especially if you spent money on a rental or purchase.\n\nAvoid. Don't let morbid curiosity get the best of you."

Unfortunately I've seen worse.\n\nA person playing two roles has been done before and often good actors pull it off so that's not a criticism on its own. Sadly Sandler is not really pulling it off too well in this film and for that reason among many others this film is bad. It's plot was pretty thin but yes there was some plot that tried to put it together even if done badly. It managed to have some funny moments with Al Pacino's cameo and Jill being so absurd. Even in his worst films Sandler manages to make silly or stupid appear funny even if it is for a few moments. Katie Holmes was quite decent and seemed to be the only one carrying this wreck of a film. So overall and trying my best to be objective its a 5/10."

The audacity of that was almost funny...\n\nThe only scene in the film worth watching is the 'Dunkacino' part, because it's so cringeworthy that it might make you laugh out of sheer awkward embarrassment.

Having Sandler play both male and female twins is funny. I know it's been done before and arguably better. However, with a smarter and more special effects savvy audience, I get the feeling they're just poking fun at the whole situation. He's just having fun with it. (I hope) They whole movie is stupid, anyway.\n\nDo I think this is a good movie? Absolutely not. Would I pay to see it in theaters knowing what I know now? No. I could see myself watching this at home with friends, or a significant other. You get your chuckles out of Jack and Jill. That's all it's worth. Nothing more and nothing less. I think this is near the bottom of the Sandler Spectrum of movies. (which isn't really that high in comparison to other movies, to be honest) At least he does try to get some basic points across while providing laughs. I give it a 5. I didn't walk out screaming for my money back. I was smiling, but it was the stupid kind of smirky smile where I didn't grow as a person and wasn't really sucked into the plot or anything deep.

The plot was heart warming and I think that this is a movie that is fun for the whole family. I laughed a bit. But there is only one thing that doesn't make this movie all that great. Everyline that Al Pacino spoke had no sense of comedy. You could tell that he was trying to act but didn't succeed. I say that he is better for the original genre that he acts best with. Drama. I'm sorry but this is Pacino's all time low. All in all this was a cute family comedy that I would recommend to see."

I still wasn't feeling anything particular, but he did deliver a speech towards the ending of the movie, that no one else in the cast could've made look as believable as him.

This one is almost as bad as what you have heard about it. There are a few parts that made me laugh, but when the best part is a little kid taping animals to his back that shows you what kind of movie this is. On a side note Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time, but the last scene with him made me cringe...watch it and you will see what I mean. The only reason I kept watching was because of Pacino, but that scene almost made me regret it. Overall, a movie I can't really recommend...\"Just Go With It\" was much, much better. I give it a C-.

I know Sandlers humor has gone a bit out of style because there aren't dirty jokes, lots of cursing,lots of people getting drunk or stoned which is what people like now. It not that kind of humor, its pretty family friendly but man its hilarious to me...Adam is the latest Mel Brooks. I didn't actually think he was that funny as Jill but still there were so many funny moments. Adam will have to add dirty jokes, nudity, and lots of f bombs before he will get his audience back. Today's audience just can't get the old school slapstick humor anymore I guess. I feel lucky that I can get it and man I had fun. I needed the laughs too. Sandler is a comic genius, Im thankful we have him."

This is a typical example of a good Adam Sandler movie and reminded me slightly of his earlier work, such as the Waterboy. When the film began I felt like I wanted to watch this movie. It contained slapstick with good family humour. I especially loved the surprise appearances of celebrities in the film. It is a perfectly watchable movie. I give it 6 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jack and Jill is amazing! I've always had a curious interest in heist related things. Like the real life heist at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum where thieves got away with nearly $500 million dollars worth of paintings. So when it comes to movies I really like Ocean's Eleven both the original and remake. That is why I'm so amazed by Jack and Jill. The movie is terrible, absolutely painful to watch and I won't even go into detail cause they didn't bother putting any effort into making it, why should I care to give it a proper review.\n\nNo the reason I like this is because it's a heist movie. They received 80 million dollars to fund this movie, on top of that they had some painfully obvious product placement mainly for Dunkin Donuts and Pebto Bismol. So add even more money on to that 80 million. Now look at the production quality of the movie... how much do you think this movie actually cost to make? The actors are the most expensive thing in this movie. Not even the NBA scene where they went to a Lakers game... they didn't actually shoot a fake game they CGI the actors into a Laker's game. Why? Cause it was cheap as hell to CGI it.\n\nSo this movie barely cost anything to make... Adam Sandler doesn't even have convincing female body prosthetics. Jill is always wearing a lot of clothes to hide the fact that he probably just has socks in that bra. Just throw make-up on with a wig and do the nails. So how much did this movie actually cost? We'll never know the truth cause this was a scam. Grossed $150 million, budget $80 million + product placement. You didn't watch a movie you watched a heist, and they got away with it.\n\nSo the score? Well I'm amazed with this movie. I'm not making this score to get you to read this, I'm scoring this an 8 because as a heist, this was amazing. If you watched this you didn't see a movie, there's no conflict or plot, it's just fat people jokes and even a little racism too. No, what you just saw was a heist being done right before your very eyes."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first heard about this movie when seeing an episode of \"South Park\" that referenced it. I seriously thought it was just something they made up! I didn't think that an idea this stupid could actually be real! So, the plot is that Jack's sister Jill is coming over for Thanksgiving. It's sad that there are so few Thanksgiving movies out there and this is one of the most well known. Anyway, Jack needs to get Al Pacino to do a Dunkin Donuts commercial for him.\n\nAs you might have guessed, Pacino falls in love with Jill. It's mostly because they both grew up in the Bronx. This is a pretty stupid reason to fall in love seeing as how Jill is ugly and annoying. We get even more hideous and embarrassing makeup throughout the film with David Spade as a woman and some old Mexican woman with one tooth who eats peppers. Jack has an adopted Indian son who likes taping things to his chest. This is stupid and pointless, much like the entire film.\n\nIn fact, the kid characters serve no purpose at all. We have to deal with Sandler's annoying voice as Jill throughout the whole film. Of course there's a lot of farts in this movie! Oh, and Jill pooping Mexican food. I think the only reason this didn't get a PG-13 rating is because there were no swear words in it. This won more Razzies than any film in history and while it's not as awful as \"Daddy Day Camp\" or \"The Master Of Disguise\", it's still horrendous. *"

In the movie the son of Jack keeps scotch-taping items to himself. Even this semi-humorous aspect of the film wears out fairly quickly, BUT, BUT, BUT, before the humor is gone there is the scene with the mythical beast, the \"Peppercorn.\"\n\nThe Peppercorn is easily a painful belly laugh--an intense focal point of funny that makes me give the film a five-star rating even if every other scene in the film warrants a zero. (And it just about does,...)\n\nSure we should expect low-brow from Sandler, but do we have to settle for encephalitis? Come on, Adam, you can do way better.\n\nRent this movie for a dollar from Redbox, watch the first fifteen minutes until the Peppercorn scene, laugh really hard, and then turn the film off. Thank me later."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly, with its comedy this movie is not any better or worse than the average modern genre attempt but the one thing that does make this movie worse is the entire way it got told and made.\n\nThe one thing with this movie that kept bugging me was that it felt like a couple of loose shot scenes, that weren't really connected by a story. It's like they went ahead and shot this movie before there even was a script ready. It's weird and it makes the movie feel like such an incomplete one.\n\nBut other than that, is the humor more lame or childish when compared to other similar genre movies? And is the Jill character really more obnoxious, irritating and unconvincing than any other forced comedy characters? Not really. As a matter of fact, the movie its humor and characters didn't bother me all that much. It's a comedy, so of course everything is being over-the-top. When you go along with that, it's not all that bad of a ride. It might even make you chuckle a couple of times.\n\nOne of the things that also really makes the movie worthwhile is Al Pacino as himself. You perhaps would expect his role to be no bigger than a cameo but as a matter of fact he is essential to the 'story' and you could even see he plays the second biggest and most important role out of the movie because Jack and Jill are both being played by the same actor, Adam Sandler, of course. And yes, Al Pacino was quite awesome in this. Most of the movie its best moments involve him and he plays his role very Pacino-like, so all serious and with all of his talents and skills.\n\nIt's really too bad he wasn't in a better movie than this one. None of the developments or backgrounds really work out for its story or any of its characters. Because of this also a lot of characters are making a very redundant impression in the movie, such as Jack's wife and kids. And his wife is actually being played by Katie Holmes but her role is hardly important at all for the movie.\n\nIt's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, it just is not a very well made one.\n\n4/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, I said it. Jack and Jill is not that bad. It does have a lot of dumb humor, but that what makes it funny. Yes, it does look a lot like a movie George Simmons (Adam Sandler's character from Funny People) would do. But, the reason why Sandler does films like this is because they make a lot of money, and when he does something different, those films don't do so well financially.\n\nSandler stars in both title roles. Jack is a television commercial director-producer, who dreads when his twin sister, Jill, visits for Thanksgiving every year. Jack has only a few weeks to land Al Pacino to do a commercial for Dunkin Donuts when Jill arrives. Jack now has to keep his cool knowing that Jill is not just staying through Thanksgiving, but even longer than that.\n\nSandler proves that he still is a funny guy in playing both parts. As Jack, Sandler has to play it straight and does good at playing the guy who has to keep his cool, yet loses it a few times. As Jill, he goes all out, especially with the ridiculous voice. Katie Holmes plays Jack's wife, Erin. She does okay with an underwritten part, but shows that she is not a great actress at all.\n\nAl Pacino is a riot as he appears in the film as himself. He made a character out of himself as a guy who wants Jill, yet trying to stay professional as an actor.\n\nSandler fans, like myself, will enjoy seeing people such as Nick Swardson, Tim Meadows, Norm MacDonald, and David Spade appear in small roles. There are also cameos by Regis Philbin, Jared Fogle (Subway guy), and even Johnny Depp.\n\nSomething I found to be somewhat entertaining, yet unnecessary was in the beginning and end of the movies where quite a few sets of twins talk about being a twin and what it's like.\n\nFans of traditional Adam Sandler movies may find it entertaining, yet dumb. But that is what Adam Sandler movies are, and they still work."

It had the usual toilet humor, farts, diarrhea and a sweaty bed but the cockatoo almost stole the show. I have seen films worse than this and I don't think it deserved the harsh criticism it has received. We all have someone in the family that we are embarrassed about and want to get rid of at times and this exaggerated the fact. I think Adam Sandler has a lot of talent and I don't think we've seen the best of him yet. I would love it if he tackled a really serious role, just to see what he is really made of."

Despite this, I didn't find this quite as bad as expected. I had been meaning to see this for a long time and while it's pretty poor I have seen much worse.\n\nI don't think the film's problem is its humour, I had a few laughs here and there and Sandler's antics were entertaining at times. It's very lowbrow and juvenile but I've watched far worse films on the comedy front. One of the main issues with the film is the fact that Jill is possibly the most annoying character in cinematic history. Jack isn't so bad, but Sandler portrayed Jill as a very irritating and unlikeable individual. The makeup also isn't great and you can tell that Jill is just Adam Sandler dressed up, whereas in films like Norbit (another much maligned comedy featuring a dual performance) it's hard to tell who's who. Elsewhere the acting performances are serviceable though nothing great, and Al Pacino features, strange to see him in a comedy. Another problem is that the film has the most obvious product placement in the history of film. It's like a 90 minute long ad.\n\nBelow average for sure, but it's not as bad as some make it out to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jack and Jill\" (2011), well, that's 91 minutes I'll never get back. Wow, and I thought I'd seen bad films before. But this one takes bad to a whole new level! As soon as I saw the first trailer for this \"film\", I said to myself: \"this movie is going to suck!\" Sure enough, it did and it still does. This \"film\" is, by far, the worst Adam Sandler movie. \"Jack and Jill\" has an abysmal and cliched storyline, overall horrible acting, and a boring generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, a man named Jack Sadelstein is an ad executive. His sister Jill is coming to visit him and his family. Doesn't that just sound riveting? Yeah, I've seen this boring and overused trope a million times! It's just like hundreds of other films, an annoying family member comes to visit and cliched hijinks ensue. Granted, the majority of movies are recycled plot threads. However, the goal is to take the familiar concept and try to do it better while adding your own unique twist to it. \"Jack and Jill\" has none of that. To add salt to the wound, the character Jill is also played by Adam Sandler! We'll go into more details about that in a minute. Any way, it's about as cliched as you can get, just like most of Adam Sandler's other films. Bad jokes, toilet humor and subplots that go absolutely nowhere. That's right, for this entire 90 minutes, nothing of substance happens. Another thing, the writing is about as lazy as you can get. To ante up the irritation, Jill has a pet parrot that repeats the same phrase over and over again. It keeps screaming: \"where were you?!\" That's it, seriously, that's all it says and nothing else. Really? You couldn't come up with any other catchphrases? If you can't think of more than one thing for a parrot to say, then the stupid parrot shouldn't have been in the story to begin with! None of the characters are likable, even Al Pacino, who plays himself in this \"film\" couldn't save it. Yep, they somehow convinced Al Pacino to be in this \"movie\". I feel sorry for him! How did they get him to do it? Did they threaten him or his family? Any way, the story is cliched, the characters are cliched and the 91 minutes just feels like an eternity. As far as the acting goes, it's just as bad. This \"film\" has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, I'm serious. It's ironic that Al Pacino, who is such a fantastic actor, gives such a horrible performance here! But, the worst acting performance in this \"movie\" comes from Adam Sandler. When he plays Jack, he's boring. When he plays Jill, he's unbearably annoying! The sad thing is, that a lot of the actors and actresses here have acted better in other movies. What happened to them here? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as predictable as you can get. There's nothing in this \"film\" score that's worth writing home about. Now, what do you say we get to the only two good elements in this worthless pile of filth? The only two good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this \"film\" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that this \"movie\" came out in 2011. \"Jack and Jill\" is easily the worst Adam Sandler movie, by far. I don't see how his career can possibly recover from this. Yes, I am aware that this \"film\" broke the record for winning the most Razzie awards. I didn't know about that until about a week ago! When I saw that it won those Razzies, I just cracked up. Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't win more than it did! Yes, I do think that this \"movie\" is that bad. I'm giving this \"film\" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Must I tell you to stay away from this \"movie\"? Probably not, because anyone with a brain stem should know how bad it is. When I saw it, I had no choice at all. It was during an airport flight, and I was subjected to watching this piece of garbage. I couldn't avoid it, I was stuck! The tagline on the poster explains it perfectly in one statement; \"it ain't pretty\". At least they're being honest! Any way, for the sake of your decency, avoid \"Jack and Jill\" like the plague. The original nursery rhyme is much more entertaining!"

Grab some friends and beer, and laugh hysterically at (not with) this movie. Make it a challenge to sip your beer for the duration of the \"chimichanga scene.\" This movie is such a blast to make fun of that I ALMOST feel bad for the poor review. As a movie for bonding over its terribleness, it's a ten. It's also a great pallet cleanser if you've been watching too many great movies. Otherwise, a two is fair. The only reason it isn't a zero is because I think there was a joke at one point that made me slightly chuckle, but not ironically. My friends promptly started laughing at me. Anyway, this is probably the best movie to represent the Happy Madison dark age. It's a unique low for the studio, but in a way, an absolute high. It's a work of art in its own terrible way."

This movie isn't as bad as the critics suggest, but it certainly isn't good. It's somewhere Inbetween. Like I said, it does have its moments of laughter, but there aren't enough to make it a successful comedy film. I enjoyed Katie Holmes in the movie, thought she did fairly well. Adam Sandler was Adam Sandler, I'm sure u know what I mean. There were some moments where I found myself laughing. But this movies problem is that there weren't nearly enough of those moments. The other moments I was just saying why is this happening lol. And to be honest Al Pacino made me uncomfortable in this movie. I did not like his performance at all. To be perfectly frank this movie is not really worth watching. It's not terrible, but it's not good. No I do not think it was the worst film of the year, but I can see why some people might think that. Overall, this gets a 5/10. Not really worth your time."

I practically felt like shooting him every time his face was on the screen. I have nothing against him but I found his presence to be unnecessary. Second, I would just like to say that farting is only funny maybe the first couple of times. Over use of flatulence just gets annoying. Third, well, all I can say is that this movie was no 50 First Dates."

Jack is a happy-go-lucky family man with caring wife , beautiful kids and perfect job. His life turns topsy-turvy when his twin sister comes to visit them in the summer vacation. Jack & Jill , directed by Dennis Duncan , could have been better , funnier and probably more sensible like Sandler's previous which had at least some story to tell. Adam Sandler is not in form this time. He simply goes over the top and is sometimes irritating especially when he is playing the female character. The least I say for the direction , the better for you. The screenplay is terrible. The dialogues are passable. Adam Sandler do make you laugh at certain scenes but at one point of time , he just disappoints. God knows what Katie Holmes was doing in the film. The only silver lining was Al Pacino. The veteran actor has small role to play but he does justice to his part. Jack & Jill is watchable only in parts where as rest of the movie is just about OK. Average 2/5"

Poor Al Pacino whatever they paid him wasn't enough. I'm sure Sandler took great pleasure in dragging Pacino down. I will say Adam Sandler is a genius he gets a studio to invest in bad movies so he and his friends can go film in beautiful locations and of course always gives himself a beautiful wife. Not even so bad it's good."

Co-stars katie holmes, norm macdonald, tim meadows. It's silly. And way over done. A funny bit when the bathroom attendant re-assures jack, when he dresses up in drag... which is redundant, at this point. Jill and pacino fight it out, in a strange scene.

Jill's story is a Shakespearean soliloquy wrapped in an enigma of mystery and tantalizing romanticism. Jack himself is a shallow charlatan and debutante who embodies the worst of Coastal elitism and corporate America. He forsakes any moral compass for the sake of social advancement. Poopsie, Jill's trademark fecal-inspired avian, presents the audience with an undercutting of Jill's credence as a protagonist, with his repeating of the phrase \"Where were you?\" suggesting a pattern of paralleling behavior between the namesake siblings: abandonment. I did, however, find myself to be greatly disappointed by Katie Holmes' nominal role in such a visceral plot for the audience, as I cannot even recall her character's name in the film. If she had channeled her acting prowess in the same vein as was done for her seminal role as the iconic former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the hit television series, The Kennedys, which came out in 2011. For my foodies in the crowd, the Dunkachino, portrayed in the most commercialistic light of any plot object presented to the watcher in the movie, is presented as a bold, hazelnut-infused, daring take on the average American coffee, which Dunkin' runs on. In conclusion, Al Pacino was the best character lol, adam sandler a mf og watch this rn fam."

This is a comedy movie, but i can't feel the humor. the jokes was plain and cannot balance with the story line. Plus, saw Adam Sandler in woman's body just like wow, are you serious? like i've never imagine this before. But, the cast like Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, etc are really helped this movie became better."

Adam Sandler in drag is such a convincing Jewish New York 80's Barry Manillow fan , and is so warm and attractive in a motherly way. IT IS SO WHACKY IT CANT FAIL TO BE FUNNY. Wonderful performances and such great fun to watch. The kind of movie that used to be made, It is a brave thing to do in this day and age, and so refreshing to see. it is an instant classic and deserves at least a trio of sequels and prequels maybe. 10 out of 10 for the purpose of encouragement to continue. A Inspirational comedy.\n\nThe supporting cast are good, the lines so terrible they give you belly laughs. Al Pacino is brilliant, his love for Jill so full of pathos and tragedy and is played with such gusto and power it makes you shudder with delight, and impact what impact! Hilarious Hilarious! Hilarious!!!!\n\nYou want to re watch. I love this place it is a good place to be. More more more."

I have never hated an Adam Sandler movie and I don't hate this one, it's not his best but there are some parts that you will giggle at. One bonus the movie has is that there are a TON of celebrities in it, including: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, John McEnroe, David Spade, the Sham-Wow guy, Jared from Subway and many more. It is more of a family Adam Sandler movie so don't expect the same humor as in 'Happy Gilmore' or 'Billy Madison' if you do you will be disappointed. Just watch it with an open mind and remember that is more family humor that everyone will giggle at. I enjoyed it and it got some giggles out of me."

People saying that Adam Sandler is a bad actor, even though there may be SOME truth to that notion, i still choose to disagree with that. Sandler is a great actor, but the only thing pulling him back is the bad writing. Actors follow a script, they don't write that script, they just follow it. But this is a weird situation (for obvious reasons). The comedy is targeted towards the young audience. Sure, i chuckled a few times and the plot was good enough.\n\nHonestly, this is a movie for children and not for anyone above the age of 16."

At one point I my self was laughing so hard that I had stopped breathing and I fell out of my chair. All these F's on ratings must just be because all these people are jellos of the director!

Its strictly NOT meant for the pseudo intellectuals, who only have an appetite for Hardcore-Serious Cinema. I won't say I loved this comedy, but I definitely didn't hate it either. Come on, you're not meant to take this film seriously, its meant to make you laugh, that's it!\n\nBen Zook, Steve Koren & Robert Smigel's Screenplay is over-the-top, but funny at times nevertheless. Dennis Dugan's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are functional.\n\nPacino is truly Unforgettable in here. The Emperor of Acting delivers a load of laughs, thanks to his Fantastic Comic-Timing & Undeniably Screen-Presence. Sandler, on the other-hand, delivers a very relaxed & sporty performance. He's good as Jack & completely \"fun\" as Jill. Among other performances, Katie Holmes is her usual self. In cameo roles, Johnny Depp & Shaquille O'Neal are Superb.\n\nOn the whole, 'Jack and Jill' is funny in parts. Watch it for Pacino & Sandler's Winning Performances."

I love that man in anything he's in and he makes a very funny advertisement for a new drink at the end which got some film quotes in there, which was nicely done.\n\nSo, the film is defiantly Sandler's worst, but not as bad as everyone claims it to be as there was a few funny bits (most from Pacino though.)"

Among those are Mixed Nuts, The Waterboy, The Hot Chick and now Jack and Jill. I could do without a few scenes of the bathroom/gas humor, but the laughs far outweigh those minor episodes.\n\nAdam Sandler convincingly portrays his twin sister with hilarious and touching results. The special effects are so realistic that honestly I'm not sure what was real and what was CGI, especially Poopsie the cockatoo or cockatiel. The sight gags are hysterically funny.\n\nThe sole fact that Al Pacino plays a prominent role in this movie should garner a higher rating and he does it with serious panache. Even Katie Holmes gives a wonderfully straight performance as Adam Sandler's wife.\n\nThe addition of Sandler buddies Nick Swardson and Alan Covert provides some hilarious support. The cameos are so numerous that you just have to watch and enjoy - David Spade is an absolute hoot.\n\nFinally, the real twins that bookend the movie are adorable and funny. I just don't understand how someone could not appreciate this movie and avoid laughing their heads off!!!\n\nRIP Norm Funbucket."

It is uncomfortable.\n\n3. A lot of supposed humour comes from horribly prejudice comments made by the characters. Such that even if you thought you'd sit down and watch a bad movie... continuing with the viewing would make you feel wrong and uncomfortable.\n\nThat said I got through this movie and found some random cut away type jokes quite funny. It doesn't stop it being awkward but I do have one thought about how you could enjoy this film better... Well making a comedy that is just offensive is discomforting but we can all see what archetypal movie we're going for here. What if this film was actually just that movie made as a serious drama with a few jokes thrown in there, but the main characters are really portrayed so badly that the serious story turns to uncomfortable character jokes? If you can view it through these eyes where there is a shallow but sensitive story being told about 2 awful human beings that learn to stop being hateful to each other and everyone else, and try to forgive that it is framed as an all out comedy, enjoying only the side-comedy for laughs... Then you might make it to the end without feeling dirty. Maybe. Good luck though!"

It was the portrayal of a brother who cannot stand his sister. Nobody else can understand his feelings and his frustration. It reminds me of my own sister. This is a frustration that I share.\n\nI also think the part where Jill leaves a \"sweat angel\" on the bed when she sleeps is a piece of overlooked comedy gold."

Especially the pepper.\n\nI loved also to see Pacino.\n\nAnd I think this movie subtly, maybe too subtly, was showing how stupid it is to criticize a celebrity for showing some emotion. It made me think of the big scandal made of Tom Cruise's couch event, which was certainly a natural demonstration of emotion, and that many many people mocked, apparently without any consideration of hurting the feelings of Tom Cruise.\n\nThere are many things that make me think that this movie speaks a bit about the Cruise life : the word \"cruise\" used, the conversion of Erin - Katie Holmes in the movie - to the religion of Jack, ...\n\nBye. And why be so harsh? Oh and also I loved the little scenes in the beginning and the end of the movie. At the end, I especially loved when it was a little girl speaking about how her brother could put her back on her feet when she'd fall and feel bad.\n\nVery kind.\n\nLove, Leila"

At first, we were concerned about the television commercials showing the entire flick, but then we were pleasantly surprised. I personally found myself laughing throughout the movie. While Adam Sandler had a great performance, for me it was Al Pacino who stole the show with his over the top antics. Sadly to say there were some things that were very implausible, but even these items did not distract too much from the movie itself. Jack and Jill is a feel-good movie that is supposed to make you laugh and have a great time. It delivers in that area. Of course if you are looking for something deep and moving with Oscar-winning performances, then you should be looking for something more like J. Edgar."

I didn't think this was going to be a funny movie at all. Adam as a woman? But it worked and he made a pretty woman at that. Scary. It reminded me a lot of Robin Williams comedy. The cameo's the stars it was a very well done movie. The only thing I didn't like was Katie Holmes part, it should have had a bit more action on her part. She was almost there only for show.

He really takes it funny with the role of Jill, and Jack (how he gets so annoyed with Jill). I sat there in the theater (when it was finished), hoping there would be more to it.\n\nThis was so much better than any of these movies: Abduction, The Big Year, Harry PotterVII, and The Smurfs.\n\nI recommend you watch this movie, even if you're not into comedy films.

It isn't a movie about taking in a homeless man for Thanksgiving... that's just one small scene. Having some knowledge of cinema should help you enjoy this film. (Just for reference, I have a graduate degree from USC, I'm over 30 and female). LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The laughter in the theater here in Monterey was loud, so clearly it's not the one-star film some of these reviewers have said. Yes, Adam Sandler doesn't make an attractive woman... he's not supposed to be pretty! There are 'family moments' that made us cringe... but that was the point. Who doesn't have someone in their family that's not the star? Funny stuff!"

Who cares? :) Anyways, this film is NOT as bad as the critics make out. I went to go see it thinking it was the worst movie ever, and came out with a smile on my face. Sure, some of it was pretty immature but the rest was quite funny. I might have a weird sense of humour, but then apparently so does my friend. She enjoyed it and she's not a huge Adam Sandler film. It was pretty crazy seeing Adam playing Jack AND Jill but amusing as well. The story line kinda sucks, but the lines were funny and I liked it how it made a reference to the fairy tale (is Jack and Jill a fairy tale?!). I loved this film. 10/10. Well worth my money.:)"

How glad I am that I chose to ignore the reviews and follow my instincts. Admitingly not one of his best but As always Sandler delivers on the light hearted comedy with some great laugh out loud moments and all in all provides another feel good film. If your looking for a film with a deep intellectual background go pick up something else with subtitles, If you want a giggle look no further!! as the gags fly often enough to keep you captivated. True rating would have to be at least a 6/10"

To people who do not like this movie based on the fact they do not like the actors etc. this is not a good reason to bag the movie out.

        "review_detailed_main": "I would like to start this review by stating my disappointment that it was not a big screen adaptation of the classic nursery rhyme. Took me half an hour to work that out. But once I did, I realised that this was a fantastic film, the high-brow sort of comedy we have all come to expect from Adam Sandler.The man has set the bar extremely high this time, might be hard to top this one. But I do hope he does. My only real concern is for Al Pacinos mental health. This man is deeply disturbed, I mean he played a bizarre parody of himself. It was almost as if he were portraying an amalgamation of every single character he has ever played on screen in his long and illustrious career.\n\nAll in all a quality film, marred somewhat by the casting of Katie Holmes as Jacks wife Erin. I say this only because she is not a high quality actress, certainly not in the same echelon of say, a Bridgette Wilson or a Fairuza Balk. These are capable actresses of a high calibre. I actually believe that Adam Sandler would have been able to play a third character. Why stop at two? He could play Jack, Jill and Erin. Any more than that is ridiculous, Eddie Murphy territory.\n\nKatie Holmes incompetence as an actress is almost as deplorable as her incompetence as a wife. Perhaps this film was the catalyst for her divorce from the great Tom Cruise. Did she not ask him permission? Did he feel threatened by her amazing chemistry with Adam Sandler? Or was Adam Sandlers superiorority the only thing threatening Tom?\n\nIn summary, a feel good romp the whole family will enjoy.\n\nUnless your family supports terrorism."

I was happy and laughing.\n\nAnd another thing, it's Adam Sandler. Not 4-letter words or sexual innuendo. He's saved comedy. If it weren't for him, where would comedy be? Research that!

I thought it was odd that Pacino was in this and the part he played was out of his ordinary character, but \"Jill\" was a scream! We rewound parts and watched over and over as we rolled on the floor in laughter. This movie was not crude humor, sexual, nor did it have drugs or alcohol in it. Just a great film, funny.....funny.....funny! I would recommend this one for any family who just wants to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and laugh.

Well I suggest everyone do that because this movie is funny as hell.\n\nJack hates his sister so everyone can agree and relate to his part. She basically comes for the holidays and stays longer than Jack wanted. Al Pacino played an excellent part and is hilarious too. This is Adam Sandler humor through and through. Please give it a chance and I know these cross-dressing movies are getting out of hand lately but I can say this one was enjoyable from beginning to end. So watch with an open mind and I believe you will enjoy this movie. Also this is the best Adam Sandler movie ever! I Kidding, I Kidding, LOL watch the movie for that. Enjoy people and never go into a movie expecting the worse. Just watch it with a clear and open mind and you shall enjoy! Go ADAM SANDLER!"

The amount of love and energy he put into the film was above any of his others. Some people say he should have won the Oscar for best picture in The Godfather but his performance in that film pales in comparison to his performance in Jack and Jill. As the movie progresses you find that the relationship between Jill and Al Pacino was well thought out and well written. Adam Sandler's characters in this movie are very charming and funny. The amazing acting, direction and writing are all what makes this movie Al Pacino's and Adam Sandler's best movie."

His shtick is making silly, funny, loaded-with-innuendos comedies. My only complaint about this movie would be the overdone and paranoid references to anti- semitism. He overdid it when it came to that but otherwise, I thought the movie was great. The character of Jill is funny, vulnerable and yes...kind of creepy but she's supposed to be! I did think Katie Holme's considerable acting talent could have been to more use but I enjoyed watching her in this film. She's a solid actress."

At least, this movie teaches you to be more loving towards your relatives, not to be so hard on each other and the ones you love, in a humorous way. Do you think that one of the best actors out there, Al Pacino, would've accepted to play in the worst movie if he didn't think it would've been a hilarious movie to watch with the kids and laugh? Plus, it's full of multiple great actors all united, not just an indie film. So watch it if you're in a mood for goofy."

I love Adam Sandler movies and to have one I could share with the kids was great. I'm guessing most of the bad reviews came from peops without kids. We all laughed and enjoyed it. Good family fun movie. I think some people expect so much from movies that they forget the fun aspect. I have an image of people sitting in front of their TV with a whip saying \" make me happy now!\" or \"entertain me\". I believe the audience have to be someone more than just a corpse sitting there, or a person with a dry or bland personality. Let yourself go and you'll be surprised to see things in a new light."

At times, you'll feel sorry for \"Jill\" and, other times, she drives you nuts! Adam Sandler truly understands human comedy regarding the highs and lows, the happiness and sadness that all great comedians experience in their films (like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Jackie Gleason). The children in the movie are great and enjoyable! Nick Swardson is so funny as Adam's employee! This is a good, fun, enjoyable comedy that we will definitely watch again!"

Adam Sandler is great actor I would bang Adam Sandler when he is dressed as Jill. I mean come on that is one of the reasons why I rated a 10/10. I love Adam Sandler this movie is amazing he is such a good actor in this movie. I give it a review of 10/10 I think a sequel would be a great idea. Maybe switch the main character around. I think it should have a spin off TV series about Jack and Jill since they're 2 lovable characters I mean come on who didn't love Adam Sandler dressed as a woman I mean damn. Maybe they could get a dog that talks and another thing why does he has a Indian kid I mean I hated that kid I liked the Mexican who goes I'm kidding he was like able and relate able because he was kidding about the jokes he made I thought it was really funny I loved everything about this movie it was amazing my friend liked the movie I liked the movie you should like the movie too it was a good movie I would watch it again with Las."

Sandler plays himself and his twin sister and he's very good at it. All the acting is great, no corny dialogue, well written, well shot and edited -- no boring parts. It's simply very quite clever. I also really liked Al Pachino's acting, because of course he's good and fun to watch, but I really liked that he worked at it and didn't just phone it in, and of course much of his parts I'm sure were boosted by good writing and camera work and editing etc.\n\nIt's definitely worth watching imo."

Sander isn't that convening as a girl but thats only because his kind of character doesn't really work as a girl. the other cast are also good but there not really that importunate compared to Adam Sander. i have given it a 10 out of 10 only because i couldn't bring mys to give it any less. if their was a choice of like 9.5 i would give it that but seeing as there is only 9 and 10 then i would rather give it a 10 then a 9. BTW the linkage in the film can became a bit unappropriated but its not to the point that it cloud be considered bad for kids. in conclusion its an OK movie thats not as bad as people say."

I don't view it worried about lighting, music selections or similar nitpicking critiques as someone who fancies themselves a Siskel and Ebert successor might do, nor do I feel it's worthless unless it teaches a lesson or seeks to reinforce an agenda. If you're that type as well....someone who just wants to be entertained without the need to dissect the picture to look for discrepancies, then you should enjoy this movie as well.\n\nJack is a successful businessman with a lovely home and family. It seems the only thorn in his side is his annoying sister, Jill, who comes annually to visit for the holidays. Adam plays both characters well in a way anyone with that type of dynamic with their own sibling can relate too.\n\nAs Jill Adam does display some crude humor that only a guy who is masquerading as a female could pull off, as any actual female who produced those scenes would either gain sympathy or disgust from the audience. (imagine Katie Holmes performing some of Jill's raunchier scenes and you'll get my drift). And Jill comes across as incredibly annoying at times, but to be honest that's perfectly okay because that is what Sandler was going for in the character and, frankly, what anyone who has a toxic individual in their family such as Jill could easily relate to.\n\nThe next time you're at home for a couple of hours and need a simple, silly distraction from a serious world, push Play on this movie. You'll be glad you did."

Of course, you wouldn't want to leave, for this is a brilliant masterpiece. The jokes are very cunning and fresh. This will keep you laughing all the way through and have that feeling of gratitude when you're finished. It'll last in your mind for days and make you want to see it again and again. Adam Sandler did a better job on this than 'Big Daddy'. I think 'Jack and Jill' might even reign over 'Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star'. This is a must-see and absolute joyous occasion. My rate: 10 STARS!! Bravo."

        "review_detailed_main": "Honestly I was afraid....a lot. Being a huge Sandler's fan, I didn't want to witness yet another faliure... I'm so happy I didn't read IMDb reviews before! I was very nicely surprised. C'mon guys, it is soo far from 3,5...Not long ago I watched That's my boy. I didn't like it... I love most of Sandler's stuff, Big Daddy, or even Click (different genre though).\n\nAl Pacino was a little weird but not hideous. Time to time he happened to be even funny. Yes, the taping kid was a little overacted (but sorry, I just couldn't help thinking: THIS IS THE KID OF USA, americanized poor Indian kid, doing whatever he wants to do. So I appreciated some self- irony there by Sandler, which he can do so nicely so often). It may have the charms of Spanglish. But overall the dialogues were GOOD, jokes flied here and there - somewhere lower somewhere higher.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can say is that I forgot MY world around....which is lately my biggest issue, films rarely happen to do the trick, to completely engage me and make me forget about my poor life for 1,5-2 hours. This movie jumped the bar.\n\nMy biggest criticism though: I can really see that throughout the movie Sandler was struggling when talking \"for himself\", the parts when he was talking with Jill, it was shot alone....I felt those parts artificial and not believable.\n\nAs a single woman - getting older and older - I could relate to the poor Jill, net dating...feeling lonely....I have been there. That part was really nicely done. What I appreciated, too, as usual the minor characters - as his assistant e.g. - were enjoyable, as well, great lines for them.\n\nI gave 9 .... but I admit it was because of my shock - I expected so much worse after seeing the trailer (I have been delaying watching the movie for so long). It is worth probably something like 6-7, but hey, I'm a true fan! Have fun...."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't believe all the negative cynical comments about a rather clever slapstick comedy similar to the type of movie which made Laurel and Hardy very famous all those years ago! It was great entertainment, funny, cleverly done with all aspects of interest for the viewer:- Animal antics, slapstick moments, clever dialogue and a family movie for all to watch together. There was even some moral messages; cant understand the comment about it having racial motives??!!!! The onslaught of negative comments have me entirely confused?! The story of twins, one a success the other not and getting together with all the family dynamics and comedy which follows, makes it a very funny with many moments of big smiles! Adam Sandler pulls off the movie well with Katie Holms doing a great 'straight' part as Adam's wife. The aspects of the children's 'oddities' was just part of the fun. The part of Adam's character twin sister was also played by Adam and was believable albeit she had masculine tendencies!!! Al Pacino was good as the besotted hopeful boyfriend of Adam's twin sister. All in all I feel this movie is well worth the watch, leaves you with a smile on your face and laughter in your heart - cant be bad! p.s. whats wrong with some toilet humour anyway, makes me laugh and much much less offensive than the torrent of foul language other movies expose us too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've never been a big Adam Sandler fan. I have difficulty identifying with or empathizing with the characters he portrays and generally don't find the subject matter of his films particularly interesting or compelling. I can't even remember much from the Sandler films I've seen, other than Jessica Biel undressing in \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\" and the pineapple gag from \"Little Nicky.\" But the good thing about this is that I was able to watch \"Anger Management\" a second time without feeling that I had heard the jokes before.\n\nI didn't expect to enjoy \"Jack and Jill\" in the least, but found myself laughing aloud quite often. Al Pacino is hilarious and there are some amusing cameos. Many of the supporting roles are well developed and Sandler is confident enough to work with talented co-stars and allow them to take some of the best lines, even in a bit with an actor complaining that a puppet in a Pepto-Bismol commercial has the better lines. Some of the physical comedy gags are a riot, particularly one in a weight room, one concerning a restroom valet and some of the dance steps. The denouement with Pacino is priceless.\n\nThis is not really a comedy about a successful man who must endure an annual visit by his uncouth, unsophisticated, uneducated passive-aggressive twin sister. It's a movie about a man who must learn to accept his fraternal twin who is very much alike him physically but very much different emotionally and intellectually, and whom everybody else seems to like despite the flaws that annoy him.\n\nThe dual Jack/Jill role is good for a couple of laughs and contributes to the theme of the movie, but also gives the movie an underlying creepiness that grated against my deeply ingrained homophobic tendencies. A common movie trope involves a character who cross- dresses and must fend off unwanted advances from suitors of the same sex and/or manage to pursue a love interest of the opposite sex while pretending to be the same sex, all for comedic effect. Here we have a male actor in the role of a female who attracts two ardent suitors. As the audience is acutely aware of the Crying-Game undertone, some of the scenes seem a bit creepy and test the limits of credulity. Jill is abrasive, physically unattractive and about as sexually appealing as the hand puppet seen in the Pepto-Bismol commercial.\n\nPersonally, I think the movie would have been much better without the dual role and with a female actress playing Jill. Sandler was never convincing as a female and I never believed the interest or fascination of the two suitors."

The humor in the movie is great, and anyone a fan of the hot chick, scary movie series, mean girls, the house bunny, and austin powers will probably enjoy what this movie has to offer. People have been saying that this is one of the worst movies Adam Sandler has ever written and starred in, I STRONGLY disagree. My family and I laughed through out the hole movie, and a picnic seen far into the movie had me and my grandmother in tears from laughing so hard. The movie starts off with Adam Sandlers' character Jack trying to make a great commercial for pepto bismal, and with his twin sister Jill arriving soon, more pressure is added to everything. There are many great scenes in this movie that even thinking back on them I burst out laughing. Even if you aren't a fan of twisted comedy that is not for children, the stars that are in this movie are worth seeing, such as Katie Holmes, Al Pacino, Adam Sandler(of course), Regis Philbin, Drew Carrey, and a brief appearance of David Spade at the end of the movie. All and all, Jack and Jill is completely worth your time if you are into this type of comedy, you may just find yourself laughing so hard you cant breathe!"

Then out of costume as a handler she was a b I t c h. My childhood ruined. Maybe having a bad day but just broke my heart. How the creation of this scene for the movie was a lot.
