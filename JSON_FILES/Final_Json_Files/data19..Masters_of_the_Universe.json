        "review_detailed_main": "So, this precious little gem, from the 80s, still remains a special gem in our minds. First of all, let me be clear, this is movie is bad, not the worst, but really bad and campy. I don't know how Cannon pictures took over the rights for this film, and how no other well-known, or larger studio didn't take the rights of something so popular. Really, He-Man and Masters of the Universe were quite popular and favorite show for kids (and to mention all that toys sales\u0085), but was it a good idea? Was it necessary? Even for the 80s?\n\nNow, the budget was ridiculously low, and the movie did not worked well at box office, but it has, even today, a loyal cult following. The story is funny, it's just a movie adaptation of some typical (not exactly) episode about a cosmic key that is wanted by Skeletor. Now, the story and directing, including script are cheesy, meant for kids of course, but when you get older, you realize how dumb that clich\u00e9d that was. They did not follow the original idea entirely, the characters do not look too much as themselves from the original TV show, they did not even put their original super powers, or special abilities, He-Man doesn't even have his Battle cat. So, that makes things disappointing. The acting is ridiculous, except maybe for Meg Foster\u0085 and of course Frank Langella\u0085 I'll talk about him soon enough.\n\nI have to admit that Dolph Lundgren was a pretty good choice for He- Man, but, the guy can't act, and he looks pretty much older and they never referred to him as \"Adam\". Meg Foster was good as Evil-Lyn and I think she was a good choice and she put some of her charm and poisonous sexiness to her character\u0085 I vouch for her. This was one of the first major roles of Courtney Cox, thought she did not tried that much, nor her character was all that developed. Her boyfriend Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill) was just ridiculous. Other actors as James Tolkan (who played a clich\u00e9 detective who waits his retirement), Neil Cypher (Man at Arms was not that special) was solid, Chelsea Field (Teela was not that much developed also, she was there to look good in her tight white battle-armor\u0085 ). I think that supporting actors as Bill Barty (who played Gwildor) was good. Though I also think that they made up this character, because they didn't have a budget for Orko. And also\u0085 Anthony Longinus was good as Blade, though he could do more fighting scenes with his character.\n\nNow, for Frank Langella\u0085 what to say\u0085 Everyone who studies acting, want to become an actor, or is already an accomplished actor\u0085 must swear to Langella's performance here. I think that Langella saved this film. He was easily the best actor in the film. So this is a prime example of good actor, overshadowing all other actors. He just steals the entire show and he was glad about it, because his sons wanted him to play Skeletor. And look at him, that is the actor who had so much fun with his character and that would be a good advice to other actors\u0085 just have fun with it. Just like for example\u0085 Raul Julia in Street Fighter (1994).\n\nThe costumes and make up were not entirely bad, but the costumes could have been better. They could make them to identify more with the TV show characters. The costumes of Skeletor's storm troopers were too generic\u0085 too usual. The interior and exterior of planet Eternia was bad\u0085 it was just bad and unimaginative\u0085 So most of the scenes were filmed on earth. There are also people who thinks that this movie has gay overtones and make jokes about it\u0085 Really, some people can't notice something far more important in the film\u0085 Overall, I do recommend this gem, because it's a good, family fun, of course not to take for granted. And, yes\u0085 watch after credits."

        "review_detailed_main": "On the planet Eternia, Skeletor (Frank Langella) and his dark army overthrow the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull (Christina Pickles) expecting to acquire her power. He-Man (Dolph Lundgren), his old friend Duncan \"Man-at-Arms\" (Jon Cypher) and his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field) are attacked by Skeletor's soldiers and they defeat them. They also rescue their prisoner, the inventor and locksmith Gwildor (Billy Barty). He explains that he was lured by Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) that used his invention Cosmic Key to open the gates and seize the Castle Grayskull. He-Man and his friends retrieve the prototype of the Cosmic Key trying to release the Sorcereress but they are defeated by Skeletor and his army and Gwildor uses his key to open and portal for them to flee. They come to Earth but lose the key. Meanwhile Julie Winston (Courteney Cox), who grieves the loss of her parents in a plane crash, and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan (Robert Duncan McNeill) find and activate the key, believing it is a foreign musical instrument. On Eternia, Evil-Lyn locates the Cosmic Key and Skeletor sends her with a group of mercenaries and soldiers to vanquish He-man and his friends and bring the key back. Will they succeed?\n\n\"Masters of the Universe\" is a silly but entertaining fantasy adventure film. The movie is a ripoff Star Wars, with the introductory credits rolling on the screen, the score and Skeletor's army, and Conan, with the strong Dolph Lundgren. The plot has silly moments, like Julie delivering the Key to her deceased mother or the comic attitudes of Detective Lubic. But \"Masters of the Universe\" is cult and entertaining for the fans. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Mestres do Universo \u2013 O Filme\" (\"Masters of the Universe \u2013 The Movie\")"

That may very well have been the problem; I knew everything that was wrong with it.\n\nThe only thing they got right were the portals, and those portals were used more often in She-Ra than He-Man. He-Man doesn't transform, Cringer/Battlecat is nowhere to be seen, Orco is nonexistent (instead there's just this hairy dwarf that wasn't in the cartoon). Most of He-Man's friends are gone, except for man-at-arms.\n\nMost of the movie is set not in Eternia but on Earth. I suspect this was to save money.\n\nWorst of all, Skeletor had lips! His lips actually moved and changed shape as he spoke! Since when does a skull have lips? Skeletor has a skull for a head, everyone knows that. And everyone knows that his jaw just goes up-and-down as he speaks.\n\nAgain, they decided it would be cheaper to cover a human with make-up then design a working skull for Skeletor. And it's not like it was impossible at the time, there were lots of horror movies made in the 80's, many of them had animatronic skeletons/zombies, or stop motion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hadn't seen this for 16-17 years and was hoping to be kind to it. I loved the old cartoon and toys when I was a kid, but this movie just does not have what it takes to be good in any way.\n\nFirst of all, the story is terrible. Bringing He-Man to the cheesy 80s United States was a major mistake that could not be overcome. I mean, where's Prince Adam and Eternia? All we ever see of Eternia are 8 guys in bad costumes looking up at a projection of Skeletor on a stage.\n\nThe plots of the cartoons were actually totally superior (which is sad).\n\nDolph Lungdren is big, but has absolutely no charisma as He-Man. The other characters are simply there for the sake of being there. There is no connection between characters that shows any emotion. Not so ironically the best acting comes from teenager Courtney Cox. She doesn't have good lines, but at least she comes across as sincere, which is a talent of hers.\n\nEvil-Lyn and Skeletor's mercenaries are completely wasted. Evil-Lyn does nothing other than continually walking onto scenes leading the drone troops.\n\nWe don't get to know any of these characters. In one of the many \"what could have been\" moments, Evil-Lyn puts an electronic choker around the teen boy's neck. The director stays on a dumb side-angle two shot of the two of them, when a good director at that moment would have gotten close-ups of them or of the device. We could then have seen the fear in the boy's eyes, or the glimmer of evil in Evil-Lyn's. Finally, when we do see a close-up it is way too late to evoke any emotion at all - the moment has passed. I could go on and on about such similar moments, but this is what distinguishes good directors from bad. Do you think Spielberg would have missed that moment?\n\nUltimately, the cheesy 80s decor, weak costumes, and awful opening titles also betray the film. Langella can't even save it with his hamming. It probably shouldn't have been made and came almost two years after He-Man's heyday of 1983-5. The effects were not able to do what was necessary and most of all, there are so many great characters from the toys and cartoons that are absent. Where's Stratos, Ram-Man, Trap-Jaw, Mer-Man, etc.??? Only Beastman, Teela, Man-at-Arms, and Evil-Lyn are here. What's worse is each is wasted."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have read a number of reviews on this movie and they are accurate and good for the most part. My credit is to Gary Goddard for all he endured and still getting a credible and succinct movie made.\n\nThe fight scenes are real and actual so they seem methodical but they're great. The hair, clothing, make-up, special effects, and down the list we go, is so caked in '80s gunk it would be hard to fight for this as a classic. It is the only He-Man movie out there, and although a sequel beckons, eighteen years have passed without a stir.\n\nIf a sequel were to made Langella would have to be Skeletor. I mean the best acting from both he and Lundgren comes when He-Man is being led by the Centaurian. Langella saying \"I give you a choice: return to Eternia with me as my slave and save their despicable lives, or perish with them here on this tasteless, and primitive, planet.\" It's cold and dark and it's authentic. It's chilling and you get chills. Langella overacts sometimes but mostly is great. He took Skeletor from a whiny, irritating, and downright pathetic worm of a guy to a believable, earthy, credible, and despicable evil-doer. We get a taste of the importance of He-man and all that he does, here in this scene, too.\n\nGoddard did something brilliant here, he made the movie personable. He puts these people on Earth, interacting with Earthlings, and putting a grasp on how out there these \"aliens\" are. But it is also probably why this movie is so widely disregarded, because it doesn't have great and illustrative fight scenes. Instead they are sensible and plotted. To see this movie remade could be a real treat.\n\nGwildar is, essentially, Orco. He was easy, sensible, irritating, but not nearly as annoying, and unfairly Billy Barty was nominated for a Razzie. The story interlocks with this missing \"key\" as created by Gwildar. This cosmos idea of God-like power through the manifestation of a fourth dimension is highly advanced. This is why the movie is good. Portals are doors and He-Man is definitely a science fiction adventurer. This puts an Earthy spin on an idea wiling out.\n\nTeela works and Man-in-Arms (Duncan) is good as a faithful sidekick to He-Man. That's what he is. He can hold his own but mostly is fighting for duty of right, and he follows He-Man for he is the epitome of it. Teela's gritty and pitched voice, with her desperate actions, are very formidable. Duncan is best when inspiring Kevin. Kevin is a sensitive guy with a talent. What these Eternians do is showcase pessimism on Earth for their planet is dying at their own hands. They are their own good and evil and it is hard to differentiate, so why care? By the end of the movie Courtney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill (Julie and Kevin) see that. So does Lubic. The Eternians have no planet and yet they continue to hold hope and forge ahead: He-Man.\n\nTolkan is not so much a distraction as he is pretentious. McNeill yelling to Tolkan \"Lubic this is for real\" as he dodges a Centaurian blast doesn't hold much weight, or reality. It is about unity, division, and strength. Both literal and figurative.\n\nMeg Foster is great as Evil-Lyn because she improves the movie rather than take time from Skeletor. Goddard lets most of the acting chops fall to the incomparable Frank Langella. He-Man is the ambassador of good. He is to talk slow, be level-headed, and search for justice. Lundgren does all of these things. He mission isn't to be malicious and blood seeking. When he runs into Julie (and a great fight sequence ensues) it is Duncan and Teela doing some leg work. He-Man is a protector. He'll abate killing Skeletor to keep any and all safe. In all honesty how many lines can you give someone? Someone suggested Brad Pitt as He-Man for a remake. I don't mind Pitt, but he would ham up the screen like some feel Skeletor did. Skeletor's was good, He-Man's would not be. Lundgren, in all honesty, is great. He has a mullet but looks the part, and contrary to popular belief, acts it. He wields the Sword of Grayskull gracefully, yet with force and some clumsiness. It's heavy, but he's well-skilled and versed in the sword. These oppositions are found in the Soceress. She would normally seem bad to us; however, she is the greatest power of good. Christina Pickles gives great lines of philosophy allowing for good banter and humor with Skeletor. And her love for He-Man is very evident and clear with solid acting.\n\nThe cartoon is hardly to be found here, aside from the characters and Eternia. Battle cat, and all other characters good and bad, could cloud a remake. But it would be great to see history revealed for He-Man like the new Batman series has done. People forget we like to see depth in our characters. And the character Charlie is filler, not unimportant, but certainly not integral. He's written well. All in all watch this movie because it's really, quite engrossing."

Dolph Lundgren is as unexpressive as usual, but at least he looks the part.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film came out in 1987 which was two years after the Transformers movie (the cartoon). It also came on two years after the last new episode of the cartoon was made. Basically, it pretty much was a done franchise when the live action adaptation hit the big screen. I was a fan of the cartoon, so I went to this film, but even at this young age I was not the fan I once was. Transformers took the mantle of my favorite cartoon. Still, I thought it would be cool to see a live action He-man, which I remember reading about in my He-man monthly magazine. What graces the screen is a mixed bag. You find yourself saying 'that is pretty cool' while at the same time going 'this really isn't much like the cartoon'. The film was released by Canon, which is odd mainly due to the fact they mainly released 'R' rated, over the top violence and bloody movies during this time. Here they release a children's film and do so with a rather large budget...over 20 million. They cast Dolph in the role of He-man and had a few other stars of note in what would be a doomed franchise in that it never made it passed the first initial film.\n\nThe story has Skeletor basically in charge. He has taken over Castle Greyskull, he has the sorceress in his evil clutches and he has He-man and his two allies Man-At-Arms and Teela on the run. So already it is nothing like the cartoon as I just do not remember any episodes where Skeletor was this ahead of the game. It is kind of like the Transformers film in that in that one the Decepticons were winning despite never really challenging the Autobots during the course of the show. It is also more forgiving here as this is a live action movie, independent of the cartoon, while the Transformers were a continuation of the show. Well He-man and company run across a little creature named Gwildor. I do think they should of just named him Orko and be down with it, cause that is obviously who he was in essence. Well this creature has a device that transports our gang from Eternia to Earth and thus Hollywood once again uses the trick of setting what should be a battle on a fantasy world to Earth. Earth, the place where sets are not as expensive. We also get these two teenagers who have drama in their lives, making me wonder, who the heck were these two characters trying to appeal to? Not me, or my friend as we both found their romance and storyline boring. Well there are battles aplenty and when the film is focused on the action it is pretty good.\n\nDolph is okay as He-man, he certainly has the looks. Still, he does not look at home in a child friendly film in costume. Frank Langella seems right at home though as the evil Skeletor and he does a commendable job. He also has the coolest scene in the film, where his giant throne like ship comes rising up behind our characters. The rest of the cast do okay, get rid of the two teens and their asinine sad plot and this film could of been great. Not saying we should not have an earthling for the gang to interact with, but not the girl from the Bruce Springsteen video! Seriously, were they trying to attract teens that would not want to see a He-man film in a million years or what? If they were looking to attract teen guys, all the simply had to do was put Teela in the costume she wore in the cartoon.\n\nSo basically the film has some good and some bad. A bit more good than bad. The film plays like other films like Star Wars and Krull with the added additions of the He-man and Skeletor characters. I do not understand the inclusions of the newer characters, because at this point the toy was finished so why not have more of the characters from the show. Why Gwilder instead of Orko? They at least had Teela, Man-At-Arms, Evilyne and Beastman, but those new characters were just lame. Well Sauron was cool and not in the movie for long. Karg and Blademaster were just embarrassing looking. The film though has some good action, between the melodrama and this film while not perfect did probably the best it could with the budget and the source material. Had the rights been bought by a bigger film company I am sure it could have done better. This film reminds me of the Dragonball: Evolution film, it too was released well after the show's popularity had fallen, only this one was not the failure it was, because even it followed the source material better than that film. So an okay action flick with some fantasy touches."

He-Man has always been something of an enigma, I loved this character when I was a kid, but looking at how cheap and retarded the 80's Filmation cartoon was I can't for the life of me figure out what was going through my head to actually come back for more.\n\nI do remember this movie from 1987, and thank God I'm not the only one that remembers a key fact that this movie's release year of 1987 was WELL AFTER the initial He-Man craze of 1982-'85. That clearly hurt the movie. If you were some 5 year old back then, you probably didn't care and loved the movie despite it's stupidty just because you were 5. Those of us that were a bit older remember that by 1987, shows like Knight Rider and A-Team were already canceled and off the air. And even the Transformers/G.I. Joe weren't very popular, to say nothing of the goofy He-Man cartoon. I was still very much a child in 1987 at around the age of 11 and 12, so I remember having the kid interest in this film. But it was also crushed with the newly developed pressure to \"act cool\" since I was heading into 7th grade and thus had to leave behind all my elementary school ways. A cheap ass made for 5 year olds movie like this was dreadful for the image of any pre-teen back then, despite the fact that practically everyone secretly yearned to watch it.\n\nThe film is packed to the hilt with all kinds of unintentional hilarity, and the campy, gaudy 80's flavor will leave you howling. Dolph Lundergon looks like he is in a European smut film with that fetishistic gay porno costume of his. Man at Arms and Teela have respectively cheap looking Halloween rental costumes, but Frank Langella really elevates this movie from bargain basement crap to cult status. Langella really steals the show as Skeletor, and the makeup is suprisingly effective. Yes this movie is stupid beyond belief, but it's about He-Man and it's from the 80's. So give it a chance, I'm 28 years old now and I'll still watch this movie for fun.\n\n5/10"

They transport themselves by means of a mechanism that creates a time hole to Earth in which nothing less the future of the universe is at stake . There they meet an intimate and youthful couple (Courney Cox , Richard Duncan). Meanwhile , Skeletor wants to get a chance by destiny to receive the powers of Grayskull . From a distant galaxy... they have come to Earth. A battle fought in the stars, now... comes to Earth. The live-action motion picture . Only the universe could hold adventure this big!\n\nThis is a medium-budgeted live-action rendition of the cartoon roles' feats in the \u00a8Star Wars\u00a8 mold and characterized by He-man , Skeletor and many others . All of them blended together with wonderful and terrific special effects courtesy of Richard Edlund and special designs by Moebius .\u00a8Masters of the Universe\u00a8 is basically a lot of spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement , full of sympathetic dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy . It features stunted and disjointed action, as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters partially fitting to the animated series . It includes abundant breathtaking images , which laboriously and mightily attempt to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look .\n\nAfter his nasty roles in in \u00a8Rocky 4 (85)\u00a8 and \u00a8A view to kill (85)\u00a8 , the Swedish muscle mountain Dolph Lundgren starred this film and followed by \u00a8Red Scorpion (90)\u00a8 and \u00a8Universal soldier (92)\u00a8 in his successful period during the 80s and early 90s . Lundgren has certain acting ability and charisma enough to play this kind of heroes . Based on cartoon and famous toys by \u00a8Mattei Inc\u00a8 that proved to be one of the biggest hits of all time . However , the characters and story may aim a little more at kiddies than teenagers and adults . For comical relief in charge of Billy Barty with his antics , sympathy and jokes . Other support actors giving enjoyable acting in brief appearances are as follows : James Tolkan , Meg Foster , John Cypher , Chelsea Field , and Christina Pickles as the imprisoned sorceress . The special effects are well made by the presitigious Richard Edlund , all they're cracked up to be and set a new cinematic standard for realistic realization . Action scenes have the zip and excitement you'd expect . The motion picture was well directed by Gary Goddard in his only filmmaking ; subsequently , he has dedicated to production and 3D . This would-be epic , surrounding the genres : \u00a8Sword and witchery\u00a8 and \u00a8Sci-F\u00a8results to be an entertaining and fun romp through space and time."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I Have the Power!\"\n\nFor those of us who grew up in the 80's, that phrase is all too familiar. Especially for those who would rush home after school to watch our favorite strongman face off against the forces of evil that threaten the safety and security of his homeworld. For my money, it was never better than when He-Man faced off against Skeletor for the struggle for Eternia.\n\nI also remember the fantasies that I and my friends would have of traveling away to that world of magic and fantasy, to fight alongside He-Man as he defends Grayskull. It truly was a series that was out of this world.\n\nAnd now it's on Earth.\n\nWhen I first heard about a live action movie, (mind you, I was twelve at the time), I was overly excited about it. But I didn't get to see it until my late teens. And I must say that it was very well done, especially in its presentation. In fact it brought back those far away childhood memories of those late afternoons in front of the tv, or outside with the toys a make-shift Eternia setting with my friends.\n\nI'll grant a few things that were wrong with the movie though. There were times that I think the script was either badly edited, or just too rushed at certain points. I'm also not thrilled about them being on earth, but understanding budget constraints and the idea to make these characters more real than fantasy help feed into that decision, so I let that one go. I would have also liked to see more of the characters from the toys in the movie, but have no complaints that they made up a few cool characters, like Blade.\n\nThe casting choices, I felt, were really good. Dolph Lundgren worked as He-Man, even though he can't act. He looked the part, and even pulled off the role. I could tell that he wasn't walking through the part, as many actor will do with character roles (right Mr. Clooney?). And Frank Langella the PERFECT choice for Skeletor. Langella managed to bring that character to life in a way that gave me chills. Skeletor is perhaps one of the greatest villains ever imagined, but the cartoon made him a cackling villain, who was more a buffoon than anything, therefore he didn't seem threatening. But seeing Langella make Skeletor more dark and evil put my faith back into the conviction as a great villain.\n\nYou don't have to be a die hard fan of the series to enjoy the movie. It's great fun, imaginative, and it captures a moment in time. Don't scrutinize the movie because it's different from the cartoon. Look at it for what it is, and don't focus on its faults. It had the power to recapture my imagination, so its not all that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "Cannon movie based on the popular toy line and cartoon series from my childhood. I should say loosely based, as it rips off everything from Star Wars to Flash Gordon, all the while borrowing precious little of worth from the He-Man mythos and purportedly being a tribute of sorts to Jack Kirby's New Gods. You could look at all those connections and say \"well this just sounds like a pile of awesome\" but you would be wrong.\n\nI hated this movie with a passion when I was a kid, mainly because it felt nothing like the He-Man I knew and more like some generic sci-fi action movie that had the Masters of the Universe name attached. But over the years I've grown to appreciate a lot of movies I didn't like when they were first released. And I do appreciate this more than I did then, but I'm still not ready to say it's a good film. Its value is in its badness, particularly Frank Langella's delightfully campy performance as Skeletor. Unfortunately he's not in the entire movie. The bulk of the film takes place on Earth with He-Man and friends running around with Courteney Cox and trying not to be killed by the goons Skeletor has sent after them. Most of this is just boring.\n\nOther than Langella, the cast is either adequate (Meg Foster, Courteney Cox, Jon Cypher, James Tolkan) or terrible (Billy Barty). Dolph Lundgren is wooden to the point that it makes his previous performance as Drago in Rocky IV seem like Hamlet. The budget is obviously very low and the costumes and special effects are cheesy. It's worth a look for fans of Cannon and He-Man. See it for the campiness and fast-forward to the Skeletor scenes."

It was done simply because they didn't have the budget to create Eternia, so instead of putting the idea to rest, they saw dollar signs and continued regardless.\n\nThere are so many things about this film that annoy me as a childhood fan of the cartoon. An example being the fact that Skeletor isn't a skeleton-man, he's a man wearing a rubber mask that has an image of a skull on it. What were they thinking? It looks cheap and ultimately insulting.\n\nIn short, avoid like the plague. If you're feeling nostalgic, get on the internet and hunt around for the original, animated series on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first watched this film in the 80's, as a child who was already a big fan of the franchise. I enjoyed the cartoon and I had a lot of the action figures and other toys. When I saw the film I was as happy as I was disappointed, before I go into that, and provide a review, let me tell you something about the film.\n\nA long time ago in a distant galaxy (sound familiar?), evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) is mounting an attack on Castle Greyskull, a fortress of goodness and power supreme. The castles protector, the Sorceress Christina Pickles), has been captured by Skeletor, and only He-Man (Dolph Lundgren), the sorceress's champion and defender of good could save the day. He-Man is currently fighting his way to the castle with the help of Man-at-Arms (Duncan) (Jon Cyper), and his daughter, Teala (Chelsea Field) - head of the kings guard. On the way to the castle they have an accidental meeting with Gwildor (Billy Barty), an inventor and locksmith. His invention, a cosmis key, has allowed Skeletor the advantage in his attack on Castle Greyskull, Skeletor is hunting him to prevent him from inventing something to rival the original invention, little does Skeletor know, he's already made a duplicate key. A fight ensues, and in order to save themselves; Gwildor uses the cosmic key and opens a gateway, taking the good guys to Earth. In order to return to Eternia, the good guys have to work with native Earthlings - Julie (Courtney Cox) and Kevn (Robert Duncan-McNeil), while trying to stop them; Skeletor has opened a gate too and sends his henchmen. Can He-Man and his friends get back to Eternia and prevent Skeletor from becoming the master of the universe?\n\nSo then, first of all this is a decent fantasy - if you forget that the characters are based on cartoons, which are ultimately based on toys. The plot isn't that taxing or complex which makes it easy for a younger audience to follow, which will be run of the mill though, and familiar to older audiences. Other than Dolph Lundgren's acting as He-Man, the rest of the cast are conceivable and deliver well - notable mention to James Tolkan as Detective Lubic for playing a wise cracking hardened detective well. The choreography is generally quite cheesy and predictable, but it doesn't look stupid. The musical score by Bill Conti is actually really good, and Gary Goddard as director manages to push the film thematically and as a motion picture spectacle in a decent direction. The problems arise when you have a vested interest as a fan. I remember sitting in the theater thinking that He-Man didn't look right or sound right, the other characters didn't look or sound right, some characters and technology were made up for the film and didn't previously exist, and some were completely omitted. There were Stormtrooper like armies that Skeletor commanded (new and made up), there were characters missing such as Orco and Battlecat (albeit, these two would have been hard to execute as CGI character in the 80's). In fact, it's fair to say, the characters and places which did exist originally were just name sakes rather than a filmatic duplicate of what fans had come to expect. Writing all this makes me sound like an old fanboy with a chip on his shoulder about this film, but I truly enjoy it, maybe it's just nostalgia that drives that enjoyment but it's definitely not the worst film ever.\n\nTo summarise, if you like fantasy films that look like a cross between Star Wars and Flash Gordon with a twist of Back to the Future technology, then you'll find some enjoyment in this. I've got to give it 7 out of 10, because \"I have the power\"... to award it that much ;) Enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "As a kid I was a big fan of He-Man. I owned many of the toys and played with them constantly. When this movie came out, I must have watched it dozens of times. Having caught it again recently and after watching it out of curiosity, I think it holds up quite well.\n\nThe story pretty much jumps right in, as in if you've seen Star Wars, any comic book movies, or are familiar with the original Masters of the Universe cartoon and toy line, you're supposed to be able to just get right into it and accept it. In the movie Skeletor (Frank Langella) gets his hands on a cosmic key, which can allow him to open portals and travel to other worlds. The inventor of the key, a little \"goblin\" named Gwildor, has also created another one. He partners with He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) and in an attempt to evade Skeletor, he opens up a portal to earth. He-Man and his team escape and eventually partner up with some humans, including a girl played by Courtney Cox, that stumble onto the key. A battle to protect the earthlings and to defend themselves against Skeletor and his army then ensues.\n\nSo the movie is cheesy for sure. Many of the gladiator-like costumes are not very impressive. The storyline is very basic and the script is also very unremarkable, with most characters being very one-dimensional. There's also not many surprises as you can pretty much tell how this movie will go.\n\nHowever, there are quite a few good things about the movie, especially given its low budget. For starters, the performances are quite good with the actors really buying into the story. Dolph Lundgren does a fine job as He-Man, even if he is a bit of a bore. Frank Langella is exceptional as Skeletor. He delivers the perfect balance of villany and humor. His mask could have been better, though. And Gwildor is a very amusing character with a great costume and with Bill Barty giving probably the second best performance in the movie. The special effects also hold up well. While there are no amazing spaceships, unique worlds, or elaborate space battles, the ground battles and shoot outs look as good as they did in Star Wars (even if this movie came out several years after). And although the costumes are unremarkable for the most-part, the make-up for the more alien-like creatures is terrific. The look and art and set design in the movie is also cool as it has its own unique atmosphere and interesting looking locations, sets, and lairs. Finally, the storyline is basic, but the travel with the use of the keys is an intriguing plot idea. This has been done countless times in movies like Back to the Future or in the Marvel movies (see Thor or The Avengers) since, and is very effective here. As is the interplay between earth people and He-Man's world.\n\nSo the movie is cheesy, but it is nowhere near MST3000 bad. It is actually executed quite well given how basic it is. The ideas that it has are actually effective enough even if they have had more of an impact in other movies. It has a good spirit and with an open mindset, Masters of the Universe can even be enjoyable. So it gets an extra point or two for good-natured fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "This was the premise of a classic toy line and the classic cartoon that emerged from it: When the planet Eternia-think a futuristic Camelot-comes under attack by the demon sorcerer Skeletor in an attempt to abscond with the mythical Castle Grayskull and thus conquer the universe, Prince Adam, teenage son of Eternia's King Randor and Queen Marlena, discovers that he has been chosen by destiny to bear Grayskull's power against all who would threaten Eternia's safety. By raising the enchanted Sword of Grayskull aloft and shouting \"By the Power of Grayskull,\" Adam is transformed into the superheroic swashbuckler He-Man, and proceeds to do battle with Skeletor...and to try and prove himself to his demanding father.\n\nFrom that premise, Filmation created a terrific cartoon that, even though it had its share of '80s cheese, was rich and complex, deftly mixing Arthurian legend with sci-fi. At its essence, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE was a coming-of-age story set against a high-tech sword and sorcery backdrop. As such, it had the makings of a great movie. Unfortunately, the low-budget Golan-Globus team (which destroyed SUPERMAN IV) got their hands on it, and we the viewers got cheated. The essence of MOTU was trashed; the Adam/He-Man duality and everything it entailed was tossed away. Several critical characters, like Randor, Marlena, Cringer/Battle Cat (Adam's pet tiger), and the like were ignored. And finally, 90% of the character and set designs immortalized by the toys and cartoon were changed as to be unrecognizable. Only Man-At-Arms, Skeletor, and Skeletor's lover/servant Evil-Lyn emerged on film as being visually recognizable as their cartoon counterparts.\n\nSo what did we get in return? We got a shameless, low-budget STAR WARS rip-off. Instead of the myriad beasts, demons, and cyborgs that Skeletor employed in the cartoon/toy line, we got three beasts and a bunch of armored stormtroopers. Instead of getting a He-Man who captured the feel of the character, we got a wooden Conan wannabe who relied more on laser guns than on his sword. Instead of a story that spanned Eternia and carried the appropriate sci-fi/fantasy feel of the series, we got a story that took place primarily on Earth, complete with a crabby cop and two ditzy teens. Instead of having a skilled, experienced director at the helm, we got unsteady, pedestrian direction from novice filmmaker Gary Goddard (whose day job was designing amusement parks). Sure, we got some excellent FX work, a great Bill Conti score, and a terrific Castle Grayskull throne room set, but we also got bad costumes, a stupid Grayskull exterior that looks like a pirate ship, a plotless script that's all noise and no depth, substandard fight choreography, and really bad acting. Only Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher), Skeletor (Frank Langella), and Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) are well-acted in this film; Langella's theatrical performance in particular is the film's saving grace, and deserved to be in a much better movie. Otherwise everyone else in the cast stinks. Dolph Lundgren is a perfect physical match for He-Man, but the guy can't act and his awkward Swedish accent has been the butt of fan jokes for years. Everyone else is just too vapid, too bland, and just too unsuited for the roles to be any good. This film needed to be a big-budget affair with top-rate actors and a script that followed the cartoon closely, not a STAR WARS wannabe that fails on most levels. THE BEASTMASTER with Marc Singer was far closer to the spirit of MOTU than this film (and Singer's Dar looked and acted far more like He-Man than Lundgren's hero did), and is a vastly superior movie. Pretty sad that the actual MOTU movie didn't even come close to matching that level, isn't it?\n\nTo be fair, I initially saw this film when I was 9 and enjoyed it, but over time I realized how weak it really was, and how it could have been so much more. While I don't HATE the film, I don't like it too much, either, and it hasn't aged well. This summer, Mattel will relaunch MOTU with a brand-new cartoon series and toy line that retells the story of Prince Adam/He-Man from the beginning. Hopefully, if Hollywood decides to make another go at a He-Man movie, they'll use the cartoon as the baseline and get it right this time. As it stands, the 1987 film is an OK way to kill a few hours, but as a He-Man film and as a fantasy film, it just doesn't cut it."

While the decision to place part of the story in 1980's suburban America, planet Earth, was no doubt a way to keep the budget low, the end result is still a lot of fun, and the main characters manage to stay pretty close to their original characters. Naturally, though, I'd loved to have seen some more of Eternia instead. Unfortunately, the promised sequel never came to be.\n\nFrank Langella is simply brilliant; his bigger-then-life portrayal of Skeletor may be different from what they did in the TV series, but it works great. He commands every scene he is in, and his performance is powerful yet subtle at certain moments. Wonderful! By the way, be sure to watch until the end credits are over...\n\nDolph Lundgren, while perhaps not quite the eloquent thespian Langella is, does make a formidable old-fashioned hero."

Although not following regular story line this film showed the rivalry between He-man (Dulph Lundren) who defends the secrets of Castle Greyskull and the protect the planet Eternia and Skeletor (Frank Langella) who tries to control all things including the Castle Greyskull. The story starts on there home planet of Eternia but ends up on earth due to the cosmic key which a local inventor designed to transport anywhere in the universe, but was stolen and used to get into Castle Greyskull and capture the guardian the sorceress this is where the battle begins. After recapturing the cosmic key Gweldor ended up having to open a portal door to escape Skeletor and his warriors. They ended up on earth but lost the key so they set out to finding the key. But Skeletor used a second key to follow. Two earthlings found the key and this is how Skeletor located the planet. They find the key had been taken to a music shop this is where the first battle on earth was. Evelyn disguised as the mother of the earthling steals the key back. Then He-man is captured to save the rest. The rest end up using the damaged key with a keyboard to get the required notes to get back home. This leads to the final battle between He-man and Skeletor, this is where Skeletor falls down one of the pits within the castle. The Sorceress is freed from the ageing spell then helps the earthlings back home."

        "review_detailed_main": "War has broken out on the planet Eternia and the evil Skeletor has taken prison the Sorceress of Greyskull castle in the hope of capturing her powers, so he can rule Eternia and finally the universe. Though leading the resistance is He-man and small group of freedom fighters. They rescue Gwildor who has created a device called the cosmic key that Skeletor could use to move between galaxies. To escape the overwhelming forces, He-man and his friends are transported to Earth. Two earthlings stumble across the key and soon find themselves caught in between a universal battle of good and evil.\n\nThis one definitely brings back mixed memories. I loved the TV cartoon series of He-man and collected the toy figurines (which the movie is based on) when was a young kid. So naturally when the movie came out, there was no doubting that I wouldn't go out and see it with my father. \"Masters of the Universe\" was actually the first film I saw at the cinemas and the only time I ever walked out of one. Firstly: Skeletor and his minions totally freaked me out. Call me a wuss, but loved how they were represented as bumbling villains in the cartoons. Secondly; I didn't particularly get into the serious direction it went for and the whole mythology the cartoon series drew up was severally lacking. The magic and humour was nowhere to be seen on this live feature length presentation.\n\nThis was my third viewing of it and I still found it to be an averagely uninspired and bloated clunker that somewhat resembles that of a \"Star Wars\"-\"Flash Gordon\" hybrid. If it wasn't for Frank Langella's theatrically imposing portrayal as the malevolently power-hungry Skeletor and a lusciously icy Meg Foster as the vindictively sly Evil-Lyn (Yep, I don't mind how viciously wicked they are now). This would have just been another forgettable fantasy fodder.\n\nThe costumes and make-up (especially Skeletor's mercenaries) do look vividly striking and convincing, but the variably dazzling special effects with its pyrotechnics light show and grand scale treatment became dreadfully cheesy, but I guess this made it mildly fun and diverting. The budget is reasonably minor and you can honestly tell, despite with its striking set designs for Eternia and this is why most of the story takes place on earth. Director Gar Goddard does quite an generic job with David Odell's scratchily rapid screenplay (with an uncalled for sappy conclusion), but the speedy story does have its moments and Goddard generates a couple exciting flashes of creative gusto. This is mostly when the villains are on the screen or when James Tolken's slightly humorous Detective Lubic gets caught up in the mayhem. The script is singly minded, but there a few risible lines delivered with strenuous conviction by Langella. The glistening gold Dolph Lundgren looks the part and does the action scenes quite well, but he does provides nothing but a monotonously laconic performance. Courtney Cox's debut film role is nothing spectacular, but reasonable. John Cypher as Man-at-arms and Chelsea Field as Teela provide sound contributions. Robert Duncan McNeill's rabbit in the headlights performance is pretty weak and Billy Barty very much annoys as Gwildor. Bill Conti's corny and grand sounding music score is easily influenced by \"Star Wars\" musical score and I got that feeling it tweak around with the \"Superman\" one too.\n\n\"Masters of the Universe\" is a weird live-action cartoon that's full of hiccups, but with its overblown nature and fast pacing it amuses without much fuss."

It's an enjoyable romp right through with some good set-pieces, rousing 80's style action and a brilliant He-man in Dolph Lundgren, who fits the role to a T. But, of course, the actor who really boosts this film a few notches is Frank Langella, who literally eats up the screen. His portrayal as Skeletor eschews the whininess of the cartoon Skeletor, and delivers a gargantuan performance that oozes real menace and an evil mind.\n\nMasters of the universe rips off a bit from Star Wars and isnt totally faithful to the cartoon, but it still an enjoyable romp that,unlike a slew comic book film adaptations of today, doesn't take itself seriously."

Even with a final cut delivered by the woman who edited 'Laurence of Arabia', like 'Star Wars' it goes on a bit, but at least is minus all that pompous Force talk (although in Gwildor it almost creates a 'funny' creature as annoying as Jar Jar Binks).\n\nUnusually but inexpensively it's mostly set on present day Earth (hence the drab backdrops to most of the action and the nasty mullets the men wear) and a couple of times a character has the temerity to declare this is real life we're talking about here. The visitors from space, however, show that they hail from a more advanced civilisation by finding the eating of meat gross. Definitely a carnivore is Meg Foster's Evil-Lyn; grievously underused and deserving a film of her own."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not really a comic connoisseur. It was only when I read about this film that I realized that the characters had been taken from that literary universe and from a line of action toys created by the American company Mattel. This is something that helped me to understand the sheer confusion and goofiness of this film, which I think only toy fans will truly appreciate.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is the cast. There are some very respectable actors here, and their commitment and talent is remarkable, raising the quality of a cheesy movie quite a bit. Frank Langella's involvement is particularly good. He gave life to the great villain, a being called Skeletor, who looks like Darth Vader in the day he decided to go to Halloween dressed as Death. The character himself isn't impressive, he's a huge clich\u00e9 without any intimidation ability, but Langella is really enjoying and having fun with this work. On the opposite side is Dolph Lundgren, a herculean and apparently invulnerable young man who came out of the world of combat sports, who doesn't know how to play and has the dramatic qualities of an avocado, but who manages to respond to what is asked of the character. Meg Foster, the proud owner of one of the most beautiful pairs of eyes of her time, has a charisma of her own and does a very good work.\n\nBut let's be honest, is anyone going to see a movie just for the cast? I do not think so. It's a good argument, but it doesn't take anyone to the theatre by itself. Does the movie have anything else? Do you have qualities? Is it really worth it? There are audiences for all types of cinema, including kitsch, trash and B cinema. The proof of this is the success of some films that would never convince a person with the least amount of good taste. Therefore, I believe that lovers of \"oily sci-fi\" will be delighted with this magnificent piece of cheese with a very characteristic taste of the 80s. We have everything: stilted action scenes, choreographed like a Russian ballet, extraordinarily cheap special effects, \"DIY\" level, a very poor script, characters reduced to sketches, dialogues more melodramatic than a Mexican soap opera, crude make-up (Langella's mask is particularly bad) and many laser shots, in the golden age of lasers and neon. One last word for the soundtrack, bloated and arrogant like a 16-year-old on steroids."

        "review_detailed_main": "Just as some movies that should be great turn out to be awful, some movies that should be awful turn out to be great - Masters of the Universe. Unfortunately, for a film that's based on a cartoon that today's 20-somethings used to watch in the 1980's, none of the said 20-somethings are going to admit to liking it now. Few will give it a chance and realize the direction is good, the acting is good, the music is good, that it's exciting, funny, scary, suitably epic and absolutely action-packed and that it looks fantastic. But Superhero Cinema does. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was a hugely successful mid-80's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The success of each fed the other, as well as a popular comicbook and loads of other merchandise. Finally in 1987 came the big one: the motion picture.\n\nWhat looks like suicide at first glance - converting a cartoon based on action figures into a full-length feature - gets more appealing when you look at thes ource material closer. The cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and sci-fi, with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. It also has a very mythic feel, mixing Ancient Greece-era monsters and challenges with fairy tale locations.\n\nThere are also hordes of exotic characters - warriors, mutants, monsters, magicians of every description, so the film makers could pick the coolest ones to bring to the screen. The ones they've chosen are He-Man and his arch enemy Skeletor (obviously), amazon-type female warrior Teela and her dad Man-At -Arms, the Sorceress of Grayskull, Skeletor's second in command Evil Lyn (which is always pronounced 'Evil-In'), and Beastman. Added to these are four characters that were created for the film - Gwildor, a dwarf-like inventor, Karg, a cross between Captain Hook and a bat, snake-like Sauron, and Blade, a sword and knife-obsessed slaphead. So that's eleven fantasy characters running about, which is a pretty good total.\n\nMasters of the Universe succeeds because it takes the cartoon and adapts not it's superficial qualities, but it's essence into a movie, turning it into a mature sci-fi/fantasy adventure. This is where so many comic and cartoon based movies fail. They don't adapt their source material properly to make a successful feature film. You need to make the movie a natural progression from what it's based on, altering the look enough so it looks acceptable in real action, altering the characters into real people, choosing actors who can give real performances. It's not simply dressing superstars up as characters from a comic or cartoon, it's re-imagining the ideas as a movie. MotU does this perfectly. You can fault it as a film itself, of course, but you can't fault it as an adaption.\n\nThe production design is superb, with some superbly realized sets and costumes. Everything has been adapted to look more realistic on the big screen. The cast give uniformly decent performances. Nobody lets the side down - these are all 3D characters, not cartoons. Dolph Lungren proves he's one of the European bodybuilder brigade who can act. Frank Langella gives an outstanding performance as Skeletor, his powerful presence almost bursting out of the TV and into your living room. Langella gives a shining example to all actors portraying comicbook and cartoon characters in live action. There is a pervading sense of dread whenever he appears, especially during Castle Grayskull sequences, and the script gives him some awesome lines which he delivers with pure evil dripping from his voice.\n\nThe monsters are pretty bloody scary, especially for a family film, especially the Beastman (who's had a 'the' added to his name). The sequence where they invade a school gym and chase Julie around it is excellent, far more exciting and scary than similar chases in many horror films (including some of those Courtney Cox has been in). It's also, like the rest of the film, surprisingly violent, as the bad guys attack Julie with swords, claws, laser guns and high velocity darts. That she manages to escape is not unbelievable at all, because of the way the chase is staged - it's just a relief she gets out of there, the goal of any such chase scene. The sheer ammount of bad guys that the small band of heroes has to face adds greatly to the drama.\n\nSetting half of the movie on Earth has it's advantages and disadvantages. It does give the film a human component, and two ordinary teenagers to be pulled into the adventure with. It also makes the monsters scarier - rather than being in a distant galaxy, they are in the neighbourhood, viciously attacking people and destroying whatever they come across. On the other hand, it would have been cool to see some more of the war torn Eternia and the planet's weird inhabitants and locations, but MotU had a relatively small budget, so that sort of stuff was off limit anyway. A little too much time is spent on the almost soap-opera angle of Julie and Kevin, but it helps flesh out their characters to make them believable.\n\nMotU is also packed with action, and we do mean packed. There is an outbreak of violence every 15 minutes or so, usually even less, and there is variety and imagination among the content, unlike many action films, which consist of repetetive shoot outs and nothing more. It could possibly be said that it's quantity over quality, as some of it, particularly the shoot-outs, are badly filmed, and none of the action ever reaches adrenalin pumping. However, it's good enough, in-yer-face and quite exciting to watch, with He-Man taking out hordes of bad guys with his sword, laser beams everywhere, mass destruction and some good old rough and tumble. And all the action grows organically from the story - none of it seems put in simply because the movie needed an action scene at a certain point.\n\nOne of MotU's greatet assets is it's atmosphere. The sense of an intergalactic civil war is tangible, as is the sheer menace of the villains, the desperation of the good guys, the growing sense of doom as Skeletor captures the Cosmic Key. There is a cower-behind-the-sofa scariness similar to that of TV's Doctor Who.\n\nIf Masters of the Universe was re-released at cinemas this summer, people would realize how good it is compared to the blockbuster summer fare we get these days. And all for $17m, which was hardly anything, even in 1987."

        "review_detailed_main": "I suppose it does make a difference if one is like this viewer and loved the Mattel toys and the animated series as a child, so visiting this vintage big screen treatment is appealing enough to the kid that's still inside me who would have just lapped up something like this had he caught it when it first came out. I always thrilled for my dad to rent the tapes of the series. Now, of course, as an adult I can't help but laugh hearing something like \"I HAVE THE POWER!!!!!!!\", and see this as a very cheesy, silly affair, but again, it was meant for kids of the era and is still very likable.\n\nAppropriately cast Dolph Lundgren is He-Man, battling with associates Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher) and his daughter Teela (Chelsea Field) against the forces of cackling, demonic bad guy Skeletor (the great Frank Langella, unrecognizable under the mask). Skeletor desperately needs to get his hands (or should that be bones?) on a \"cosmic key\" devised by lovable imp Gwildor (Billy Barty); said key opens dimensional \"doors\" and transports various characters good and bad to Earth, where they raise all sort of hell in their battles, and two teen lovers, Julie (a young Courteney Cox) and Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill of 'Star Trek: Voyager') get caught up in all of it, along with a flustered detective (James Tolkan).\n\nThe movie is quite easy to take from start to finish, with pacing that doesn't falter, lots of colourful visuals and effects, a score by Bill Conti automatically calling to mind John Williams' work for \"Superman\" and \"Star Wars\", and entertaining characters, although the villains definitely fare better than the heroes; Langella is commanding as Skeletor, and Meg Foster likewise delicious as Evil-Lyn. The four henchmen dispatched by skull face are an amusing bunch, especially the Beastman who looks rather like the character Alph from the futuristic action / exploitation flick \"Turkey Shoot\". But for this viewer, what makes this as much fun as it is, is the ass kicking character of Detective Lubic; Tolkan is hysterical in the role.\n\nA nice diversion overall, with a funny surprise for anybody who sits through the closing credits.\n\nSeven out of 10."

The only thing standing in his way is the scantily clad, pec-packing, tiger steadless He-Man, played here by the Scantilynavian action star Dolphin Lundgealot. We are not sure where Skeletor's hatred for He-Man comes from, but it could be due to He-Man's muscular physique and his penchant for showing it all off in an outfit for which there is no coat hanger while Skeletor covers up all skin except for his hideous face. It could be He-Man's beautiful blonde mullet that constantly reminds Skeletor that he has no follicles. Anyway, the plot... What sets things in motion is none other than a ginger dwarf with a warp whistle. With the exception of He-Man, there is no other tool that Skeletor would rather get his hands on. But Gwildworf, along with He-Man and friends take a cosmic cruise to the most boring part of Earth where they land in sub-bordemite America. Skeletor has his own personal army of Darth Vaders but he chooses instead to send a \"curious quartet\" of ass kickers to retrieve his precious. There's Blade who is a cross between Shredder and a pirate. Sarad, a reptilian relative of Mortal Kombat's Cyrax, I think. The Beastman who seems to have a bit of cowardly lion in him. Then there's Karg, imagine the Grinch had a baby with Joan Rivers and it came out with a silvery mane of hair and a desire to be an intergalactic Napoleon. Unfortunately, Skeletor's A-team get little chance to let their mercenary skills shine as He-man proves formidable. But the saga isn't over as Skeletor has more tricks up his sleeve. Watch it! Love it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If it wasn't for the ultimate in sci-fi cheese-fest aka Flash Gordon in 1980, then Masters of the Universe would rightly hold the title. However, second place isn't bad. And nor is the film either.\n\nIf you're looking for Oscar-worthy performances, big-budget special effects and great character development then look elsewhere. This is NOT Avatar.\n\nWhat this is is a tale loosely based on the classic eighties figures of He-man and co. On the planet of Eternia, the evil Skeletor is trying to take over the universe and it's up to He-man and his furry underwear to save the day. Of course this involves a trip to Earth to the only place in the world where no one takes any notice of large muscular men wielding swords in their Y-fronts.\n\nIt's very daft and you won't know whether to laugh or cry. But it's still enormous fun. It may not have the budget of the acting performances of Lord of the Rings, but with Lord of the Rings, you couldn't really cheer loudly for the characters as well as you can with Masters of the Universe.\n\nThis is fun for all the family (especially if you were either a young boy in the eighties - like me - or simply someone who can appreciate cheesy movies for what they are - also me). Don't take this too seriously - it was never meant to be that way. Just put your brain on hold and enjoy the silliness of the ride.\n\n(Oh, and did I mention there's a very young Courtney Cox to see, long before the start of Friends!)"

        "review_detailed_main": "A twisted exercise in wish fulfilment and post-bereavement fantasy in which Courtney Cox gets a chance to resurrect her dead parents killed in an air crash one year previously, aided by extra-terrestrial warriors whom have dominion over time and space. Director Gary Goddard fashions a disturbing dissection of grief and guilt in which Cox's Julie constructs a hyper-real fantasy world - an uneasy profusion of pop cultural artifacts (Star Wars, Children's Dolls and Action Figures) and the symbolic projection of repressed desire, particularly with regard to the device of the 'cosmic key'. It is both a literally employed narrative device to allow the visitation from Eternia, the alien world of Julie's dreams, and the restoration of her family in whose death she feels complicit but facilitates structures of fantasy in which Julie's need for escapism from her grief and the ability to alter the past become manifest in technology. The technology doesn't exist of course hence the need for Cox to invent her otherworldly heroes but also we become aware of the need the Cox character has to address the role that transport technology played in her parents death. Just as the plane killed them and blew their fragile bodies into millions of blooded and metal infused bits, David Odel's script suggests that an even more advanced instrument of transport can bring them back to life. The visitors themselves are supermen and animal like creatures, perfectly divided into easily coded forms of good and evil and subsequently a complexed play of light and dark is played out between 'He-Man' and Skeletor' in which the character's narcissistic identification with the conflicting emotions she feels surrounding her guilt complex are personified in an on screen war between these alien visitors. This might be an easy enough paradigm from which to judge the thematic and formal conventions employed in Masters of the Universe but the film itself provides more questions than it answers. What are we to make of the boyfriend Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeil) who is viciously beaten by the 'beast man'? As the narrative takes place in Cox's mind, characterisations of friends and partners are unreliable. McNeil is an idealised conception of ideal partner who is of course an extension of her dead father, namely supportive, loyal and alive. His vicious beating however suggests that in the midst of her catharsis revenge fantasies are being played out, the beast man the personification of rage and barely concealed contempt. The only conclusion is that McNeil's boyfriend has beaten his girlfriend in reality and probably subjected her to indecent sex acts and psychological torture. If his on screen personality is an idealised opposite then in reality he has propagated the notion that Julie killed her parents by choosing not to go to the lake with them that weekend. Furthermore the decaying father made flesh, i.e Skeletor (Frank Langella) compounds this notion by punishing her culminating in a physical attack that recalls the spectre of rotting decrepitude in her parent's burnt corpses. Ultimately then this is a children's film in which death, torture and suffering walk hand in hand with schizophrenic hallucination and Bill Conti. It's either the greatest diatribe on loss in modern cinema or an offensive mish mash of half-baked psychological projection and the Reganite culture of fear. Which is it? You decide.\n\nSome good special effects."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a classic confrontation between good and evil, and a struggle to save the Universe from the dark side, when a villain rises up and threatens all who oppose him with slavery or destruction in the 1987 offering `Masters of the Universe,' directed by Gary Goddard. The evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) has captured the good Sorceress of Castle Greyskull (Christina Pickles) and is awaiting the moment when the Moon is at it's zenith, at which time he will be able to absorb all the powers of the cosmos and become Master of the Universe and omnipotent Ruler of their land, Eternia. But everything is not yet right; though he has the Sorceress in his clutches, his formidable opponent and champion of the people, the indomitable He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) is still at large, and Skeletor knows he must bring him to his knees if he is to succeed. Besides which, the `Cosmic Key' that will make it all possible for him is not yet in his possession. So his task is two-fold: He must enslave He-Man and find the Cosmic Key in order to effect his plans. And the secret of the Key lies with the peaceable locksmith and inventor, Gwildor (Billy Barty), a trusting soul, who betrayed by the beautiful Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) has gone into hiding. Now it's up to He-Man to foil Skeletor and save Eternia and the Universe from his unscrupulous grasp and restore power to the Sorceress and Castle Greyskull.\n\nThough the make-up, costumes and special F/X are a bit cheesy, and overall the acting is bad, Goddard has put together a movie that is fun and exciting, and by lightening up on the menace has made it accessible to the whole family, including the younger set-- and, of course, since it's based on the children's animated TV series, it's just what you would expect, or should I say, hoped for, going in. Goddard moves it all along at a crisp pace, never allowing it to get bogged down unnecessarily, and the ideals and principles to which the story adheres-- loyalty, honesty, trust, love of family-- all make this a worthwhile endeavor and a film to embrace. Call it a poor man's `Star Wars' (from which it draws heavily, with the plethora of laser blasts and the ersatz `storm troopers' of Skeletor's army); the scale, perhaps, is not nearly as grand, but the sense of adventure and the overall feeling of Lucas's monumental film are certainly present.\n\nHidden behind the bony skull mask, Langella brings Skeletor to life with flair, successfully conveying the evil at the core of his soul. This is a creature cloaked in darkness, ruthless and intimidating, effectively sinister, but less daunting than say, Darth Vader. He's scary, but it's not a character that's going to drive the little ones out of the room shrieking in terror. Langella makes him a fun kind of evil presence, which keeps it upbeat and creates the necessary sense of evil without taking the viewer to the brink of despair or bad dreams. It allows that unsettling feeling within an atmosphere of hope, and the realization that in the end all will be well in Eternia. It's a strong performance by Langella, and without question the best in the movie.\n\nAnother good performance is turned in by Meg Foster, as Evil-Lyn, Skeletor's right-hand woman. Like Langella, Foster manages to convey evil without too much menace, and few actors have such absorbing, riveting eyes, which she uses to great effect here. With her flowing cape, meaningful stride and a glance from those mesmerizing eyes, Foster makes Evil-Lyn a force to be reckoned with; she's a formidable opponent for He-Man, and one of the most memorable characters of the film.\n\nAs He-Man, Lundgren certainly looks the part, which is no doubt what put him in the role to begin with. But can he act? Let's just say this is a fantasy, and as such, what Lundgren brings to the part is good enough. When he raises his sword and exclaims, `I have the power!' it's a rush; He-Man lives-- embodied by Dolph Lundgren, and for this movie, it works.\n\nFans of the TV series `Friends' will be interested in seeing the young Courteney Cox (twenty-three when this movie was filmed) here in her motion picture debut. As Julie Winston, a high school girl who unwittingly gets drawn into the fray, she comports herself well enough, though her performance is a far cry from anything that would earn an Oscar nomination. She does make Julie believable, however, which is the important thing. Again, this is a fantasy, and as such it doesn't take a lot to keep you in the story. Suffice to say that Cox has come a long way since making this one.\n\nJames Tolkan, on the other hand, does not fare as well as some of the others here. A talented character actor, he nevertheless gives an embarrassingly bad performance as Detective Lubic. A stereotype if ever there was one, Tolkan still can't seem to get a handle on who Lubic is or where he fits in. This is a role just about any actor could've walked through without missing a beat, but Tolkan manages to muck it up so badly he becomes a distraction at times. It may have been a case of trying to make too much out of something that simply wasn't intended to be anything other than what it was; and it's understandable that as an actor Tolkan would want to make the most of what he was given. In this case, however, it was unnecessary, and just didn't work.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Jon Cypher (Man-at-Arms), Robert Duncan McNeill (Kevin) and Barry Livingston (Charlie). Enjoyable family fare, `Masters of the Universe' may not be the best movie of all time, but it is what it is and offers a fun and satisfying evening's entertainment. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10."

As we were to see afterward, with wasted projects like Lost in space key things that made the cartoon entertaining only appeared once if at all. He-Man's classic line \"I have the power!\" is only said once or twice, and there isn't battle cat (probably due to lack of funds) It is a shame that the film will probably never be re-released on video or appear on DVD, as it is one of my favorites.

No, but it makes for great entertainment . You get Dolf Lundren with a mullet wig, a gnome wearing a Haiwain shirt eating fried chicken , laser guns, sword fights, a teenage Corteney Cox, keyboards ,bad acting. To put it over the top, Frank Langella not only has the worse makeup job ever. As Skeletor he overacts like his life depends on it .

Frank Langella plays skeletor to perfection (even if the makeup is a little obvious) and billy barty is a nice addition to the overall cast.

After the success of the Star Wars toy line from Hasbro, the industry began a series of fantasy toy lines that used the 30 minute Saturday morning cartoon as an advertising tool. This led to famous toy's/cartoons such as Tranformers, Thundercats et al (there are way too many to list in this review. I believe the first of these was the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which hawked a band of sword-and-sandal-like fantasy characters, in a world called Eternia.\n\nThe cartoon and toy line were incredibly successful, and whilst as an adult, my cynical side sees the enormity of this exploitative marketing, as a child I was totally sucked in. With the unbridled achievement of cynical marketing, it was only a matter of time before the Hollywood machine would take the buff character of He-man and immortalise the c**t on screen.\n\nThe 1980's also saw an increase of over sized muscle-men on the big screen. This was of course reflective of Reagan's politics of big-is- good etcetera. So with such a low-rent project, the film needed a pretty low-rent, muscular \"actor\". I'm guessing that even Schwarzenegger and Stallone were too good for this film, as the actor chosen to play the homo-erotic, buff-dunce He-man was Dolph Lundgren, another of the increasingly large action stars of the decade.\n\nThe story involves a set of keys that can open a portal to other worlds/dimensions, and He-man's evil foe, Skeletor (Frank Langela) obviously wants the set. During a battle in Snake mountain, the hero's are forced to go through a portal where they find themselves in contemporary America, and take on the help of a native, Julie (Courtney Cox).\n\nThis derivative, insipid film is just awful. The action is more than likely placed in a Earth-bound setting for budgetary reasons. And to be fair, even if this was not the case, it would probably be just as s**t. I did see this at the cinema at the time, and probably liked it. But seeing this as an adult just makes me realise that there was an abundance of genuinely awful movies in the decade of greed.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "I grew up watch the animated He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoons during the 80's, and I was a huge fan. I also loved the 2002 re-birth of the Masters of the Universe series. Heck, I even got a tattoo of He-Man (from the 2002 series) covering most of my back), that is how much a fan I am.\n\nBut this movie. Wow! It was terrible in so many ways. It should never have been associated with the Masters of the Universe franchise. Not that I got anything against Dolph Lundgren - he have some fairly adequate movies to his name. But this movie was a gloveslap to the face of fans and an insult to He-Man.\n\nThe movie is not bad in itself, if you distance it from the He-Man story. Had this movie been totally unassociated with Masters of the Universe it would have been acceptable.\n\nI remember when I was young and this movie came out, it killed off He-Man for me for a long, long time. But then thankfully I got over the crap that is this movie, and then were blessed when He-Man came back, mightier than ever in 2002.\n\nThis movie should be watched as a sci-fi adventure movie, and try not to associate it with the Masters of the Universe story. You might just set yourself up for a major disappointment."

From the start it feels like the entire thing is going to be cringeworthy, but it really builds and genuinely draws you in until the end. Although Lundgren as He-Man is the lead, it is not a one-man show, screen time is split fairly equally across half a dozen characters and it never feels like there is a true central character.\n\nA victim of 80s special effects (which are truly awful), taccy costume choices bar a few (I'm looking at you Saurod, who looks brilliant) and poor make up (Skeletor's skull is very fleshy), these things all eventually add into the atmosphere and support the enjoyment. The costumes actually grow on you, although some remain downright daft. Acting isn't too great, and there really isn't any comic relief which is odd for this kind of film, but it's entertaining until the end. Stick with it, but don't expect too much."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of my biggest disappointments as far as movies go. Having grown up with He-Man, I watched the film with hope, but, despite not having seen the cartoon for a number of years before I watched this on VHS, I still spotted the gaping holes. No Battle-Cat, no Orko (not that I really missed him - never liked Orko) and since when was He-Man permanently He-Man? What happened to Adam?\n\nDolph Lundgren's He-Man was just perfect as far as physical resemblance goes. Just like Arnie in the Conan movies, you had no trouble believing he was the main character. But unlike Arnie, whose acting weaknesses actually came across as social ineptitude on Conan's part and enhanced the image, Dolph's acting and accent ruined any credulity he had as He-Man.\n\nDespite being set on Earth (no budget for Eternia, apparently) the film is saved primarily by James Tolkan's character, Det. Lubic, a cop with an attitude. I ended up watching it more for him than anything else. Basically it's the same character he played in Back to the Future.\n\nBilly Barty reprises his village wizard role from Willow here, albeit with more make-up.\n\nInteresting to see Robert Duncan McNeill here. He later went on to play Tom Paris in the Voyager series.\n\nApart from the unforgiveable liberties taken with the source material (at least it's not as bad as Dungeons and Dragons!) the film's biggest letdown was Skeletor. Oh. Frank Langella plays the part well enough, but I'm referring to the rubber skull mask he wore. It was just so lame and obvious. And since when did Skeletor have eyeballs anyhow?\n\nA pretty poor movie overall and something only the youngest fans will enjoy due to the extreme low budget and lack of understanding of the materiel on the part of the producers, writers and director."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you were going to produce a children's action-fantasy movie would you really risk your money by casting as the lead a man with the charisma of a bag of sugar?\n\nHaving said that, Dolph \"even Keanu has a greater screen presence\" Lundgren does try really hard, and is still miles better than his dreadful co-stars, Frank Langella excepted. Jon Cypher is particularly uninspiring as Man-at-Arms. Maybe they make films like this to take it easy on the Oscar Academy.\n\nBased on a popular cartoon series/toy figure range, the film naturally expands its audience by downplaying the more eccentric (expensive?) looking characters (We get Teela but not Orco or Ram-Man, Evil-Lyn but not Triclops or TrapJaw) and setting the vast majority of it on Earth. This cheap scrimping even writes out the popular Battle Cat. New character Gwildor (Billy Barty) has two dual functions - one is as blatant plot device and font of all exposition, the other is to irritate you s***less.\n\nBeing derived from an already pretty vapid cartoon series, the film even blands it out further, with a mawkish, tritely sentimental end and a predictable plot. \"It's not her you want, it's me. It's always been between us,\" says He-Man (Dolph) to Skeletor (Langella) at one point. While 'tor, for his part, wants He-Man kneeling before him with his chest stripped bare. No wonder they're aggressive to one another - it's an unrequited homo scenario going on here.\n\nThe generic movie takes everything it can from the genre. The opening theme and titles so want to be Superman you almost pity them, while Skeletor's opening march is straight out of Star Wars - and that's just the first five minutes. Only decent moment is a quick blast of Purple Haze, though as it's used as character shorthand to pretend that nerdy Barry Livingstone is a cool heavy metal store owner even that holds little comfort. Look out too for the incessant product placement for Burger King.\n\nAlthough the plot is simple, not to say microscopic, the execution leaves it all a little confused. Combine this with a romantic subplot involving an 80s-style Courtney Cox and some of the most feeble comic setpieces ever laid to celluloid and you're looking pretty grim. Add to this disinterested direction, cheap-looking design and a witless script and what's left is a noisy, worthless (and violent) dirge. Yet it's still better than Power Rangers. Well... just. 3/10."

Courtney Cox and the bald cigar smoking guy from Top Gun who threatens Maverick about flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog sh**t out of Hong Kong add to a stellar supporting cast. Evil Lynn has still got it.\n\nGreat tune for the cosmic key. Eating ribs will always remind me of this movie.\n\nA favourite childhood movie, which doesn't disappoint as an adult."

Of course there's always the risk of getting the wrong type of comic-relief, but I liked Gwildor so I don't care.\n\nIf there's something about this movie I didn't like it has to be two things: 1.)

Frank Langella has probably the most underrated performances as the evil and sinister Skeletor, one of my votes as baddest bad guy in movie history if they had something like that... this is the Jack Nicholson performance of the Joker before Batman. I don't know why people are giving it such a low rating, there are a ton of movies that are a lot worse out there. You have to realize that this was made in 1987 and SFX weren't as good as they are today, but this had heart and it shows if you watch it. If you go into it watching for deeper meanings and all this other stuff that art fans go for, i can see why you'd bash it afterward.

        "review_detailed_main": "Firstly, I must admit to not seeing very much of He Man at all-just enough to know that the show is essentially an extended advertisement for an action figure line, and not much else beyond this. This is significant because it reveals one of the central problems this film has right from the starting gun: there is very little meat on the source material to begin with, and already so little of it can be transferred onto an hour and 45 minutes of cinema, leaving the movie as much of a barren wasteland as Eternia itself. Perhaps this explains the film's insistence on taking as much as it can from the Star Wars franchise-anything to add meat to bones, it seems.\n\nThere is furthermore not much else of value that can save this film from its lack of substance. A disappointingly long stretch of runtime has the film on the planet we humans call home, with the potential of the Castle Greyskull set only utilized in the movie's beginning and end. The performances of most of our actors range from adequately bland (Courtney Cox) to unacceptably terrible (poor Billy Barty), with Dolph Lundgren in particular even more stiff than his hulking muscles appear to be. Should I mention he is the star?\n\nThe movie is not so devoid of value to the viewer as I perhaps have said it be, however. Frank Langella's turn as the power-hungry Skellator, who seeks to obtain the universe's power, is delightfully show-stealing, cheesier than a Texas grilled. The set of the Castle Greyskull, being used far too briefly, are yet admittedly impressive and do actually have the feel of it being another planet far from ours. And much of the film's action, apart from some quick edits to mask Dolph's apparent poor swordsmanship, is adequately shot and pulls in enough investment.\n\nDespite this, Masters of the Universe does not convince this viewer that it holds much worth, seemingly being more contempt as a cliche-ridden, empty shell of its source material and of the Star Wars franchise. I would advise whomever may read this to instead search for clips of Frank Langella as Skellator instead-I promise you that it would be a better use of the finite time you and I have in this universe."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have read in the past about people, as young children, replaying the original Star Wars films from the late 1970s, early 1980s over and over again on home videotape once they became available, that the tapes have become old and worn through repetition. True as that may be I will never know because I never saw a Star Wars film properly until the last year and a half or so but one science fiction/adventure hybrid fable I did have on videotape through one means or another was this: Masters of the Universe, an under funded and pretty poorly thought through piece from a bunch of 'C' going on 'D' list talent made in the mid to late 1980s.\n\nI saw this film recently for the first time in what must be a decade-plus and while I didn't wear out the tape all those years ago, I saw it enough times to take a trip down memory for this occasion. You don't remember lines of dialogue or gripping narratives in scenarios like this, you remember individual shots and facial expressions from the film. As it was, Teela's (Field) reaction shot when she finds out what she's eating very early on in the film was one of them as was Gwildor's (Barty) joyous and knowing expression towards the end when he sends certain characters to a point in Earth's history they will appreciate.\n\nBut enough of that and to cut right to the chase, the film is pretty poor. Although, it's that watchable sort of rubbish that accompanies the fact you saw it as a child so often that the experience now is a trip down memory lane rather than an out and out first time film viewing. To some, this might be the worst film they've ever seen and I wouldn't have a problem with that; to others, it may be their favourite and I wouldn't have a problem with that although I would point out to them that their childhood links with the piece has blinded them somewhat.\n\nI read only now that the film was originally going to take place on the planet of Eternia but budget limitations brought it to Earth \u0096 there's your first clue as to how ordinary it is. The fact the film's idea of where it wanted it set had to be scrapped should really have been enough to dissuade the producers from making it, surely. But, it didn't and of course we're all glad it didn't. Masters of the Universe is one of those strange hybrids that has a clear cut hero in He-Man (Lundgren) come out of where he's familiar with (Eternia) and travel to a far off place in order to achieve something. In this case, it's Earth in order to escape evil Skeletor (Langella) and his foes who want control of an item called 'The Cosmic Key' little creature Gwildor has created. This key enables folk to travel from planet to planet and, naturally, Skeletor wants control of this contraption.\n\nBut instead of being a circular journey in which a hero leaves their homeland; fights battles and defeats evil before returning home an even bigger hero, the film presents us with a typical high school romance involving Kevin (McNeill) and Julie (Cox). The idea that He-Man is the focus is still very much present but it is Julie we have more of a connection with as an audience as we feel she may be in peril at certain times and her back-story may touch us somewhat.\n\nBut the film is really just a collection of nice outfits and rather unbelievable scenes. The film needs to happen in the early hours of the morning on Earth for the sake of convenience and the heroes know they have until 'moonrise' on Eternia to achieve their goal because Skeletor was kind enough to tell them that ultimatum much earlier on. Initially, monsters resembling wolf-man rip-offs and rejected Predator prototypes are sent to Earth as a scout party but it isn't long before Skeletor himself and an army of his soldiers, most of which wear body armour that resembles the troopers' in Star Wars, arrive to check things out for themselves.\n\nAlthough perhaps the actors in the soldier suits are the lucky ones as they don't get to have their faces revealed. I think everyone in the film, especially by the end, is accepting this as Reaganism inspired, tongue in cheek action/adventure and nothing more. Frank Langella does a great job in bellowing his lines, demanding he be worshipped as the most powerful being in the universe \u0096 indeed 'God'. But that's all he's doing and the fact the rest of the acting talent is an array of stunt men, Karate fighters and actors more used to television work sort of grates in the end, although it does bring a certain quirkiness to certain characters.\n\nThe film has its charm, no doubt about it. A pumping synthetic 80s soundtrack and a great turn from James Tolkan, otherwise known as Principal Strickland from Back to the Future, whose best line is \"Nobody takes pop shots at Lubic!\" are some here and there highlights but it isn't really enough to cloud adult judgement on a childhood 'favourite'. Skeletor may have been the most powerful being in the universe at one point and he may have wanted to remain like that but how does one so powerful explain the stupidity of having a huge pit complete with lava at the bottom mere feet from where you rule on high in your throne? Regardless, I don't think he'll be back."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not only does this film stand tall on it's own achievements but it is also clearly the inspiration for that well loved classic \"Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time\". It follows the mythos of the original He-Man mini comics (the ones that came with the toys) more than the plot of the animated series, as such He-Man is not secretly Prince Adam. (My fellow post teenage virgins as well as losers in general will probably understand what I'm talking about.) Anyway Langela proves the perfect Skeletor. Unlike the cartoon character he proves to be convincingly pure evil. I must say that he honestly did succeed in being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. Hat's off to director Gary Goddard and the cast for taking the story entirely seriously and not just dismissing it as a campy hour and a half long toy add. It's that kind of conviction that distinguishes between art and commercial shlock. This movie also taught me some valuable life lessons. For instance, if a guy with a skull head gets massive god-like power the only real change he will make to his life is giving himself golden armour. (Both Skeletor and the Red Skull have done this.) I also learned that when some one gets god-like power, to defeat them all you need to do is push them into a muddy ditch. Having the characters travel to late 1980's earth made this movie all the better specially since they got to meet Courteney Cox (what a babe. Grrrowwlll). Why doesn't anybody ever ask her about this movie when she's on talk shows? Oh wait it's cause there's no reason they should care. Anyway if you don't have anything better to do give it a rent... and wait till the end of the credits for the secret surprise. You can probably find it at your local Blockbuster Video! Make it a Blockbuster Night!"

The film clearly tries to imitate Star Wars and fails miserably but still, for me at least, holds its own.\n\nIt's also worth watching for an early role by Courtney Cox."

        "review_detailed_main": "On planet Eternia, Skeletor is attempting to gain control of Castle Grayskull and the sorceress of Castle Grayskull and a special 'key' are integral to his success. Locksmith and inventor Gwildor has the key that Skeletor requires, but Gwildor, He-Man, Duncan & Teela all escape Skeletor's clutches and open a gateway portal to planet Earth. Unfortunately, along the way the key gets lost and boyfriend and girlfriend Kevin & Julie unwittingly activate the key allowing Skeletor and his team to locate it. It's now up to He-Man and his small team to protect Julie & Kevin, defeat Skeletor and ultimately take back control of Grayskull...\n\nFrom the rather cheesy opening credits I was already a little bit worried about how Masters Of The Universe was going to pan out. Ever the optimist, I hoped that the cheesy opening credits would give way to a campy-cheesy and fun throwaway action-adventure film. Well I suppose it was kind of campy and was definitely throwaway, but fun it certainly was not. This forms part of the problem and director Gary Goddard has perhaps made the film a little too dark and serious (which will only work with a strong story and well developed characters). It's evident early on that Masters Of The Universe doesn't really contain either of the aforementioned elements which merely results in a film that you can look at and one that 'passes the time' but does little to involve the audience. To be fair attempts are made at comic relief by the Gwildor character, but he doesn't exactly have the best of dialogue and unfortunately, for me, he wasn't a very funny character.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that made me partly enjoy this film was the special effects; not because they were good, but because they were so bad that they actually made me laugh; - the opening credits are supposed to be 'Wow' but look terrible. The cinematography and sets look cheap and dated (and one wonders if that may have been the case even back in 1987). Even laser guns (which can look good) come across as third rate here. I think my favourite bad special effect was the 'laser whip' which again looked more ridiculous than cool.\n\nThe acting is about as poor as you'd expect; with the possible exceptions of Frank Langella and James Tolkan who seem to be the only people who seem to have made any effort. The former is particularly good bringing the necessary menace and evil of Skeletor to the screen very well - in fact it's safe to say that many of the best scenes in this film were the ones that Langella was involved in.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the highlight of the film for me were the laughably bad special effects and at the end of the day if that's the kindest thing that you can say about a film then you know that it's a bit of a stinker."

Revisiting the film almost 30 years later, and knowing that it came from the Canon Film Group, I was hoping for a dumpster fire of a film, something my friend and I could laugh at. Unfortunately, it's borderline competent, which is quite a bit worse. It's more or less a rip-off of Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian. The script is awful, but the production design and costumes are very good. Cheaper than Star Wars, obviously, but still not bad at all. Frank Langella plays the villain, Skeletor, fairly well, and Meg Foster is a good henchwoman to him. The heroes are less interesting, with Dolph Lundgren as He-Man (most annoying, he's off screen for long periods of time). The film is perhaps most famous now for co-starring a young Courtney Cox. The film as a whole is kind of a bore and pretty forgettable, which is probably how I felt as a kid, too."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie wasn't given a chance back in the 80s simply because it was based on a toy. Nowadays, with big-budget epics based on video games and other playthings being a common occurrence, you'd think people would be a bit more open-minded. It's true that MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE really is a low-budget movie but it does a great job stretching its meager funds into a very elaborate fantasy look. The production design by William Stout is fabulous and Gary Goddard's direction is quite stylish. Bill Conti's music score is especially noteworthy -- one of the best fantasy-adventure scores of the era. Skeletor's prosthetic make-up takes a bit of getting used to (not so great, I'm afraid) but Frank Langella plays him like he was doing Richard III at the Old Vic! I love it -- there's not an ounce of the tiresome eye-rolling which most \"legitmate\" actors feel compelled to introduce into these types of roles (think Peter O'Toole in SUPERGIRL). Many of the reviews already posted seem to fault the film for not being more faithful to the TV cartoon. I was already a grown-up when this one came out and had never seen the cartoon, so I took it at face value as a stand-alone film. The decision to set most of the picture on earth (which I'm told was done for budgetary reasons) actually gives MASTERS a nice \"TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE\" quality that I find quite appealing. All in all, I think this is the best of the many low-budget STAR WARS imitations that came out in the 80s and a very entertaining drive-in style \"night at the movies.\" My own kids love it as much as I do!"

Like many sword-and-sorcery movies, it depicts a bad guy who has an evil plan, so it's up to the good guy to stop him. This one ups the ante by having a lot of the action take place on Earth.\n\nBasically, if you expect a complex, intellectual plot, then you'll be sorely disappointed. If you expect nice, brainless fun, then you'll have a great time. The cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Frank Langella, Billy Barty and Courteney Cox (in other words, it stars Ivan Drago, Richard Nixon, the world's most famous dwarf, and Gale Weathers).\n\nIf you're interested in a serious movie produced by Edward Pressman's company, then I recommend Brian DePalma's rock opera/horror flick \"Phantom of the Paradise\", a mashup of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Grey\" focusing on the '70s music industry."

It should have included a small origin part for people like me to know He Man is, a bit more of Eternia and so on\n\nHowever, I personally loved this movie. The plot was decent and so is the acting. What's most impressive to me is the stage set for Skeletor's castle and bits of Eternia as it really gave the movie a true fantasy atmopshere like it's really set in the He Man universe where the characters eventually come across our world in the movie. I could definitely see there was some love and thought that went into making Masters of The Universe\n\nThe best part about this movie was of course Skeletor and his actor Frank Langella who stole the show and you can tell he had the time of his life playing Skeletor. He stole every scene and was just awesome\n\nThis was also Courtney Cox's first big movie so it was cool seeing her in her first movie for the first time and it also features the actor who played Mr. Strickland in the Back to The Future trilogy in a very cool role as a police officer getting caught up in the battle between He Man and Skeletor."

I have no idea why this is considered a \"cult classic.\" Frank Langella's performance as Skelletor is why this movie gets even 3 stars. Without it, I would have given it only one. Dolph Lundgren clearly ended his career as a leading actor with this performance and the rest of the cast couldn't quite figure out if they were doing something totally campy and cheesy like the 1960's Batman television show or trying to do something remotely serious and as a result, come up with neither.\n\nThe only characters given anything resembling a backstory are the ones who were specifically created for this mess.

He Man and crew must find the key before Skeletor does.\n\nStory and the Production: A Dimensional story about finding a key and fending off the villains. The typical land on earth and expose to stupidity is still relevant.\n\nI do adore and love the costumes. Way better than current day CGI.\n\nThe acting for the 80s was well. The action was choppy. Overall a decent film that's good for after a long day grinding to chill to.\n\nVillain: Skeletor and crew were okay. Skeletor isn't a dummy by any means.\n\nHighlight: The costumes. They were so cool.\n\nWhat can be learned?: Earth is filled with dummies no matter what movie, show and in real life.\n\nVerdict: Have the power and watch this film."

I remember liking playing with my toys - the Master of the Universe toys. There is no pun or innuendon here, so if you think there is, that is totally on you.\n\nAnyway the plastic weapons used - well I reckon since the toys were plastic too, you can be forgiving when it comes to that aspect of it. But maybe you can't - I don't know. What I do know is that everyone is having fun in this - so why shouldn't you? Even if it feels cheap, even when it feels too easy and there are too many coincidences ... suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Maybe you do find this as appealing as I think Howard the Duck is - which many consider a disaster ... so there's that too.\n\nDolph probably thought he had hit the motherload with the movie and role ... I am sorry he didn't. On the other hand, he had a pretty good run and some amazing movies too. Plus some feel this being one of his best ones - after or up there with Drago. Give it a try if you want to - or watch the trailer, you should get a feeling and know if it is for you or not."

Yes, some of the lines are cheap and the acting is stilted and questionable at times, but it is still a fun movie. If you forget what I've just mentioned and just sit back and enjoy the fantasy and the adventure, and you will enjoy the movie. Some memorable scenes are the battles in the junk yard, the flying hover craft fight and the final fight between He-man and Skelator.

        "review_title": "Somewhat charming cheesy fantasy movie about toys",
        "review_detailed_main": "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe toys were quite a big hit in the 80's. There is a rumor that He-Man toys were the results of an unsuccessful attempt to market a line of Conan toys and that they only gave him a blonde wig . Anyway , Mattel (the producer of toys) approached Filmation studio to develop an animated TV series out of the toy line. The cartoon aired from 1983 to 1985. Filmation created most of the supporting characters in the mythology, which Mattel then turned around and developed as toys. As you can see the whole show was basically a cynical extended commercial that was being marketed under the guise of entertainment. To be honest the cartoon is a epic hybrid of fantasy and sci-fi, with ancient castles and sorcerers mixing with laser guns and cyborgs. A good potential for interesting movie. \"Masters of the universe\" movie was made when the popularity of the cartoon and toys was starting to fade. This was not He-Man's first big-screen release. In 1985, the animated film \"The Secret of the sword\" was released theatrically.\n\n\"MOTU\" obviously tries to follow in the footsteps of \"Star wars\". The real uncredited source for the film is surely Jack Kirby's \"Orion of the New Gods\" (1971-1977) comic-book from which all the elements have been taken. Director Gary Goddard tried to dedicate the film to American comic book artist Jack Kirby in the closing credits , but the studio took the credit out. The film has also been stripped of much of the mythology of the animated series. Many viewers reviewed the motion picture in comparison to the cartoon, when it really was an adaptation of the toys only.\n\nThis is one of bigger budget movies made by Golan - Globus , yet disappointingly because of budget restrains most of the action happens on contemporary Earth . Eternia appears at beginning and ending of the movie , mostly works as a backdrop. Thankfully the costumes and sets are superb . The special effects still hold up pretty well. The music by Bill Conti is good , even if it rip offs \"Superman\".\n\nThe action is OK . I really liked the final battle between He-man and Skeletor , the flying hover craft and the junk yard battle. At least you can clearly see here what's going on , not unlike modern action movies.\n\nThe screenplay is rather poor. There is no real introduction to the characters , because the movie is aimed at the cartoon and toy fans . The characters are paper-thin , one dimensional at best. The fish-out-of-water aspect of story doesn't really work , the humor is VERY lame. There are some terribly dumb moments in this movie (the \"I'm your mother\" scene for example). A little too much time is spent on the soap-opera angle of Julie and Kevin. Dialogues are terribly simplistic. The overall plot is predictable as hell.\n\nThere is nice extra scene that was supposed to set the stage for the sequel \"Masters of the Universe 2\", but since the film didn't do very well at the Box Office, the sequel was dropped. The script for \"Masters of the Universe 2\" had been written, but was rewritten and became the script for the 1989 Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi action film \"Cyborg\".\n\nDolph Lundgren (\"Rocky 4 \") looks EXACTLY like He-man , althrough his acting is almost non-existent. Lundgren had only limited acting experience, a thick Swedish accent, and was not yet fluent in English during filming. He needed a speech-coach AND a drama-coach to make this movie. The real star however is Frank Langella (\"Frost/Nixon\"). He took the role of Skeletor because he wanted to do it for his son Alex, whom was a fan of He-Man and Langella had felt Skeletor was a role he couldn't refuse. Frank Langella admitted in an interview that Skeletor was his favorite role. He wrote some of his lines, like: \"Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of evil ?\". His performance is honestly great , very theatrical and fun. Courtney Cox (TV sitcom \"Friends\") is bland as Julie . Christina Pickles as the Sorceress is awful . Meg Foster (\"They live\") as Evil-Lynn is nice. James Tolkan (\"Back to the future\") tries to bring some humor as police detective , but can't do much with weak dialogue.\n\nOverall , for a toy commercial this is not that bad movie . Just accept the silliness and go with it . Give it a chance on lazy afternoon. It's not really good , but charming and innocent. For a movie about toys this is FAR superior than \"Transformers\". I give it 3/10."

Sadly, my memories of such a fantastic film have been clouded by terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and a rather weak storyline.\n\nGwildor is the Jar Jar Binks of the mid-eighties, while Dolph Lundgren appears to be struggling with the concept and execution of the English language. On the plus side though, you do get to see a youthful Courtney Cox, years before the idea of marrying a wrestling policeman that struggles with giant spiders ever entered into her head."

Skeletor (Langella) is up to his old tricks again; he's trying to take over Castle Grayskull and the magical power held there to become the master of the universe. In their efforts to thwart his advances He-Man and company learn of his secret weapon; a pair of interdimensional keys. To evade capture at the hands of Skeletor and his second in command Evil-Lyn (Foster) - it's like Evilyn but she's eeeevil - He-Man and company make an interdimensional jump. Guess who comes into possession of the super device? Yup, two unlikely heroes: high school seniors Kevin (McNeill) and Julie (who is played by a super young Courtney Cox).\n\nIf you are a fan of He-Man, you've probably already seen this, but if you haven't I'd bet it would be a hoot. It's fan-service galore. It's one of those movies that assumes you know the characters and places. It translates to a movie that finds it satisfactory to throw named characters on the screen and call it a day.\n\nThere are some amusing parts about the movie though. If your quota of the '80's isn't full, this'll fill it. Take the interdimensional key. It's used by pressing a sequence of keys (which emit a different tone)...it's like a synthesizer! Good thing Kevin is the keyboard player in his high school band.\n\nIf the aforementioned notes didn't suggest, everything about this movie screams Saturday morning cartoon cheesy. Now, the cheesiness, of course, isn't an inherently bad thing; that can be fun every once in a while, especially when it can be found on YouTube. That said, there are almost certainly better things to watch. I'd think I'd recommend this if you want to see good old Dolph action and/or you're familiar with He-Man. Or you could always just watch Rocky IV."

He-Man was a hugely popular cartoon in the 80's and when it was announced the were making a movie version of it many a kid must have been very excited to see it at the cinema. The result sadly is a bit average, first of all the action takes place on Earth for 90 per cent of the movie. It would have worked so much better if they kept it on He-Mans home world of Etarnia. Also a very popular character from the cartoon \"Orco\" was missing and replaced by a slightly annoying little creature called Gwildor played by the great Billy Barty. Both of these decisions were due to budget problems (this movie was made by Cannon films after all) but a Kid who was a huge fan of the cartoon is bound to be slightly annoyed at this. Still credit where credit is due they certainly tried to offer up a big Star Wars type spectacle but it didn't quite work out. More positives were that Dolph made a pretty good but not very talkative He-Man and Langella makes a great scenery chewing Skeletor but you can't help see this movie as a missed opportunity."

Also, there's Gwildor, who is basically the movie's Orko, only not funny enough, and Skeletor's soldiers, who are basically a rip-off of the Stormtroopers from Star Wars.

I remember the big disappointment with the cheap costumes, cheap special effects, the silly plot, and the cast of characters that had little to no resemblace with the cartoon and the toys.\n\nI must say that Dolph Lundgren perfectly suits as He-Man, and his outfit looks pretty good. The reset is, well, embarassing: Man-At-Arms and Teela are unrecognizable, the Sorceress is an old lady with cheap plastic spikes on her head, Evil-Lyn is fascinating but could be a general evil mistress out of any fantasy movie. And then we have Skeletor. The greatest villain of the 1980s' is turned into a lame copycat of Emperor Palpatine, in his laughable make up, looking nothing like a skull. Frank Langella might be the most convincing actor in this bunch, but he's not Skeletor, sorry.\n\nYou know who are the best characters around? Blade and Saurod! The latter having the outstanding look of the real kick-ass villain. A pity that he gets killed immediately... they had to cut costs, maybe? Oh, and Gwildor is not at all more irritating than Orko. In the end, Lou Scheimer packed both the He-Man and She-Ra cartoon series with dwarves and gnomes, so why not Gwildor?\n\nThere isn't even need to talk about the boring plot, the fact that, pretty early in the movie, He-Man and co. arrive on Earth, making sure that no Eternian settings are needed, the infamous Star Wars (but more likely, Black Hole) troops rip off, the final transformation of Skeletor into... a cross between Lo-Pan from \"Big Trouble in Little China\" and a Saint Seya!?\n\nStill, \"Masters of the Universe\" is surely fun to watch as an 80's camp/trash classic. Hoping that the upcoming live-action reboot won't make us miss it!"

Eternia was so much more interesting than stupid earth and those people that they found were so annoying. I didn't want to see any stupid humans I wanted to see Masters of The Universe characters.

        "review_detailed_main": "I first watched this one on VHS in the late 1980s\u0085so it's another nostalgic trip down memory lane for me; besides, as a kid I used to love watching the animated series on TV \u0096 along with its short-lived predecessor, BLACKSTAR (1981) \u0096 and even owned toys of some of the characters! This is a juvenile live-action version and although watchable, it's still among the least adventure epics of its day: to begin with, the characters don't look much like their old selves and there's little use of the mythical Greyskull setting or He-Man's trademark \"I have the power\" line. Besides, the time-travel convention adopted for the film's main plot feels as ill-advised now as it seemed then, but is more like than not a measure of budgetary constraints on the part of the penny-pinching Cannon Group.\n\nDolph Lundgren is a stolid He-Man; Frank Langella a campy yet unconvincing Skeletor (especially when he exchanges his typical hooded attire in blue for a mask and golden costume); Courteney Cox is the present-day heroine; Billy Barty's Gwildor replaces Orko from the animated series (but, then, there's no sign of Battlecat\u0085or, for that matter, He-Man's mild-mannered alter-ego Adam either!); Meg Foster comes off best as Evil-Lyn, with the good sorceress (who has been turned into an old crone by Skeletor) at the other end of the scale; admittedly, James Tolkan, is quite fun as the tough but bewildered modern-day cop. While there's plenty of mindless (if uninspired) action throughout, Skeletor's army is lazily depicted as a black-clad variant on the 'stormtroopers' from the STAR WARS saga \u0096 while his gallery of mutants is, at best, a forgettable lot! Skeletor even re-emerges from his watery grave after the end credits had rolled \u0096 thus promising a follow up which, perhaps unsurprisingly, never materialized..."

The acting is really something else, half the time I'm wondering why He-Man sounds so damn happy. Considering that Castle Greyskull has fallen to a surprise attack by Skeletor and the Sorceress is his prisoner, this guy should be a little worried.\n\nSoon he discovers how the forces of evil penetrated their defenses, a slightly insane Dwarf who created the ultimate key. This key, which sounds like it was manufactured by Yamaha, can open anything - even doorways between dimensions. Which is how the group ends up on Earth, though the device which brought them there lands some distance away.\n\nThis gives a neat reason to include a budding Courteney (not a joke about her breasts, well maybe) and her A-Ha idolizing boyfriend, because they find the Cosmic Key and immediately begin playing with it.\n\nSkeletor's forces lock in on the signals and battles rage through the suburbs. Surprise, surprise the good guys lose the first encounter and He-Man is taken in chains back to Greyskull, everyone else is left alive on Earth to rot.\n\nOf course Gwildor MacGuyvers up a makeshift Cosmic key and Kevin remembers the song to open the gateway to Eternia. He-Man sees his friends, breaks free, and recovers his sword for a final battle with a Skeletor (who has just absorbed the power of the universe, as if that would matter. He's the BAD guy, Dolph is the GOOD guy - he's screwed).\n\nOkay, the film is very predictable, but combine the premise with a \"motivating\" fantasy score and I start cracking up. They should play this music in mental wards, though having two hundred people in gowns acting like Conan would probably be bad..."

Only a handful of the characters from the original worldwide successful cartoon makes it into the movie together with a whole bunch of star wars castoff \"stormtroopers\" painted black. But let's be fair here, turning a cheesy kids cartoon like HE-MAN into a successful live action movie was always going to be near impossible, especially when the source material has very little depth to it, the cartoon was basically an ad to sell the numerous action figures. Sony has had a planned reboot in existence since 2000 but has had constant delays, the latest rumour is for March 2021 but a theatrical release isn't on the cards, instead a release thru a streaming service is more likely with Netflix being the preferred way to go."

If you're looking for an accurate live-action version of your beloved He-Man, don't watch Masters of the Universe. If you're looking for a good sci-fi fantasy movie, don't watch Masters of the Universe. If you're looking for awesome fight sequences, don't watch Masters of the Universe. But if you're looking for a goofy movie that you can enjoy and to which you can unwind, then Masters of the Universe is what you want.\n\nBy no stretch of the imagination is this a good movie. It has a trite plot, terrible acting, and special effects that were bad even for the 80s. But the folks that made this movie knew they weren't making a Best Picture contender. It's full of cheese, and like a pizza, that just makes it better.\n\nSo for your next cheesy film fest, make sure to include Masters of the Universe. It's perfect for a night of popcorn, pizza, drinks and friends. It probably deserves a 2 or 3, but gets a 4 because the movie does exactly what a movie like this is supposed to: entertain and make a few laughs.

        "review_title": "Mediocre at Best",
        "review_detailed_main": "It's no surprise that after the success of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983) cartoon that Hollywood became interested in creating a live-action version of the series. However, it turned out to be a financial and critical blunder for everyone - crewmembers and audiences alike. It's pretty much a split right down the middle. It either will be enjoyed or it won't be. I for one had a hard time figuring out where my stance is. It certainly is not even close to being a good movie but it also isn't close to being a terrible film either. It's just blah.\n\nThe film starts out with already what seems like a finale to the film - Skeletor (Frank Langella) has captured the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull and wants to lure He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) himself into a trap so he can acquire the powers of Grayskull. All Skeletor needs is He-Man's sword. But writer David Odell thought it would be a good idea to create a subplot that involved a gizmo called the \"Cosmic Key\" that can transport anybody anywhere across the universe. But the only way to make this item work is to play a musical tune out of the finger pads surrounding it. I mean, it's an OK plot device but it's not necessary.\n\nUpon being ambushed when He-Man arrives to confront Skeletor, a portal is opened from the cosmic key and he lands on Earth. From there a boy and a girl find the instrument and mistake it for a synthesizer. How 80s like. It's because of this plot device that carries the whole film. As a whole, it's a chase, but it's a slow chase. And kind of cumbersome too. Every scene is one clich\u00e9d chase after another where each team is a step behind the other. It's just so happens that everything occurs coincidentally with one another to string along a very thin plot line. It's not great entertainment but one should also understand that it isn't unwatchable either.\n\nTo be fair, this film stays pretty faithful to the cartoon. Everything from the set design of Eternia, to the costume design of each character looks and feels like the cartoon was rendered into the real world. Dolph Lundgren's physic matches He-Man accurately as does his co-star Jon Cypher as Man-At-Arms (with that brush of a mustache). Frank Langella as Skeletor was an okay choice, but his make up could have been done better and he could have at least tried to make his voice a little higher pitched. The same goes for many of the other creature like characters. In some ways, they remind me of Steve Wang's creature costumes. I did wish the character of Man-E-Faces was included though. He was an awesome character.\n\nWhat's even more interesting is too see a very young Courteney Cox as the girl. However, that doesn't mean that the acting is great. For the actors that take part in this, the performances aren't really convincing. No one's performance really feels genuine, nor is any of the dialog anything special. Even for an 80s movie, you'd think there'd be cheesy one liners - not even that. But again, it's not terrible, just plain. But, the other aspect I did find gratifying was Bill Conti's score to the film. I am confused to why he didn't reuse the theme from the cartoon but his new tune sounds praiseworthy none the less. There is a theme and it sounds heroic. Too bad it can't support all the other dead weight.\n\nFor a live-action film, it stays faithful to the cartoon and has a good musical score, but its' actors' performances are barely passable and the writing is too silly."

It has its share of plot holes and some bad effects, but for what it is worth, it is fast paced (stuff almost always happens except those 'family' stories), costumes are funny, one-liners are cheesy, sets are interesting and so on.\n\nMaybe it gave bad hohmage to the cartoon series but as a stand alone title it is good entertainment and I recommend it if you are in the mood for some light-hearted-laser-shooting-sword-fighting-army-teleporting- time-traveling-food-stealing-fantasy-movie."

Thank goodness, because in our post- MST3K culture, the expectation is for Disney-style jokes to dispel any possible suspension of disbelief. Flash Gordon 1980 might be entertaining, but it is ultimately a joke. The fantasy has no serious weight. You are meant to laugh at it.\n\nSo credit Cannon and co. That they did treat He-Man seriously. Lundgren's voice is not ideal, but he is doing the role straight as can be and considering how Hollywood shuns or mocks such characters (fat Thor)--it's rather amazing that he got respectable treatment.\n\nAnd then there is Langella. At the time it came out I did not pay attention to his performance, he simply was not the cartoon Skeletor. But it has aged well, since he played the role without a joking attitude. As others have said, he acts as if he is Richard the Third. What Disney/Marvel bad guy in their comic book movies conveys that kind of performance?\n\nWhich brings me to Transformers 2007. The plot of that movie is two alien forces coming to Earth to quarrel over an object of great importance in the possession of teenagers who are caught in between them and pursued by legal authorities. John Turturro is doing the James Tolkan part but with much weaker dialogue.\n\nIf Cannon could manage a decent B-movie script on limited money then what excuse does Paramount and Spielberg have for such their dim-witted toy movie?\n\nI give it a 7 for the effort and 1 extra point for Langella, probably the best performance by someone playing a toy."

This created an incredible bond between us, which as of today 2022, is still strong! .\n\nSeveral years later as she entered her teens, I was working abroad and wasn't with her as much as I would have wished. At age 14, she became unmanageable for my parents then in their late 50's and I decided to return to the UK to help them with my sister.\n\nI arrived home on a Thursday night and without notice, I arrived at my parents home Friday evening.\n\nI was walking up the footpath to my parents front door, when I was greeted with raised voices, slammed doors and bad language which a Sailor would have been embarrassed to hear.\n\nI rang the door bell and my Mother opened it, I gestured to her, not to announce my return, went into the sitting room where my Sister was shouting at my Father, who only got the occasional word out in reply.\n\nI stood silent for a moment, then as loud as possible shouted: \"By the Power of Greyskull.......\" My kid Sister stopped shouting mid sentence, burst into tears and ran into my arms.\n\nThat silly saying from a cartoon, was more powerful than even Heman & Skelator combined, could have ever realised.\n\nMove forward 20 years or so and my kid Sister has a daughter of her own, at age 5 she would run around the house with her dog (Heman's Tiger) and she would scream \" By the power of Greyskull...\".\n\nMy Sister bought a DVD box set of the Heman Cartoons, and another little fan and monster was created :0)\n\nBack in the late1980's I brought my then kid sister to see the Masters of the Universe and she was both amazed and loved it. Though she was a little upset by the absence of Heman's Tiger and the fact that Heman didn't say his catchphrase as he did on the cartoon, before every battle.\n\nThe movie was not great, but It brought great happiness to many!. Acting was only average, with one or two exceptions. Special effects were poor even for the 80's and the script was all over the place.\n\nThat said, even to a man in his 20's as I was then, I could see that this B - Movie had something special for younger fans, who had grown up on the Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nFor that reason I have given this movie 8 out of 10."

It seems that an awful lot of people enjoyed the film, and I think, all things considered, it turned out pretty well. As to Frank Bailey's notes - everyone has a right to an opinion. No one will ever realize what goes into making any movie, but we had many masters to please on this one. The entire movie was done for $17,000,000 and it's a good looking film. I'm proud of the film, and pleased to say it was the feature film debut of Courtney Cox, Robert Duncan McNeil(\"Voyager\") and Chelsea Field (\"Last Boy Scout\"). I recommend the film highly, but as the director, I am a bit prejudiced. I saw it again recently and enjoyed it. I hope any of you who view it enjoy it as well, but remember, it IS HE-MAN, so you shouldn't expect Lawrence of Arabia. It's definitely an enjoyable film if you view it with the spirit in which we made it - which was to be engaging family sci-fi."

I would marry her, but I'm not really ready to commit at this point in my life.\n\nThat little dude IS Gwildor. He made me believe that a small dwarf could make a thing that creates portals to other worlds.\n\nSpecial effects are awesome, no Battle-Cat but I heard it's cause they had a big cat but he ate an extra and whatever they had to fire him. The cat, not the extra, he died of blood loss from massive head trauma cause the cat ate part of his face.\n\nGreat movie. Dolph Lundgren rules now and forever.

        "review_detailed_main": "Like many people of my sort of age bracket, when I was younger I was obsessed with He-man, the cartoons, toys and whatever else. When this came out, I was understandably very excited. Never have I felt the same excitement about a film as I did when this came out.\n\nOf course the film is by no means a classic. It was a relatively high budget by mid eighties standards, being 17 million. This was still fairly cheap in terms of recreating the worlds of Masters of the Universe, hence most of it was set on Earth as opposed to Eternia. Other gripes would be, no Orco, no battle cat but He Man purists could go on. The changes that the designers made were generally well recieved. The darker more gothic look with the costumes, I thought He Mans costume was really good.\n\nThe cast are good. Dolph Lundgren is perfectly cast as He-man on the physical side of things, and for his debut he isn't half bad, he's good hero material and his physical exploits make up for his lack of acting ability. He has however improved immensely since this movie and I have been a Dolph fan since, thanks mainly to the fact that he portrayed my childhood hero. Meg Foster is excellent and strangely sexy as Evil Lynn and James Tolkan is as usual very good too, but it is Frank Langellas superbly evil performance as Skelator. Skelator gets all the best lines and Langella revels in his role, with his performance shining through heavy make up.\n\nThe sets that have been built are good, particularly Greyskulls interior, which at the time was one of the largest sets ever built. This is all harmless and camp fun with a superbly uplifting musical score from Bill Conti and despite not being a very good film in the critical sense it is fun and I love it. 9/10"

If their a new film a actor needs to use this portrayal of Skeletor as inspire. The special effects are great for that time period and if the budget had been higher it probably would have become a classic like Star Wars and Flash Gordon.Dolph was alright as well. But I'm afraid he and the other actors are out done by the villains. This may do to the fact we really can't get any good characterization out our heroes. THe film deserves attention do to the fact that in the 80's this film included with such films as Back to the Future, Willow, Indiana Jones,and Star Wars really pushed the boundaries of what could be done on film , at least in the realm of science fiction and fantasy. We need to understand and continue try to achieve more great scifi and fantasy films like this one."

He doesn't seem to have a lot to say which may not be such a bad thing. Langella is a delight and very much the focus of the movie playing the rather camp Skeletor with great gusto. He delivers lines like 'on your knees proud warrior' and 'yes you will, yes you will or I shall wreak terrible harm upon you' (or words to that effect)with verve. As He-man points out, he doesnt want the woman (the sorceress/hag) he wants his he-man and its always been between them. And perhaps it always will? Make of that little nugget of information what you will. I know my interpretation added depth and perhaps hidden dimensions to the struggle for power between skeletor and his bulky nemesis.\n\nThe leprechaun, gwimmer, gwildor something gwimmy anyway, is interesting too, nice scene between him and the cow.\n\nCast your cynicism and modern sensibilities aside, rest your weary brain and any thought processes, and enjoy this tale through the eyes of a child.

But despite our professionalism when it comes to rating films, there's always a special place in our hearts for those really cheesy childhood movies that made on hell of a difference to our upbringing one way or another. Masters of the Universe is one of those films. Frank Langella, Skeletor, plays the part of He-Man's nemesis better than anyone else i could dream of. Dolph was perfect for the part of He-man. Sure there were some good old fashioned bad guys missing. And where was battlecat? I'll tell you where, at the bottom of the budget. At least we had Air Centurions and a damn sexy Evil Lynn. But above all, we had some bad ass lines in there. I think they done well with what they had. Even the tune is good (thanks for Rocky too Bill). If you don't like this movie it's cause you've got no soul. Masters of the Universe is a masterpiece in every way, shape and form. There hasn't been a bad guy like Skeletor (with the exclusion of Darth Vader) who was able to do the role justice. You probably grew up on a steady diet of westerns (that didn't include Clint Eastwood) and therefor have no imagination. If you don't like Masters of the universe then there's a good chance you don't like other classics like Big Trouble in Little China and other such masterpieces. In which case go back to watching so called classics and pick out another sweater from bland wardrobe and rot.\n\nLook for more down to earth reviews coming soon (big Trouble in Little china, Rocky, Predator, etc)"

I loved the cartoon and action figures when I was a kid, and I must have rented this movie from the video store like 30 times! I think Meg Foster did an excellent job as Evil-Lynn (love the eyes!) and Skeletor was also a highlight. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good somewhat sci-fi story, with lots of action. I am still waiting for the sequel :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the kind of movie that can almost only be enjoyed in the context of when it came out. I suppose just seeing it on TBS like, I guess, the viewers who voted did, then you might not think highly of it. but it takes the normal he-man comic\\cartoon and changes it up a little for the screen. example all of the comic\\cartoon he-mans episodes took place in he-mans homeland where grayskull was and with skeletor always lacking in his attempt to take over the castle. In attempts to make it less of a fantasy and more relateable they set it mainly on earth and though it may have hurt comic fans to see he-man only and not as the prince. Also no Panthor, i believe that was his panters name but maybe im wrong. I have to admit i loved the cartoon but i was only 5 in 87 when the movie came out so i saw very little of the cartoon. which came out in 82. But it has an intresting new plot entangling the 2 worlds and also. Great action scenes. Plus lets not forget the late Billy Barter, Who has a really funny voice (see willow for more Billy Barter). The music is very well done and plus there is that ode to comic\\cartoon fans where he-man shots at the end. \"I HAVE THE POWER\"\n\nYou have to love that. I love this movie, its hard to find and very unappreciated. I love when it comes on TBS but now i own it so i can watch it every now and then. It was unavailable for years but i think it will be realeased on DVD soon so they re-realeased it on VHS. I should have waited for the DVD and bought it but oh well.\n\nYou dont have to love it but please dont vote that it is a bad movie cause its not. You shouldn't watch it objectively watch it thinking its a good movie. Thats my advice. If i picked apart every little think i didnt like about the movie and rated it on that, then i would not be criticing it correctly. You have to see a movie as a whole not in its horrible little bits. It's the final battle between to huge comic book characters. Then latter scenes where Skeletor gets both swords and has all that power is just magnificint. You cant watch it thinking, man the 80's were lame. Its a great little movie. Just cause its not \"Gone in 60 seconds\" (which i dont think is very good) I promise you in the next 2 decades 60 seconds will be just of badly thought of then as masters of the universe is thought of now. You get what i am saying. Some movies can only be enjoyed at the age you first saw them. I saw this movie when i was 5 i loved it then. so i think fondly of it so i like it now. Its not the kind of movie you can watch at any age and love i think. but as i am not any age i cant say for sure. This movie rocks hard. LOVED IT"

I still can't describe the feeling of seeing my favourite characters come to life on screen!! :-)\n\nThank goodness this film is now on DVD in the UK.

        "review_detailed_main": "As a kid in the 1980's, I was not into the Fantasy scene. I would have taken Star Wars and Star Trek over Conan the Barbarian any day. That is why I was reluctant to rent \"Masters of the Universe\" way back when it was first released on Home Video. Fortunately I let my buddy pick our rental for the day and we watched \"Masters\".\n\nYeah, this film isn't going to win any awards, but it really is fun to watch. At the time, the effects were not bad and Dolph really looked the part of He-Man.\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, that this film really does not stay true to its cartoon origins. For instance, the cartoon dealt with the battles of good vs. evil in a mystical fantasy-land 'Eternia', i.e. 'Third Earth' or 'Middle Earth' . . . But this film placed Eternia in a science fiction setting. There really is no reason for He-Man to use a sword when he is shooting his laser gun. Further, the film used mostly new creatures instead of the beloved characters created for the toy line. It's kind of like the producers of this film decided to take He-Man and put a Star Wars-like spin on it. What emerges from the mixer, then, is a sci-fi action film that doesn't take itself too seriously."

I really loved the scenes with Dolph Lundgren's He-Man and Courteney Cox's character, cause I think Dolph and Courteney were awesome together. I think that Dolph Lundgren's He-Man is better than Christopher Reeves' Superman. The opening and ending music of Masters of the Universe sounds a lot like the original Superman theme song. This was Dolph's first leading role and he plays really awesome good guys."

Based on the He-man tv series of the 80s, I thought that this may be a bad film based on the tv show, but is was actually very entertaining. The story was good, perhaps on the basic side of things but it kept me interested, I also enjoyed the fight scenes which were fun to watch. Though the film may seem a little cheesy, I think it is a very solid action film of the 80s and one that is overlooked. You should check it out"

The weak link is Courtney Cox, whose scenes tend to drag. Otherwise two big thumbs up for this cheesy, campy gem from the 80's.\n\nIt's hard to believe that a sequel was never made to this fun enjoyable escapist flick, especially considering the hint to one at the end of the credits.

The movie takes place with Skelator after He Man and his group of people who are with him and they are out to save the day. This film is not one to take seriously but I will say watching Skelator performance makes this film all worth while. I will admit there are some scenes in this film that are kind of dull but overall the film is fun and worth watching once."

They should have showed Snake Mountain, for instance, and how Skeletor took over Greyskull.

I was 3 years old and remember it very well. The smell of popcorn, my friend running up the aisle screaming when Skeletor first turned to the camera, my refusal to leave while he waited in the lobby. I always liked Skeletor more than He-Man and a lot of that came from this movie. I watched the cartoon, but the movie is what did it for me as a 3/4 year old. It really influenced me a lot, especially my action figure play as a goofy little kid who enjoyed doing long Skeletor dialogues alongside the usual action figure...action.\n\nAll these years later, I really do still have a fondness for this film and since it was such a big part of my childhood...I can't judge it too harshly. As a Screenwriter/Filmmaker myself, I understand the problems this movie faced in fitting an epic universe into a less than epic budget. For what it is, the movie works today, but beyond the nostalgia factor, the three undeniable things that still hold up are the realization of Skeletor's character (look, costume, LINES! ACTING!) the set designs for the greyskull throne room, and the majestic score.\n\nI don't turn my nose up at good entertainment(I can watch this film and Apocalypse Now in one sitting and enjoy both for different reasons), and this is good entertainment, certainly with more substance than the 2 dimensional crud kids get today.\n\n\"Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of Evil?\"\n\nThink about that line, and the underlying theme that Skeletor, even though he has \"won\" will never be whole because greed needs conflict to survive (i.e. more greedy pursuits, hence Skeletor's obsession with \"breaking\" He-Man).\n\n\"Men who crave power look back over the mistakes of their lives, pile them all together, and call it destiny.\"\n\nWhat it did not have in budget, the film made up with heart. Some of the technical things aren't up to snuff, but again great writing will seep through even when hampered by the constraints of budget (meaning a last second...\"let's set most of it on Earth\" note from the producers) David Odell and Gary Goddard did the best with what they had, as did everyone else. Some went above and beyond, Bill Conti, Frank Langella, and for those reasons and more many of us remember this film fondly and enjoy watching it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "i know this is not a very cool thing to admit but in my humble opinion this is the greatest sci-fi movie of the 80's and nothing has bettered it since.the sheer joy of watching this brings me back to the day i went to see it as a kid in 1987(the best year for both movies and music).i remember it vividly and i think thats the sign of a great movie. the villains in this movie are also pretty scary.skeletor,beastman,blade and karg all creeped me out as a kid and still do. the best thing about this movie though is its a spectacle.its a story of good versus evil and filmed in such a fantastic way.looking back at it now in crystal clear DVD it shows the limitations of the effects,but it doesn't matter,because the movie just looks so great.the vivid colours of both eternia and los angeles and then final showdown in gold bring you into this cartoon world without ever making you think \"damn this is cheesy\". i would much rather sit through this,even with its limited effects,than the likes of \"lord of the rings\" or \"spiderman\".there will come a time when movies don't look like movies anymore because they're so heavily effects-laden(sin city,300).if a movie is to be effective it shoudn't have to have \"amazing\" special effects.it should be down to the characters and storytelling.the mind is a powerful thing,we don't or shouldn't need everything put on a plate for us.masters of the universe takes you on a wild ride regardless of dodgy dialogue and not-so state of the art effects. i love this movie,its underrated and deserves greater respect than it gets."

Surprisingly they do a good job, in showing some parts of Eternia but not all of it is shown in the movie, many things is missing in the movie from the cartoon series. They also did a great job with the costumes, special effects and make-up, especially Beast Man, Karg and Saurod.\n\nAs He-Man, Dolph Lundgren does look good in this role. With his hot look going for him, he does a terrific job as He-man, the man is definitely in good shape and must have been told to tan to look as much as possible like He-man.\n\nI miss the good old days when they used to use laser firing guns, sword to sword combat and cool creative monsters."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of all the Star Wars rip-offs, the only worth while watch would have to be the masterful MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.\n\nSet in the land of Eternia, He-Man (played by Dolph Lundgren) and friends find themselves in a bit of a pickle when Skeletor and his cronies crash the party and make heads roll. Skeletor captures the Sorceress, takes over the Castle of Greyskull, and tries to enslave He-Man. Basically, he wants to make peoples' lives a living hell.\n\nThere are many parts of this movie that bear similarities to Star Wars. Storm Trooper look alike, laser beams that deflect off of swords, a cloaked bad guy who can shoot lightning from his body, bounty hunters, the struggle between futuristic good and evil...the list goes on and on. However, once you get past the fact that this movie directly steals from Star Wars, you start to appreciate the awesomeness that this film brings to the table. Let me review a couple scenes for you.\n\nAfter transporting to earth, the good guys in this movie find themselves conveniently located near one of the most delicious fast food places ever found in a film, Robby's Chicken Shack. Of course, the wily veteran of the group, Man-at-Arms, follows his nose toward the tempting fried chicken and ribs. However, Gwildor, a troll look alike, beats him to the punch and goes fly-fishing for some freshly fried buckets of food out of a nearby convertible. Upon learning that they are indeed eating meat from an animal, the female warrior Teela condemns the two hunger-stricken heroes for being so inhumane. Shut up, bitch... and go make me a space burger. Man, this scene always makes me hungry.\n\nMeanwhile, Skeletor is freaking out because no one has died at his hands yet.... (continued at www.oldforgereviews.blogspot.com )"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I saw this movie I was 10 years old. I was a huge fan of the cartoon and I had a few of the action figures. I can't remember the amount of times He-Man and Skeletor went head to head on my bedroom floor and in my back yard. Of course they were also teamed up with Optimus Prime and Megatron (but for some reason they always banded together to destroy my sisters doll house. lol, never mind). As a kid this movie was everything I wanted it to be . OK, I might have bin a bit disappointed that some of my favourite characters hadn't made the cut, but once I got into the movie I soon forgot all that, as I remember.\n\nWhen I was DVD shopping recently I came across it and got it for nostalgia sake. After not seeing it for a long time me and the family sat down to have a watch. Now my kids, being 6 and 9. Have never even heard of He-Man and my wife wasn't a huge fan as a kid.\n\nNow I will admit that, when watching it this time I wasn't as impressed as I was as a kid. I noticed a lot of the sort of impossibilities that annoy me even in a Si-Fi, fantasy film like this. For example, when He-Man and his group arrive at the music store before Evil-Lyn and her group. Even though Evil-Lyn left the same starting point first and was flying. (you might call it nit picking but that sort of stuff upsets me)\n\nBut I realised that all that really didn't matter when noticed that both my kids were really into it. I remembered that it is a kids movie after all; and as such isn't bound by the same laws as movies targeted at a more mature audience. All things considered i think the storyline, plot and acting were all good enough, and all added up to exactly what the film was intended to be, a great family movie.\n\nI think Frank Langella gave a very good performance as skeletor. I never realised, and couldn't believe it was him under all that make-up. I watched 'Superman Returns' not long after that. In which he plays the newspaper editor. Watching the two performances back to back is really quite daunting."

Casting is top notch and the script is great. There is a great mixture of effects and live shots. I highly recommend you see this movie. I wished they would have gone on to make a sequel but Lundgren said he wouldn't do it and Cannon films went under shortly after the script for the sequel to this movie was redone and made into another of my favorite movies Cyborg Starring Van Damme. Great 80's action/fantasy, this movie is another reason why the 80's rocked!!!"

(Can you even compare them to.. what? Turtles?.. OK they were cool.. but NO.) There could have definitely been a more charismatic actor as He-Man than Dolph, but he does it OK and definitely has the muscles required. Skeletors character works very well in this movie and I think it really did justice to the original. Some people even compare Skeleter to Dark Vader, the villain of all time, so there has to be something good.. eh.. evil in this character and after all what would have been Skeletor like if they would have done two more of these? If we would only have the first SW-film the Vader wouldn't look that much better from Skeletor would it? This is really a great fantasy classic all tho -like said- it could have obviously been much better.\n\nI hear people saying a lot that it ruins the movie because it's set on earth - I have to disagree because this way I felt that He-Man was so much more real. Isn't that one of the reasons why so many of us liked this movie as a child (and still do;)? - Because we want to dream Eternia being a truly existing place."

        "review_detailed_main": "A complaint I commonly see in reviews of Masters of the Universe is that it seems to be an obvious \"rip-off\" or \"derivative\" of Star Wars. Fans of the He-Man cartoons also complain that it does not adhere very closely to the continuity of those cartoons. The latter charge has already been answered elsewhere: that this movie is, in fact, based more on the minimal storyline of the mini-comics that originally came with the toys than the animated series that was later plotted around those same toys. Hence, we have mainly just He-Man and Skeletor and some of their inner circles of friends and allies and no Prince Adam or other characters and identities later developed for the animated series.\n\nSuch creative decisions, as with particularly the decision to replace Orko with Gwildor for the live-action movie, were doubtless motivated partially by adaptive pragmatism and partially by budget concerns. Whereas whipping up a believable live-action facsimile of Orko would be ridiculously easy with the computer graphics technology of our times, this just would not have been feasible for most special effects departments back in 1987. Moreover, that the costumes and equipment the characters use in the live-action movie don't entirely match the ones in the cartoons is surely due to adaptive pragmatism as well: as pointed out in one of the live-action X-Men movies, it would hardly have been a good idea to dress all the mutants there in the same brightly-colored skin-tight spandex they wore in the comics and cartoons. In fact, the lighting and coloring of Masters of the Universe actually does give it a credibly cartoonish look for a live-action movie, and the director makes it clear on the DVD's commentary track that he and the cast and crew bent over backwards to achieve this effect by shooting most of the movie at night; looking at the finished product, one can see this effort paid off beautifully.\n\nAs for the charges of plagiarizing from Star Wars, that Star Wars itself plagiarizes heavily from (or, as Hollywood prefers to say, \"is inspired by\") other sources is fairly well known. What not so many of these critics realize is that Master of the Universe was actually \"inspired by\" a great many of the same sources as Star Wars. Try playing tracks from the classical composer Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\" intermingled with music from the Star Wars and Masters of the Universe soundtracks, and suddenly you'll realize that Bill Conti was not ripping off John Williams; rather, Conti and Williams were both plagiarizing from Holst. As for the characters and plots of each film, Marvel and DC's lawyers would likely have sued anyone who'd admit this into oblivion, but Star Wars and Masters of the Universe obviously both draw heavily from a lot of Jack Kirby's early Silver Age comics with their grotesque monsters and armies of invading alien stormtroopers, particularly the ones in which a power-hungry tyrant from a metallic and highly technologically advanced dystopian planet seeks out a mysterious source of cosmic power that can give him god-like control over the entire universe, aided by mindless hordes of minions and squads of quirky and monstrous super-powered warriors all seeking to curry favor with him; but enough about Darkseid and Jack Kirby's Fourth World stories.\n\nOn its own merits, apart from all its predecessors, is Masters of the Universe any good? On the whole, I'd have to say yes. Frank Langella's Skeletor clearly enjoys chewing the scenery at every opportunity, as does Detective Lubic, who's remarkably competent at his job even if he's a bit of a dick about it at times. Robert Duncan McNeill's performance as Kevin neatly foreshadows the same level-headed plain-spoken charming personality he would later bring to his roles as Nick Locarno and then Tom Paris in the Star Trek franchise, Courteney Cox is sweet and vulnerable as Julie, Meg Foster demonstrates considerable ruthless competence as Evil-Lynn in bringing a woman's touch to Skeletor's efforts to retrieve Gwildor's other cosmic key, and even Billy Barty does a decent job being the plucky comic relief as Gwildor. Dolph Lundgren, while playing a rather flat character with minimal dialogue, earns his paycheck by flexing those muscles and swinging that sword at every opportunity, and Skeletor's mercenary squad and stormtroopers are believably menacing and dangerous even though He-Man and his pals end up wiping the walls with them.\n\nWhile a remake is rumored to be in progress now, I strongly doubt it will be able to improve much on this movie. Though the constraints of its relatively low budget do show in places and it has not aged as well as it might, Masters of the Universe is an enjoyable sword-and-sorcery space opera better than most of the kid-vids of its time and still well worth a viewing."

Its another version of He-Man where there is no alter identity his background was supposed to be a prince turned warrior, I think thats fine of course I do wish they would have had Cringer in it and Orco, I still like the movie. I think Skeltors character stayed true to the animated series, that sort of evilness mixed with a mockness of He-mans nobility. My personal rating would be a 4 and a half out of 5 stars, and my critical rating acknowledging the plot holes would be a 3 star out of 5."

He-Man could have been played by no other than Dolph Lundgren he fit the description of He-Man to T. The story may be somewhat weak at certain points, but the character development is very good you have to pay close enough attention to catch it. Beastman and Evilyn are the only villains from the animated series besides Skeletor, while Beastman's part is small his character does come through subtlety at points. Meg Foster did well with Evilyns character so beautifully evil. Though I do wish they would have gone with the sorceress's original look my only complaint.\n\nYou get a little more insight from the commentary as well The schedule was very tight, and all the cast to-date agrees making the film was hard work for all of them, so at least appreciate the time they put in it, it wasn't easy. For people who complain about it being different from the animated series,look at it this way it could have been a lot worse.\n\nFor most people the story will probably be hit and miss but overall, Gwildors lines and Skeletors mixed in with Saroud, You just gotta love it."

Billy Barty is great as Gwildor and a young Courtney Cox is Julie.\n\nGreat movie just to watch Frank Langella chew up a one dimensional role into a multi faceted villain."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is another volume for the isles for my \"Under the Radar\" video series. This film is also another childhood gem of mine. As you already might know I'm of course a fan of the \"He-Man\" franchise as I've seen the 80's animated show when I was about six years old, one of the episode volumes was the very first VHS I rented out in my local video store \"Video City\" in Yakima, Washington. When I saw a VHS copy of \"Masters of the Universe\" it really took me by surprise, despite my fandom I honestly never knew a live action even existed. It's true back then this film was universally panned but as time went on it became a sleep cult gem that gained positive reception which you can say is part of the beauty of cult films.\n\nAnd for the record, yes I know a sequel for this film was supposed to happen but it didn't. Though personally I'm fine with that as the plans for it I personally thought were out of wack and could've made things worse (though that's just me). And due to circumstances along with that sequel series \"New Adventures of He-Man\" and it's radical new direction, this sequel just didn't stand a chance of happening. Hopefully if the upcoming live action film is successful, it will have it's sequel.\n\nWhen I saw this film, I really liked it; it's true the film wasn't quite the one I had in mind, nor met all my expectations. Though the same can be said about a lot of comic book adapted films out there; but sometimes to me it doesn't always matter as it's hard to do justice to the greatness of any source material. To me, what matters is whether you put effort into coming close but most importantly actually it will be good and fun, which this film is for me.\n\nIt's true to me the only real drawbacks of this film are the fact that we don't really get to explore Eternia and all it has to offer. Also, some of the supporting characters and villains don't really have many character moments to make them stand out even more. Maybe we would have had more on both had a proper sequel been made. But of course, it didn't happen as this film didn't do well in the box office. To me the reason for this was because this film was like most cult movies, a victim of bad timing. From the downfall of \"Canon\" films, the toy line even fandom of \"He-Man\" fading at the time, and the fantasy genre in the 80's was ending. Yeah, it's easy to see why this film didn't stand a chance and why the sequel never happened.\n\nWell now that that's gloom is out of the room, let's get down to business. I do like the story, the film you can say predates the TV show \"Once Upon a Time\", this feels like it could have been a season of that show, which would have been awesome; the fact we didn't was a major lost opportunity and deep shame. I thought that was cool seeing \"He-Man and the rest of the characters on Earth which makes the film a bit of a fish out of water/alien visitation movie, as that makes sense as those films were prevalent in the 80's. And you even have a teenage couple along with one cop who are kind of the both the narrative devices but also the outsider element, do like how they react as probably seeing alien beings would really be a lot to take in.\n\nAll the characters are pretty good and decent as they are true to the series. Like Dolph Lunderen, one of my favorite action stars, this film is an honorable mention in my book. I thought he played the role well he was a solid live action He Man, much like He Man he's the straight-laced hero but does it well all the same. Gwildor I thought is a fun new edition to the Masters verse let alone as he was played by Billy Barty. He was comic relief, but I also like that he by his nature is also the technician of the bunch much like Billy is to the \"Power Rangers\". One thing that's cool about him is how he's able to invent real fast like a rocket powered engine for a Cadillac; yeah I wouldn't mind hiring him to upgrade my car.\n\nHowever, the two that stand out for me the most are Evil Lyn played well by Meg Foster. This film was how I found out about her, but I felt she fit the role as she was true to the character being Skeletor's right hand woman. Really like her outfit which has this elegant coolness to it, her voice which just has this calm but deadly calculating simmering evil, as well as those cat-like eyes of hers; I know that's the actresses natural eyes but that just added to that evil. You see she's a person that commands well, takes every advantage she can get, but despite serving Skeletor you sensed there were some ulterior motives always going on and she's just waiting for her chance.\n\nAnd of course, Skeletor played well by Frank Langella. This is one of my favorite roles from him, he was true to the character but slightly different as he was all menacing, power-mongering and humorless. Just really like how he delivers the lines which sound almost Shakespearean but that delivery and his performance just made you all the more nervous of him.\n\nI really like the designs which are that fine balance of being similar but also different, so they look better on screen. Like the effects from lasers that look and sound cool which should in sci-fi as it's a given. But I really like make up and costuming for the monsters from Sarod who is this humanoid reptilian that has that cool looking mask, only disappointment is that mask doesn't really do anything as the toy figure of him he shoots laser from his mouth. Maybe if a proper sequel to this film happened, we could have seen that but oh well.\n\nOne favorite of mine is for \"The Beastman\" who doesn't talk in this film, but like that he looks true to the toy and cartoon character sort of a werewolf. But I like the armor outfit he wears which makes him this anamorphic samurai.\n\nThe action is solid and decent, I really like this fight in this junk lot but the highlight of it is the one on one swordfight against Blade which was really cool despite short. It was just cool seeing \"He-Man\" go against someone with two blades, the choreography was solid those clangs where just music to my ears.\n\nAnd there is even the battle on Earth which is an honorable mention in my favorite battles of mine, just really like how is one big ongoing battle that starts out as one thing and then turns into another. From the Music store which was cool as it was a shootout taking place in confined space seeing He-Man, Man at Arms, even Telia go against oncoming odds, despite cool action in that I can't help but feel a lot of musicians and probably my uncle are going to be very upset from the amount of destroyed instruments.\n\nThere is also even the hover disks, which you can say predate the hoverboard action from the films \"Back to the Future 2\" and \"Highlander 2\". It was a fun sequence, as you can say it was jousting action but in the air.\n\nAnd finally, the highlight is the music from one of my favorite composers Bill Conti. This film just has a lot of memorable orchestra tunes. From the music during the battles that just sung out big bombastic ongoing action. But my favorite is the theme song which is one of my favorite theme tunes of all time. Yeah, it's not the one from the animated show but I didn't mind, though sidenote would have been cool if in the end credits Bill did his version of it. But anyway, that theme tune was just really cool and beautiful as it just has that feel of epic fantasy adventure which is exactly what the series is.\n\nOverall, I really like and have fun with this film. Yeah, I wouldn't say it's one of the fantasy films that are high on my personal list, nor is it one of the best adaptations, but as I said it has it where it counts. Hopefully the upcoming current live action \"Masters of the Universe\" film will be better and awesome and give us that live action movie franchise all long-time fans have been waiting for. But for now, this version is at least worth a swing.\n\nRating: 3 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am dead serious, Frank Langella should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Skeletor.\n\nThis movie is far better than the IMDB score lets on. I feel like people chastise it because they expected it to be based on the goofy cartoon, rather than the toy line, or the mini-comics that originally came with the toys. Regardless, the movie turned out to be one of the best mediums that Masters of the Universe has ever graced. Sure, there is a bit of \"plotholeium\" with regard to a few elements, but all things considered the movie took some odd concepts and made them work really well. I loved it when I was a kid when saw it in theaters, and I loved it even more when I watched it 30 years later with my own son (who, knowing nothing about MotU, also thought that Skeletor was one of the baddest dudes alive). Seriously. Oscar for Frank. Right now.\n\nEdit: Shortly after writing my original review, I re-watched this movie. I enjoyed as much as ever. This thing was perfectly cast. I'm not sure you could get a human being to look closer to a real-life He-Man than Dolph Lundgren did. John Cypher as the grizzled, war veteran Man-at-Arms was fantastic. The entire cast, top to bottom was great. I am not sure it would be possible to make this work in live action any better than this movie did, particularly given the restraints the filmmakers were working with."

        "review_detailed_main": "So let's continue the review of films based on cartoons Now it's the turn of the rulers of the universe or a film inspired by the he-man animated series But you should know that first this character was born from a line of toys and to sell them they created a lot of stuff starting from theanimated series from the 80s But those cartoons really aged too badly because they recycled the animation a lot of times But this series was so successful that they did other things after like a spin-out that talked about the he-man's sister then you was Ilsequel The new adventures of he-man which was much more hated here but I didn't find it bad at all. So was the 2003 reboot too, beautiful, beautiful, but there was also the hairy one, I consider it the ugliest animated series he- man aka the horrible one on Netflix but I want to talkwhen I will do the review but now we are here to talk about the live action adaptation which was made in 1987 Where to fish Skeleton conquered the castle salami the master is an asteroid How to beat him So what do you think of this film unlike Popeye this movie It's meliked it much more to know some things who is this Gwildor Well because he was the replacement of that character that they couldn't really create orc but in the way he did it was really possible to create a character like that and so they changed him with this is the reason isbecause this film increased on earth because I really had little Barge and therefore they had to set it all on earth at that time and I also know that this film has a lot of problems like other characters are missing and he-man never turns into Adam Gwildor Here this is theproblem when you have little money and I also ask you to tell me that I didn't mind the two human characters, I found them really very beautiful in the film and then for me the final battle was very beautiful and then for me Dolph Lundgren or the Rocky fans will know him wellplayed Ivan Drago for me it was really nice that a he-man role Ah and I also want to tell you if this film was supposed to have a sequel but they didn't because of the flop for me This film was one of the underrated films for me And don't listen to the nostalgia reviewcritic because this film is very good and for me it was one of the best films based on cartoons to conclude with a rating of 9."
