        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is not a finished product, not even close. This needed AT LEAST a month or two longer in the editing room because it is a mess! I'm not even talking about the terrible story or acting because I knew I was getting that regardless, which is no problem for me as long as there's some carnage. I'm talking about the atrocious sound mixing/editing, the abrupt cuts and transitions, and nauseating camera work. The basics of filmmaking! Whenever someone is getting murdered, you can't even tell what is going on because the camera work is so amateurish and shoddy. It's almost like the camera operator was having a seizure whenever they were supposed to film a kill.\n\nThis movie had a $100,000 budget, yet they showed almost no gore/make-up FX when someone would die. If you're filming a low-budget B horror movie, people are going for the kills and not much else, therefore you better be pumping 80% of your budget into the \"horror\" aspect of the movie and show some people getting slaughtered.\n\nTerrifier 1 had a $25,000 (a fraction of Blood and Honey's budget), yet showed every kill in grisly detail and people LOVED it! Then they made a sequel for $250,000 and made 13 million off it. I'm not sure where the $100,000 budget of this movie went, but it was most definitely not the kills, editing or acting. Maybe Pooh and Piglet's costumes were each $50,000 a piece, and if so the costume designer definitely pocketed that money.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this a 1 is because I like the concept of taking a fictional character from the public domain and putting a B horror twist on it. Though a good concept, the execution could not have been much worse. This should not have left editing room let alone released IN THEATERS! The distribution company should be held accountable. It's like video game developers releasing unfinished games. Trash.\n\n2/10."

Then I saw the extent of the bad reviews and the amount of coverage it was getting and I decided to watch it as a joke.\n\nI can't say it made me laugh enough to make it so bad it's good. But I was in completely awe for much of the movie. My jaw dropped on numerous occasions at how bad everything is. It's completely incompetent on every level. Every filmmaking aspect is poor. There really isn't much to say.\n\nI'll give one example of the incompetence. It's a scene from very early and is not a spoiler. The women find a gas station in the forest. It looks like it's been abandoned for decades. Broken down cars, overgrown plants, and a completely trashed inside with no electricity. The character walks in looking for a worker so they can fill up gas. I don't understand how stupid a character can be. What possible indication do you have that this is a functioning gas station?\n\nThen to my surprise, she does find someone inside. I figure maybe he's just some homeless guy or a creep. But I guess not because two more customers walk in. I... don't... understand...\n\nThe entire movie is filled with this type of nonsense. (1 viewing, 4/23/2023)"

        "review_detailed_main": "If there are any \"real\" directors reading this; there is clearly an interest in a Winnie the Pooh horror. This isn't it.\n\nI don't even know where to start in expressing the sheer disappointment of this \"film\". What's worse, it doesn't appear to be an issue about the low budget - more the direction. We have all seen recently what can actually be achieved with a small budget. It would appear this \"director' got very lucky with an interesting idea, but has no idea how to actually make a film.\n\nOur cinema was about half full, but after 45 minutes I would guess half of those had left. Not because it was scary or gory or too intense - but, my guess, and along with us, bored out their minds. By about an hour in the rest of the audience had broken into conversation. We left with about 15 minutes left as just couldn't take another second.\n\nOn the way out I asked for a refund (never done that before lol). The guy behind the counter laughed and said a couple others had said the same thing.\n\nSo what's wrong with it? Well, first and foremost its not scary. It's also not funny or clever or interesting or well shot. It drags on and on with super bad acting, awful music, bad editing, bad camera work, dreadful lighting, terrible dialogue, super cheap looking costumes.... and I could probably go on.\n\nSometimes bad films can be a cheesy, campy good time but the absolute killer here is - it's boring.\n\nThe world of horror has some absolutely fantastic up and coming directors and its a shame someone with some talent didn't have this idea and execute it properly. But as Winnie is now public domain, maybe someone will.\n\nAnd, somebody needs to ban these people from ever making another film. And, I want my money back.\n\nAs I was writing this review I came across a review in the Daily Beast by Nick Schager (full credit to him for the below and the full article can be found online/socials) that puts it so much more eloquently than I have been trying to:\n\n\"Frake-Waterfield exhibits minimal skill at framing a unique or unnerving shot, effectively transitioning between scenes, or eliciting jolts though canny cuts or audio cues. He's not helped by Vince Knight's muddy, shaky cinematography and Andrew Scott Bell's comatose score, which loses steam at precisely the moments that is should be punctuating the action.\n\nIts difficult to fault the musicians for their lethargy, however, in light of the omnipresent amateurishness on display, almost none of which can be blamed on production constraints; though its clear that Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey was made on a shoestring budget, its failings have to do with a simple lack of talent both in front of and behind the camera.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey's premiere, the writer/director has expounded on his plans to film a series of additional children's lit horror shows, with Bambi and Peter Pan next in line for the grim dark treatment. On the basis of this fiasco, however, that feels like so much wishful thinking. For all of Pooh's kills, the greatest casualty of his rampage may just be Frake-Waterfield's career prospects\"."

The pacing is a bit off and the effects at times were notably bad.\n\nBut what did you expect on a budget under $100,000 made by amateurs? I don't feel like my time was wasted by people who used an IP as a lazy money grab. I thought the team tried and did what they could within their means.\n\nThere were a handful of cool directorial shots, a few fun kills, and some bad in an entertaining way scenes that made this at least watchable. It's a really short film that isn't an absolute chore to get through. This isn't even the worst horror film I've seen this year.\n\nIf the next time around there is a bigger budget, better writing/editing, and better casting it could be fine. A lot of their issues seemed to be budget or inexperience related as opposed to offensively bad or incompetent."

I'm impressed by the animated sequence they created for this movie and it was kinda cool. But even the decent production quality, somewhat good cinematography, visual tone, set pieces and locations overshadowed by it's very poorly written and atrocious screenplay with a bad ending, slow and tiring pacing, weak performances, lazy direction and an amateur cast with subpar acting abilities."

I'm glad I saw the movie in theaters (Mexico City) because I had a complete blast.\n\nI think they pulled this off by being in on the joke. It almost plays as a satire of the slasher craze from the 80's. They knew they were making a Winnie the Pooh slasher and they leaned hard into the premise. I laughed, I was shocked (the deaths are all super fun and creative), and I was impressed by the cinematography and music (especially for this budget which I think is probably less than $100k). In short, it's just a good time if you know what you're signing up for.\n\nSimilar to Terrifier 2, this is a super low budget horror movie getting a huge amount of attention and press and that's so exciting to me as a lifelong horror fan. I personally want to live in a world where that happens more often. So yeah I gave it two extra stars for that reason alone. They pulled off the impossible.\n\nGo see it in theaters and support true indie horror films."

There's no point in me doing a synopsis, because if for some sick reason you've ever dreamed of a movie where Winnie the Pooh (yes, the bear from your childhood) goes psychotic and on a killing spree, that's just what you're going to get in this movie.\n\nI want to clarify something, being objective this is not a good movie even remotely. As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.\n\nSo why do I give it a 7? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.\n\nIn short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all. If you don't find the idea of Winnie the Pooh killing people at least a bit fun, you should do well by skipping this one."

But I think it could have been far better with a more serious script and actors.\n\nFirst, the movie is maximum a Z one. It is bad, really bad in all aspects. Even the gore looked pretty cheap.\n\nSecond, the music is terrible. As bad as you can expect in a Z++++ movie.\n\nLast but not least, the best are the girls ready to dissapear. Didn't feel anything for any of them. Good job Winnie and friends.\n\nSo, overall if you want to waste some time watching a terrible slasher, do it.

The only thing it surprised me with was with how many/few people survived. The acting was sub-par.\n\nThere is a backstory with the main character about stalking, but so much attention was paid to this that it insinuated it had something to do with Winnie and Piglet, when it did not. So why was it there? It felt like an empty add to the plot. There is also a story line added of a troubled relationship between two girls, but that too feels like a feeble attempt at adding some backstory to the characters.\n\nNext is the totally unneccessary amount of nudity and sexualization of some of the characters. In one of the scenes Winnie rips off the shirt of a girl (so her upper body is fully exposed) before killing her, literally for what reason? It doesn't appear that Winnie or the others are sexually driven so it is just a boring attempt to make the movie \"interesting\" for the (male) viewer. Also the scene of another girl in a bikini feeling herself in her room and in the hottub have zero purpose in the movie. It's redundant and does the movie no credit.\n\nAs others have also pointed out, the masks on the animals were quite poorly done and made it look cheap, maybe CGI would've been the better choice here.\n\nFinally there is the complete unbelievability of how long people stay alive in some of their conditions. You're telling me a girl can still scream while half of her brain is already crushed? Highly doubt it....\n\nIt seems like they ended the movie so that there could be a sequel, but honestly it would need a lot of improvement on all its fronts for it to be good."

        "review_detailed_main": "I really liked this movie. It's obvious that this shouldn't be taken as a serious horror film. Most of the 1-star reviews are people trying so hard to be movie critics.\n\nThis movie is fun, stupid, cringe, and funny. The whole thing feels like a dream, from the cliche/mediocre acting to the ridiculousness of the story. \"Winnie the Pooh going on a killing spree because Christopher Robin left him\". Listen to that, the vibe of the movie even feels satirical. I love how they use the exact same kills from the Halloween movies (head stomp kill, pinned to wall by knife kill, etc.). They even did the neighborhood vs. Michael scene from the end of Halloween Kills. I find that hilarious because they are doubling down on copying parts of those bad movies, further proving the fact that this movie is satire.\n\nSome of the kills were actually good, the shots as well. There are retarded moments in the film too, but that doesn't matter because it feels purposeful + it ends up making the film funnier.\n\nNot exactly a \"so bad it's good\" movie, but similar. Overall this film is a fun, fever dream that doesn't try to be good."

It's so terrible and not even remotely scary at all and the plot is truly terrible. Everything about this movie sucks and I wish it was never made due to how terrible and an abomination this movie is to all of cinema. Overall this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen."

So unnecessary!\n\nI can't help but feel like this was just lazy storytelling, they start by riding off the coattails of others success, the first sign of the dumpster fire to come. I mean, A. A Milne created Christopher Robin, Pooh and his friends, as well as part of the origin story of this movie, so thats half the work done by him and not even the writing team. You would think this would give them time to write something decent but that was not the case, instead they created this pile of garbage. I honestly believe the author would be rolling in his grave after seeing what humanity has done to the stories he wrote about his son and the amazing imagination he had. The acting was very stiff and unrealistic in places and I found the stronger performances were Pooh&CO, but couldn't really find that enjoyable either as the effects were laughable. I want to narrow in on specifics but do not want give away spoilers that will ruin your day but just know watching this movie is a waste of your time, I swear.\n\nKnowing this is up for Razzie and yet has SEQUEL coming out so quickly makes me double down on the fact that they are not even trying to write a movie worth spending your time and money on, they are just living off its infamy while simultaneously trying to ruin the world A. A Milne built for his son."

        "review_title": "Not Even Fun-Bad",
        "review_detailed_main": "Winnie the Pooh has finally entered the public domain, just for a talentless film crew with no passion for this project to shoot a clich\u00e9d slasher, and bring in those dollars based on the shock value of the popular childhood characters becoming misogynistic, blood-thirsty killers. Writer-director Rhys Frake Waterfield completely wastes the potential of the premise with terrible characters we don't care about, unnecessary scenes that drag out forever and ever, and the most disappointing CGI kills you'll see in a horror movie. At the very LEAST, Blood and Honey could've just been one of those fun-bad horror movies. But it's not even to the extent of being so bad that it's good; even Sharknado did better in that category.\n\nIf you care to know about the plot, Pooh and Piglet basically become these feral creatures with a taste for blood after Christopher Robin abandons them for college. Speaking on the positive side of things, the movie begins with an animated sequence in which a narrator keeps us up to date on how Pooh and Piglet have cannibalised their friends and returned to their animal instincts in order to survive after Christopher Robin left them. This opening being made as if it were for a kids' fairytale film, in addition to a few good shots and some nice lighting (it's still no Martin Scorsese film) is every compliment I can make about Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, which is what scores it one point.\n\nUnfortunately, these small factors are overweighed by huge disappointments or other obvious issues such as horrible acting, underwhelming gore, an atrociously bad script, and blatantly making a profit off of turning a beloved childhood character into a cold-blooded monster, which I think would be absolutely fine if it were done well. There's a completely useless stalker plot that does nothing for the story, the laughable soundtrack during some kill scenes sounds like music that would be played for clowns during a circus act, and the CGI deaths look unbelievably fake. The Terrifier movies, despite not being horror standouts, use practical gore effects which make them look so much better and end up being way more brutal. Why did Blood and Honey have to dispose its only decent elements like kills in a horrible execution?\n\nA common trait we know plenty of horror movies share in their genetics is the element of characters making bad decisions, but in Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey, they're just downright suicidal and completely careless for their own or their friends' lives. There's a scene in which Piglet is attacking two of the girls around a pool, and once he attacks one of them, the other girl DELIBERATELY falls/jumps into the pool so it'll make it easier for Piglet to kill her once he's killed her friend. What in the actual f### were they thinking here? Are they asking to die at the hands of these masked murderers? \"Ah yes! Scream so that Pooh and Piglet can know where you are!\"\n\nThe film is way too drawn out just for the sake of being a feature length movie, every character's IQ falls out of their heads and transforms into a plot hole, and the third act of the film is so goofy that I just couldn't enjoy it. Blood and Honey overall is just a terrible horror movie with no redeeming qualities, although I can't promise that you won't have fun with it. I actually enjoy and have fun with lots of bad horror movies that I'd end up rating solidly, like The Nun, Halloween Kills and the endless Saw sequels. But this movie is not one of them; it's so appallingly bad that I couldn't even laugh or just simply have fun with it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

        "review_title": "A Wild and Fun Movie",
        "review_detailed_main": "This was a movie that when I first heard about it made me laugh. The closer we got to it coming out, I was intrigued to check it out. When it came to the Gateway Film Center, I made it a point to see it on the big screen. It is just wild to be honest.\n\nSynopsis: after Christopher Robin (Nikolai Leon) abandons them for college, Pooh (Craig David Dowsett) and Piglet (Chris Cordell) embark on a bloody rampage as they search for a new source of food.\n\nNow where I'm going to start is that I don't recall watching Winnie the Pooh growing up. I know a bit about the character and his friends, but I'm far from an expert. I like that writer/director Rhys Frake-Waterfield seems to know enough of the subject to incorporate elements. We start this with seeing a book version of the events. They are narrated by Toby Wynn-Davies. Christopher Robin befriended odd half man-half animals things living in the woods. Among them are Pooh, Piglet and a few others from the story. One day, Christopher didn't come back and they started to starve as he was bringing food. This drove them mad.\n\nWe then shift to the present. Christopher comes back to 100 Acre Woods with his wife, Mary (Paula Coiz). He went away to college and while he was there, he talked about his friends. Mary doesn't believe him but is coming along in support. This makes Christopher uneasy. He is determined to prove it. What he finds though isn't what he is expecting.\n\nAlso coming to this area are a group of women. Alice (Amber Doig-Thorne) needs time away due to a stalker situation that she had. Coming with her are Jess (Natasha Rose Mills), Zoe (Danielle Ronald), Tina (May Kelly), Charlene (Danielle Scott) Maria (Maria Taylor) and Lara (Natasha Tosini). One of them is running late and has a strange encounter on her way. The rest also get more than they bargained for when as the synopsis said, Pooh and Piglet are out looking for a new food source.\n\nThat is where I'll leave my recap as I'll be honest, there isn't much to the story here. I chatted with a buddy of mine after the movie ended and we both agreed. This is taking a backwoods slasher and taking out killer you'd normally get to replace it with Pooh and Piglet. We see newspaper headlines for the credits that give you a bit of information about this duo, but it is never fully explained. I don't necessarily know if that is a bad thing. I personally don't know if they're just a couple of insane people wearing masks or are they mutant hybrids.\n\nRegardless of that, this movie knows what it is doing and leaning into. The kills are what you are here for. They even make most of our group of women being unlikable or given much personality. We don't connect with them and care what happens. The only one that you could argue against would be Maria. I believe she is the one dealing with the stalker. I give credit to the effects. The blood and gore we get is good. There's quite a bit of that which I wasn't expecting. They go brutal with the kills which had my theater cheering. I should include here that it was a full house.\n\nI do have some negatives though and it comes with the acting. Doig-Throne is fine. My issues with her are with the writing I feel like. They include this back-story, but it doesn't go anywhere so I'm not sure why. The rest of her friend group was underdeveloped. I did know there was Tosini who is Lara, she is addicted to social media. The dialogue isn't good so that doesn't help. I will credit Dowsett and Cordell. They have good size as these two killers. They don't have much personality due to the masks. Leon and Coiz are fine as the Robins, but they fall in the same trappings as their co-stars if I'm honest. The acting holds this back a bit unfortunately.\n\nAll that is left to go into then would be with the filmmaking. I think that the cinematography is good. We get good shots so I can appreciate that. Knowing where to focus the character to hide the seams of effects is good. I also like the setting being as far out and isolated as it is. Another strong aspect here is the soundtrack. It sets the atmosphere and I was impressed.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a movie that coming in I didn't think would work. This is absurd, but they play it straight. It oddly works as a backwoods slasher with having these odd hybrid killers. The acting isn't good, but that's not the focus. It is all about the effects. The rest of the filmmaking was good around it, with special credit to the soundtrack. Don't come in expecting much. This is a fun, shut off your brain movie and is there for the slasher fans in my opinion. That's who I would recommend seeing this.\n\nMy Rating: 6 out of 10."

You know how some bad movies are actually kind of entertaining? Yeah, this isn't one. It's just plain bad. Here's a rundown of the worst parts:\n\n1) Terrible makeup/costume. They didn't even try to make the Winnie the Pooh characters look realistic, they just look like guys in masks\n\n2) Ridiculously sexist. You can tell this was written by men who have never interacted with a real women. The characters are extremely stereotypical, while the dialogue is cringe and vapid. Like, I seriously don't think this writer has met a single woman. Also, unnecessary nudity is forced in, which, of course.\n\n3) No character development or plot whatsoever. There's nothing to make you care about these people, at all. Also, four of the main characters look exactly the same. There's no diversity at all, like not a single POC. I've actually never seen that before. Probably for the best though, nobody should want to be attached to this atrocity.\n\nThis man is already planning to make sequels. Do not encourage him by watching this!"

Right now I can seriously say I'd have paid $100 to not have seen it.\n\nWoefully acted by what seems to have been cheap labour from the local University drama class. Dismal sound and editing.\n\nSometimes it was like the 10 day shooting time wasn't enough so they inserted re-shoots in to scenes using a different camera, different mic, and different sound design tech, A lean 84min run time fluffed-out with plenty of long shots that try to create tension and suspense that end up simply having the viewer cry \"Hurry it up!\" I could have written a better script. Like I'm being serious here. The writing is atrocious, but I suppose the execution didn't help it.\n\nDon't get me started on Pooh bear. The creature effects (or lack thereof) certainly didn't make it into the budget.\n\nWe walked out of the cinema after what turned out to be about the 60min mark - and we weren't the first either!\n\nTo take a quote from Obi Wan Kenobi: \"Don't try it\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film had great potential to be a great film, featuring well know and beloved characters as evil villains as opposed to be sweet and harmless. The concept and the idea of it was great! Of what happens after Christopher leaves his friends for college and doesn't return for so long. But the execution of this concept was a complete disappointment.\n\nThe start of the movie was promising, with eerie, 2D animation in black and white like children's drawings depicting the past of Christopher discovering the famous characters and what they did when he left, but it immediately went downhill from there within the first ten minutes of the film.\n\nThe acting was poor by a majority of the actors, but it didn't help either that their written dialogue was also so empty, flat and lazy. Absolutely none of the characters were well developed enough to like, even in the slightest bit.\n\nThe animated blood and gore was exciting and promising for a thriller, aiming to invoke disgust and unease, but the way in which it had been animated was done so poorly that online content creators could do better. It wasn't the worst, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe number of inconsistencies constantly left me confused throughout the movie, wondering and questioning why characters were behaving in certain ways when it made no sense, or where things suddenly came from, everything felt like such a let down.\n\nHalfway through the movie, I had posted the thought to my friend I was watching it with that perhaps this film was attempting to be a satire but was just bad at it, and they looked it up to find that this movie genuinely was a serious attempt at a thriller movie.\n\nThere is simply too much done poorly for this movie that it outshines its very, VERY few positive parts. It was genuinely such a disappointment I wanted to walk out in the first ten minutes.\n\nIf you watch this as a satire and don't take it serious, you'll be able to get a good lot of laughs from it. I know I did. But as a serious thriller movie, it just didn't turn out well.\n\nThe idea and concept of the movie was great. With it, a hilarious satire movie could've been made, or a genuinely disturbing and bone chilling horror could've been done. But this film really dropped the ball on it."

The cast tries to do their best but the way their characters were written fails to make them stand out, giving only flat performances. The make-up effects are efficient but the computerized blood that oozes from the victims is quite unreal and detracts from the gore. The cinematography in the exterior locations is the most successful as it achieves a gloomy atmosphere. A bad movie with a couple of good scenes."

Unlikeable characters that I didn't really care about. Tissue paper thin plot. And the characters are always making poor decisions.\n\nThe animated sequence in the beginning is the most interesting part. Plus there's a few shots of the forest that look pretty creepy and interesting.\n\nNo clue why the other characters like Rabbit aren't in this, except for getting a brief mention at the beginning.

        "review_detailed_main": "When there's people that have an idea using the public domain, that would have them think that it would do something to create their own. However in the case of going into this kind of direction, there's sometimes a reason public domain can have people wish that they're still copyrighted. Winnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey is not just an insult to a childhood favorite, but also one of the most stupidest horror movies ever made. The consequence of adapting a classic into a horror twist results in having a pointless premise that has nothing to do with how the franchise we know and love, giving little to no charm or likability. The story has no focus and leaves with more questions than answers, the horror feels more messed up than scary, both the costumes and the special effects are convincing that they look fake, the characters are all dumb, the killers are mentally unstable, and the tone is misogynistic that's convincing that this is nothing but a lazy horror film. I will say this right now. If you're someone that has grew up admirably with the character, then yeah, definitely avoid this movie. However, if you're someone that wants to create your own version of the characters that have entered public domain as a movie and want to learn what to avoid, I won't stop you. And this is a great example of using public domain the wrong way. At least this will be the only public domain Disney property that will get this kind of treatme- I'm sorry, what? There's gonna be one of Bambi and Peter Pan? And there's gonna be a sequel to this soon? Ladies and gents, get used to it. This is the era for horror movies we will be stuck in for a while."

You can put random masks on wrong turn like killers and call it whatever you want. If your gonna call it Winnie the Pooh at least have Pooh be Pooh. Not some dude in a Pooh mask. Plus no Tigger or any other characters. It's just random weirdness. Sure it's gory but that doesn't make it good. It takes itself way too seriously. This could have been great. Could have been epic even. This is just nasty bile. So go rewatch the Wrong Turn series to see what Winnie the Pooh is trying to be apparently. At least then you'll get some laughs."

But it was far worse than I was expecting.\n\nLess than five minutes into the movie you already have several indicators that it is a train wreck. The acting is awful, which can be expected for a movie of this calibur. But the editing is also awful. Scenes and cuts last way longer than they should. Much of the dialogue is completely unintelligible. And to combine the two, there are a couple of points where it seemed they put several different takes of the same scene back-to-back.\n\nThey also completely fail to capitalize on the main point that brought most people to see the film: Winnie the Pooh! The fact that the main villain is supposed to be the silly bear from the cartoon is almost completely forgettable. They may as well have just been weirdos in masks. The \"plot\" (also pretty non-existent) would not have suffered at all for it.\n\nIt is clear that the entire movie budget went into the gore scenes, and into getting hot girls to show their stuff on screen, which again, can be expected for this movie genre. But it is just sad that they took such a golden idea and threw it in the gutter. I have seen scarier content from one-man YouTube channels.\n\nPlease don't spend your money on this. It is the first time I have ever felt like I completely wasted my time watching a movie. Whoever was responsible for these terrible choices needs to never work on a movie again.\n\nIf the obviously planned sequel does happen I hope it's done by someone else."

And maybe this did go viral purely because it takes a popular name and flips it on its head. But I'd rather some British dudes doing a horror B-movie with it than Disney nowadays.\n\nThere are things to like and even love about this movie, such as the lack of certain cliches that are done to death in slasher movies (e.g. No \"final girl\" cliche, which even today continues to be super rare and cringe), and it reminded me of Inbred - another goofy British horror movie that had some bad, but also a whole lot of good, and even great, hilarious, plus original.\n\nUnfortunately this movie doesn't exactly match Inbred in fun and originality as I had hoped. It's kind of boring and unsurprising.\n\nIt's still alright. Since big-studio movies are mostly trash nowadays, I'd recommend watching this regardless, but I'm really hoping the sequel will be excellent.\n\nIf the people who are working on it read this - aim to make something like Inbred, or the first Terrifier movie.\n\nThose had cool villains, lots of violence pandering, a familiarity to them, yet tons of subversion of expectations, great humor to break up the gore, and just... were somehow lighthearted, while still being tense.\n\nI sure hope you can take this franchise in that direction, and even surpass it. Because this first movie didn't really nail it, but it is promising.\n\nOr, you know, the sequel could be even worse, and actually have the cliches, losing the few things it had going for it... We'll see, I guess. But for now, I'd like to support this franchise."

There's no attempt at clever satire or social commentary, just pure shock value for its own sake. Just incompetent filmmaking. From the low-budget costumes and effects to the amateurish acting and directing, the film is riddled with technical flaws. The gore is unconvincing and the story is nonsensical, leaving you questioning why this film even exists. Save yourself the misery.

It's really THAT bad!! Don't give them a pass because they only had 100k budget, the total budget for my film was $8 worth of Taco Bell. My acting was better, the editing, and lighting in my bathroom was better, and the script made more sense. I was really wanting to like this move, but unfortunately the only thing remotely likeable about this train wreck was in the beginning where they explained how the creatures when feral. Rearrange your sock drawer, go to the dentist, spend the day at the DMV, any of those options would be better time spent than watching this \"movie.\""

The camera work and lighting was also so visibly poor I was genuinely shocked. Too top it all off the kill scenes were long drawn out and just overall utter awful.

They didn't make a bad movie to make a bad movie, they wanted it to be good, but they ended up making a 'its so bad it's good' movie. A torture porn movie if there ever was one. It's not a movie that you can break down for an essay in a film class or a YouTube video, but instead a movie to watch on a night drinking with your friends."

However, after researching, I saw that the movie received many bad reviews, so I was quite skeptical about it. But today after watching it I felt it was really bad. The film is quite lacking in logic, the actions and reactions of the characters are annoying, and the film has many holes. I don't even know who the main character is in this movie. Another thing that disappointed me was about the appearance of Pooh and Piglet. To me, these two images are not too scary and do not look realistic. The only thing I feel like the movie is quite good is probably the death scenes. Overall for me this is the worst horror movie I have seen in 2023."

IMDb will not allow me to use the more appropriate synonym for poo, so poo it is.\n\nI was curious about this movie since I read this past week that a teacher in Florida had shown it to a group of fourth graders, causing their parents to become quite irate. Apparently, the fourth graders demanded that the teacher turn off the movie after about 30 minutes, showing once, again, that fourth graders often have better judgment than I do as an adult since I watched all the way through the closing credits. I kept hoping there would be an additional scene that would somehow justify or explain what I just watched, but I was disappointed.\n\nI've heard that the producers were waiting until the first of the Winnie the Pooh books was in the public domain so they could do a sort of mashup movie without fear of being sued by the authors estate, but they apparently were not afraid that viewers of this steaming pile of cinematic garbage would get together a class action suit and sue the producers for insulting our intelligence and wasting our time.\n\nI really loved a lot of other mash ups, such as Abraham Lincoln, vampire Hunter and FDR, American badass, but those movies were so much fun to watch, and this movie was, as I stated, above, a steaming pile of cinematic garbage. This writer found absolutely no redeeming qualities in the entire production. The acting was subpar, the special effects cost about $1.98, The plot made no sense, and there didn't seem to be any discernible theme. Not to mention that the monsters costumes looked like the above mentioned fourth graders, put them together out of odds and ends from their mothers closet.\n\nI gave this one star and recommend that you seek your entertainment elsewhere. I'd like to think that this is probably the worst mashup movie that will ever be made, but I notice on IMDb that a sequel is in the works for a 2024 release. I cannot imagine how the producers can justify a sequel, but as HL Mencken said, no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American people."

The only thing this movie has going for it is the amount of blood that in it. I'm not sensitive to blood at all but even this disturbed me a little. I also can't believe the amount of weird jump scares. Like what is happening you think the scene is going to be an awful jump scare, but all you get is a person walking in and then the victim is dead I'm sorry what? This movie couldn't be any worse. You also don't have any character development, as well as you get 2 seconds of the main character and then they die? I wasn't even attached to them and then they die. You don't care for them.

I knew something was wrong with me before but the news hit me like a rock to the groin. I tried pulling, pushing, exfoliating. I even went to a chiropractor. As a final resort I messaged an old homeschool family of mine to see if they had any essential oils that could resolve the issue. To my dismay, none of these worked. I'm pretty sure the oils made it worse. Sad and alone, I gained 15 lbs. Before I had watched this film.\n\nFriends of mine who knew but couldn't understand what I was going through asked if I would like to join them for Winne-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. I watched the trailer, which was quite horrifying from what I saw, and was unsure if I should join my friends. I learned shortly after that it was a b-movie, and so I consented. I am so glad that I did go.\n\nAs I munched on my popcorn and drank my Coke Zero sugar, wondering how how I was going to get this out later, I felt the hairs on my neck stand up. I refocused on the movie to see the horrifying images on the screen. And for the first time in three weeks, I crapped. It wasn't like a small crap or even a normal crap, but like the crap-god that sits on the crap-throne kind of crap. When I had finally realized what had happened, I noticed that it wasn't the gore even the faces of the deformed animals, it was, in fact the faces of British women.\n\nKnowing that the smell was going to be pungent, I went home early, for the sake of my friends who sat near me. So unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the movie, but it deserves a rewatch from me, not out of enjoyment necessarily, although that is there, but out of respect. For Winnie the pooh saved my life."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a movie that you might watch out of sheer curiosity or morbid fascination, but it's difficult to recommend it to anyone, especially those with a deep affection for the lovable characters from A. A. Milne's classic tales. The movie attempts to blend the innocent world of Winnie the Pooh with the horrifying elements of a slasher movie, and the result is jarring. While it does have its moments in terms of delivering horror, it feels like the narrative could have worked just as well without the beloved Hundred Acre Wood inhabitants. In fact, the inclusion of these characters seems more like a marketing ploy than a genuine effort to tell a compelling story. The scares in \"Blood and Honey\" are intense, and it's evident that the creators intended to shock and horrify their audience. However, the entire premise feels somewhat forced. The juxtaposition of the cute and cuddly characters against a gruesome and violent backdrop is simply uncomfortable to watch. The movie's concept draws more from the likes of \"The Strangers\" or \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" making you wonder if this film should have even included the Winnie the Pooh characters in the first place. The excessive gore and violence are a far cry from the wholesome stories we've come to associate with Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, and their friends. While it's true that going into this film, one would anticipate a departure from the usual, the degree to which it veers off track might still catch you off guard. \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a bizarre attempt to mesh the world of childhood nostalgia with adult horror, and it doesn't quite succeed. If you're a fan of the classic characters, it's best to steer clear, as this film tarnishes their wholesome image in a way that feels almost sacrilegious. While it might provide a few cheap thrills for those who enjoy extreme horror, for most, it's best to preserve your fond memories of the Hundred Acre Wood and pass on this unsettling reinterpretation. Sometimes, it's better to leave the classics as they are, untouched and untarnished by the darkness of the horror genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is incomprehensible in how ill-written and catastrophically-constructed it is and goes through every horror cliche in the book while featuring characters with paper-thin character development.\n\nThe only elements that aren't utterly woeful are the cinematography and sound design where both have been treated with the right amount of care and clearly had people behind them wanting to do a adequate job.\n\nThe script on the other hand, feels like a rushed-out and effortless piece of work from a group of people desperate to capitalise on the Winnie-the-Pooh character becoming public domain. Director Rhys Frake Waterfield then seemed to struggle with a lack of confidence at the helm when directing his actors leading to an unbelievably long list of facepalming moments for audiences to sit through.\n\nWhat could have been a fun and entertaining alternative Winnie-the-Pooh film in the right hands inevitably tumbled into contention for being not only one of the worst films of the year but of the 2020s so far."

I enjoy horror schlock as much as anyone, especially 80's slashers, often low budget films. This is where they missed the mark. There is a lack of camp and tongue-in-cheek fun that there was so much opportunity to use given the nature of the movie.\n\nThe filmmaker relied solely on twisted, brutal torture scenes to make his mark here. Not a laugh to be found. We are talking about the beloved Winnie the Pooh franchise and the director didn't elevate the material to show the silliness and self-awareness that makes so many slashers fun and enjoyable.\n\nOh bother..."

It looks like they grabbed some new faces to keep it fresh, but the talent was lacking. The special effects were something you might see from first year FX students and the kills weren't terribly imaginative at all. After watching it, I saw that apparently a sequel has already been green lit. I'm. It sure how or why, but it did. I hope it is better than this one."

Still on a shoe string Budget Rhys Frake-Waterfield has managed to no doubt create larger than life characters that I'm sure will return in a sequel and will no doubt become a Jason or Freddy character slashing his way to millions $100000 Budget and a $9000,000 return is sure to see interest in doing more of this rubbish ...

From the lighting to the framing composition to the basic great quality; it leaves the all to often grainy, poorly lit quality of most modern horrors in the dust.\n\nThe solid acting was also somewhat surprising. Unfortunately, they killed off one of their best actors, Paula Coiz, almost immediately.\n\nHer portrayal of Christopher Robin's love provided a solid foundation that really grounded the film right off the bat.\n\nIn Mary, Coiz's character, you had someone related to a central figure from the original stories that was innocent and outside those original stories. She was the audiences eyes and ears. She was perfect for drawing the audience in and experience this strange world from her point of view.\n\nMoreover, she gave us someone to care about. She was obviously a good person and supportive of Christopher even though she believed his childhood stories to be a figment of a young highly imaginative mind.\n\nShe was also set apart by not being Christopher; the uninteresting silly looking boy from the cartoon movies we remembered as kids. Furthermore, it was Christopher's abandonment of our beloved woodland friends that started all this mess.\n\nSo the audience won't care about him nearly as much as they would an innocent supportive spouse doing her best not to dismiss Christopher's fanciful tales out of hand.\n\nBut the filmmaker quickly threw all that away.\n\nThe entire movie could have been built around her and Christopher trying to survive while at the same time attempting to reconnect and recover the beloved friends Christopher knew.\n\nBut nope. The filmmakers had to dive head first into mediocre horror film troupes.\n\nBesides the horrible storyline, not to mention the awful dialogue, that killed the film for most people were the COSTUMES!!!\n\nThe look like that were designed and crafted over a weekend. Despite being told at the beginning that our animal friends have abandoned anything that made them human-like; they dressing in human clothing and leave a pathetic impression in the viewer's mind of just men in jeans and flannel with oversized latex masks on.\n\nPersonally, I would have casted the often underused and overlooked vertically challenged members of the acting community. Yes, I mean actors who happen to have dwarfism.\n\nThe Hundred Acres woods creatures would look sooo much better and realistic. Full body costumes would be so much better. I also wouldn't be completely thrown off by the fact that Piglet and Pooh were now somehow TALLER than a grown up sized Christopher Robins.\n\nBesides, what would be more frightening than being chased by overpowered, animalistic, kid sized, revenge driven monsters?"

Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey takes the beloved children's characters and asks the burning question that EVERYONE has wanted answered for the past 100 years: 'What if these children's characters were vicious killer animals?' Sarcasm aside, this ridiculous mash-up is one I never thought I'd see, but I went in hoping to find a surprisingly good movie, or at least one charming enough to eventually be a cult classic. Unfortunately, this has almost nothing to offer as a movie, parody, or slasher. The story is as basic as possible, with almost nothing happening throughout. In a rare interesting moment, the opening animatic is actually quite entertaining and animated in a unique way. Immediately after that, the film loses all uniqueness, fitting as a low tier sequel to the already poor quality Friday the 13th franchise. The acting is cheesier than cheddar, with the line deliveries sinking almost as hard as the lines themselves. The slaughters, which should be the most entertaining part, are mostly obscured or basic. The characters barely resemble their source, with nothing except the names connecting them. I understand why someone made this movie, as the name itself is enough to make some money off intrigued viewers, but the smallest amount of effort outside of that could have made this some kind of a memorable hit. Sadly, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey applies little to no effort in this uninteresting slasher, not even worth a curiosity watch."

There is a lot that can be explored and improved on this twisted journey... But that doesn't take away the magic of this movie.\n\nIt's not for everyone, that's clear, but if you wanna have a good time watching these childhood icons in their crudest facet, this movie is for you!\n\nThe direction, cinematography, setting, the score and Pooh and Piglet themselves are some things in which this film shines on its own.\n\n100% Recommended."

Unfortunately, it really has no redeeming qualities as the story is pretty predictable, bland with nothing really that exciting happening throughout.\n\nThe plot is very forgettable due to it's underwhelming nature, yet you are likely to not forget about this movie due to the disappointment it is.\n\nSimply, it is not on the same scale as other slashers, and should really only be watched if you're purposely watching a poorly made film."

The idea of child-friendly creatures turning deadly was good, as most fairytales were actually once twisted stories, but not at all well-executed. The gore was cheap, the sounds were just funny, and the acting was decent but not convincing. I found myself laughing quite a few times, and dare I say, the accent was killing me. The plot was nonsense. None of the characters were memorable. All the female characters looked the same to me, and I found my friend asking me \"Wait, didn't she already die?\" quite a few times.\n\nOverall, not a good movie. Don't waste your time and move on to something better. 2023 was a good year for the horror genre, but this was just not it."

The gore is definitely there since I had to look away a few times.\n\nThere is zero character development, and the writing is subpar. The acting is decent considering it is mostly girls screaming their heads off most of the time. It would have been interesting if they had some sort of twist to make it a little better than just Pooh and Piglet whacking off people left and right.\n\nI just wish they had included other Winnie the Pooh character like Rabbit, Tigger, and Owl in the film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Hey everyone! Here's my review for Winnie-The-Pooh: Blood and Honey. Pretty good movie,good story it's a horror retelling of Winnie the Pooh stories it follows Pooh and Piglet, who have now become feral and bloodthirsty murderers, as they terrorize a group of young university women and an adult Christopher Robin when he returns to the Hundred Acre Wood years later after leaving for college. Good cast,solid acting everyone does a good job in their performances,intense lead,memorable characters one of them is given a dark backstory,two creepy intimidating yet bada** killers,character relationships are solid one character decides to make a life or death decision in exchange for another character's life,the death scenes are brutal,bloody yet creative,the gore/makeup effects are practical which I appreciated,very gory,flashbacks occur,a couple callbacks to the Winnie the Pooh franchise itself,hand drawn animation gets referenced,scary at times,well shot cinematography to help build a creepy atmosphere,a little bit of adult content,tons of swearing,spooky music,major twists,one callback to another horror film,good directing this was the directorial debut of Rhys Waterfield he did a good job with the direction I can't wait to see what other famous childhood characters are made into slasher villains and has a surprise twist ending I didn't expect. Overall I really enjoyed this film I went into with very low expectations I'll be honest I was a big Winnie the Pooh as a kid especially the Disney version,taking a beloved childhood character making him into a slasher villain is cool,something different,for an independent horror film I was intrigued and is definitely worth a watch. I give Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey a 8.9/10 stars!!!"

The problem is that the movie was made with such a low budget, so they tried quite hard to make it closer to a more expensive production, but failed. If the casting was better, with better editing (timing, sound & music background) & the killings were done in a more creative & drastic way, it would have become a great horror movie. What a waste of a good plot. One more thing : if they want to include some sexual elements into the movie, they could have done it in a better way but reducing the number of unnecessary casts so they can have a bigger budget for that (e.g. Fewer girls, maybe just 2-3, and no need to have a group of guys driving in a 4-wheelers who died within less than 5 mins. A simple 1-person drive-by police or old man will do)."

Filled with more holes than Swiss cheese, devoid of a protagonist worth caring about, and populated by characters so unremarkable and repugnant, you'll question the sanity of anyone who claims to derive pleasure from it.\n\nIt's high time for those responsible for this cinematic catastrophe to do humanity a favor and exit the film industry. Their glaring absence of talent, discernment, and empathy for their unsuspecting audience is nothing short of a travesty, and they should be held accountable."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, it is a scary tale. And it does feel like a Horror film with the dark setting and the dimly lit rooms. But, I'd never thought I'd see the day that a beloved childhood classic would turn into a dark and twisted story, but hear we are. Reviewing this \"R\" rated story. The Woods is also a good setting to create a creepy atmosphere for a Horror film. So let's review, Winnie the Pooh:Blood and Honey.\n\nTo start of with, the movie did not look promising. It had boring and uninspiring voice acting that read out why Pooh and the Piglet were on a revengeful mission after Christopher had to leave them to go to College. The Narrator does not seem very engaging and it left alot to be desired, it just felt as if he was bored to death and didn't want to be there, but after that we do get a nice view of the trees down below. And we get some photographic images to show Cristopher leaving, which was very cool.\n\nHis girlfriend was badly written, but Christopher was mostly fine. He goes back to see them, unfortunately for him he doesn't know that they killed one of the members after being left hungry. Either way it didn't seem believable as to why they would kill one of there members, especially when they'd been together for so long. But regardless of that, Chis shares old memories about the place. Pooh and Piglet find them, and try and kill the both of them, Christopher had to watch his girlfriend die before he was then torchered.\n\nIt looses focus on that side of the story, and we are left with four girls who have no choralation to the story of Christopher and Pooh, and even Piglet. This is another flaw, Christopher is hardly in the film, even though we all know he is the main character. It could of developed nicely, but there story feels shoehorned in rather then feeling earnt as it's without any real merit. With this said, I don't think the girls are bad protagonists. The Writing wasn't dreadful, and the main one had some depth.\n\nNow the whole Christopher thing could just be a me problem, but if they are too touch on other characters, they have to of been written better so we can care about them. As I said previously, the main girl is decently written and we know she has had a dark past. But the others don't really have anything meaningful to look back on. Yes they show confidence and bravery, and one even obsessed with the Internet, but these tropes shouldn't carry an entire story. As nobody will care much about them when they die.\n\nThey focused on the brutal deaths, and they had so much killings in the space of an hour and 20 minutes. Overall, the film in my eyes should have had Christopher and his College friends introduced into the story, so we had more lore on the universe these characters are in.\n\nWould I recommend this film?\n\nIf you like looking back at the past and having some Flashbacks then that part of the film is okay, the rest of it you can just skip."

Despite a few clever and humorous moments, the film can be difficult to enjoy due to its overly violent tone. In the end, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is a lackluster attempt at reinventing a beloved childhood classic."

I've seen many movies in which the premise was taken seriously, but I haven't seen a degree on how far this could be displaced until I've seen Blood & Honey. The tone brutally clashes with what is shown, which is often ridiculous.\n\nOn top of it all: The effects work (or lack there of) is beyond dismal. At least make your gore practical. Instead they've chosen CG of such a quality, it would've been laughed out of any decently made internet video."

I get that people are all going to have their own opinions, some will hate it, some will love it. But If you are interested in seeing this movie there are certain things you MUST keep in mind or it will be a real waste of your time.\n\nFirst- you need to forget EVERYTHING you ever knew about Winnie the Pooh because there is no comparison here. This is a completely different take on the characters, and It' s a completely different story line, sort of like a multi-verse thing. In this version the characters look strange and grow up stranger\n\nSecond- take NOTHING seriously. There are plenty of horror films out there to take seriously and this is NOT one of them.\n\nThird- keep a very, very open mind!!!!\n\nTo rephrase what I said before this film is not for everyone.

It's a by-the-books slasher with no humour or charm that tarnishes the image of a children's icon and not even in the clever way that The Banana Splits Movie does.\n\nBlood and Honey is the worst kind of movie, devoid of a soul and meaning, it was made for the sake of being made for shock value and to get people talking about it in the hopes it got an ironic appeal out of it. Well, they succeeded in that first half but failed at the second, there's no ironic enjoyment to be found here, it's just that bad."

For example, when some of actors towards the end try to kill Pooh towards the end of the movie, they crash their cars in attempts to kill him, but they forgot (for some unknown reason) to put seatbelts and ended up injuring themselves! This happened twice! Lots of unnecessary gore scenes! It's just bad, silly scenes kept happening until the very end! The movie did not end properly, which means that there will be part 2. For sure, I will not watch part 2, neither in the theatres nor on TV!"

I like a horror movie with a mean spirited edge to it , this has that in surplus. It's a throwback to old slasher movies , there is a scene that is a mid to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The guy playing Christopher Robin is annoying, but the movie had some unintentional humor in it. The pool scene is ridiculous but the kill scene is really done well. Overall is a good horror movie with a good premise and honestly.. watching Winnie the Pooh lay people out was just fun."

It only existed for shock value off the titular characters, and did nothing with the brand. But, being a horror acolyte, i saw this film anyways.\n\nI was exactly right.\n\nInstead of taking the IP and bringing to some dark, twisted vision, Blood and Honey would rather dabble with old tropes and horror cliches, exploit the IP for shock attention and abandon any creative nuance that it may have had going for it. The result is a bleak, interchangeable slasher flick that doesn't try anything new or interesting despite the obvious prospects it has placed before it.\n\nThe characters are so wooden, they'd blend into the 100-Acre Wood, and only exist to be brutalized by Pooh & co, whose characters is to ensure an R-rating; your typical unstoppable horror movie villain. The tone is far too serious for this film, the lack of any authentic horror or humor hurts far worse as this film lacks any real identity among the endless ocean of slasher films, no thanks to its startling lack of creativity.\n\nHad Blood and Honey heeded the idea of a horror comedy, this could've been something far better - if not incredible. Take a page from The Banana Splits Movie, where the comedic undertone balanced out the horrors and humor because the it didn't take itself too seriously; it was self aware, unlike this film.\n\nThis film isn't worth your time, nor is it worth anything in the horror genre."

I know ITN and how they give their filmmakers the short end of the stick behind the scenes and rush their productions, and unfortunately for the filmmakers here, it shows. And it's even more unfortunate because I can see some potential for the director. Some of the shots and the way things are set up look really nice, but you can only go so far with so little time. In the end, this movie is going to make a lot more than was given to the filmmakers to play with, I just hope they learn from their mistakes with the sequel.

What they will get instead is grossly misogynistic, horrifically unhorrific, humorlessly dull, fanfic-grade trash that should make the Supreme Court reconsider their public-domain laws.\n\nIn \"Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey,\" a group of six women travel to the 100-Acre Wood for a cleansing getaway. However, these hapless females are soon confronted by murderous versions of Pooh and Piglet, who already have a collegiate Christopher Robin in their grasp. But rather than a taut chase thriller, it instead descends into an undercooked, off-the-rails adventure featuring two \"killers\" that are far more convincing as drugstore Halloween mascots than renditions of beloved childhood characters.\n\nBut the worst thing, by far, is the rampant sexism. The women are not given any common sense or individualism before their breasts are shoved into frame, their tops are torn off, and their heads are mashed by car tires and woodchippers. Rather than being strong, smart, or even capable, these women are reduced to magazine centerfolds cut and pasted with the rationality of third graders: they're constantly lost, perpetually confused, and unable to make logical decisions. The concept of fully functioning female adults was, apparently, lost in translation, unfortunately replaced with as much cleavage as possible.\n\nEven if viewers trudge through this marsh of awful on-camera and off-camera decisions, they'd still find only embarrassing effects, the flimsiest of clich\u00e9s, nonsensical plotting, cinematography and scoring that take the movie's ridiculous premise way too seriously, and strangely lifeless acting. Instead of being bloodcurdling, this film sputters, entirely exsanguinated. Few creative flops are worse than this sexist, lazy, unironic dumpster fire of a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are walking into a theatre to watch your beloved childhood Disney characters massacre a series of innocent victims, then you most likely have a certain level of expectations that you are going to see something that lives in a world that exists among satire, horror, and general bad taste. If you walked into this film expecting the next Scream or Halloween series then you have clearly not gotten the whole point of its creation.\n\nThroughout the film, the over-the-top gore (although mostly limited to a few brief moments) and careful attention to incite every possible slasher-film cliche proliferates the bulk of the film. You're left with two options: you can either dismiss the film due to this and claim you wished for a serious horror movie, or you can rock out to it and revel in the satirical horror film that is Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.\n\nDuring the screening I attended, the audience clearly chose the latter. What began as stifled smirks and chuckles quickly turned to laughing out loud at the entire ludicrous nature of the film by the final scenes. The conceptual framework of \"so bad it's good\" makes this film worthy of a watch in and of itself; however, there are some additional aspects that make it worthy of a closer look.\n\nThis film knows it doesn't have the budget to compete with a serious horror film, nor does it pretend to be one. The over-the-top gore and cliches are reminiscent of scenes in which a character's body is mutilated beyond recognition and the characters foolishly wonder if they should call an ambulance to help. Nearly every scene is constructed in which the obvious solution is not only ignored but the characters double down on the wrong things to do. Not since Scream has there been such a blatant satirical approach to the filmmaking process of horror films. Perhaps I'm reading much too much into this, but I feel the creators set out to create something unlike anything we had ever seen before. They were partially successful if you accept that the film is a unique take on a classic children's story. They were entirely successful if they chose to use this conceit as a vehicle from which to make a satirical statement about horror and the ways in which society embraces the genre through its own sense of nostalgia and predictability. Which perception is real is entirely up to you. Either way, you have a brilliant satire at best and a decent ride at worst."

They couldn't afford a mask that could talk so the characters were written as silent. They couldn't afford to show all the characters so they were mentioned in story book format.\n\nAll kills are done in quick cut format, so they can show you some gory make up of the after effect but nothing in camera. Some kills are so cheesy and poorly done it boarder-lines a parody. Several scenes feature cuts where characters are in an entirely different position before and after, because again the director just doesn't care. Plenty of movies are made cheaply with little special effects including greats like Saw, Texas Chainsaw and Night of the Living Dead but also movies like Hobo With a Shotgun, Sleepaway Camp which are not my favorites but were made with love that you can respect them for what they are.\n\nThis was made for money only. Passionless and lazy. One of the worst films I have ever seen. I think I am most angry because a talented and passionate creator could have made a really good film with this idea."

There's no such thing as being so bad it's good, it's bad, period. The girl group is completely useless surpassing any group of friends of a traditional eighties slasher and the protagonist is even worse. The least that could be expected in a bad film is that it be at least funny, but this is not the case as it is a very boring film, the deaths, although grotesque, are very weak and the ending only reaffirms the poor quality of this film. Let them learn from the director of Terrifier, who, with the same budget constraints, does high-quality work and is seen to do things with love and care. Finally, fvck everyone who was involved in the making of this crap, they are embarrassing."

        "review_detailed_main": "On January 1, 2022, the copyright on the original Winnie the Pooh expired. Now this did NOT include the 1960s and 70s Disney versions of the characters...but the original Milne story and the original Shepard drawings. So, as soon as they entered the public domain, the opportunistic makers of \"Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey\" sprang into action...rushing this bloody slasher film with many of the Pooh characters in it into production. It was apparently quickly slapped together and offended many folks. After all, Pooh and his friends were NICE....but here they have a taste for human blood! I'm assuming the concept alone would account for such a low IMDB score of 2.9...but is it BAD on top of being offensive?\n\nThe plot is VERY simple. After the characters are abandoned by Christopher Robin when he goes off to college, Pooh and Piglet make a pack to destroy people. So, they kill lots of folks...but, like too many slasher films, they mostly kill pretty young women. There's not a lot more to the story than this...just various folks going about their lives until the pig and bear turn them to hamburger.\n\nThe first technical thing I noticed is a very nicely filmed section near the beginning of the movie. I think it was just luck, as soon after I noticed the camerawork again...but NOT for a good reason. Many times, the camera jerks around and seldom stays still...though other times it seems fine. It also often frames the people wrong. I think perhaps they were trying to be artsy (as opposed to just being amateurish?)...but it just looks bad and would be worse on the big screen...inducing nausea because of the jerkiness.\n\nThe acting, for the most part, isn't especially deep. It's mostly folks running and hiding from the hellishly ugly Pooh and Piglet. I cannot say the acting is terrible...it's just the script gives the actors little more to do. There is some gratuitous nudity and the killing is particularly gruesome and nasty. Its violence level, combined with sexualized killing of women, is certainly disgusting...and it's sad this is intended as entertainment.\n\nOverall, the film is in some ways worse than I'd imagined. Had they perhaps done it all very tongue-in-cheek it might have worked. Instead, it's just mean and nasty...and a bit hateful and exploitative towards women. Someone who really HATES women would no doubt get off on seeing some portions of the movie."

Without Christopher to feed them or give them guidance, and with the arrival of winter, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Owl went into extreme starvation and killed and ate Eeyore, which traumatised the group to the point where they developed a hatred for anything human-related, as well as Christopher for abandoning them.

The kills are decent with cgi blood and the worst part was just mindless and no creativity. I would say the only positives I can take away are the music score and just a few kills.

Ok, changing the subject, here goes my review. To begin with, do not take the children to see this movie because it is very bloody and there is a lot of blood and honey. DO NOT take the children to see this movie because you will ruin their childhood. Well yes because children are used to seeing a friendly, tender and pretty yellow bear.

Yes the acting throughout is terrible, but the human characters are not supposed to be the main attraction of the show. Pooh and piglet are. I was a little disappointed that owl and rabbit didnt appear even though their characters were introduced in the beginning, while tiger isnt even in the movie at all.

The idea is you can turn off your brain and watch this, so you can multitask. Poorly written script, a lot of it was quite predictable from the get-go. The acting was mediocre, and Christopher Robin was exceptionally bad. The movie ended is the dumbest way possible. Perhaps than ran out of ideas on how to wrap the movie up and so I guess the ending was actually real. Maybe they told good ol Chris that they broke their budget, he wasn't getting paid and thus his sudden change and the change in the ending."

What would happen if Christopher Robbin grew up? Went to college and moved away? Life would go on but there's no one to take care of his animals and they resort to their instincts in the wild to live. Including eating, well not gonna give that away but it sets off a series of bloody events.\n\nWhen adult Christopher does come back those cuddly forest creatures are out for blood. They wipe out everyone in their path. There's a brief moment where Christopher Robin is able to get through to Pooh. Then the slaughter continues. The ending was a little rough and kinda sad. No spoilers but the franchise window was left open. So sit back and enjoy this little gore."

But it has some great kills, a good bit of suspense, and some admittedly great performances by the actors playing Pooh and Piglet. And honestly, it distanced itself from the Disney version of the characters and the tone of the books enough that my childhood really isn't ruined by this movie.\n\nAll in all, for an independent horror movie made on such a small budget of less than $100,000 it's pretty good. It has the energy of a grindhouse midnight movie."

Now it is no masterpiece or work of art, but people misjudge this movie and it feels like they expected it to be a really great movie even though it's about winnie the pooh and piglet on a killing spree, this isn't gonna be some huge, endgame level movie, it was made with like $8 in the standards of hollywood.

If you're going to use creatures, you can't have a rubber mask with the same goofy expression the entire time. This movie would have been a bit better if they went the route of the killers hiding their true identities under masks, and had a main protagonist. But that's not the road they took.

However, I can 100%, confidently state that this was a bad movie. And by bad, I mean that there was not a single aspect of this movie I can actively classify as good. You may have heard there is no \"wrong way\" to approach a passion project (if that is in fact what this movie was to the film crew; perhaps I'm being generous here), but if there ever WAS a wrong way, well this movie just nailed it. The plot is actually so much of a disservice to itself, that the only consistent thing about this movie was how consistently awful it was. All 100 minutes of it. (About 95 minutes too long, if you ask me). Every bit of dialogue and exposition and \"tension-building\" goes on far longer than it needs to, so much so that I ended up spacing out mid-way through just about EVERY scene. But here's the kicker; it's absolutely not possible to miss any meaningful information to the plot. This is because... there is absolutely no. Meaningful. Information. In the plot. There is no continuity in the plot. Don't even get me started on the sheer lack of character in this movie. Don't get me wrong, this movie HAS characters, but they are so meaningless and one-dimensional that it feels like they've casted actors as props rather than people. If you're looking for character development, a story you can actually follow, and a movie that is more worth your time than doing literally anything else, maybe look somewhere else. Or, grab a few friends, and maybe the commentary amongst yourselves will provide the content this movie so desperately yearned to have. You will not gain anything by watching this movie except maybe an understanding of just how difficult it is to articulate exactly how meaningless every bit of this movie is.\n\nTl;dr: A movie that is so mediocre, that it's not even remarkably bad; it's just markably not good. If you're going in with low expectations, just drop them altogether. This movie warrants no expectations."

It's easy to shoulder a movie on shock value alone, however, it takes talent to make a horror movie that is worth watching. No matter how hard I try, I just can't comprehend how a movie this ridiculous received any kind of funding, and it doesn't seem like this movie got any. The costumes are so bad they are laughable, and the actors are cringey throughout, the worst of them being Natasha Tosini. I am assuming she was to be the resident, \"worldly\" character who you know the killers are going to take out first. My problem with Natasha is that she is about the farthest thing from being attractive, and having to see her in a skimpy bikini was the most horrific thing in this, \"slasher\" movie. Yikes!"

It ruined what could have been a cool adaptation of the classic children's character by taking itself way too seriously, and it may have ruined movies in general for me. From the script, to the costume and set design, to the cinematography; everything was abysmal. The plot holes were abundant and the character development was non-existent.

The film just seems to miss every other detail and to be honest, was shocked on how everything was put together.\n\nWouldn't suggest wasting your time."

Christopher Robin and his soon to be wife. They had the potential to really draw out the story of how it was real to him and could have gone down many paths.\n\n1) him going crazy and being the characters... 2) They both make it out at the end after taking Pooh out 3) More backstory...\n\nNo it jumps right into completely making her a useless character. Don't give me the nonsense of collateral damage for CR's leaving them alone.\n\nNow enter the other characters, all moderately attractive females including the super raunchy one.... again....just pure slimeball directing. Director needs a mental evaluation. They didn't need to have a \"love story\" or some raunchy girl half dressed.\n\nI may have to re-write this later, however, after literally just watching the credits I am sitting here questioning everything about these people involved.\n\nThis was pure junk,\n\nCharacters - F Story - F Had the potential for a well done movie....but yeah they screwed it up majorly Costumes - May this person never work in Hollywood again. The costumes were so unbelievable, I was waiting for them to rip the masks off to reveal crazy rednecks.\n\nNo other characters just Piggie and Pooh.\n\nJust wow. Don't waste your time on this....."

Milne's original vision while adding layers of depth and emotional resonance.\n\nThe cinematography in \"Winnie the Pooh in Blood and Honey\" is simply breathtaking. Each frame is meticulously crafted, creating a visually stunning feast for the eyes. The use of color, light, and shadow is masterful, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring, from the beautifully animated honey jars to the enchanting landscapes of the Hundred Acre Wood.\n\nThe musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, is a true masterpiece. It perfectly complements the visuals and performances, elevating the film to new heights of emotional intensity. The melodies are both haunting and uplifting, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer's heart.\n\nIn addition to its artistic merits, \"Winnie the Pooh in Blood and Honey\" is also a triumph in terms of its cultural significance.

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, first you have to remember it was made for $100k - you don't judge it for not being a $1M film. That's why the review is 7.5 stars (rounded down) instead of 4.5. If a regular studio released this, it would deserve all the quality complaints it got.. but it's not from those so it shouldn't be treated as if it is.\n\nAlso - for people missing characters. Only things in the 1928 book are allowed. So no modern-Tigger or some other pieces that either Disney invented or were in later writings.\n\nIt has problems. The dialog is choppy throughout. The acting is a mix of some good, some not good and some...poor (even for the price - the 4 guys are embarrassing in acting and dialog). There are complicated deaths that make little sense and 1 add-on victim that makes even less sense.\n\nThe writer/director should have gotten someone else to edit besides himself (per the credits). That might have helped.\n\nThat said, the story is a good one. The framing idea was well done, the story with the girls is well put together and held together for a horror film. A couple of small bits made no sense but it screamed edited-out scene more than anything else. Some of the issues are easily fixed through an editor / script doctor.\n\nThe use of atmosphere (visual and audio) was well done (some great use of music). When the subtle music shift makes the hairs on the arm stand up, you've done your job.\n\nDeaths were hit and miss - some typical nonsense \"movie complicated' but 2 were perfectly done (3rd to last and last). You expect that today, regardless of who releases it (SAW's deaths are also the same).\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it to those who like horror and don't care if it is low budget. Those needing SCREAM production-quality should avoid."

As always I won't spoil anything but give some feedback of the technical aspect of the movie. But you can't expect much from such movie esp when they have micro-budget.\n\nSo, acting 0. These actors/actresses have very little or no experience at all, looks more like bunch of friends deciding to make fan movie. Maybe tad better because of the main character. Similar to Troma movies basically. Script and dialogues are also 0/10. That is no surprise considering the topic but some scenes don't even make sense. Not to mention all the clich\u00e9s that are so typical for most horror movies.\n\nCamera work is very bad almost trough the entire movie. But here i will say the only 2 positive things. First - some of the shots were actually great. While they didn't have that much money, there are cool shots with fog in the forest and dust light beans in the wood shed that look awesome in horror movies in general. The 2nd good thing about this is the editing at times. It has kinda mid 2000s vibe. It's not constant but i'm giving them that.\n\nNo info of the gear used for it, but from what i see, it's just entry level DSLR/mirrorless camera with kit lens if i do an educated guess from the background and how it changes in different scenes. Totaly amateurish setup, they didn't even bother paying few bucks to rent a better lenses, it's quite cheap to rent.\n\nThese masks look as cheap AF. As they went to the 1-dollar-store and bought the cheapest one available there. The blood and gore look bad too, tho you can't expect more from such a budget. Overal the VFX are bad.\n\nAnd who'd choosen the music... songs like \"bad smell\" lol ... Overal, terrible movie. It has the cheap quality of Troma movies, but they are at least funny sometimes :D This is not."

        "review_detailed_main": "STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful\n\nYears ago, young Christopher Robin discovered Winnie the Pooh and his friends while playing out in the woods, and developed some wonderful childhood memories. But then, he had to go off to college and left his animal friends on their own, forcing them to fend for themselves, and leaving them to resort to a savage act. Years later, Christopher Robin returns to the woods with his partner, only for Pooh and his friends to exact a terrible revenge, whilst a group of female friends take a vacation that will end in blood.\n\nLast year, the copyright on A. A. Milne's classic literary creation, Winnie the Pooh expired, leaving anyone who was interested free to cast their own creative interpretation of the story without any fear of getting sued by the almighty Disney. So, the filmmakers behind this unimaginable nonsense decided, what would anyone like to see better than a psychopathic Winnie the Pooh and his mates going wild on their old pal Chris Robin, and a group of standard shrieking, slow witted brunettes typical of any slasher film? Nothing. So, with the most seemingly minuscule of budgets and with what must surely be a cast of none professional actors, they followed their dreams. And this...is the result.\n\nIt feels a little disingenuous to give a really bad review to something that, at the very least, you knew was never going to be an Oscar winner. But, sometimes the slowing-down-at-a-car-crash effect can set in, and you just want to gawp at something just to see how bad it is, and I allowed myself to fall prey to this phenomenon here (as I had nothing better to watch.) The awful acting and dismal production values could be overlooked if the whole thing seemed to have a genuine sense of its own preposterousness, and kept its tongue firmly in its cheek, but with a silent Pooh and his friends unable to deliver any Krueger style wisecracks, it's just left to linger in its own bleak nihilism, until an abrupt end filling in where the budget must have run out.\n\nThe novelty behind the film (a psychotic Winnie the Pooh!) gave the film some publicity that allowed it the slightly elevated status of a limited theatre release, but fundamentally it has no merit above all the other low budget horror trash that creeps out direct to DVD every month. *"

Among the better features here is the earnestness with which the film takes the wild and silly storyline. Setup from the start to take full advantage of the popularity of the characters with the way it wraps the traditional stories into something different, the newfound direction it takes by providing the proper reasoning for their rampant bloodthirsty nature by utilizing the abandonment of their past is handled well. This has enough to bridge the past connections into being reasonable killers due to the perceived anger and betrayal that takes place here provides a lot to like as a setup. That provides this one with the perfect opportunity to unleash some genuinely more effective scares than expected. Taking full advantage of the effectively eerie wilderness of the woods where it all takes place, the early scenes of the couple getting stalked in the hideout they used to live in or the stranded victim outside the factory where they operate out of, giving this some quite chilling scenes. A later scene of a victim in a hot tub unaware of the approaching killers who are obscured in blinking lights or the group being confronted with the aftermath of their handiwork completes this nicely enough as there are some creepy sequences at play in this one. As well, there's a lot of brutality at stake here once the creatures make their presence known to the girls. The overwhelming nature of their home invasion takeover brings some great scenes here chasing them around with their superior size or beating them to death using their weaponry leads perfectly into the great finale. Taking place at the creatures' hideout where the brutality of their beatings inflicted on others they've captured which lets the film include plenty of high-end chases, confrontations, and a thoroughly frantic final half that's incredibly over-the-top and graphic deaths which is all sorts of fun. Altogether, these are enough to make for a rather fun time here as this one doesn't have much but there are some slight issues. One of the few drawbacks present here is the viewers' own personal preference for the treatment of the characters. Rather than do anything remotely familiar with the usual treatment of the characters, this one features them as vicious, brutal serial killers out to decimate anyone and everyone they come across which can be outright insulting depending on your individual attachment to the characters. If that's not a factor, the cheap nature of what's happening and the intensely shaking camera on display when we see the creatures moving after others that's difficult to make out are the main issues to bring it down.\n\nRated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Nudity."

The movie is very gory without any reason and the main characters choices are very questionable. My childhood is ruined. Winnie-the-Pooh and the other animals are looking like people with a mask on their faces. Not to mention that the animals are traumatized and doing all that horrible things they do to other people because a kid they used to play with had to leave them to go to college. They are just SELFISH . DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU DONT WANT TO DIE FRON CRINGE!!"

It's just a bloke in hiking boots and dungarees wearing a rubber mask. I wanted to see a huge bear snarling with giant teeth dropping with blood, but our Pooh has no facial expressions and don't believe he even blinks. The acting is laughable and don't expect to see any of these actors names on the Hollywood walk a game anytime soon. There's zero suspense, shock, or scares. It's just cheap gore you have seen a thousand times in similar low budget slasher movies. IMDB has the estimated budget at $100k and i think that says it all. They have used Pooh's name to make a quick buck and have put in a minuscule amount of time, effort and expense into the project. Shameful."

But someone wanted to make this film so badly even though they had no actual ideas, so they made it anyway. The first hour of this movie is so painful that I put it in 2x speed to get it over with faster. In the last 30 minutes, I finally did get a couple laughs, like when Pooh seriously did the Vulcan death pinch. Really?"

The drawn imagery, as if out of a storybook, is creepy but fits the theme. The turn of events that leads to Pooh and his friends becoming evil isn't the most believable but is better than many horror movies. Christopher returning to 100-acre woods is creepy and the result, while expected, has the freight you'd expect from a slasher. The problem is one many monster horror films struggle with. The second that Pooh and Piglet are revealed, they stop being as scary, for it is the anticipation of them that makes them most terrifying. The novelty of these characters also quickly fades when you realize that the Winne-the-Pooh theme has little bearing on any aspect of the film outside of the first few minutes. It ends up becoming a mediocre slasher that offers close to nothing.\n\nThe funny thing about this film is I think if they left it as a 10-minute short film, just including the part that comes before the title sequence, it would've been excellent. It was involved in the lore of Winnie-the-Pooh, creepy, but believable enough in the universe. Instead, they drew it out (likely to make more money) and ended up with something unmemorable and overdone."

If watching a slasher, it's rather silly to expect some epic romanticized screen play acted out let alone get Oscar worthy performances. Idk what some peeps expect sometimes looking at reviews. This had major potential imo yet fell way short. Lighting made it hard to watch & I'm guessing budget really hindered what they could do. Some can do more with less, than others."

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching the first half of \"Blood and Honey,\" I was initially inclined to defend this movie after reading both critic and user reviews. However, my optimism diminished after I watched the second half.\n\nFirst and foremost, what did people expect from \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\"? If you walked in with the expectation that it would become an instant cult classic and redefine the horror genre, then you approached it with the wrong mindset. \"Blood and Honey\" was always destined to be a low-budget B-grade horror film at its finest. And for the first third of the film, it exceeded those expectations. You witness graphic kills, nudity, and two hulking brutes that resemble serial killers in poorly fitted leathery masks more than mutated creatures from the Hundred Acre Wood.\n\nI considered the possibility that some reviews might have succumbed to the #metoo movement concerning a group of girls being slaughtered, or perhaps the criticism of the movie's lack of diversity. I dreaded the less-than-insightful commentary that critics often provide nowadays, where even films like 'Deadpool' are hailed as good.\n\n\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is not nearly as terrible as some make it out to be. It's too simplistic to label it a mere 'cash grab'. The writers and director clearly leveraged a well-known children's classic to draw people to the film, and the publicity and marketing alone achieved that goal, regardless of how poorly the film ultimately turned out.\n\nThis falls right in line with \"Charlie's Farm\": limited backstory, cheesy dialogue, innovative ways to portray violence on screen, a weak ending, and painstakingly cringe-worthy CGI. Nevertheless, this film is watchable.\n\nThe image of a tire from a vehicle pressing down on the girl's head was a gruesome triumph. I've had nightmares about a scenario like this playing out in real life, and now, even with some questionable late 1990s to early 2000s CGI, I can confidently say it wouldn't be a pleasant outcome.\n\nThe highlights are the early storyboards depicting the backstory of Pooh and his friends. The drawings hint at deeper layers of sadness and complexity to our beloved characters. I only wish they had delved further down this path because it was truly fascinating, and I wanted to know more.\n\nThe low points include certain scenes that made it into the final cut, such as the one where our main heroine stands at the top of the staircase, gun in hand, with ample opportunities to shoot Pooh and end the nightmare before her best friend loses her head right in front of her eyes.\n\nAnother perplexing scene is the one at the indoor pool. While one of the girls falls into the water, frightened by Piglet, and screams at him to leave her friend alone, she seems to do everything but try to run and escape. Somehow, a hulking Piglet, wielding a sledgehammer and chain, jumps into the pool, wades through the water at a pace slower than Andre the Giant, but catcher her nevertheless and nearly decapitates her with a mighty swing.\n\nLastly, what's with their intelligent yet brutal methods of killing? I thought going animalistic meant they kill and eat people for sustenance, not pressing a foot on a girl's back to prevent her from escaping while another drives a car over her head... massive 'facepalm'. Unfortunately, this film is rife with such moments that defy reasoning.\n\nI won't spend too much time discussing the acting. Nickolai Leon was serviceable, but apart from that, it's a rather sombre affair.\n\nAll in all, this doesn't come close to some of the trashy horror I've seen over the years. (I'm talking about you Unfriended and Invoked) However, it takes a freefalling nosedive by the end, and the more you contemplate the plot's meaning, the more absurd the entire film sounds.\n\n3/10."

What happened to you and your (beloved) kid-friendly franchise...\n\nAt first, when the movie was announced, I was pretty surprised to see how a supposedly kid-friendly franchise like Pooh, being turned into something animalistis and sadistic like this? But again, I'm always a positive person and will always welcome a new idea.\n\nSo, when the trailer first hit the internet, I saw it and kinda liked the idea to a point where I was pretty excited to see the outcome. But upon watching it, I finally realized that I've wasted 86 minutes of my life for a movie that's badly produced.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this movie actually has potential if executed properly. Gory and slasher movies still have great values, as long as it's executed nicely. Sadly, that's not the case with this one. Bad direction, bad lighting, bad script, bad story, bad acting, bad costume. Nothing good can be said about this one. Oh wait.. maybe one good thing is there: the killing and the gore.\n\nThings I really hated about the movie is mainly on the following:\n\n1. Actors and actresses who was pretty bland on the acting... 2. Terrible and inconsistent dialogue (10 minutes into the movie and I already felt like wanted to stop watching it because of the dialogue...) 3. Story which is under-developed 4. Bad costumes... (I mean, come on. In this era, where you can create a believable monster like Kingkong and Godzilla, but yet, the creatures just looked like over-juiced villain cosplaying as Pooh and Piglet, while going all Jason-esque style murder spree?)\n\nI'm sorry, but I really don't recommend it, unless you really have lots of free time to spare and don't mind your childhood lovable-stories got butchered and turned upside down into full gore-style killing spree genre.\n\nI still give it 3 stars out of 10, because I want to at least appreciate the idea, which again, is sadly, badly executed."

Embracing its ridiculous premise with gusto, the film delivers buckets of blood, guts, and laugh-out-loud moments that will leave you in stitches (pun intended) a d saying WTF!\n\nThe kills are gloriously over-the-top and gratuitous, ensuring that horror fans with a taste for cheesy carnage will be satiated. Despite its low-budget charm, the practical effects and makeup are impressively grotesque, providing a visceral feast for the eyes.\n\nThe acting is as cheesy as it gets, but that's all part of the fun. Watching beloved childhood characters turned into murderous psychopaths is a guilty pleasure, and the cast fully commits to their roles with tongue-in-cheek humor.\n\nDon't expect a deep, thought-provoking story, because \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is all about the gore-soaked spectacle. It's a riotous, tongue-in-cheek celebration of slasher cinema, and it doesn't take itself seriously for a single moment.\n\nI\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a gut-busting, cheese-filled slaughter through the Hundred Acre Wood that will have you laughing and cringing in equal measure. It's a perfect choice for horror fans who love their films extra bloody, extra cheesy, and extra outrageous. Just like an extra value meal topped up with extra cheese at your corner Burger King with an extra dose of gore-drenched fun."

His actions may unleash hell on Earth.\n\nThis picture is directed by Rhys Frake-Waterfield (The Killing Tree AND the upcoming Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 AND Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare) and stars Gillian Broderick (Alive), Paula Coiz (Tooth Fairy Queen of Pain), Chris Cordell (Curse of Humpty Dumpty 2) and Craig David Dowsett (Area 51 Incident).\n\nThis film had so much potential - great settings, characters, soundtrack, use of lighting, soundtrack and background music. I really enjoyed the sets; unfortunately, the acting and dialogue was mediocre to really bad. The scenes were so inconsistently executed. The opening kills before the credits, torture scenes and hot tub scenes could have been so much better. The \"I love you\" and pool kill are absolutely awful. I will say the ladies are gorgeous and the topless red head kill was awesome...but we needed way more of that. The masks worked for me but I could see why people may complain about them. The bee CGI sequence wasn't good.\n\nOverall, this is a movie that had the ingredients to be good but the budget to mess it up. I would score this a 4/10 but would still highly recommend it."

The film drags for most of its run time, with backstory that leads nowhere, entire scenes that feel added to pad out the run time, and plodding chases full of all the excitement of apple sauce day that the nursing home. Most of the kills were PG-13 level violence, and the gorier offerings were executed with cartoon-ish CG that blunted any shock value the filmmakers might have hoped for.\n\nThis movie could have been great had the filmmakers just gone all out and made the craziest film they could. Instead it feels tediously restrained. And given the threadbare nature of the story and entirely unsatisfying non-resolution to the story, I can't help but think they thought the concept and kills alone would get them by.\n\nI was really excited for this one, but left the theater seriously disappointed."

The movie only sells on its premise, and does nothing with it. Even if it was also stupid, 'The Mean One' was at least enjoyable because that film knew it would suck, so it just went nuts. And even so, it was still better. It's sad to see a movie and following, a whole cinematic universe with loads of potential fall on its face, but that's life. We can hope Rhys Frake-Waterfield learns from this, and makes a better sequel, along with a Bambi and Peter Pan movie, but I have my doubts."

The connection between Chris and Pooh seems like Chris can solve the situation but then is useless. It ended in a surprise and I can't wait for the next one to come.

It's more of a Holloween movie than a Jason or Evil Dead. But for a movie with a budget of only $15,000, they did a hell of a job. The biggest let down is, without spoilers, the movie feels like it's setting its self up for a final reveal (if you've ever read Winnie the Pooh) but doesn't deliver. If the reveal I was hoping for happened at the end, it would have been an easy 7 but its a solid 5 stars without it."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the expiration of the copyright of the Winnie The Pooh books and after a period of waiting, this macabre experiment finally arrives that transforms a children's story into something terrifying. Traditional tales used to be dark and terrifying in their origins until they became infantilized over the years. Now with this film the roles are reversed and it brings us something that is not surprising as it has generated a negative reaction in those who grew up with Winnie The Pooh. This film presents an alternate reality where Pooh and his friends are creatures of flesh and blood and while in the original stories they were stuffed animals that were probably figments of Christopher Robin's imagination. This new imagination presents a different approach to what would happen if Pooh and his friends were flesh and blood beings and if Christopher would not be present to continue caring for them. What we have is an independent film with an evident moderate budget that ends up offering a generic B-movie slasher. The Pooh and Piglet masks give these characters a rather bizarre touch. It uses a lot of practical effects and a little CGI. The truth is that it is an entertaining slasher film for those who like those types of films made in the old fashioned way. It has a very simple story without much to offer about the characters, since many of them are only there to be killed. The death scenes and gore look pretty decent. The script does not seek to give the plot a development, nor to be coherent, but rather to offer a typical slasher without more or less. The movie itself turns out to be bad, but Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey is one of those movies that are so bad that they end up being good. My final rating for this movie is a 6/10."

Some parts that I did not like were since that the cast are mainly females that it gets raunchy and overly sexual towards the male demographic audience. Speaking in a male's standpoint that it was just really cheesy. Not just that, but the acting was not that good either. It is a mid-level film of entertainment in my opinion.

Christopher Robin, who promised they would always be together, had to leave for college. They were abandoned, starved, ate one of the characters, and turned feral. Piglet has tusks. 5 years later, Christopher Robin returns to 100 Acre Woods with his sweetheart Mary, and she is killed, and he is tortured. Meanwhile, a group of young women rent a home nearby. Maria needs a break, as she was stalked. Doesn't work out well for them, and what is really bad about this is that the women characters are written as they only make bad decisions, they also scream a lot. In a way, that is adding insult to what has already insulted the audience, a terrible movie. Oh, one of the women has a gun. Since this is set in England, that is beyond belief. Even the killings are done badly, with terrible special effects. I don't give one stars easily, but I cannot go any lower on the IMDB rating scale. There are movies so bad they are good.

Winnie and Piglett look all right, it's explained that there animal hybrids, I think, all though some of Pooh's... abilities are a little questionable.\n\nI will say I was entertained, the climax is interesting, a little confusing at first, but I liked it.

For that I found it a really enjoyable silly dark romp. The narrative begining was out of place and unnecessary but I see what they tried to do with the original kids book material. I got more than I expected, it delivered more than just camp and backstory like malignant, didn't pretend to have twists, and didn't set out to be a cinematic gem. This movie simply is what it is and I enjoyed that. I'm looking forward to a rewatch when it's available for purchase."

I'll start with the good things: i honestly think that the costume is pretty badass and looks dope. The cinematography was actually pretty decent. I also really like the beginning that they're telling us how he started killing people. The kills were actually pretty creative and gory. The movie is so silly that it's just fun to watch and that's just my opinion. Now the bad stuff: the acting is cringe and bad, but it like didn't bother me or someting. This is like the kind of movie where the characters make the dumbest decisions. We need more plot in the movie, i mean it's the same the whole time: winnie the pooh is mad and goes around and kils people. Another stupid thing like how can winnie drive??? I also think that this movie would be better if all the friends from winnie would be in it and that they killed some people to. Overall it's just a silly movie but it's fun so i give it 3/5."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a disappointing addition to the beloved franchise,\n\nOne of the film's major flaws is its departure from the lighthearted and whimsical tone that fans of the franchise have come to love. Instead of the gentle adventures and endearing friendships that defined the original stories, \"Blood and Honey\" presents a dark and unsettling narrative that feels out of place in the Hundred Acre Wood.\n\nThe decision to introduce themes of violence and conflict into the world of Winnie the Pooh is jarring and unnecessary, undermining the innocence and simplicity that made the original stories so beloved. From bloody battles between the Hundred Acre Wood inhabitants to scenes of graphic violence, the film takes a dark and disturbing turn that is sure to leave audiences feeling uncomfortable.\n\nFurthermore, the characters themselves feel unrecognizable in this gritty reinterpretation. Winnie the Pooh, once known for his gentle nature and love of honey, is transformed into a serial killer with his friend Piglet, are stripped of their lovable qualities, replaced with one-dimensional caricatures devoid of the charm that endeared them to audiences for generations.\n\nIn addition to its misguided tone and characterizations, \"Blood and Honey\" suffers from a lackluster plot that fails to engage or captivate. The story meanders aimlessly from one violent encounter to the next, lacking the heart and depth that defined the original tales. With little emotional resonance or narrative cohesion, the film struggles to hold the audience's attention, ultimately feeling like a hollow and forgettable addition to the Winnie the Pooh canon.\n\nOverall, \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is a misguided and disappointing departure from the beloved franchise. With its dark and unsettling tone, one-dimensional characters, and lackluster plot, the film fails to capture the magic of the original stories, leaving audiences longing for the simpler and sweeter adventures of the Hundred Acre Wood."

No wonder is so over-hated, and plus. It's pretty fun and funny ! Really not a huge fan of all of that, but hey you can give it a try because this movie is a decent 5/10, acting is alr bloody, gross, fun, (a little gripping?) anyways.

        "review_detailed_main": "Now don't judge. You mustn't judge. If you do this will come across as the most atrocious piece of cinema since \"Mesa of Lost Women\" (1953). \"Christopher Robin\" (Nikolai Leon) is taking his fiancee back to the wood in which he played with \"Pooh\", \"Piglet\", \"Eyeore\" etc. As a child. What he doesn't appreciate, though, is that in the intervening years things got tough for his erstwhile friends. They couldn't fend for themselves, and were reduced to cannibalism to survive.... Aside from altering the balance of their tiny mids, this also instilled in \"Pooh\" and \"Piglet\" a grim and determined need for vengeance. What now ensues is hilarious. What ever budget there was must have been spent on gin for the cast: the costumes and lighting are pretty dreadful and the script - well that is almost as bad as the acting. Leon is quite easy on the eye, but the sight of him being whipped to within an inch of his life with the tail of \"Eyeore\" by a large man in an ill-fitting yellow bear suit whose mouth was oozing honey like a drooling bairn just has to be seen. Cinema can be too earnest and worthy at times, and I think this is the perfect recalibration for that - it is certainly neither, nor is it a film you will ever (want to) remember after you've seen it. Still, the cinema was packed and there was laughter a-plenty throughout the eighty minutes or so this risible drivel lasted. It could easily be a school project - nothing here is of an higher standard, and it did make me squirm at times as the 1970s \"Doctor Who\" special effects department came back to life - but I didn't hate it."

That's what brought me in! First off, there's not really much Winnie the Pooh as you know it beyond a quick backstory done with animated sketches. Other than that, this is just your run of the mill slasher movie. Nothing really new. The only Winnie the Pooh characters are Pooh and Piglet. Piglet is unrecognizable as piglet. I guess Winnie the Pooh is himself, but honestly, I'm not sure I'd know he was Winnie the Pooh if it wasn't in the title. I have a few issues with this move. First, it obvious they just used Winnie the Pooh so that people would watch the movie. Otherwise, it would just be another one of the hundreds of indy slasher movies out there to watch. Winnie and Piglet are just people in masks, so I had to keep reminding myself they were supposed to be themselves instead of men with masks on, but that was hard to do. What's next, a sequel for Cujo with Scooby Doo? I think this would have at least been more entertaining if they had all of the characters instead of just Winnie and Piglet."

With this getting almost zero stars from the get-go, I just had to see it. Only, I didn't want to pay $19.99 for a mere rental and had to wait until this finally dropped to $4.99. (Still too much to pay.)\n\nWinnie the Drool and Pigless terrorize some girls at a cabin. That's the non-spoilery gist. But, think: The youths took a Wrong Turn from the Texas Chain Saw Massacre on Halloween to use their Hatchet against Bebop.\n\nThere's tons wrong with the script, such as they never speak again until the plot needs them to. Also, there's a 5-year time jump post-cold-open and our \"hero\" can't seem to remember places he had visited his entire life up to half-a-decade ago. Really? And, there are four remaining Pooh characters and yet two completely disappear never to be heard of again. But, what can you expect. This 100% looked like an experimental Film School Thesis from a C+ student. So many shots were sooo artsy.\n\nAnd when I say those masks look bad, NO ONE in this cast or crew gave a blank about making them look anything but a fifty-cent rubber Halloween mask. This movie would've been 10x better had the killers just be humans with cheap masks on. They just had to make them \"real-life\" animal/human hybrids...for reasons. And don't get me started on the CGI...\n\nWhat I can say that's positive: I loved the cold/cartoonish opening and new backstory. Quite creative. But, then the movie began. Sigh.\n\nWinnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey isn't the worst movie I've ever seen and sadly I was kinda hoping for it to be. I really thought this was gonna be Jeepers Creepers: Reborn-bad. Nope. Not even in the same ball field.\n\nBut is it even so-so? No and so completely bland and unremarkable, it's not recommended. Those masks alone make this movie just so dumb. I only laughed once or twice. Don't ask me if that was the movie's intention or not. Haven't a clue.\n\n***\n\nFinal Thoughts: This reminded me of that Disneyland horror flick, Escape from Tomorrow. I understand some people like that movie. I couldn't stand it, at all. Way worse than this movie. So, see? Lower your expectations, like I had for Winnie the Pooh's first foray into horror and it's not the worst of the worst."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Winnie the Pooh -- Blood and Honey\" will probably shock a lot of viewers, given it is being characterized in the media as a \"fun horror flick with Winnie the Pooh.\" Fact is, it's a pretty shocking, deadly serious slasher movie with a hefty dollop of graphic violence.\n\nIn a cartoon prologue, we get the \"slasher event\" that kicks off the horror -- in this case, Christopher Robbins leaving his friends at \"100 Aker Wood.\" Unable the fend for themselves, they turn feral and become filled with rage. And when Christopher returns five years later he finds things have changed... a lot. At the same time, a woman named Maria is dealing with a stalker issue, and so she invites five of her friends to get away from the city. But unfortunately for them, they chose to go to a house at the edge of \"100 Aker Wood\"...\n\nPeople who go to \"Winnie the Pooh -- Blood and Honey\" expecting a comedy or parody or light entertainment are going to be stunned. This movie is bleak and nihilistic and takes its scares and kills seriously. The violence is graphic and in your face. There isn't a laugh or joke of \"wink to the audience\" in the entire film.\n\nNot to say that's bad -- quite the contrary. It's a fine addition to the horror genre, you just need to know what you're getting into. At the showing I went to, I sat in front of a group that was desperate for this to be a comedy, a couple of times they went into very forced laughter at a non-funny sequence and then were almost immediately stunned into silence.\n\nThe filmmakers took a risk -- the easy way is to make this a silly, lame \"horror comedy.\" Making this a flat-out horror film took guts and the result is worth it. It's clearly set up for a sequel (the end credits proudly say \"Winnie the Pooh Will Return\") and we can all look forward to it. Definitely worth checking out for horror fans!"

The characters we're supposed to care about are weird and make the same dumb mistakes every horror movie character does.

Overall they were just generic and after a point we didn't care for their eventual deaths.\n\nWith a low budget, this film feels a little rushed but that's expected.\n\nThere are some decent gory and bloody kills but a majority of what occurs has happened in slasher films before.\n\nAlso the film takes itself too serious. Perhaps they should have went for a more campy and funny tone. No memorable dialogue, no witty or clever humor. Everything was predictable. Very generic standard thriller.\n\nOne positive is the appearance of Winnie the Pooh (the mask looks great). Piglet looks more deformed and looks more like a boar. It's mask wasn't pink enough."

        "review_detailed_main": "After A. A. Milne's 1926 novel of Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain there are lots of opportunities for people to make their own kinds of adaptations of this story, so making a horror movie off this character is overall a weird idea, but depending on what you do with it you could make something at least interesting or entertaining to watch; after watching this movie, I will say that this is a bit worse than what I thought this low budget movie was going to be. In the horror film adaptation Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023) there are bad performances, bland characters, ok cinematography, harmful effects, unconvincing looking killers, brutal kills with horror movie tropes you have seen before, and an awful script with just cringe worthy lines of dialogue; what was the dumbest thing was that the film takes itself too seriously with this concept, instead of having fun with the concept and being aware of what it is.\n\nAll the lead girl characters are dumb, bland, and disposable people with bad performances that you could care less about, with there also being other random side girl characters who show up just to get killed off later in the film, along with them getting killed off easily and doing dumb things that gets themselves killed; the only character depth you get is that one of the girls had a traumatic past involving a creeper, which is why this group of characters are on a trip to this house in the woods, but it has little to do with anything so I did not care. Winnie the Pooh and Piglet in this are setup as anthropomorphic creatures which is why they look like they do, but the bad masks that look like they just found random masks online that were close enough to what the characters looked like, and their motivation for going feral makes sense despite sounding like a dumb reason; also, Winnie the Pooh gets a random ability near the climax of the film that was not setup at all, with him also being questionably very strong to kill people. Lastly, you have an awful performance from the actor playing Christopher Robin, with him barely being in the film except in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, and in the ending; the setup is that he leaves them alone for many years, and it makes Winnie the Pooh and everyone feral and mad at him.\n\nThough the kills in the movie are brutal and bloody, it starts out with some uses of practical blood effects then it uses bad CGI blood effects that was a bit distracting with every kill, along with there being weird looking CGI to just make Winnie the Pooh's face/mask change expressions and have his mouth open and close; the script for this movie was bad, like it needed to be rewritten or tweaked a bit more to make the dialogue better because it involves certain characters repeating themselves a lot to saying the most bland and dumb things. The movie starts with a quick backstory to setup what this movie is about, and at first, I thought it could work but after that it got worse with it leading to a rushed third act climax and an ending that does not feel like an ending and feels more like it just stopped; this movie took itself too seriously despite having an occasional that was a little entertaining or funny, but the only thing that was good enough was the cinematography with its nice shots of the woods and the house they stay in, despite there also being some bad editing throughout the film.\n\nThe film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023) there are bad performances, bland characters, ok cinematography, harmful effects, unconvincing looking killers, brutal kills with horror movie tropes you have seen before, fine cinematography, bad editing, and an awful script with just cringe worthy lines of dialogue; what was the dumbest thing was that the film takes itself too seriously with this concept and the bare minimum of what you could do with this idea, instead of having fun with it. I will admit that the idea could have worked and that there was effort put into this film by the director, but it did not work out that well which is why I am obviously not going to recommend this; if you want to check this movie out because of the concept, go ahead, but I still think this movie is definitely worth skipping."

Also, something that I noticed what that only Winnie, piglet, and eeyore In the movie, but rabbit and roo just kinda disappeared. The outfits too. Winnie was not in his iconic red shirt. A red flannel with overalls on!! Sound effects also sucked in some areas. Overall, glad I watched it, wasn't scary, but it was really funny."

It's just fun!\n\nUnfortunately the opening is a little flat and doesn't really show the actors at their best, the guy who plays Christopher really comes into his own later in the story.\n\nThe killing methods were varied and inventive with some interesting setups being paid off later.\n\nTo achieve a film of this level of polish in ten days, means sacrificing multiple takes. Which is probably the reason the performance can be a little wooden at times. It's still very enjoyable though, and I had the most fun watching a film I've had in a while!\n\nWith a decent budget allocated to the announced sequel, I have high hopes the minor issues will be ironed out and we'll have a new horror series with many more films to be made.\n\nAnyone who has rated this 1 star is acting in bad faith, there are a lot of strong elements that make this enjoyable and any horror fan should find this entertaining. I will be watching this again in the future and look forward to the sequel."

I originally had no plan of ever watching it, but it was on Peacock and I wanted to watch something that I could easily turn off if I needed to go somewhere. It wasn't great, but it had its moments.\n\nThe story they set up in the beginning is actually really cool. The idea of the characters losing all sense of humanity after being abandoned and having to eat one of their own for survival had me pretty hooked in the beginning. It was done through illustration, and it was an overall very solid beginning to a movie.\n\nThe problem is that it very quickly devolves into a boring slasher, where two characters just show up and murder people. They don't even explain where the rest of the characters are. It is just Pooh and Piglet walking around killing people. Where's rabbit? Where's Roo? Also, there is no real emotional attachment to any of the characters. They literally just exist to be killed by Winnie the Pooh. All the primary victims being women also feels a little weird. Men seem to only die if they get in the way of the killing of the women.\n\nEvery once in a while, they would try to delve into the original story line of abandonment, but every time, it is quickly pushed out of the way so that someone can be killed with a sledge hammer. It seems like they had a really solid idea, but then wanted to be the first ones to release a Pooh horror movie after it went public domain, so they just said, \"f it, who has the time to flesh out this story, let's just make them murder everyone.\"\n\nThis concept could have been fun and dark and thoughtful, but instead it is just a very generic slasher film. A silent killer that looks like Winnie the Pooh but could very easily be any silent killer. It was filmed well though, so that is another plus I guess. At least now I can say that I watched it. I don't plan on ever watching it again, but I don't feel as if it was a waste of time watching it."

The set pieces are kinda cool, though, and the gore is quite good.\n\nI think the original idea is very creative, but the execution lacks a little originality. There are a lot of nods to other movies of the genre, but they are done in a way thay you can't really tell if it's a homage or just a borrowed idea.\n\nI hope that for the sequel they work a little on the acting direction, we are not on the 80's anymore."

Using such a beloved, universally heartwarming series as fodder for a creepy horror film could have been a grand slam with imaginative subversions of the classic story, but this really just wasn't it. It really just felt like a cheap slasher movie where the killers looked like adult men wearing bear and pig masks. I will say though, the acting was better than I expected across the boards and the storybook opening sequence was pretty fun. Everything else, though, left a lot to be desired.\n\nI look forward to more clever public domain uses of Winnie-the-Pooh in the future and will almost certainly skip this film's sequel."

Or that bad, depending on your perspective.\n\nThere's basically no plot, as befits an heir to the Halloween or Friday the Thirteenth legacies, the blood effects are much better than I expected on the budget they had, and the references to other slasher flicks are not overly bold and in your face. They're ax-ually (Sorry) subtle enough that I'm pretty sure the rest of the audience was laughing with them like I was. There's very little dialogue and what there is is not awful. The acting is standard for the type of movie and not Tommy Wiseau bad.\n\nIt's bloody, which is to be expected and is probably best for fans of the genre, but it's far more amusing than most. I am definitely going to acquire a copy of this when it gets to home video.\n\nAnd why only 9 stars? The masks on Pooh and Piglet are pretty bad.

Where terrifier fills with blood and gore, this movie fills with atmosphere, dread, and unforgivingness. This movie offers some truly haunting imagery and horrific sequences. The storyline is so unique and dark that it adds such a layer of menace to Winnie the Pooh and Piglett. The opening sequence is so haunting when Winnie and piglett are slowly closing in on Christopher robin, and the scene when the girl sees Winnie in the woods and he just starts clog stomping towards her all crazy.. truly scary. This is a real horror movie with no strings atrached. It's cheap yes but it makes it all the more raw for that reason. This is the superior film between this and terrifier.

Yet despite the abject failure of much of the world, humanity, and entertainment in general in most genres and franchises, this movie at least set out to fulfill its promise of being a slasher revolving around the titular character. THat being said, it wasnt terrible tbh.\n\nThe location was a fairly nice track of wilderness, the masks worn by the \"animals/killers\" were actually decent. Oh and I didnt really notice any CGI It was all practical affects aside from some dripping blood or other effects here and there.\n\nIT really stuck to the mythos of the beloved childrens characters for the most part, and the sets they constructed seemed like they could have just been peoples camping grounds in their backyard, as much as where the killer animals dwelt. The story in theory is haunting and disturbing, not just for spitting int he faces and collective memories of a cherished, pristine, once untouchable franchise, but the way they explained the \"WHY\" of the film.\n\nThe lighting was good, especially at night, the flame effects and a lot of the gore and makeup was spot on. Honestly I give a lot of props to most of the actors like the dude that plays Christopher Robin, Pooh, and some of the gals and others in the movie. IT was basically just about killing innocence, but wow did it go the full 9 yards to do so.\n\nIf not for the parts of me that were kinda offended by the thought of Pooh BEar and Piglet being murderous, rampaging, stalker eaters of people, I might have given this a halr score or more higher rating. As it stands, its a 4.5 for what they did to poor Winniw The Pooh. An where the hell was Tigger and Owl?\n\nPooh was HUN-GRY FFS lol 4.5/10 ( but again might have been a 5.5 for the acting which was ok, but thos effects were pretty enjoyable, as was the scene craft and props.)

Hey idiot: You have a gun, and a clear shot at a barely moving target--SHOOT! No? Well after that, you deserve to die, and so does everyone else for being your friend. (That's the logic of the movie) We have no idea who the humans are. We get a little detail about one of the women having had a stalker, but that's it. The others are... ??? No clue.\n\nThe information in the intro animation is almost completely repeated by the dialog in the first scene, so... why do we need the same thing twice in rapid succession? It's almost like they showed it to someone, and their test audience said \"I don't understand.

I had absolutely no delusions of grandeur for this film. None whatsoever. Nevertheless, it was fun to watch. The concept of twisting favorite childhood characters into something murderous and terrifying is definitely fun and worth watching. The kills aren't anything terribly creative, but instead of being fast and shocking, they're slow and deliberate which adds to the overall brutality. In essence, don't watch it if you're an overt snob or if you're expecting something revolutionary. I do recommend watching it if you're a fan of things like Roger Corman and Lloyd Kaufman films."

This movie had so much potential to be one of the greats but it was just ok, I might watch it again in the future, or if there's a sequel I'll probably check it out."

The actors must have only got a few grand each and it supposedly grossed $5 million. Not a bad return.....for the money people and for them it was a result.\n\nMaybe entice better actors with a royalties payment, even 1% each for the main cast woulda been a great return."

It has to be one of the worst looking films ever shot with every scene glazed in the most unappealing filter available. As far as the plot, it involves some girls getting stalked by Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who are giant, indestructible man-like butchers. There are some kills, and each one is just about as pedestrian as possible. The only one that stands out involves a car and it is more silly than anything. I would urge anyone who has any curiosity about this movie to avoid it completely. There is nothing to gain by having seen it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, honest opinion here:\n\nIf you're expecting MCU, Warner Brothers quality horror movie, you will be disappointed because as some have already reviewed the filming isn't the best and it is low budget.\n\nThat being said, take into consideration that this is a small group of unknown actors who took a well known childhood classic and gave it a horror twist and frankly, I think they did a nice job with it. Pooh's appearance while silly, has an unsettling appearance, they give a few explanation as to why they go feral as well as to why Christopher befriended them and wants to believe that they can still be friends, there were some good gory kills (some a little silly but again, it's a low budget film and I've seen some awful death scenes before and I think they did a good job), and generally I think they did a good job keeping a cohesive story from start to finish, which is often a problem that happens with many low budget horrors. And personally, I love how Pooh only talks once in the movie so that we aren't bombarded with poor impressions of Winnie's voice, but instead have a raspy voice which fits the \"They swore to never speak again\".\n\nSo while this isn't a movie for everyone, I don't think it's awful. It's not the most amazing, but for what they had to work with, I think it's a fun little campy movie to watch on a night where you kind of just want to make your own Rifftrack of it."

As I said before, it's 2023, a better effort should have been made with this adaptation of Winnie the Pooh into the horror genre. Do we want to see this? Hell yeah, if it's done right, there's a good chance that it will become good enough for a multi-movie horror fest. Forget a sequel to this, just start a fresh with a bigger budget.

After five years, he returns with his wife after gaining some success writing about his animal friends. They are attacked by his old friends. Maria and her girlfriends are spending time at a nearby cabin after she experienced some creepy stalking. They and others become targets for the disturbing group.\n\nThis starts with a funny horror idea, but it delivers very little else. One could watch the first five minutes and that's the best of the movie. It has nothing left after that. It has no imagination. It tries to do a bunch of bloody kills. The characters aren't interesting or fun. They should have done it this way. Christopher Robin reads in the news that people are brutally killed near his 100 Acre Wood. He returns and becomes a Van Helsing type character. I actually wanted to see this movie for an unique reason. The news reported that this was banned in Hong Kong due to Xi's disgust with the Winnie the Pooh comparison. Maybe they could do something with that since I hear they are planning a sequel."

The one primary male character whined the whole time. I should have counted how many times he whined \"sorry\" and \"Pooh\" and \"why\".

He's a bear, there should be fur on him. I honestly think having a 'cutesy' looking yellow furry bear as an antagonist would have more of an effect. Piglet too, just looks ridiculous. Imagine the horror of seeing characters which at least resemble the original characters running amok with hammers and axes? It would be an amazing juxtaposition to see on screen.\n\nAll that aside, the acting in this just isn't very good. It's very clearly made made on the budget of a box of Quavers and can of 'Top Deck'. The lighting at times is absolutely terrible, the script is poor. Overall this is a disappointing film, which is a real shame, because i loved the idea of a slasher starring Winnie the Pooh."

Because now, once they showed us what happened, the story development just ended.\n\nSome of the kills were nicely gory, but somehow they were still lacking and felt too censored, as if someone was holding them back. Most of the characters were absolute morons, and there was no logic.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a mindless, bloody horror movie to watch with friends, this might be for you. However, if you're looking for something more substantial, you might want to look elsewhere. It's not a movie to be taken too seriously, but if you're willing to throw your brains out for a while, it can be a fun ride.\n\nJust an average B-class horror movie. Definitely not worse than Cocaine Bear and this is somewherre between 4-5 stars."

For starters, the individual murder scenes were spot on, even though expected, they were gruesome because they were slow and detailed and didn't hold back.\n\nHowever the whole thing was held up nicely due to the outstanding cinematography. There were many scenes that I would happily have as a desktop background. I sometimes paused to appreciate a scene.\n\nEven some of the drone shots were quite inventive.\n\nI feel torn, between having been entertained and thinking a 6 year old could have written a better film and acted better.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it as the slasher and eye candy it was, and would have given it more, but can't due to the absolute train wreck it was at the same time."

        "review_detailed_main": "A group of young women spending time in a house near 100 Acre Wood are attacked by Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who have gone feral after being abandoned by Christopher Robin.\n\nWinnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey has received a great deal of coverage solely for the fact that it subverts children's favourite Winnie The Pooh, turning the once cuddly bear into a brutal killer-this made possible after the character fell into the public domain.\n\nSo what does the film offer besides its novel premise? Well, there's some reasonable gore, as Pooh and Piglet, wielding machete and sledgehammer, whittle down the victims, and there's some brief gratuitous nudity; however, I think that, given the ridiculous nature of the film, the level of blood and boobs could have been upped to make the film a far more trashy treat.\n\nUnfortunately, the film also delivers wooden acting and terrible writing, with two-dimensional characters who act like morons, and plenty of inconsistencies and gaffs (is Hundred Acre Wood in the UK? If so, why does one character refer to petrol as 'gas'? And how does one of the girls have a gun?). Having introduced the human characters, the script goes nowhere, content to simply bump off the girls one by one, which soon becomes boring. Rhys Frake-Waterfield's direction is passable, but genuine scares are in very short supply.\n\nIt's a shame, because this film's version of Pooh is a fairly creepy creation, like Leatherface, but with a little black nose, wiggly ears and a taste for honey. Because of the media exposure the film received, the film has managed to turn a tidy profit (nearly $5m on a $100k budget), meaning the inevitable sequel is already in the works. Let's hope that a bit more attention is given to the script next time around, and that they dial up the trashiness, making the sequel the enjoyably over-the-top slice of excess that it deserves to be."

I even watched Jason X earlier in the day just because, and that dumpster fire of a movie is WAY more entertaining. If you want to see it for yourself, okay, but honestly, you can totally skip this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023) is a horror film directed by Rhys Frake-Waterfield and written by Waterfield and Mark Gooder. The film stars Rhys Frake-Waterfield, Jack Holden, and Suzanne Maddock. The film follows Pooh and Piglet as they become feral and bloodthirsty after Christopher Robin leaves them.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2023, and in the United States on August 25, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its originality and others criticizing its poor acting and direction.\n\nThe film's plot is simple but effective. Pooh and Piglet become feral and bloodthirsty after Christopher Robin leaves them. They then go on a rampage, killing anyone who gets in their way. The film is well-paced and suspenseful, and the kills are gory and satisfying.\n\nThe performances are mixed. Frake-Waterfield and Holden are both adequate as Pooh and Piglet, but they lack the charisma and charm of the original characters. Maddock is the best of the bunch as Christopher Robin, but she is not given much to do.\n\nThe direction is uneven. Frake-Waterfield does a good job of creating a sense of tension and suspense, but he also makes some poor choices, such as using shaky cam and quick cuts.\n\nThe visual effects are decent. The gore is realistic and the kills are well-executed. However, the CGI is not always convincing, especially when it comes to the animals.\n\nOverall, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is a mixed bag. It has some good qualities, such as its originality and its gore, but it also has some poor qualities, such as its acting and its direction. If you are a fan of horror films, then you may enjoy this film. However, if you are looking for a well-made and faithful adaptation of Winnie the Pooh, then you will be disappointed.\n\nThe film's box office success is likely due to its novelty. People were intrigued by the idea of a horror film based on Winnie the Pooh, and they were not disappointed. The film made over $10 million at the box office, which is considered a success for a low-budget horror film.\n\nOverall, I would give Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey a 5 out of 10. It has some good qualities, such as its originality and its gore, but it also has some poor qualities, such as its acting and its direction. If you are a fan of horror films, then you may enjoy this film. However, if you are looking for a well-made and faithful adaptation of Winnie the Pooh, then you will be disappointed."

They kill several and attempt to kill several others. I wouldn't say the film is a waste like other viewers did it's just very gritty. Ok horror film to view once."

They are repetitive, unnecessary, redundant, meaningless. The plot is so bad that it's not even unintentionally funny. The masks, which really shouldn't look like masks, are also horrible. In short, it's a long list of bad aspects, bad sensations, bad executions that encompass a disastrous film from every angle you look at it.\n\nI recommend it only for those who like movies that are so bad that they are good, although this one is not even mediocre.\n\nIt goes right to the bottom of all my rankings."

Instead, it's better to theorize that this is going to be something that allows itself to have fun and come in and out of your live on a boring Monday night, never to be forgotten but with little memory to live on.\n\nHaving watched this movie now I have a difficult time placing it. As silly as it is and as much fun as it wants to have, and it does have its fun, believe it or not this movie still manages to take itself a little too seriously for its own goods. They were never going to pull off genuine scares or worthwhile storytelling in this one so why even try? The best moments of the movie are when it lets itself go and have some fun, which is exactly what it should be doing, but its weaknesses come in when it wants to be a real horror movie. That just doesn't work with something like this unless there are some truly gifted minds behind it.\n\nI don't give it a 3 because I had my expectations set high for something incredible. I give it a 3 because it failed to deliver on the fun it promised just by existing."

Except for Eeyore, they never explained why the others, Owl and Rabbit, did not appear in live action fraction (possibly just for budgetary reasons; Tigger, Kanga and Roo are not even mentioned). The human guys with bear and pig masks were tremendously ridiculous. I simply cannot believe that even a B-film producer from Great Britain does not have enough money for at least rent adult full costumes for presenting properly Pooh and Piglet. Considering the exploitation I just watched, the guy, Rhys Frake-Waterfield, also seem to be a mysoginist (I do not want to imagine what he may have done to Wendy and Tinkerbell in his horror spoof of Peter Pan). The great amount of clich\u00e9s you may find in this Z-movie have already been assembled in a much better way in several formulaic mainstream films before. It was amazing how every single character stopped to see the others being beaten and killed, instead of running the faster they could (very few times someone tried to help; therefore, it was just just that same morbid curiousity that makes drivers stop the car or drive slower when they see victims after traffic accidents). To resume, what is the moral of the story, after all? I guess it is a warning about the importance of learning how to swim. You may need that skill if an anthropomorphic pig attacks you with a maul in a swimming pool. You never know..."

As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.\n\nSo why do I give it a 10? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.\n\nIn short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all.

Unfortunately majority of the viewers disliked it, but I know there are few fun people out there who enjoyed it.\n\nSome critics called it misogynistic and gory, and gave it 1/5. Well, yes, it was gory. Misogynistic? Hell no. You guys need to do better to discredit this movie. I mean, I noted that point when I was reading a review and I specifically looked for it while watching. I did not see it at all. Men and women were equally treated here. The people who said that it has ruined their childhood and was unnecessary, you adult-babies are soft as sponge. You know you are allowed to not watch this if you feel uncomfortable. I didn't watch the live action of Scooby-Doo for similar reason. Some people are living inside a rigid moral fence. Come out of it. It is a \"horror\" movie. Dark comedy is a thing.\n\n2023 wasn't a great year for horror. This movie saved it from becoming one of the worst years for horror fans. I'm happy there are directors who utilise the opportunities like these."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the poster for this movie, I figured that it was a fun thing to make a movie about. However, I have to say that I wasn't harboring much of any high hopes or expectations to the movie, because it just seemed to have things stacked against it.\n\nBut as I had the opportunity to watch the movie, of course I did. And yeah, \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" from writer and director Rhys Frake-Waterfield is every bit as you would expect it to be. So don't hold your breath here hoping for a great movie.\n\nThe storyline in the movie was shallow, if not actually downright laughably stupid. Sure, in concept the idea of the creatures of the 100 Acre Forest growing full of hate and resentment after being abandoned when Christopher grew up actually seems like a fun idea and an interesting enough concept. However, the transition from script to movie just didn't make for an overly entertaining movie.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were actually fair enough. Sure, the actors and actresses didn't really have much of anything to work with, but they managed to put on good enough performances nonetheless.\n\nWhat does work for the movie are some of the kill scenes. I have to say, as a lifelong gorehound, then some of the slayings in the movie were actually interesting to watch and executed, pardon the pun, nicely on the screen. But that was essentially also all that \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" had going for it.\n\nVisually then \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" was a bag of mixed nuts. Piglet and Pooh looked awful, especially with those inarticulate latex masks the actors were wearing. It was just so difficult to take them serious and buy into them being the once-beloved Piglet and Pooh characters. Some of the gore and mayhem during the killing scenes were quite good though.\n\n\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is not a movie that impressed me, and it actually was everything I had initially feared. And while I did manage to sit through the 84 minutes, then I can honestly say that I am never returning to it a second time. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend you waste your time, money or effort on.\n\nI will say that \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" is actually a droning, monotonous experience of a movie, because the narrative settles into a gearless slump and never goes up or down, the characters in the movie were generic and made some very stupid decisions and actions. And there weren't any thrills or excitement to be found throughout the 84 minutes of monotonous storytelling.\n\nMy rating of \"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" lands on a three out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "4/10. So now someone made a micro budget horror movie based on an interesting premise. For 2023, beloved children's character Winnie the Pooh turns into a blood-thirsty, murderous creature. Also, Piglet is on this insane, low budget ride. Please keep in mind that this film was made under 100K.\n\nIt is a good, well made movie? Nope, it is not. Is it a so bad that its good movie? Meh, not really; only time will tell. It's a fun, twisted idea to turn beloved family characters into angry, gore hound villains though. Some of the kills are ok but were really held back due to the small budget. This film did have a couple of jump scares and some gory scenes. I'm trying to not judge this too harshly considering. Surprisingly, the music and cinematography were quite well done. The \"masks\" for the creature are quite goofy and comedic.\n\nBiggest problem was that it is way too dark in much of the movie. Literally, there are a couple of scenes that are hard to tell what's going on. The characters you just don't care about, there are some awkward cuts, some of the character's decisions don't make any sense, the plot is quite dumb, and that low budget 80's horror charm wasn't there. I hope that for the sequel and their expanded horror universe; they get a bigger budget and better script polishing.\n\nI support this type of film making and only hope it gets better on for the filmmakers. Honesty, my expectations were quite low and I just wanted to have fun watching it. It was kind of fun but felt like they should have had more fun and humor in it. Just set your expectations low and don't think too much about it."

The kills are excessive, which is what you want in a film like this. If you're squeamish, be prepared going in.\n\nOverall, this movie wasn't as interesting or as suspenseful as it could've been, even with a weak plot. There isn't much buildup so it there just isn't enough time for the movie to be scary or creepy. If you're looking for a B grade slasher flick with gore porn and tolerable-ish acting/characters, you may enjoy this."

The characters weren't very interesting, nor well-developed and not really likeable. The filming location of the movie was just a house in the middle of the woods, nothing new. The casting of the movie was just some amateur actors and actresses and their acting wasn't really good... The killcount of the movie was really bloody and gory, but most kills weren't realistic at all. The opening scene of the movie was ULTRA CRINGE and I didn't really enjoyed it. The ending scene was kinda unexpected, but it was so silly and I didn't really care what was gonna happen, lol. Overall, it was a low budget horror movie that had a terrible concept and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Last but not least, I'm still kinda shocked that there's gonna be a sequel, literally WTF."

The thrill you usually would get loving horror movies. The chase scenes weren't good. Its way better when the killer creepily walks while you run luring you somewhere you can't escape out of but instead the killer just full on sprinted towards the victim.

I agree with most of review here that they should have focus on Christopher Robin or make it as dark humour. The character development of those ladies are not great, the acting is bad and underwhelming, I know they are disposable characters but still you want to see some sort of personality of those characters, but no, no such thing.

Obviously Pooh we grew up on was stuffed animals. That Eeyore you couldn't eat as he was made of sawdust. So this C. Robin finds these animals, befriends them leaves them etc. I did like the old truck that was in the woods. Ties with good slashers; woods where people disappear so let's go stay at a cabin in those woods. Don't care for cartoony work at the beginning. These humanoids hateful things are killing people esp women. No interesting kills here. They've been throwing people in wood chippers for years. No sex scenes, sadly, and no gorgeous killer in a mask. I will say this for a big guy, Pooh could move. He was a hauling it thru those woods. Movie is like Halloween 3, the one that had nothing to do with Michael Myers. This had nothing to do with the Pooh we love and know. Kind of liked it. Hope they do another. How about a rabid Scooby Doo. Hope he does Bambi as promised now that one will be good, been dealing with deer poaching on my land for years. Deer do need to take up arms.

Bring it on!\n\nBlood & Honey follows Christopher Robin, as he returns to his childhood home. Growing up with Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore, he eventually left to go to university, and now years later has returned to introduce his girlffiend to his childhood friends. Thing is, the gang were not able to fend for themselves, and ended up eating Eeyore just to stay alive. Growing to resent Christopher for leaving them and having to kill their friend to survive, Pooh and Piglet are now somewhat unhinged and very, very murderous...\n\nThis film was utterly decimated by critics upon release, but I wasn't put off as cheap shlocky horror movies never go down well with critics. I was completely on board with this concept and more than a little curious so I decided to check it out.\n\nI really wanted to like this film, but boy does it make that difficult. I actually laughed out loud at how absolutely AWFUL the dialogue is. If you ever watch it, just listen to the lines Chris Robin's girlfriend says at the beginning! Who even talks like that!!!!? And it's not just her, nobody in this film talks like a real person. Yes, this film isn't the only one that suffers from bad dialogue, but DAMN... it's really jarring...\n\nThat aside, the film seems to be going for your typical Texas Chainsaw vibes... and Pooh and Piglet are so typecast as psychotic hillbillies that they could easily just be generic humans and it wouldn't matter. The fact that they are humanoid pigs and bears doesn't really serve much purpose in the film itself beyond the initial set up. They just look like humans wearing masks (which with a budget this low is probably exactly what they are).\n\nSome pretty grim kills aside, this film doesn't really do anything that a billion other slasher movies haven't already done much better. The characters are all unlikable and have zero depth, the location is cliche and everyone is either dumb, annoying or both - including the killers. Amazingly, this film somehow got a sequel that is allegedly much better. Well... it can't be much worse..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The critical consensus is just \"Oh, bother\", Pooh's famous catchphrase, and that should give an idea as to how bad the movie is - as per the critics at least. But even the audiences have given it a 58 per cent rating. Blood and Honey became possible because the copyright for the original stories and related illustrations by EH Shepard entered the public domain in the United States in 2021, 95 years after their first publication. This means that anyone is free to use the characters and stories in their own works without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. And writer-director Rhys Frake-Waterfield chose the moment to make a movie about Pooh and other inhabitants of Hundred Acre Wood psychopathic murders. The movie was said to be a retelling of the stories. In this adaptation, it's revealed that Christopher Robin and his animal friends did have all those adventures during Robin's childhood, but as he grew up and went to college, the animals became increasingly hungry and feral. Eventually, they became so deranged that they terrorise a group of girls who are staying in a rural cabin. It's even getting a sequel, but the initial reactions to this horror movie, which we've cobbled together below, have been less than kind with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 9% at the time of writing. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey wastes an immediate-draw title on an underbaked, low-budget horror blunder that's rougher than sandpaper. Outside of a few good kills, even horror fans just looking for mindless slaughter will probably be frustrated by Rhys Frake-Waterfield's unimpressive and unamusing adaptation. Every choice becomes more baffling than the last, as if attention was only paid to how much gore slathers the screen rather than, for example, making the title character look better than something you might pull off the shelf at a Spirit Halloween shop in early November. Not every horror film needs an airtight approach and Oscar-worthy composition, but it's a crushing disappointment after Blood and Honey's delightfully twisted elevator pitch grabbed so much attention that it seems to struggle to succeed at even the most basic movie-making elements. \"Oh bother?\" Try \"Why bother.\""

And more competently crafted overall.\n\nI expected \"Blood & Honey\" to be an appalling visual experience because of the bad reviews here but in the end I actually kind of liked it. I am actually glad with my purchase of the Italian steelbook edition.\n\nFor me, the movie doesn't seem so ultra low-budget - kind of college-kids material like \"Book of Monsters\". And to be honest, even my girlfriend thought that the bunch of girls acted in a more realistic manner than young women in any other modern horror movie.\n\nLike, these days all we get to see is skinny 50 kg & 1.60-metre tall gals successfully fending off and plucking up in Street Fighter fashion all those 110 kg & 1.90-metre tall male monster villains... As if throwing a kick to a male figure that size wouldn't most probably result in a fracture of their shin.\n\nMost regular people over Britannia do not take kung Fu lessons or happen to be so determined, bold, cool-headed and supernaturally strong as say... Selene in Underworld. To take but an example.\n\nAll in all a B or Z movie I would most probably revist again in the future over some pizza and a beer."

The script also was very generic and could have been more satirical. Another problem I faced with the film was that, the entire time, I couldn't tell if the directors knew JUST how bad of a film they made or not, but I guess that just made it even funnier in my opinion."

Did you notice any relationship connection between the women or just the lesbians?\n\nI have other questions but I will pin it there.\n\nI am not historically a fan of horror, mostly due to the obvious ...the killing and blood, the times when women run and fall right in front of the murderer, the intense music that makes you know someone is going to get it; it is all so heart pounding. But, my daughter loves old horror films and I take her when I know it will be the fakest scenarios ever. That way I'm not afraid at bedtime. Did I hide my eyes from time to time, yes. I also found that I laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of some of the scenes? Who responds that way to a nearby threat?? That type of action and those types of responses made me remember that this IS JUST ENTERTAINMENT!!!\n\nI liked this film. Will I ever rent an Air BnB in the middle of nowhere??? Heeeck no!

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher was always the least interesting character in the 100 acre wood. That he should not play a major role is a plus. That they've re-imagined the lead characters is also a plus. But the dialogue is mediocre and the acting sub-par. The entire concept is a gimmick. But so what? It's a horror film. It's fun, not philosophical. Their choice of characters, however, seems rushed and unoriginal, as if they hurried to be the first out of the gate once public domain took effect. Can't fault them for that, but hopefully the sequel will improve on that. If not, there will be others. Now that the stranglehold has been released, who knows where it will go?\n\nThe fact that any giant conglomerate can claim ownership to other people's creative works, after stealing them and irreparably changing the very nature of them, only proves that they deserve to have their name buried in obscurity. And by obscurity, I mean the cesspool of all the putrid bowdlerizations ever thrust upon the unsuspecting childhood of every unfortunate being unlucky enough to have been exposed to its toxic banality.\n\nSo, if creative works can't be protected from the unscrupulous moneybags of unoriginal saccharine filth. More power to the independent purveyors of somewhat less unoriginal filth. There's more creativity in a simple brush stroke of a small group of film makers than in any giant corporation with all their algorithms, marketing research and influence on artificially deflated rating systems. How does a 6.6 become a 3.4? Bags of money."

It was sad that they had to eat Eeyore. I thought Maria & her friends would survive against Pooh & Piglet, but boy was I wrong. I watched the sequel, but you'll have to wait to see my thoughts on that movie. Now, how would I rate this movie? I guess I'll rate it a 7/10.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure what people expected from Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey. I mean, it's a slasher film about a twisted version of Pooh, so why were people expecting something different? Critics have been harsh, and honestly, I don't get why. Trust me, I was one of the first to think this movie would be terrible, but after finally watching it a year after its release, I was pleasantly surprised. While it's far from perfect, the movie does a lot of things right.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated about Blood and Honey is that it doesn't waste time with unnecessary details. The filmmakers committed to their wild idea and took it as far as they could. It's clear they knew exactly what kind of movie they wanted to make.\n\nI guess some people expected to hear Winnie the Pooh talking like in the cartoons, but I'm glad they decided to keep the \"monsters\" silent. It adds a creepy element to their personalities and enhances the horror aspect. For a concept that many thought was stupid, they managed to create something fun and engaging. If you enjoy slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with this one. Sure, there's gore-plenty of it-but what did you expect from a film called Blood and Honey?\n\nWhat I really liked was the break from typical slasher clich\u00e9s. Instead of the usual teens having sex before the killing spree, we get a group of women on a quiet retreat. It works well, and the change of setting adds something fresh to the genre. The actresses give decent performances-not amazing, but definitely good enough for a movie like this.\n\nI also loved the ending. It was bold and didn't follow the cowardly, safe choices we often see in horror movies.\n\nSo, if you're into slashers, don't let the harsh 2/10 reviews turn you away. That rating makes no sense. I've seen films that deserve less than zero, and Blood and Honey is far from that."

The cinematography was excellent. Some movement shots were a bit dicey but the angles were great so maybe with a bit more money or time those could be perfected? Gore was well done without being overly gratuitous; super gross when necessary and yet not buckets of blood just for the sake of it. Not a ton of jump scares but a nice amount of the stalker vibe shots, especially the hot tub scene."

Which brings me back to the why not. It was so ridiculously far fetched fantasy story book twist on something loveable. It was devilish in comparison to adorable. It had some classic moments where the evil plays a little soft for a moment but then recalls the real mission. If you enjoy a well done rarity of gore. Go ahead."

The actors all played their parts well and the flow of the movie was at just the right pace.\n\nI would not recommend for kids as the killing is extremely brutal with little to no hesitation on the killers part. I told my own children this movie will give them nightmares.\n\nOverall I think it was really well done and may watch again in the future. The brutality alone should put goosebumps on your arm or be the reason somebody holds onto you more tightly."

        "review_detailed_main": "I heard about this movie last year and some peoples saying it was one of the worst movie ever made and such. I really don't understand where these critics come from.\n\nNumber three on my Halloween watchlist this year, i was in the mood for something short that i could turn my brain off and just have a quick fun, and i got it with this.\n\nLike sure, its not without faults. For instance the concept of the characters is barely used and for 95% of the movie, it could had been any generic slasher monsters and it would had done the same thing. None of the human characters were particulary developed or made me care much for them either.\n\nBut for 100 000$ this movie had some very decent kills, and ultimately thats what you want in a slasher movie before anything else... Not every kills landed. Some were \"off camera\" probably to reduce cost, but some were very solid.\n\nI don't think any of the special effects were bad per say. Maybe at times the camera was a bit shaky and sure its not the best direction i ever saw, but for a 100 000$ b-slasher, i think it was more than alright.\n\nOverall i enjoyed my 90 minutes watching this. Will it become a cult classic for me? Absolutely not. But it surely do not deserve the hate it got.\n\nI try to keep one movie per franchise per year in my halloween watchlist so i will likely wait til next year to watch the sequel, but its one im interest to see.\n\nPeoples had just too high expectations. I assume they either wanted a complete spoof/delirium movie, or something that looked like it was made with 20 millions. This is neither of it. Its threaten as a regular slasher with seriousness, it has its fair share of blood and gore, and its done on a very small budget. Take it or leave it."

        "review_detailed_main": "When this movie was first announced, I was unironically excited to see it. First off, I am a massive fan of the world of Winnie the Pooh and his friends, I've watched the movies and episodes of different TV shows. Second, I was interestee in the idea of seeing Winnie the Pooh as a horror villain. Now don't get me wrong, this is a horrible movie in every aspect of filmmaking, but this is one of those movies I unironically loved when I first watched it back in 2023.\n\nPositives for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023): First off, I have to give props to Rhys Frake-Waterfield for actually making this movie happen in the first place because not many filmmakers are given the chance to make the movies they want to make. This movie was fun to watch. I am also very impressed with how Rhys Frake-Waterfield actually got to film the movie in the location of the actual Hundred Acre Woods. And finally, there are some decent kills in the movie.\n\nNegatives for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023): This movie was made on a cheap budget and it shows in the final product. Also, there are a number of scene with CGI gore.\n\nOverall, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023) is a horrible movie, but it's a horrible movie that I kinda had fun with."

It's obviously not cinematic gold, but it's fun! It's what it's meant to be!\n\nIf you're a fan of slasher movies, I'd definitely recommend. I don't get the low reviews! There must be a following of some sort, since there is now a Blood and Honey 2.\n\nI feel like standards are way too high, considering what the film is about. I've sat through some terrible movies, that had far higher ratings than this movie.\n\nQuality isn't bad, acting isn't superb, but makeup and the graphics, it's a solid slasher film! Give it a try!"

There is a reason why it made so much money. The pooh bear costume is very realistic and creepy. The characters are very life like. The movie is full of suspense gore and nudity, with a good story line starter. It basically has all the elements of a 90's horror classic, I would bet all my money that we will see many more sequels to come. Apparently the 2024 part 2 sequel is already doing very well. You should watch this before watching part 2 to give yourself some context."

However if you go into this knowing it's more funny than scary and have the popcorn ready you can definitely enjoy it! It's cheesy and gory. Dialogue leaves a lot to desire but it's fun. Something that (for us twisted minds) have always wanted to see. What happens when Christopher grows up and the gang is left to their own devices.\n\nI think people expected too much from this. I mean seriously. It's a movie about child book characters that grow up to be cannibals. And they didn't have the budget of avengers for special effects."

The story is a bit incoherent and some parts you just have to figure out for yourself but there is allot of killing and violence. The bad masks don't help and I figure that the no-talking-bit is because the actors would have problems making themselves understood if there were any kind of dialogue. Somewhere I read that there might be a second part in the making and I hope it will be just as badgood..."

But you have a slasher genre horror movie with the main bad guy being a dark version of Winnie the Pooh, not the cuddly character we remember from.our childhood. Some really good bloody deaths, bit of tension and some annoying characters that i couldn't wait to be taken out. All of which is what i look for in a movie like this. I mean what were y'all expecting? It is what it is, Can't wait for the second one."

Story is silly, but hey, do you remember that you're watching WINNIE THE POOH BLOOD AND MAGIC on a limited budget? Id say that story is kinda charming in a way, it;s both silly and stupid but in the end, its just an excuse to make some really dark scenes fueled by excessive gore with winnie the pooh. And these are really well shot and creative. I love that the movie goes straight to it instead of pretending that it will have some well built characters and story\n\nIm mad at people reviewing this movie. How on earth ppl love Terrifier and hate this? God bless."
