A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of \"the middle children of history\" generation.\n\nAfter that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.\n\nStill took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.\n\nIt's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club."

Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.\n\nEdward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.\n\nAn absolute classic."

Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been \"asked\" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.\n\nPerhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.\n\nI would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves \"Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not.\" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.\n\nAs David Berman once said: \"I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming.\" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.\n\nL."

        "review_title": "a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Fight Club\" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the \"Choose life,\" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of \"Trainspotting,\" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of \"Seven\" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of \"The Game\" and assembled his strongest effort to date. \"Fight Club\" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes \"Fight Club\" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? \"Fight Club\" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with \"Kalifornia\" and \"Twelve Monkeys\", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the \"Legends of the Fall\" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what \"Fight Club\" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, \"win.\" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes \"Fight Club\" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens."

The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.\n\nIt's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.\n\nWithout giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.\n\nThe first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club. And I'm happy to be done talking about this one for a good long while."

Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that \"but\" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze.

At times it is genuinely outrageous, and therein is its monumental appeal.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter steals so many films, and she's terrifiic here, but it's the combination of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt that makes the film, they are outstanding, I still think it's Norton's best performance to date.\n\nThe wonderful, late Meatloaf adds a nice bit of humour.\n\nThe moral of Fight Club......don't have the soup.\n\n10/10."

Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways."

It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times. In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something. I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.\n\nSo, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign. The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters. This is one of the most underrated movies I know.\n\nI always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both. Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out."

But then something happened.....I actually watched it. I thought the movie was genius. It wasn't so much about fighting. It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia. Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly. Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep. With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems. I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand. Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (\"No great war to fight, no great depression\"), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which \"borrows\" ideas from Dostoevsky's \"The Double\" and puts some \"Thus spoke Zarathustra\" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about \"Fight Club\". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc\u0085.\n\nWhen all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images\u0085) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, \"Fight Club\" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe \"go let it out\" or \"if it feels good do it\". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!\n\nIt begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. \"I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom\", he reasons. Until\u0085..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.\n\nThe story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.\n\nSoon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!\n\nThe rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.\n\nIn the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal \"Being John Malkovich\" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to \"Fight Club\" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices."

In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life. The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends. The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value. My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.\n\nThere has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999."

Also great about Fight Club is its soundtrack performed by the Dust Brothers and especially the song 'Where is my mind' by the Pixies which really fit to the end of the movie. Unfortunately Fight Club didn't have much success in Germany but anyway the movie got best reviews of the German press. I also have to mention the brilliance of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt who plays best in roles in which he performs the villain. But it's quiet amazing what Edward Norton is able to do - he is just overwhelming. For that role he has to get the oscar."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period. I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film. The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting. The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, \"narrator\". It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life. In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes. The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues. We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety. Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story. This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance. Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose. I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD. Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book. If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film."

It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie.\n\nCan't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.\n\nI unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is an American film directed by David Fincher. It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter are perfectly cast as the three lead characters.\n\nNarrator(Edward Norton) is an unnamed ordinary guy who works for an insurance company. He makes a decent salary, he can afford every material good the heart could desire, but the man is deeply depressed and develops insomnia.\n\nThe Narrator starts attending self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people in these groups and meets another 'fake' named Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter).\n\nHis life changes when he meets a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden being a rebel and an anarchist convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots. Then Tyler and The Narrator realize that they love fighting because it makes them feel alive and \"real.\" After that Durden decided to start fight clubs across the country; and eventually turns the clubs into aggressive criminals releasing their hatred on corporate America.\n\nEverything is amazing about this film: the gripping plot, the acting, the soundtrack, the plot twist. I wanna talk more details but we all know rule #1.\n\nMy only criticism would be that I can't erase my memory and watch it for the first time again.\n\nNot only is this a complex and absolutely thrilling film, but also it's thought-provoking and tackles some seriously deep issues, such as social pressure, consumer culture and radicalization.\n\nStrongly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.\n\n10/10."

Yes, the movie is good with solid acting, good plot, and great shots. However, it is just missing something for me now. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it is the last 30 minutes or so. The ending just felt rushed to me when certain things are starting to make sense for the main character."

Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool. Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.Essential Hollywood film of 1999."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's a challenge to say something new about a cult classic like \"Fight Club,\" but here goes: after all these years, the story seems to have lost some of its punch. The film, which once felt groundbreaking and audacious, now reveals itself as inconsistent and repetitive.\n\nEdward Norton plays the anonymous \"Narrator,\" a man so revolted by consumerism that he channels his frustration into rage, because, you know, being male and self-centered, what else can he do? He starts attending support groups to vent his feelings, only to have his emotional outlet spoiled by the arrival of Marla, another \"tourist\" in the world of misery.\n\nThen, during a business trip, he meets Tyler Durden, who has a \"briefcase exactly like his\" (wink, wink). They start a \"fight club,\" where disaffected men gather to beat each other senseless. Sure, it's a healthier alternative to domestic violence, which remains inexplicably popular. After plenty of bruises and a descent into squalor, things escalate with Project Mayhem, a ludicrous plan to obliterate consumer society and return us to a prehistoric paradise, because life was just grand back then.\n\nNorton's Narrator is suitably neurotic and deranged, while Brad Pitt's Tyler is the charismatic, nihilistic antihero we all secretly wish we could be (minus the nihilism and the fighting, of course).\n\nThat's the gist, delivered with exceptional visual flair and style. I loved the film on my first watch, but subsequent viewings made me realize how underdeveloped and catty the Marla character is (with Helena Bonham Carter being completely miscast) and how absolutely impossible some scenes are (Tyler extracting the Narrator from the car? WTF). Also, it seems this was the peak of David Fincher's career, which has been on a steady decline since. Similarly, Chuck Palahniuk found his niche audience but never quite hit the mainstream jackpot again.\n\nInstead of a bang, it's seems that for Fincher and Palahniuk it's a slow and endless whimper."

That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like \"Seven\", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough."

The image and vision of the city that inflames and creates a constant tension. Emotions and mental state of the narrator, feelings and condition he experiences, especially in the beginning scenes - I felt it to the bone. Worth multiple rewatching - you will notice new things and details every time. Final scene brings goosebumps. David Fincher is a genius."

She embraces the strange as normal and rejects the comfortable and pretty as the aberrations. Few other actresses could have achieved the level of intense hyperactivity and abandon Helena captures here.

        "review_detailed_main": "Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.\n\nBut I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.\n\nEdward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.\n\nFor the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?\n\nIt's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment."

Edward Norton gives a brilliant performance as a depressed office worker driven by capitalism . He narrates the film , guiding us through his pathetic and hopeless life . I was immediately taken in by the movie's slick visual style , and Norton's performance is especially convincing . It is here the movie begins to crumble . Funny how it's possible to pinpoint the exact moment when it starts to turn sour . It is when Norton meets Brad Pitt's character on an airplane . He's a neo-facist who teaches self-liberation through violence . Norton is intrigued and joins his group of recruits who act out their rage by pounding on each other in dark cellars . Once Norton moves in with Pitt the movie begins to pander and get off track . It becomes more like watching a very bloody remake of The Odd Couple . I was still hopeful though , until the film self-destructs with a contrived suprise ending that's totally contradictory to many of its earlier events . The suprise endings of Magnolia and The Sixth Sense worked , because they interlocked with their themes , but the ending in Fight Club looks like it was added on just to give it a kick . Then there's the final scene , which is illogical and serves only as a cop-out , as the movie ducks responsibility to its real theme , Norton's unstable mental condition . The material was here for a compelling film , but Fight Club never explores it . Instead , it falls into standard , formulized Hollywood mush . Seeing Fight Club , I realized you can have great ideas for films , but unless you use them well , and find just the right note , great ideas do not necessarily make great movies ."

In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT... Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!\n\nHere is a film that almost cries out, \"HATE ME! DESPISE ME!\" An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop kicks them!\n\nYet, it is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for it! Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.\n\nThe term \"Ride\" is employed so freely to movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents the word! Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailing (\"We're still men!\") of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton-Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles...\n\n...FIGHT CLUB synthesizes both our pent-up frustration and our self-induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1...\"You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!\" This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one \"RIDE\" you CERTAINLY DO NOT want to miss!\n\n10**********.....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!"

I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in \"Fight Club\".\n\nSurely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.\n\nIt was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in \"Legends of the Fall\", nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent.\n\nI feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime."

For me Fight Club isn't even just a movie. It's an experience. It can improve your mindset and your style of living in some way if you understand the movie right. Fight Club is the very peak of television. Even if you don't really deal with the message the movie gives (what you definitely should) it has everything you want in a movie. Fight Club has a great directing style combined with a masterpiece of a story and a breathtaking plot twist. The acting performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter make the movie so much more authentic and fun to watch. You can watch Fight Club to really every time and how often you want. It doesn't get boring. In the end everyone has his/her own taste in movies but for me Fight Club is just a masterpiece that changed my life and style of living."

On one of his flights, he meets Tyler Durden and the two become friends. They soon start an underground fight club that starts to develop into something bigger.\n\nThe film is interesting for several reasons, not only because of the interesting plot, but because it is contradictory in itself. The film deals with how people have become a kind of shapeless mass, without a purpose and ultimately without what makes them human.\n\nWhen the Narrator meets Tyler, he draws out of him what is deeply suppressed within himself and it surfaces with interesting results.\n\nThe director brilliantly explained in the film how subliminal messages are sent to the viewer in various segments, this is not something new, it is known to be done, and some things are particularly disturbing.\n\nThe film, when watched to the end with understanding, provides an interesting perspective on the things that affect us as humans. The ending is particularly intriguing, precisely because it is contradictory and actually ends up turning out the way you might have thought it wouldn't. That's exactly what's interesting.\n\nIn the end, the primordial in man actually wins, regardless of the fact that the story may at times suggest that it is not so, and even just before the end a change happens, but in the end it is irrelevant, the subconscious wins in the end regardless of everything.\n\nWhat the Narrator imagined and wanted to discard in the end, although he partially succeeded in the end, but the subconscious in him still did what it set out to do. To understand what I mean, you have to watch the movie.\n\nAs humans, we are often in conflict with ourselves, and we struggle to let our good side prevail, which is what makes us human. Not everyone succeeds in this, and the consequences are often unfathomable. It is interesting that in this story both sides have their own arguments that are difficult to refute. That's what makes this movie interesting.\n\nIn the end, the Narrator calmly accepts the inevitable and makes peace with himself.\n\nThe film is truly exceptional, one of those films that became an instant classic. Definitely a film that is worth watching and which, in addition to excellent entertainment, gives us something more."

There is excellent camera work, particularly during Durden's iconic speech regarding the eight rules of Fight Club. There are innovative special effects, such as when the narrator describes a possible explanation for an explosion in his apartment building. The movie moves at a brilliant pace, so though its 151-minute runtime seems like it'd be a chore to get through, the film never feels boring even once. Most of the main characters undergo a significant trajectory throughout the film, which is very satisfying to watch. The final shot of the film, which is one of my favorite scenes in movie history, uses awe-inspiring effects, meticulous framing and a legendary song choice to overwhelm the viewer with acute emotions. Once the credits start to roll, you'll be awestruck, still recovering from what you've just witnessed."

This movie is simlpy entertaining and appealing to all who may watch, and also hold a huge portion of development in what movies have become today, as Fight Club was not only a popular movie, but one that allowed for more complex ideals and practices to be used in the art of film making."

The people that tell you this are not wrong, but grossly summarizing the plot.\n\nThis movie is about an insomniac who feels life is void, so he goes to meetings for terminally ill people or people who are just plain struggling, and he finds comfort in that I guess. The man then meets Tyler, and Tyler gets the man out of his comfort zone to say the least. Yes, they start an underground fight club, where each of the members finds a spark in their lives.\n\nBut Tyler manages to turn it into some cult where they worship anarchy, kind of.

        "review_detailed_main": "From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.\n\nFight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.\n\nThough it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.\n\nThe film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.\n\nThen he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.\n\nThe Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.\n\nThe depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...\n\nThe cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.\n\nThis has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.\n\nIt doesn't get any better than this.\n\n10/10"

As enticing as all of this sounds, you know what sparks your interest even more, BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE!! (I have been underemployed for over eight years now, I am all ears!!) What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!! Brad Pitt conveys his message to Edward Norton very convincingly, and now, the trick is to spread the good news, but, remember rules one and two, you are not allowed to talk about it, and, you are not allowed to talk about it!! How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality. You have experienced excruciating chemical pain, someone torched your condo because they want to get to know you a little better, you got fired because you always have blood stains on your clothes, you want to blow up a credit card centralized information building complex, and sex has not been this sensational since seventh grade!! Nobody said that this was a family oriented film!! The aggregate depravity for all of the characters in the movie transcends a diversified experimentation with needless destruction, their devotion to the non-conventional is a little too difficult to comprehend!! What does anybody really accomplish by going this route anyway? Capitualation to the bizarre? This movie's charades of insurrection are exhilarating to the clinically demented (Otherwise known as the fight club) The less I know, the better off I will be I think!! Banalities pertinent to the Bourgeousie have brazenly threatened this bevy of belligerent overgrown boys who wish to brandish their high levels of testosterone... So Now!! Life is one big boxing ring!! This is a potpourri of apocalyptic misgivings which are socially perverse!! How do you empathize with any of this?... You don't!! This website has ranked this movie the 31st best film out of the top 250 ever made.... To concur with these findings would be tantamount to indulging the character that Brad Pitt played, to the nth degree!! The psychopathic rumination involved in all of these felonious antics are even more repugnant than the eating habits of an alpaca!!! It is truly indicative of human nature to favor the form of fruition which is pecuniary, their form of fruition deals with societal malcontent and mutilation!! The resonating agitation, which serves as an inspiration to everyone in this movie, is commensurate with the film \"Clockwork Orange\"!!! Both films possess a ruthless determination to establish an adamant,counter-culture militancy with a bunch of immature misfits!! The macabre actions to both of these movies signify a heinous non-justification which is pertinent to everything!!! This is not what the phrase \"Change your sedentary lifestyle\" means!!! There are other recreational diversions out there, maybe golf can fill the void!! As far as unprecedented creativity goes \"Fight Club\" gets a resoundingly perfect ten!!! Overall, however, for \"Fight Club\" to be ranked the 31st best movie ever produced, I don't know, I really just do not know about that one at all!!"

The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.\n\nEdward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc. He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.\n\nWhen Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house. The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.\n\nOkay, like \"Mulholland Drive,\" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.\n\n\"Fight Club\" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending. Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.\n\nThe performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job. Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ing\u00e9nue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is definitely much better than Inception. At the moment, the rating of this movie is higher, but if it comes above Inception, I will no longer appear on IMDb. Because this movie is not science fiction, but it is ten times more effective than a good science fiction. And this is very important. A realistic film is so effective in terms of storytelling. You see, at the same time, there is a lot of complexity in it. And you can enjoy watching it many times. Brad Pitt is completely one with his role. And it doesn matter that the movie is criticizing politics. What is most important is the depiction of modern man, and it is one of the few films that is even better than the original book.\n\nOf course I am fan of Nolan....."

        "review_detailed_main": "What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.\n\nThis movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course \"Dr Jekill and Mister Hide\" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,\"a clockwork orange\" ,\"rebel without a cause\" \"bad influence\" and Joel Schumacher's \"falling down\",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.\n\nSo why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in \"primal fear\".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says \"the things you...\"The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.\n\nThere's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,\u00e0 la \"sixth sense\" ,\"Jacob's ladder\" or\" Usual suspects\" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of \"clues\":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.\n\nThe last picture seems now terrifying."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film.\n\nSimply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors.\n\nThis movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man.\n\nDavid Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more.\n\nHonestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the cliches but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen.\n\nThis movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time On Line and get to the nearest video store!"

        "review_detailed_main": "In Nietzsche's philosophy, there are three states of the human mind: the camel, the lion and the baby. The first state camel, endure humiliation, passively obedient to the arrangement of others or fate; The second realm of lion is to change passivity into initiative, from\"you should\"to\"I want\". I will take the initiative to fight for everything and take the responsibility of life. Third state baby, this is an \"I am\" state, living in the moment and enjoying the present.\n\nIn the US in the 1990s, the domestic economy boomed, giving rise to a surge of middle-class consumerism. What is consumerism? Life goals are closely related to the acquisition of goods, even if those goods are not needed for survival or for the traditional purpose of showing off. In consumerism, people are obsessed with the process of acquiring goods as the basis of their identity. The social system also serves for consumerism, such as designers who are specially responsible for enhancing the attractiveness of goods and ubiquitous advertisements, etc. The biggest spiritual shackles of consumerism lies in this. The process of acquiring goods has become the basis of people's identity.\n\nJack is such a consumerist. He worked in order to make money, and to make money in order to buy more and better material, goods became the purpose of Jack. Jack did the same boring work every day, and his boss was bleeding him. Jack is portrayed as a consumer in a society where consumerism is prevalent, and he is caught in the trap of consumerism, in the cycle of work and consumption. He is a prisoner of the spirit, unable to feel his own worth, unable to feel the vitality of life. He began to lose sleep, and he began to look for a way out of his pain.\n\nJack is a submissive camel enslaved by the material and system, while Tyler is a lion who dares to fight against material society, opposes all rules and advocates spiritual freedom. When Jack met Tyler, fight club was born. Fight makes people devote themselves to it and release their wildness. The pain brought by fight makes people feel their own existence, makes people temporarily break away from the cycle of work and consumption, and makes people throw away all the troubles and discomforts of life. This method is popular with many people and more and more people join fight club. Taylor yearns for a world that reverts to a primal time of instinct, and Taylor still becomes an extremist. Taylor wanted to liberate mankind from modern material and institutional civilization, and he did it by destroying it. But this is not desirable. Although we are constrained by the social value system and rules of modern civilization, they also bring us social order and progress. Although the social value system and rules of modern civilization shackle part of our nature and become the shackles of our spirit, they guarantee the higher efficiency of social operation and the guarantee of our high standard of living. So it is not feasible to throw away material and system completely. So the lion evolved into a baby, and Jack killed Taylor. The baby represents a new birth, re-establishing its own worth and will.\n\nIn the beginning, we are tamed as a camel, taught what values are and told what to do. Then we began to question and reflect, becoming lions of confrontation and destruction. Eventually we become babies, abandoning our old values and rules and perceiving the world all over again, reevaluating everything we come into contact with. Jack eliminated the split personality of Tyler, brought himself to a state of harmony, reached the infant state. Newborn babies have the will to choose actively, no longer blindly pursue the value defined by the external world, feel their inner world, redefine and create their own value, and achieve spiritual freedom."

Arguably David Fincher's best movie for a multitude of reasons, namely that sweet blend of dark humor, violence, and bad-ass performances by the actors.\n\nCinematography is great, even though the special effects are sometimes questionable/dizzying/cheesy, it never seems to bother me; call me nostalgic, I think it just adds to the overall flavor of the film.\n\nPeople kinda either hate or love this movie.

Nevertheless, directed by David Fincher, the\"fight club\" became one of my most preferable movies of all time. The promise that was taken by film was more vital that it firstly seems as. The plot reveals the life of depressed man Edward Norton, who searches for peace in different type of clubs which are based on meetings sick people. A little time later, he faced an individual after whom his life had changed. Under the direction of phenomenal producer , all the way of the film was interesting to watch. The breathtaking scenes and thrilling phrases that are directly connected with the contemporary world, which made a tremendous impact on my view to everything. Nevertheless, the movie is not easily accessible to community, due to the reason that not of all part of society are really understanding the position of director. I personally did the same at the beginning. After the passage of several time I managed my time to rewatch the movie, and felt an opportunity to comprehend my lifestyle. To recapitulate, this is the most influentials movie which has powerful meaning in the background( even bizarre) that Fincher had ever filmed. I strongly recommend to watch it until the very end."

I don't think I ever will.\n\nI have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.\n\nIt is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.\n\nThe movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.\n\nJack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.\n\nTyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.\n\nThe movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.\n\nIf we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes:\n\n\"You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.\"\n\nIf we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way,\n\nThis is not it,\n\nand\n\nThis is anything but it.\n\nHere is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:\n\n\"You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.\"\n\nHere is another line that someone shouts:\n\n\"You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.\"\n\nIf you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you."

I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.\n\nI can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.\n\nThe secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.\n\nI could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.\n\nIs Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.\n\nThey should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.\n\nFrom me, 1 star."

        "review_detailed_main": "When Fight Club was released to theatres i refused to go see it. The previews made it look like it was movie purely about senseless violence without a point or a message. One night while at a friends house they were raving aobut Fight Club and someone had brought it over to watch. i wasn't into seeing it but what else could i do. When the movie was over i couldn't believe what i had just saw. All my negative feelings about the movie were put to rest and i realized that i had seen a great movie and now it's in my top 10.\n\nI won't go into the plot because i think that the viewer should experience that for himself instead of reading this review. i will however say that it's not all about violence and the violence that is displayed in the film has a reason for being there. it's all about letting out aggression and finding out who you are. The violence is just a small part of a bigger picture.\n\nThe acting is top notch. Brad pitt is in a lot of my favorite movies(Seven, Interview with the vampire, snatch).He's a very good actor and he jsut has a certain charisma when he's on screen. If anyone hasany doubts about his abilities they should see tihs movie. Edward Norton is also very good in the film. He's a very versatile actor and he fits intot his role very nicely. Helen bohnam carter is very good as the sole female in the film. she can more that handle her own with the 2 male leads. good supporting roles are also give by meat loaf and jared leto. Meat loaf is especially good in his role as bob.\n\nThe direction by David Fincher is excellent. This film is a little dark like seven but there is more of a visual flair in this film. he's a brilant director and he has a eye for what's good in a film.\n\nIn closing fight club is a movie we all should see and hope everyone gets a chance to see it."

        "review_title": "Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease",
        "review_detailed_main": "Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise. With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become. It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.\n\nThe film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog. To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people. Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life. It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.\n\nUnfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life. Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.\n\nAs Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp. What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.\n\nPart of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need. There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.\n\nWithout giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires. It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.\n\n`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film. Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message. Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+"

It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while."

        "review_detailed_main": "If I have to describe this movie in one sentence, I have to say: wonderful and mind blowing.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is a dark and thought-provoking film that delves deep into themes of masculinity, identity, consumerism, and rebellion. Directed by David Fincher and released in 1999, the movie is based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. It stars Edward Norton as an insomniac office worker, referred to as the Narrator, and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a charismatic soap salesman.\n\nThe film follows the Narrator as he becomes disillusioned with his monotonous existence and seeks an escape from his mundane life. He forms an underground fighting club with Tyler Durden, which evolves into an anarchistic movement that challenges societal norms and values. As the story progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern reality from the protagonist's unreliable perspective.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is renowned for its visual style, gritty atmosphere, and Fincher's skillful direction. It is filled with intense and visceral fight scenes, which serve as a metaphor for the characters' desire to break free from the constraints of society. The film's exploration of masculinity is particularly striking, criticizing the shallow materialism and emasculating effects of consumer culture.\n\nEdward Norton delivers a stellar performance as the troubled and fragmented Narrator, capturing his internal struggle and descent into madness. Brad Pitt brings a captivating charisma to the screen as Tyler Durden, the enigmatic and rebellious figure who becomes both a mentor and a destructive influence.\n\nThe film's nonlinear narrative, coupled with its psychological twists and turns, keeps viewers engaged and guessing until the final reveal. While \"Fight Club\" received mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern classic, primarily for its social commentary and its bold exploration of unconventional themes.\n\nOverall, \"Fight Club\" is a provocative and thought-provoking film that challenges societal norms and offers a scathing critique of modern life. It demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexities and symbolism, making it a compelling and enduring piece of cinema."

        "review_title": "One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script",
        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.\n\nOnce Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a \"fight club,\" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.\n\nIt's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.\n\nIf anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.\n\nThe direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.\n\nThe characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.\n\nThe other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.\n\nThe pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.\n\nThe last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.\n\nOverall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time."

In a few words the moral is that a man can obtain freedom (and therefore happiness) only when he/she has given up his needs and fears, that most of us are living according to society standards, living according to the style that we hate and in front of which we are actually made ourselves dependant. I have seen it more than 10 times and always noticed new ideas which are worth to think about, and most of viewers, who watch this movie many times, have said that they experience the same experience. I have also read Fight Club book and honestly and liked the movie better - this doesn't happen often - David Fincher did excellent job - the film has very unique and accordant style without exaggerations and the crew was very successfully build, actor play is faultless, there is nothing you would want to change."

Extremely clever.\n\nWhen he is beating himself up in his bosses office he says \"for some reason I thought back to my first fight with Tyler\" why? Because it was exactly the same situation.\n\nHow could a fight club possibly form? If you see 2 guys fighting in a parking lot you aren't exactly going to join in - but if you see a crazy guy essentially fight himself you could conceivably approach to see what is going on.\n\nWhen Tyler is banging Marla he speaks to Ed Norton and then slams the door, Marla says \"who are you talking to?\" we get to find out. There are many more instances like that, the film doesn't cheat but when you find out the incredible twist you aren't expecting it.\n\nThe palette used is superb - bland, subdued, fitting in perfectly with mental illness. Then you get Brad Pitt, looks striking, blonde hair, unusual outfits - He doesn't fit in at all - again, we get to find out why. Superb.\n\nThe themes about modern society are absolutely bang on too if you think about them. Are you rich and famous? Weren't we lead to believe we could be? Do we need most of the things we clutter our lives with?\n\nThese a just a few things, there are so many more things you will notice, when you see it again and again.\n\nLike I said. Masterpiece."

This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.\n\nThe acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised. According to me this has one of the most unexpected endings and a moral message i have seen in a movie. You have to watch this 10/10"

It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie \"underappreciated\". The truth is that it's OVERappreciated. \"Fight Club\" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it. There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself. The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was not at all needed. So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this movie was underappreciated. It's obviously not the case. However, it is superbly directed, well-written, and well-acted, so I fell good giving it a rating of 7/10."

But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) \u2013 all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that \"this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain\" or \"it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity\". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...\n\nPeople can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side... Fight club is wonderful and poignant critics of the world today and 8.8 rating tells me that most of the people got it right. For all the others \u2013 too bad for you that you're not able to see it's excellence..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The people that don't like this generally fall into 2 groups: Those that approach it believing its central theme is fighting and those that think it is shallow and represents everything it claims to be against.\n\n9 out of 10 people fall into the 1st category and feel let down when they realize that fighting encompasses a relatively small amount of the movie's content. They are what I classify as \"mouth breathers\" or the \"lowest common denominator\". They are incapable of ignoring their preconceived notions of the movie's theme and unable to judge the movie on what it really is. To them, it is a disappointment that they saw a completely different movie than they expected, and it is therefore sub-par in their narrow little world.\n\nThe other 10% see the themes and story for what they are, but feel it's over-produced and \"too stylish\", something the movie purports to outright protest. What is lost on these poor souls is that was the exact point of why it is the way it is. It makes fun of itself, all the while protesting our modern culture. It's the ultimate self-deprecating humor.\n\nI know there are others who don't like the movie for a variety of reasons, but these are generalizations and are, therefore, generally true. There are exceptions, but these are what the majority of negative feelings for this movie encompass.\n\nTo me, this movie is clever and full of great, dark humor. The violence these men engage in is the same kind of self-destructive behavior that \"cutting\" is for young women. They both feel numb to the world and cutting or fighting is the way they have chosen to \"feel\". Of course it's not a healthy way to address these emotional crises, but the movie uses it as a way of illustrating the lengths to which people sometimes go in their search for a cure to their despair.\n\nI enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It's one of the few movies that never gets boring no matter how many times I see it.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "If someone has told you that \"you need to see this movie,\" then they're not far off. They're probably in their 20s or 30s and lived through that time when Starbucks was the next big thing, companies were starting to ditch dial-up for DSL, Casual Friday was the only motivation they ever had to live through the week, and their parents were too busy getting divorced to force them to go to graduate school.\n\nWhen it comes to periods within these eras of self-reflection, satire movies like Office Space come to mind. However, Fight Club goes a step beyond and then some, taking a look at how this lifestyle obsession invades every aspect of life, sinking into our personal lives, making it impossible to find a woman who doesn't despise your guts outside of the physical side of your relationship, where being clever and funny are the only things you have to keep yourself sane, and where a generation of MTV-raised, Saturday morning cartoons, post-Reagan politics, Hollywood-worshiping, McDonalds and 7-11 Slushees men are being turned into demasculated raving psychotics trying to find any escape from their misery.\n\nFight Club comes along at a time in history where it's perfect. We have our narrator and his miserable insurance salesman life with a job he hates buying all the useless crap he doesn't need to fill his apartment to satisfy himself with what he thinks makes him perfect and socially acceptable. He becomes so sick of himself that he seeks any escape. He finds hope in support groups for men with testicular cancer and starts to regain his sanity, only to have his hopes shattered when he finds another faker in the group... a woman. Things spiral out of control when he finds a strange soap salesman on a business flight and starts to take great interest in his life. He then leads him to a path to hit rock bottom, to live among the dregs of society, redefine his masculinity and prove it to others. What begins as a weekend hobby soon collapses into a downward spiral of complete and utter destruction and a seemingly hopeless struggle to put the pin back in the grenade.\n\nThe film contains line after line of brilliant writing and takes twists and turns where you least expect. Every character is acted perfectly and not a frame of film is wasted. Some have claimed this as quite possibly the least predictable movie to ever come out of Hollywood. I would completely agree. However, this is not its only strong suit. Fight Club incorporates elements from almost every genre: drama, horror, thriller, action, suspense, mystery, and romance just to name a few. It tackles so many subjects and has so many messages it's really hard to know what to look at first. This is one of those movies where everyone has a favorite scene and no one has the same favorite quote. A film that speaks for an entire generation of men and the future of our lifestyle obsessed society, Fight Club is an all-time favorite for me and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. Just sit down and watch with an open mind and you will not be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: \"God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression.\" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.\n\nThe main character continues: \"We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't\".\n\nWell, learning to differentiate between yourself and \"movie gods [and] rock stars\" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.\n\nSo, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.\n\nThe rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: \"I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off. \""

Should've won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay? You're on the right track. Stay with me and I will run you through the whys.\n\nWhy should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap that came out of Tyler Durden's and the Narrator's mouths. But the philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each character's state of mind.\n\nWhy should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena Bonham Carter was the only person who could've played Marla Singer. No one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just as well as the rest of the male cast.\n\nWhy for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film? Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick, cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all time.\n\nBest Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt's performance with the key component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn't really give a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.\n\nBest Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's twisted novel and twisted it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this movie wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be the same cult classic that a lot of people come to love and worship.\n\nIf you put all of these element's together, you get Best Picture. A story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.\n\nThere you have it. Also, kudos on the editing and the music.\n\nFight Club ****out of****.\n\nRated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Language and Sexuality."

It's the best combination of a great writer, great director, great actors, great music makers. And the outcome is a movie which needs to be watched 7-8 times to understand it. I watched it probably more than 8 times, and I still discover something new in the movie. Maybe a hidden frame, or an important word or sentence which I couldn't understand before. The enjoyment you'll get by watching it once is limited. You will like the movie more and more every time u see it and finally think it is the best movie ever made. There's no end to depth of the movie. And to my surprise, for the first time I see a movie is BETTER than its novel. The script writer took the novel, converted it into a movie script removing the boring and dull parts, and made it ready for an outstanding movie. This is actually why u need to watch it several times, because EVERY word, EVERY sentence has a meaning and no time and no line is wasted in the movie.\n\nIf you're a movie lover, you have probably seen this movie.

Its attractive and original style, its trapping story, its performances, its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into an authentic masterpiece. I consider this film to be one of the best of all times.\n\nFincher tells us the story of an unnamed character (the narrator) who has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of meaning. This guy, who is very well interpreted by Edward Norton, suffers from insomnia and can't find the solution to his problem. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder, but the presence of another impostor named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) ruins everything; Norton starts feeling uncomfortable. The narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden will try to open Edward's eyes; he will teach him how to leave everything behind, how to forget about the material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life. They will co-found an underground club known as Fight Club.\n\nThis film is the story of us, the story of everyone. This is a love tale that, camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism, talks about the pursuit of happiness, talks about finding the right person, the person that takes out our best selves. It is a story that strengthens values such us compromise, conviction, devotion, determination and love.\n\nTen out of ten"

In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.\n\nThe movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously.\n\nEdward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

I'm thinking now that maybe this film just doesn't hold up anymore.\n\nThe twists and plot advancements were just ok. I see that this movie takes a huge risk artistically but when you make that big of a risk, it doesn't always hit home.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy watching Fight Club and as a movie fan, I'm glad that I did but I don't think I would ever put it on a list of my favorite movies of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's \"Where's Waldo\" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (\"You are not your car, your khakis,\" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the \"no shirt/no shoes\" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.\n\nEverything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See \"Zabriskie Point\" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.)\n\n\"Fight Club\" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with."

Edward Norton is by far one of my favorite actors. he play just about anyone and he is very good in this film. Brad Pitt is in top form in this film. in fact this is the best thing he's been in since Se7evn. loved his performance. Helen Bonham Carter was also good as the lone female in the movie. very powerful performance.\n\nThe camera work in this film is magnificent and David Fincher i ggive you much admiration for putting this film together.\n\nFight club is exciting from the begining to the very surprising end. go see it now. 8 out of 10."

For a movie to begin with extreme tension, tell a rocking good story and then peak beautifully at the end is a rare thing. If there is a God, this should clean up at the Oscars. Black, wicked, packed with eminently quotable lines- this is one to see AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so you're the person who knows what The Fight Club is about, and not the person hearing endless retellings of the best bits.

And I was pleased with the experience: As any good film should, it leaves you shaken and stirred. It awakens inside you the same rage that the hero of the story couldn't suppress anymore.\n\nAlthough not an action fan, I didn't find the violence gratuitous or sickening, the nudity excessive, or the special effects gimmicky. The twist at the end is both brilliant and extremely valid; and the final scene prescient and timeless on multiple levels: Slice it any way you like, it is we - the conformists, the office crowd, the middle classes - who are afraid of our own power, and never fail to construct a prison for ourselves.\n\nI deducted a star because the final cut should have been edited more vigorously (there's at least 10 - 15 minutes' worth of dead weight in there). And also because the naturally stunning and usually memorable Helena Bonham-Carter is so hung up on looking ugly and sounding American in this vehicle, her otherwise prominent character adds nearly zero depth, nuance or development to the story. Given her role as the narrator's mirror-cum-doppelg\u00e4nger, she simply fizzles out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback."

Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang. Makes sense. Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style... bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).\n\nIt actually starts our promisingly. I loved the first quarter. Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.\n\nFilm buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on \"surprise\" endings in cinema history.

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time, deserving an exceptional 11/10 rating. It stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic history, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional storytelling. David Fincher's direction, combined with a stellar cast, delivers an unforgettable experience that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. From the moment the film starts, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The brilliance of Fight Club lies not only in its captivating plot and visceral action sequences but also in its profound exploration of societal discontent and the human psyche. The enigmatic performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are beyond extraordinary, capturing the raw essence of their characters with unparalleled intensity and authenticity. Pitt's Tyler Durden is a charismatic force of nature, while Norton's unnamed narrator is a haunting embodiment of disillusionment and suppressed desires. The chemistry between them is electric, fueling the film's unrelenting energy. The plot itself is a rollercoaster of suspense and unpredictability, leading to a mind-blowing twist that has become legendary in the annals of cinema. This revelation turns the entire narrative on its head, challenging our perceptions and forcing us to question the very nature of identity and reality. Fight Club's bold social commentary on consumerism, masculinity, and rebellion resonates deeply, making it a film that transcends mere entertainment. Fincher's meticulous direction, coupled with its gritty visual style and the iconic narration by Norton, creates an immersive atmosphere that is both dark and visually stunning. The film's impact goes far beyond its release, continuing to influence and inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. Fight Club is a groundbreaking work of art that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its brilliance. It is a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic gem, and a testament to the power of storytelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first rule of Fight Club is \"Don't talk about Fight Club.\" But we're going to break the first rule of Fight Club and talk about Fight Club.\n\nFight Club is possibly one of the last original movies made, before Hollywood started ripping off, reimagining and remaking everything that ever made Tinseltown money.\n\nSo if for some reason, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, when you get done reading this, go out and rent Fight Club.\n\nA good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And Fight Club is a good movie. And one that stays with you long after the credits begin rolling.\n\nI can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Brad Pitt (Who I'm not a fan of by the way) is perfectly cast as Tyler Durden (and he seems to be having a very good time here) Helena Bonham Carter can always be relied upon for a good performance, here once again, she is superb. As for Edward Norton, it became apparent the year before this movie, with 'American History X' that he was one talented actor destined for great performances in great roles.\n\nHis first movie was opposite Richard Gere in Primal Fear in 1996. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting actor which he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for 'Jerry Maguire' He also won a Golden Globe. Not bad for his first time out. He the. Worked with Woody Allen before his second Oscar Nomination for 'American History X' he lost this time to Roberto Benigni for 'Life is Beautiful'. Benigni also beat out Tom Hanks for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Boy did the Academy get that one wrong!\n\nBut this was to be his last great movie. (As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now.\n\nSo, what the hell happened?\n\nBottom line, Norton got a reputation for being difficult. Lots of people think of Norton as an absolute control freak. That Norton is not someone you want to work with.\n\nAlso, Norton isn't shy about airing his opinions to anyone who will listen. If Norton feels like he hasn't gotten the credit he is due, he will shout it from the rooftops. If he isn't happy with the final cut of a movie, he simply promote it. That is frowned on in Hollywood where stars are expected to support their movies no matter what.\n\nBrad Pitt (as I've said I'm not a fan) settled for being a famous A List superstar than making good movies I often said outside the Oceans Franchise ensemble, and with the exception of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'The Assassination of Jessie James By The Coward Robert Ford' Pitt has not made a good movie since Seven. But I love his performance here. I don't believe another actor could have played the role of Tyler Durden as well as Pitt.\n\nBut back to the movie.\n\nGiven the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience despite the premise of the movie. The studio wanted to market Fight Club to women because of Pitt. But they knew the film's violence would appeal more to men. It was a tricky one. In the end they hired an ad agency. They did a great job of promoting a tricky movie.\n\nGo watch Fight Club."

I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction. Fight Club is one of David Fincher's best films, and it is probably one of my top 5 favorite films of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I saw \"Fight Club\" I despised it. I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including \"The Matrix\" (which is not quite as realistic as \"Fight Club\"). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it much.\n\nHowever I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's now #41).\n\nWell I'm happy to report that I found \"Fight Club\" utterly brilliant on third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of \"Taxi Driver\" - according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name simple and soft).\n\nEdward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator, \"Jack,\" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being \"a laborious dog\" on its initial release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish, and I can understand why some might view \"Fight Club\" as a very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the camera.\n\nAnd the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now.\n\nOverall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999. In a year of some really good movies \"Fight Club\" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films.\n\nIt's easy to see how this might be considered the next \"Taxi Driver\" thirty years from now."

        "review_detailed_main": "As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.\n\nUndoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts.\n\nThe collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book.\n\nFight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.\n\n10/10"

Even if a friend of mine told me about this movie I still was circumspect about it.\n\nAt first I was confused, and I thought this will pass. Later in the movie, I was more confused, but not disappointed, anyway. Just at the end I understood the whole thing, making me more confused. I had to watch it over and over again to make sure I understood it right.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is not about violence, is not about that kind of \"fight\". Is not about anarchy or destruction. Is about knowing yourself, is about your capability to understand and structure your own actions, is about being aware of yourself.\n\nIt's a great movie, which describes the philosophy of life: live your own life, don't live the life of others. You have to watch this mastermind!"

The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).\n\nEdward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.\n\nHowever, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this \"anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched\" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in \"6th sense\", another recent movie, there a \"shocking\" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started..."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mind-bending and rebellious ride with \"Fight Club\"! Here's my opinionated take on this cult classic:\n\n\"Fight Club\" is a gritty and thought-provoking movie that packs a powerful punch. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are an explosive duo, delivering exceptional performances that will stick with you long after the credits roll.\n\nNorton plays an insomniac office worker who's disillusioned with his mundane existence. Enter Tyler Durden, portrayed by Pitt, a charismatic and anarchistic soap salesman who challenges everything our protagonist knows about life. Together, they form an underground fight club as a way to break free from society's constraints.\n\nWhat starts as a testosterone-fueled outlet for frustration quickly morphs into something much deeper. The movie delves into themes of identity, consumerism, and the human desire to break away from the confines of modern life. It's a dark and twisted exploration of masculinity, rebellion, and the human psyche.\n\n\"Fight Club\" is raw, unapologetic, and thoughtfully chaotic. It's not just about the physical fights; it's about the internal struggles and the search for meaning in a world that often feels empty and superficial.\n\nThe plot takes unexpected turns that will leave you questioning reality itself. It's the kind of movie that demands multiple viewings to fully grasp its brilliance.\n\nAside from the thought-provoking themes, \"Fight Club\" is known for its iconic quotes, stylish direction by David Fincher, and a killer soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's edgy atmosphere.\n\nNow, be warned, \"Fight Club\" isn't your typical Hollywood fare. It's bold, it's daring, and it'll challenge your perceptions. But if you're willing to embrace its unorthodox brilliance, you're in for a cinematic experience that's unlike anything else out there.\n\nSo, if you're up for a dark and mind-twisting journey that'll leave you questioning society and yourself, \"Fight Club\" is an absolute must-watch. Just remember, the first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. Enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Fight Club stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, and is directed by David Fincher. The plot revolves around an unnamed narrator, who is bored with his job, until he befriends Tyler Durden, a care free person, and together they start a fight club. Fight Club was one of those movies where I watched it, and I felt inspired. Not inspired to start a fight club, but the overall message was what really spoke to me. Fight Club teaches the audience that we are scared of our lives, which is why we work those boring nine-five jobs because we do what society tells us to do. And that's why we buy stuff we don't need so we can also fit into society as well having the media hypnotizing us that one day we'll be happy with that one special person, but that's a lie. And if people refuse to accept that, well then you just haven't discovered the big picture. And no one explains that well than Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is the person that everyone wants to be him and act like him and he's my inspiration to me because he has a care free attitude toward life and I admire that. When Fight Club was released, it got terrible reviews, but later on it has become a cult movie. And i think the reason it has such a strong cult following, was because when it first was released, nobody understood it, but they instead they thought it was just about fighting. But there's more to it than fighting and that's where people fail to understand this film. And every time I watch Fight Club, the more i understand what it was trying to tell us. So in the end, Fight Club is a punk rock version of A Clockwork Orange, has a very strong message, and something you shouldn't ignore just because it has to do with fighting. And remember the first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club."

Just straight up, this movie is ahead of its time.\n\nThe story is a non-stop grandeur development.\n\nI can't spoil any bits of this masterpiece. Can only say: this movie is about a man. That's IT. I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE. Or else, I'm gonna break the 2nd rule.\n\nWhen I first watched Fight Club in the 2nd year of university, I felt really skeptical. I was scratching my head throughout the whole movie's set up like why the hell is this even in the top 10 IMDB list.\n\nAnd I gotta admit, Fight Club is weird. It's complicated and it might feel like it's going nowhere. I could almost say that I was losing interest in the first act of the movie.\n\nBut as things build up and just keep building up, I saw the beauty. For the first time in my life, I felt enlightened. I felt something more than just a movie. I was laughing throughout the middle act and then, I got hit really hard in the most disturbing and oddly satisfying way.\n\nA movie that can always provoke your thoughts the moment you start watching it again. Fight Club is vulgar, intense and so damn emotional.\n\nI would always say that this is neither an action movie nor a thriller movie. But it is Fight Club. It shows me the craziest life journey of a man, being portrayed on a movie screen. The movie editing level is surprisingly movie magic.\n\nToo many people are breaking the first rule these days, this is not good."

Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's performance is first class: tireless, hilarious, all undeniable emotions that give life to this story. I rarely ever rate movies a 10/10 and only give it to a masterpiece. This ladies and gentlemen was a masterpiece."

I'm glad I watched it at this particular time in my life though, because I don't feel like I would've truly grasped the meaning of this story had I been younger. This film does more than entertain the viewer, and that's for sure. It asks some tough questions about our world, but most importantly about ourselves. It's a masterclass in suspension of disbelief. The execution and directing by David Fincher allowed it to approach a most unique proposition with tact. For me it's a masterpiece. But that's enough for today as I've already broken the rules..."

        "review_detailed_main": "If we're all just \"polishing the brass on the titanic\", and everything is going down anyway, what's the point? You get up in the morning, you go to school, study and succeed with the hope of one day becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a whatever. But if we know as we do that humanity will cease to exist in the near future, what with global warming and all, why do we bother improving existence? Shouldn't we give in to the beast we all know exists inside man? For the little time we have left, isn't a better idea to destroy, fight and kill? Anarchy seems to be the best thing to abide by in these dark times. Of course, David Fincher's Fight Club doesn't advocate these ideas; it brings them up in order for us, the viewers, to think of reasons why they are wrong.\n\nWith recourse to the everyman, Edward Norton's character, only known as the Narrator, Fight Club involves us in the film. We are the Narrator. We are the ones who need every piece of furniture in Ikea catalogues for our homes in order to feel whole. However, the everyman in the film happens to have a day only seen in the movies, but we still identify with him: His luggage is lost at the airport, his house blows up and all his possessions, even the furniture, are gone. As a direct result, he is no longer a person because his possessions have been destroyed.\n\nNow he meets a guy, Tyler Durden, who tells him he could be more than his possessions, he could be free of the superficial society which creates the needs he does not (\"in the hunter-gatherer sense\") actually have. He could be, that is, if he hits his friend as hard as he can.\n\nOur Narrator does; he likes it. Soon enough, other young men begin to like it too. These young men are also tired of mindless work which consists of helping a society that just enslaves them more as they make it more powerful. What's the point? So they all listen to Tyler, a fervent leader of men who initiates a club in which, every night, these young men can pound on each other. As they experience real freedom through pain and domination, Tyler, the giver of this wonderful experience, hands out homework assignments. His minions happily execute.\n\nThis is how anarchy begins: A fervent and relentless leader with the wrong idea. I will not divulge any more, because of the many surprises this film has near the end. Any film with these ideas can just as easily fail. Fight Club does not. It is masterfully wrapped in a package of light, sound and images by David Fincher. The film looks good and has the smarts to back it up.\n\nProponents of classic films see modern day cinema as being all style and no substance. Scenes are cut too fast to even get a feel for them, a little gift, they say, from television. Well I say look at Fight Club. What we have isn't so bad. It makes us think as well as being entertained.\n\nEdward Norton gives us many performances in one: he is an insomniac who knows there's a void in his life but doesn't have the will power to fill it, preferring to merely go through the motions of a life headed nowhere. Then he becomes \"enlightened\", finds meaning. Then he discovers what his life really is... Brad Pitt is a charismatic leader able to subdue any lost soul. Helena Bonham-Carter has fun with her intermediary character.\n\nGreat acting and great directing have always been essential to great films. So has being thought provoking, and you know what? For 7 years ever since its release, everyone has been talking about it. It hasn't stopped; even people who hate it love to talk about it.\n\nSo should we just stop our productive lives? Boys, let's just pound each other because, hey, it's more productive then anything we're doing now. It liberates us, for a given time period, because short term desire satisfaction is more useful than anything else. Somebody please prove that wrong, because that's what the film wants us to do, and I'll be damned if Tyler Durden is right."

I just cannot imagine they are older than 20, most of them must be between 13 and 17.\n\nThe title of this movie made me avoid it like the pest for a long time, sensing it was going to be bad. Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.\n\nThis movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably. And for one simple reason: childishness.\n\nWatching grownup men being constantly childish is simply not funny, much less interesting. Unless you are a redneck or not older than 17."
