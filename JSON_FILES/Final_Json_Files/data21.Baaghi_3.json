To help him in this mission he has Shraddha Kapoor. The film is full of action with fights and explosions galore every minute. It is\" \"maar dhad unlimited\". Most of it is highly exaggerated with no considerations for the laws of physics. A few sequences are downright ridiculous. There are many sequences of Tiger running towards camera with full blown explosions in the background. The film is targeted towards diehard fans of Tiger Shroff, and they will not be disappointed. Others like me will find Tiger lacking in the acting department. Other members of audience may find it difficult to sit through this overdose of mindless violence, and a wafer thin script. In one action scene there is countdown of 45 seconds on display as Tiger bashes up the goons ! Of course Tiger wins hand down. Director Ahmed Khan unabashedly gives you an upfront overdose of unadulterated action . He has definitely put in huge amount of effort and the logistics seem to be quite complex. Some good cinematography and special effects are seen. The narrative is confusing made worse with banal dialogue. However the film provides full on entertainment provided you don't ask questions."

        "review_detailed_main": "#FinalVerdict\n\nThe biggest problem with Baaghi 3 is that there's hardly any storyline in the film. Sajid Nadiadwala's adaptation is lame and it rests on a wafer-thin plot. What could've been an exhilarating thriller, with pulse-pounding moments, ends up being a run of the mill saga, courtesy a half-baked screenplay (Farhad Samji). Since Baaghi 3 goes beyond the shores of India, director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers (Sparsh Khetarpal, Tasha Bhambra, Madhur Sharma) could've used their imagination and packed the film with moments that would've made your jaws fall on your knees. Baaghi 3 is a big film in all respects - big stars, big canvas, big expenditure on VFX, big expectations. Sadly, it's a big, big, big letdown as well.\n\nThe experience with Baaghi 3 is like, you enter a posh restaurant, waiting for a sumptuous meal to be served, but what's served on your plate is vada-pau. Baaghi 3 takes you back to the 1970s Bollywood, when illogical situations, blood and gore, for no rhyme or reason, were the main ingredients that made the junta break into taalis. Sorry, the formula doesn't work anymore! Seriously, what were director Ahmed Khan, Sajid Nadiadwala (story adaptation) and Farhad Samji (screenplay & dialogues) thinking when they went ahead with this apology of a script? It's perfectly okay to pay homage to the masala films of yore, but the new interpretation has to make some sense at least. The one thing that you realize after watching Baaghi 3 is, no amount of gloss, glam and top-notch stars can ever substitute for a riveting script. Great stars, great styling and great visuals work as long as the script is great.\n\nFarhad Samji's screenplay is a complete mess. In fact, if at all there would be Razzies in Bollywood, Farhad Samji should be nominated proto for coming up with a slipshod, brainless and witless screenplay. What saddens your heart is the fact that Sajid Nadiadwala and Fox Star Studios, the producers of Baaghi 3, have spared no efforts in giving the film a spectacular look. The vision is perfect, but how about narrating an absorbing and attention-grabbing story? You remember Baaghi 3 for its striking visuals, not storyline. It's like embellishing priceless and precious jewels on a mannequin. The fight becomes too Bollywoodish as the hero eliminates an entire army of terrorists, is difficult to gulp! Perhaps, director Ahmed Khan's intentions are right, to make a hard-hitting film that marries realism and fiction beautifully, but the writing indulges in too many cinematic liberties and that's precisely why Baaghi 3 goes off target.\n\nHowever, lovers of action fares are in for a treat, since the stunts, action and chase sequences in Baaghi 3 are truly captivating. Sure, a few sequences aren't for the faint-hearted, but you can't help but put your hands together for these sequences and the man behind those death-defying stunts. Coupled with top-notch cinematography (Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran) and stylish action (Ram Chella-Laxman Chella, Kecha Khamphakdee) the film begins to grow as reel after reel unspools. But, alas, the film goes for a toss in the second hour. Things actually stagnate as the hero turns into super-hero and combats an army of villains on land, sea and air. Director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers seem to have substituted action for content and that's the most glaring flaw. In fact, you feel that the director and screenplay writers must've decided to go on a vacation in the second hour, entrusting the responsibility on the stunt directors to conclude the second hour.\n\nBaaghi 3 is soaked in high-voltage drama and action, with a consistent undercurrent of tension. As a matter of fact, there's an overdose of action in the film, though, I must admit, a few action pieces are deftly executed. But the absence of a riveting and absorbing screenplay looms large in the post-interval portions. Sure, some sequences do hit you hard, but the writing tilts heavily towards been-there-seen-that kind of situations persistently, promising little or no surprise as the plot unravels. The background score (Julius Packiam) enhances the impact, while the dialogue (Farhad Samji) are power-packed at times, but plain mediocre at places. The film's music is awful but thankfully, there aren't too many songs.\n\nDirector Ahmed Khan tries to camouflage the defect (lacklustre screenplay) with stylish execution, hair-raising stunts, eye-filling visuals, but let's not forget that the moviegoer wants to listen to a captivating story at the end of the day. Everything else is secondary! The film goes on and on and on with unwanted scenes galore (editing: Rameshwar S. Bhagat), the outdated love angle and the lenggggggthy fight sequences. Director Ahmed Khan seems to have taken the audience for granted. He has concentrated more on giving the film a slick look than narrating a gripping story and this fact reverberates at several points in the film. There's no denying that Baaghi 3 bears the stamp of an upmarket product all through, but how one wishes the director and the writers would've ensured that the film has a power-packed screenplay to offer as well.\n\nBaaghi 3 belongs to Tiger Shroff completely. No two opinions on that. Take Tiger out of this film and the movie is a big zero. He's the lifeline of this project and his performance will be loved by the masses. Shraddha Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts very well. Riteish Deshmukh is relegated to the backseat. What did Riteish see in this role? Ankita Lokhande's character lacks meat. Jackie Shroff and Vijay Varma are alright. Jaideep Ahlawat and Jameel Khoury evoke terror that one would associate with their characters. They are fantastic.\n\nTo sum up, Baaghi 3 is regressive cinema with a capital R. The film has some engrossing moments in the first half, that's about it. The post-interval portions are an absolute downer. The plot is formulaic, while the screenplay is riddled with cinematic liberties. Fans of Tiger Shroff might patronize the movie; however, the aam junta might not take a liking to it. At the box-office, the film will embark on a strong start, but it doesn't have the merits to sustain after the initial curiosity subsides. Baaghi 3 fails as a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Review By Kamal K\n\nFar distanced from reality, the delusional world of Baaghi 3 travels from Agra to Syria, with a rather frail story. An overly protective younger brother, Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) constantly rescues Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh), who, despite lacking essential qualities like bravado, and much to the surprise of the other characters, becomes a police official. That he becomes one after the demise of their cop-father Jackie Shroff hopes to add some credibility to this turn of events.\n\nVikram is sent on a mission to Syria to catch hold of a dreadful terrorist, Abu Jalal. But this plot too falls flat on its face after Ronnie must travel to Syria to save his brother from unforeseen circumstances. What happens in Syria is an entirely different story, one that's devoid of logic. But we had expected that, anyway!\n\nWhile the plot isn't intriguing, Shroff's high-octane action sequences may hold your attention. There's no doubt that like he does in every other film, he has pulled off the stunts with as much sincerity as he has finesse. A helicopter sequence deserving a special mention for its visual appeal.\n\nIf the wafer-thin plot is a disappointment, the cast doesn't particularly shine during emotional scenes either. Many, in fact, reduce viewers to laughs.\n\nShraddha Kapoor is merely there to add comic relief, but the script fails to even validate her presence. Ankita Lokhande too has little to play with, here. A special highlight, though, is the single scene that sees father-son - both on and off screen - Jackie and Tiger, feature in one frame.\n\nAhmed Khan has employed formulaic trinkets - good songs, and larger-than-life action - to make this 150-minute film a commercial entertainer."

Whenever Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor shared frame, it was magical. It was like watching Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis share screen. The action - Tiger killed atleast a 1000 guys and injured some 30-40000 others. You would lose the count after a while. The dialogues, specially the comedy sequences - all I can say is the writers must be proud of their work. The direction - the likes of Nolan, Tarantino and Scorsese should hide in shame or learn from Ahmed Khan. Only in a 1000 years comes a movie experience like this. I am simply sad that I wouldn't live long enough to experience a piece of art like this again. Unless, ofcourse if Bella does me a favour and bites me. To sum up, Baaghi 3 has set a new standard for cinema. One that would remain untouched for generations to come."

Shraddha amd Riteish are 2 most notable disasters...Ahmed khan is so pathetic with his filmmaking that people like him should be banned from films altogether.... I have one question to the makers, Can you yourself watch this torture yourselves? I like and see tiger as a good human but he should start choosing better scripts or his physique won't take him too far....AAA THOOOOOO on the face to all the stakeholders of this movie"

And the answers is nothing and he be a super hero just like that. I even fail to wonder that if a chopper bombs from behind and you fall / fly ahead due to the impact, how the bloody hell you end up on the helicopter? A very big mystery. Watch the movie to see such and many more blunders. Wait, dont watch the movie and save yourself from such useless piece of cinema. So the director Ahmed Khan should really stick to choreography as movie direction is not his cup of tea by all means. In the end he made a remix of a song and even destroyed it every possible way. Shraddha Kapoor, a question, two guys were running, tanks behind, two guys disappear in next scene, you all of sudden hug the hero, who no one knows where he came from and then he pushed you away from the circle of tanks. Was the hug the necessary? And do you really have to wear the pathetic clothes in the end song? where was your common sense."

To be honest Bollywood has no sense of making sequels and are busy in serving these below average movies week after week. Please guys stop watching these senseless movies."

If you do not expect anything of consequence to gain from watching a movie, I would still warn you under considering \"Baaghi 3\". Though I strongly urge Salman Khan Fans to go and watch the film. Bollywood has finally found a potential candidate to continue his legacy.\n\nThe movie has crossed all realms of illogical creation possible. It has no arms or legs and I found myself laughing, not our of humour but out of horror throughout the movie; whether such an exaggerated representation was even possible. It clearly shows the lack of effort made in writing, directing and acting.\n\nThe music and acting is especially substandard. The character of Ankita Lokhande was probably the single believable character throughout the film. I do not understand whether the leader of one of the most powerful organisation does not have a single marksman or is so powerless that he has to hide in the garbage dump. A complete farrago of cringy jokes, histrionic dialogues, overacting and illogical storyline."

        "review_detailed_main": "BAAGHI 3 REVIEW :-\n\nBaaghi in 2016, Baaghi 2 in 2018 and Baaghi 3 in 2020 this series of events took a very short time to run. Baaghi was a Hit where we saw Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor doing some excellent stunts and then came Baaghi 2 which took the action level much higher than previous. In result, Baaghi 2 emerged a Blockbuster and since then expectations for Baaghi 3 started building up. This time, Ronnie is back in action again but he is not against any single person but againt a nation. You can imagine how big they're going with this franchise. Baaghi 3 falls down under this pressure and how deep? You just can't bear it.\n\nFrom the trailer we got pretty much idea of film's story. Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) and Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) are brothers who share an unbreakable bond. Since childhood, Ronnie always comes to the rescue whenever Vikram falls in any trouble. Their journey begins when a certain turn in events, leads Vikram turned a Police officer to travel in Syria to complete some work. On this trip, Vikram gets kidnapped by people who are not to be messed with but as Ronnie witnesses his brother getting beaten and kidnapped by ISIS, he knows that he will do whatever it takes to destroy anyone and anything that stands in the way of Vikram's safety. Ronnie goes on a rampage of destruction to see his brother safe again, even if it means that he independently has to take on villain Abu Jindal or so called an entire country.\n\nWhen it comes to action films, Tiger Shroff seems like an unstoppable force. I loved him in Heropanti, Baaghi, Baaghi 2, War and now Baaghi 3 all these films have surely made him a darling of masses. He is the only action superstar among young brigade in Bollywood. What i didn't like about him is he fel less in acting everytime. His dialogue delivery in this film is at least tolerable but his expressions are totally dull. Shraddha Kapoor looks cute and but unbearably funny. there is lot of dubbing made on her dialogues and that made her look like a b grade actress. I remember watching her performance and stunts in Baaghi and i absolutely loved her but this time it is completely opposite. Riteish Deshmukh as Vikram is innocent from the start but you have a special surprise at the end, watch out for that (if you can't predict muvh like a movie buff). His wife Ruchi is played by gorgeous Ankita Lokhande and she is hardly decent. Rest of the cast is okay with thier particular cameos and supporting roles.\n\nBollywood has a massive fanbase for Action films. If there's any film seen, which shows you something bigger, larger in action genre then people would love it. In Baaghi 3 you get to see Ronnie alone smashing entire team of terrorism gang, this is something big but what about the content? Baaghi 3 falters in linear equation of storytelling. There are so many loopholes and loo breaks while setting a plot. Once you start hating them ypu just wanna go home leaving the film unfinished. Dialogues are massy flavoured, comically taunted. Music viz there are couple of songs that will keep you engaged but you know more of Tiger's dancing would have been more pleasing.\n\nAhmed Khan comes tries to make an entertainer set in emotional liberty supported by explosive action. But sadly Action director does a better job than him. It's quite irregular from his style of films and i don't know why he chose to go such kiddish way when he could have easily made a good entertainer like it's predecessor. He tries to focus more on emotions than hardcore drama where he wins couple of times but fails on more occasions. Overall, Baaghi 3 doesn't live upto the mark at all, i instead it degrades the standard of action franchise set by previous two films. I can blame director for the failure as he has totally destroyed this emerging franchise. If you love action then watch it, if you have seen enough action in trailer then better skip it.\n\nRATING- 4/10*"

'Log rishto mein hadein paar karte hain, mera ek aisa rishta tha, jiske liye maine sarhadein paar kardi (People cross limits for their relationships, I had one such relationship for which I crossed borders)' this line was enough for me to get interested in the movie. I watched it with my family and we had a great time.\n\nRiteish and Tiger are brothers. Whenever Riteish gets in trouble Tiger always helps him. After Riteish becomes a police officer Tiger helps him to clean up the criminals while Riteish gets the credit. This attention from both media and other officers brings the brothers face to face with a Terrorist.\n\nJackie Shroff had little screen time, he did an excellent job with those odd few minutes. The supporting cast did an excellent job. Tiger has done his best acting yet on this one. He showed bigger screen presence and seemed more comfortable in his role. He has come a long way in terms of acting. I liked the chemistry between Tiger and Riteish. They looked very cute and loveable.\n\nThe dialogues are surprisingly catchy. Songs are catchy as well. I loved the get ready to fight reloaded. This is the best version of get ready to fight yet.\n\nThe Action is the biggest positive of Baaghi 3. I loved Baaghi 2 for the action scenes but my god they took it to the next level in Baaghi 3. The first fight outside a Cineplex was superb and they topped it in the next fight at IPL's lair. Very few movies this year from Bollywood can compete with Baaghi 3 in terms of action. The fist fights in the first half was out of this world. The last fight scene does drag but even that had its moments.\n\nThere is not much in terms of story but the action scenes make up for that. I loved the first half. Thanks to excellent cinematography Baaghi 3 is very pleasing to the eye. Recommended if you liked Baaghi 2."

This movie is a perfect example of this, even the action scenes aren't synchronised properly. I have given one star for Tiger's acting apart from it I will give negative ratings. Ahmed Khan please work in choreography if you want to be in this industry and stop wasting our time along with yours."

Then there came 2018 Baaghi 2 little bit of dissapointment when i get to know that shradha Kapoor has been replaced by Disha Patani. But the movie was good allover. But when I get back to know that shradha kapoor is again coming back in the Baaghi 3 and even Riteish Deshmukh, i was eagerly waiting for it to come. And now i just watched the movie in Disney Hotstar.\n\nCan't believe they can make such movie in this era. The story line is overdramatic, far from the reality, we can't even say it a fictional, its far from fictional. It is one of the worst film the industry have ever made. Only Riteish Deshmukh and Jackie Shroff was good. I have a better storyline than this movie....seriously speaking. And why the hell Grandson is recruiting Ahmed Khan for direction. We have seen his direction. He can't be in comparision to Sabbir Khan. The first part was made by Sabbir Khan and he have done it very well.\n\nA single movie destroyed the whole franchisee. Tiger Shroff had been shown not less than a superhuman. After watching this, definitely Nick Fury is going to call him for MARVEL PHASE 5. I can't give you here the complete details but you must get understand till now how much good this movie is.....Seriously i am still in shocked and honestly speaking i have never seen such type of movie ever in my life. The Bollywood industry must work on their storywriting and must not give direction to the hands of any choreographer or else it will be soon on the hands of a doom.....\n\n\n\nA message to The Grandson, please take as much time as you want but dont ruin the Kick franchisee as Baaghi and please bring Sabbir Khan with a nice storyline for Baaghi 4. We are waiting for it......"

I live in NYC and wait for movies like these , movies that are entertaining on all counts. I'm not interested in psuedo Hindi movies where only the language is Hindi but the acting , direction and treatment of the film is a \"wannabe \" Hollywood. This movie is great on all counts. The acting is just fine for the genre, the script is pretty tight , direction is seamless , there are no slow or boring moments in the movie. And what do I say about the Action! It is just WOW! Tiger Shroff is something else! Right now there is nobody like him in any film industry anywhere. Thanks to Netflix and Prime, I watch movies of different languages nearly every night and I can tell you there is nobody like Tiger, anywhere. I'm so proud we have an action hero like him. There were 3 songs and all three were really good. This is an audio visual treat for your senses. I took my 2 boys for the movie and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I dont know why people are so negative towards these movies. If you dont like something maybe it's your taste , the product doesnt become bad. I being an Indian hate mangoes, doesnt mean mangoes are bad. A Hollywood movie of the same caliber would get such great praises but if we do it and do it better , we will be torn to shreds with analysis FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE ACTION, YOU CANT MISS THIS ONE!!!!"

If you watch moive like james bond or mission impossible you never say it is worst movie because they are hollywood. Please don't compare bollywood to any wood.

In Bollywood Action movies we can be considerate about logic because their main focus is not there. But even for decent actions there must be atleast a palatable storyline. Signing these crap films clearly reflects that Tiger is far from being an Actor. All his movies are these craps which he carries on his shoulders by Action and Action only. Don't know what on earth is Shraddha doing in the film. She was trying hard to be funny using some cuss words but everything looked irritating after a point. She went with Ronnie to Syria to dance, run and do some action exactly what and when Ronnie is doing the same. Disha Patani's item song in a Syrian Bar is a filth but gives us a little comfort from the mindless action going around. A Bomb blasts near Ronnie's legs but nothing happens to him, infact he gets thrust to jump upto the helicopter. Ritesh Deshmukh is a police officer with no characteristics of the same. Direction, Storyline, Songs, Humor nothing is convincing at all. Only a Single star for Tiger trying to do his level best and carry the film all by himself. I would rather request the audience to go and watch SHUBH MANGAL ZYADA SAAVDHAN Again or THAPPAD this Weekend if you want to go to movies. Avoid this Baaghi 3 crap. Please."

Ronnie is a Bollywood equivalent to a fusion of Dwayne the Rock Johnson chuck norris Tarzan and goku.

It was so bad, people in the theatre actually started laughing together even on sad scenes.\n\nZero logic.\n\nSorry can't say more. It wil be like experiencing this horific movie again. This movie should be taken down to save humanity."

Action sequences are good. But the unfaithful scenes are the drawback of this movie. If you love Tiger's action & dance, don't miss this flick. Otherwise baagi 3 is an avoidable flick."
