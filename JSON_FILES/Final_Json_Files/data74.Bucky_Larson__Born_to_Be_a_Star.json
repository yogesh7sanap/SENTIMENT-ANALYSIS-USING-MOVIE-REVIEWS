        "review_detailed_main": "Currently, \"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star\" is number 59 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List---the 100 lowest ranked major releases of all time. While I wouldn't consider this one of the worst in my opinion, I can see exactly why the film was hated by so many. The writing simply is awful....with not even a single laugh in the movie even though it's supposed to be a comedy. Instead of humor, the film resorts to crudeness. Crude CAN be funny....such as the cute film \"Stepbrothers\". But crude with no humor whatsoever is simply annoying and boorish....and this film has that in spades.\n\nBucky (Nick Swardson) is a guy from Iowa who is intensely stupid as well as possessing teeth like Bugs Bunny.....a joke that wears thin very quickly. After discovering that his parents used to be porn stars, instead of being repulsed or embarrassed, he thinks it's cool. So, his folks encourage him to trek to California to be a part of the porn industry. Hillarity SHOULD ensue...but it doesn't.\n\nUnfunny, very crude and ample evidence that Adam Sandler (yes, THAT Adam Sandler) should not write films. Overall, an unfunny and disgusting film that held no interest at all to me as I tried to watch. I could mention all the various offensive things featured in the film...but I am pretty sure IMDB would not allow me to mention them."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler's films and for the most part, I like Nick Swardson. However, this was very bad. I don't have anything against movies with sexual content or gross out stuff, it just has to be funny. After watching this, I know that Nick Swardson was NOT born to be a lead.\n\nHe gives us a semi creepy performance and all the jokes fall apart fast. For example, he says \"Miles is getting an eight ball, I don't wanna play pool\" or something like that. Just stuff that makes you cringe. The whole movie lacks an actual story, it's just a bunch of bad penis jokes and \"point and laugh at the freak\" jokes as well. A lot of great actors wasted (Christina Ricci, Mike O'Connell, Don Johnson) and the humor doesn't work here. It tries too hard to mix sentimental and mean-spirited stuff, which both fail. When Bucky gets a roommate, the dude (Kevin Nealon) is such a jerk that you wish he hung himself and left the poor guy alone.\n\nThe entire film is predictable and Stephen Dorff looks like Bret Michaels, which isn't a good thing. I smiled several times but didn't laugh at all. I don't understand why they couldn't put more effort into it. Making Bucky into a wimp who can't even perform correctly in these adult movies just shows you the thought that went into making it. Skip this one, you'll be glad you did!"

Had she played it for laughs, it would have been vastly less funny.\n\nThe very few jokes it contained were repeated far too many times, alas, but they were do dumb I don't believe they were actually intended to be funny except to an extremely narrow demographic.\n\nNot so bad that it's good, but I guess so bad that it's almost good - in parts."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is very little to say about Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star other than \"I hated it ... I hated ALL of it!\" The film is not funny and it is repellent.\n\nI cannot criticize it for being about porn because Boogie Nights was exclusively about the world of porn and I think it was one of the BEST film of the 1990's. Boogie Nights treated its characters as flawed human beings searching for acceptance and a feeling of belonging -- Bucky Larson's characters are all supposed to be laughed at and there are just too many times throughout the movie which had me wanting to rush to the bathroom to vomit as 89% of the film is stomach-churning.\n\nThis should pretty-much END the career of anybody involved and I am actually surprised that Adam Sandler's name is attached as both a writer and a producer of this trash (Sandler also gave us Jack and Jill and Just Go With It this year -- the latter film is only saved b/c of the over-the-top performance of the unlikely physical comedienne Nicole Kidman -- so I question whether or not his days are numbered?).\n\nAn unfunny-to-me Nick Swardson (Just Go With It, 30 Minutes or Less, Blades of Glory) -- who's career is mostly stand-up comedy -- stars as the grotesquely buck-toothed Bucky Larson (who must've been born with buck-teeth?) who believes he is destined for a glorious career in porn after discovering his parents were au natural (meaning: unshaven, un-waxed, un-spray-tanned, un-fit etc) porn stars of the 1970's. Bucky leaves behind an insulting-to-mid-westerners existence in Iowa (only found in the movies -- he didn't attend high school because his town didn't have one ... whatever), the RIDICULOUSLY-accented Bucky (that is NOT an Iowa accent ... but let's throw-out another stupid laugh at the expense of the heartland) heads to LA where his dreams can come true.\n\nBucky luckily meets a nice, big-hearted waitress (Christina Ricci - Sleepy Hollow, Penelope, Monster ... and after this is it any wonder she seeked out employment on television as Pan-Am is Oscar-caliber compared to this!) at a random diner who befriends him, finds him a place to live (with crazy-jerk roommate Kevin Nealon - \"SNL\", \"Weeds\", Just Go With It) and sets him in the right direction of finding work. Don Johnson (Tin Cup, Machete ... who's short-lived career rebirth must be over) is porn director Miles Deep who sees something \"special\" in Bucky and decides to exploit the freak (it's explained in the film ... but I don't recommend watching this to figure out the \"freak-tag\" that has NOTHING to do with his teeth!) and Stephen Dorff (who's stellar \"comeback\" with the excellent film Somewhere must have been a fluke!!) plays a jealous porn-star rival.\n\nAs vulgar and repulsive as this film is, there is surprisingly little flesh on display. It would be difficult to pick-out the worst part of this film as that would pretty-much be the whole thing. Just as impossible would be finding \"the best\" part. This film isn't bad because it is offensive -- we've had Bridesmaids and two Hangover films -- it is just terrible bad. What works with those 3 films is that they are \"equal-opportunity offenders\" ... this one -- NOT so much. It is rank and rancid and beyond mere words for criticism. I NEVER want to see something like this again."

This film should be the death-knell of not only Nick Swardson's entire career, but Adam Sandler's \"Happy Madison\" production company should be banned from making any more movies until Sandler publicly apologizes for this horrible horrible waste of film. The dialogue sounds like it was written by three horny middle-school boys, the acting was strained and half-hearted, the plot was spoon-fed predictable.

There are some genuine laugh out loud moments in this movie IF it's your sense of humour. If it isn't, then why are you watching it? Sandler isn't exactly world renowned for his subtlety or his sensitive handling of subject matter. He has a team of friends around him who obviously get together over a few drinks and spin out some ideas that make them laugh. I like that about him. And I always get the impression that everybody making one of his movies has a real laugh doing it. And that's what I'm after when I'm watching one. Honestly, some people on here need to have a good look at themselves and wonder exactly why it is they are watching movies they know they aren't going to like.

This movie had a lot of promotion which put my hopes higher than the result, a lot higher. If you cant tell already i didn't enjoy myself.

So much so that the movie has an absurd aura that ends up begging the audience to not take it seriously. With that aside I myself focused on the jokes and little things I did enjoy. I laughed several times (especially at Kevin Nealon) and found a few other things to be entertained by.

I rated The Mirror, 10/10, and Bucky Larson, I rate it 9/10, the same ratings I gave for Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Rear Window, Fanny and Alexander and Vertigo.\n\nI personally think that Bucky Larson is vastly superior to most comedies. Take another random comedy, House Bunny, that was a plain bad movie but this is much more than that, if you are able to get it, of course. One needs to be able to fully master the art of watching crappy comedies before trying this kind of stuff which was made for the specialists. I have already watched hundreds of bad comedies and about 20 Adam Sandler movies and this operates on another league of greatness.\n\nI would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's.\n\nMy ratings would be:\n\n9/10 - Specialists 0/10 - Most people\n\nI wouldn't recommend this movie for regular people.

Here we have a character, unseen anywhere else, played by a second rate actor who hasn't quite made a household name yet. To market an unknown character with antics like the ones present in this movie isn't as much hard as it is devotion. To go through with a project of this magnitude means you must have a lot of faith in the material.\n\nIn Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, there is no faith, hope, wit, soul, or even a sign that this was taken to a remote extent of seriousness. All the actors seem to be laughing at their own joke shamelessly - nearly all of them equally unfunny and sad. Adam Sandler hit a landmark year in 2011. Not only did he work on four movies this whole year, he starred in two of them. Out of the four released, Just Go With It, Zookeeper, Bucky Larson, and Jack and Jill, three of them you can simply look at the film's poster and decide if you want to pay to see it. They're films that almost don't even care that they're bad.\n\nI've seen four films where Nick Swardson plays one of the lead actors or a supporting actor. Three of them easily dismissible, and one that wouldn't be considered mediocre if he was carefully extracted from the film entirely. He simply is not funny. I think it's honestly the material that makes him unfunny. I've seen scattered clips of his standup and he is slightly funny. Maybe he works better when he writes his own lines. Yet, that can't be. This was co-written by Swardson himself, who I assume wrote most, if not, all of the dialog for his character. Maybe he works best with himself and himself only locked in a sound-proof room where he can be alone with his thoughts.\n\nAdam Sandler and his Happy Madison Productions company have now just given me one of the least ambitious comedies I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even feel like it's trying to be funny. It seems to be a series of cheap shots taken at a character that was made for that one purpose. Why not make a character who has some likability? Nope. Go straight to the drawing board and come up with a desperately unfunny character with no shining qualities, give him a desperately unforgiving plot to work with where he can get himself into lame, uninspired situations, and to top him all off, make him the most gullible, pathetic title character in the last few decades of film.\n\nThe fact I'm using the phrase \"least ambitious\" for a comedy film reminds me of a group of films in the last years that have also stopped trying. Parody films. They have been drab, tiresome works of dreck, glazed with immaturity and held together by such a simple, lackluster plot it almost doesn't matter. It becomes a competition for how many pop culture references can we throw into one film.\n\nThe same thing sort of occurs in Bucky Larson. It's a competition to see how many unconvincing gags we can put this pathetically embarrassing protagonist in. The story centers around a misfit with an annoying overbite named Bucky Larson (Swardson). Upon discovering his parents are ex-porn star legends, he travels to Hollywood, hoping that since he is the son (hopefully) of two icons he can make a living as one as well.\n\nLet me say there is nothing funny about a man-child who pulls down his pants in front of a camera, grunting, moaning, and screaming before ejaculating. Absolutely, positively nothing funny about that scenario. Yet the film does it three, if not four times within its ninety minute runtime. If it's not funny the first time, it definitely won't be the second, the third, or even the forth time around.\n\nBucky Larson: Born to Be a Star didn't upset me as much as some would think. It actually was rather typical of Happy Madison. We've seen this goofy, oddball style before. But that is no excuse for a terrible movie. The jokes are terribly flat, the lead character we are expected to sympathize with is wretched in his presentation, the setups are typical, the writing is labored, and we are offered nothing new in the terms of layout or formula. It's a movie experience of deplorable, unforgivable quality.\n\nStarring: Nick Swardson, Christina Ricci, Don Johnson, and Stephen Dorff. Directed by: Tom Brady."

        "review_detailed_main": "Intrigued by the dastardly rep, \"Bucky Larson\" ventured into my repertoire in order to privately observe how low the director Tom Brady managed to stoop. And I wasn't disappointed. This simplistic comedy centres around the buck teeth-challenged Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) and his dream to become a famous porn star, irregardless of his minuscule manhood. Inspired by his parents, who were once famous genre actors of the 70s, Bucky decides to challenge his destiny moving from small town Iowa to the Hollywood boulevards. Despite his physical deficiencies Bucky soon manages to enter into the business, mainly thanks to a chance meeting with rundown porn director Miles Deep (Don Johnson) and the backing of waitress Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci). Insert random below the belt jokes and off we go...\n\nThe gags arrive in bundles, yet surprisingly all of them are poorly construed and remarkably flat. Honestly, not a single joke even manages to register a positive chuckle or giggle, making it a whole other level of lame comedy, surpassing the feats of the Wayan brothers, who despite all their crass lewdness register a few successful hits in each movie. Chaotic timing does not help the overall poor level of constructed gags, while actor Nicky Swardson has famously put off any future interest in him as a lead, lacking charisma and delivering a dissuasive anti-performance offering Bucky Larson no sympathetic appeal whatsoever. Somewhere in this mix decent actors show up and offer half-hearted performances, that fail to liven up proceedings. Don Johnson possibly needed the money, but the presence of Christina Ricci and Stephen Dorff in this bona fide turd is a true mystery.\n\nLumbering along with tirades of trite jokes, this monstrosity of a movie does not even invoke laughter as to how bad it is, instead imbuing an overbearing notion of boredom. Required watching for those who want to know how not to make a comedy."

The CIA should use outtakes of him for torturing confessions out of terrorists.\n\nThe film's ongoing orgasm/ejaculation shtick is utterly tasteless and just makes you queasy.

        "review_detailed_main": "I just don't understand the hate towards Bucky Larson. The buzz kills giving it a single star must either have no sense of humor or never gave it a chance. No doubt you will see a lot of reviews by people who will look down at this movie and think they are too good for Bucky Larson.\n\nIs it an intellectual masterpiece? Of course not. But if you enjoy dumb comedies such as Scary Movie, Grandma's Boy or the Interview then you can't go wrong with Bucky Larson.\n\nAfter accidentally witnessing a vintage adult film staring his country parents and learning they were huge adult stars in the 70's, Bucky hears his calling. He is going to Los Angeles to follow in their footsteps and become and adult star himself because its his destiny. The main character is great but its the friends and foes alike that he meets along his heros journey are what bring the movie to the next level.\n\nNick Swardson is absolutely hilarious as the lovable beaver toothed underdog Bucky. Don Johnson is great as a drug addicted adult film director and Stephen Dorff is the perfect foil as the cocky (haha, get it?) well endowed current megastar industry star looking to protect his spot at the top. And Kevin Neelan is delightfully weird as Bucky's Psycotic roommate. Christina Ricci is fine I guess as the object of Bucky's affection.\n\nI was randomly watching Bucky over a year ago, was still in the movies beginning and my girlfriend (who isn't really a huge comedy fan) was just kind of watching for a minute as she was grabbing something in the living room and started laughing so hard that she ended up sitting down and watching the entire movie with me. And she surprisingly loved it.\n\nIf you're expecting something Oscar worthy then you're going to be disappointed. If you aren't a fan of dumb comedies, d*ck and fart jokes then don't bother. But if you want to just sit back and mindlessly laugh at a dumb comedy this is a great pick. It is written and acted better than it has any right to be. But I laughed throughout the entire movie from beginning to end. Sometimes until my sides hurt. And isn't that all that really matters?"

It made me think of a rerun of Zach and Miri Make A Porno on Cinemax After Dark or Hugh Hefner's runaway bride disaster. For those of you Adam Sandler fans, make sure you don't buy any movie with the words \"Happy Madison\" on it. The script, cast, even a Pauly Shore comeback can't save him from being a failure of box office bombs and the list goes on and on. Try looking at a list of great pornstars like Sasha Grey and Jenna Jamison. That'll get your head pumping. \"Bucky Larson\" is so bad, even \"Grandma's Boy\" made Grandma a nice big piece of sugar cookies.\n\nBottom Line: This is one of the worst obese films of 2011 and as I could recall to Bucky Larson, I should re-name my title \"Bucky Larson: Born to Suck Every Adam Sandler movie and let my critics throw Subway sandwiches at me.\" Nick Swordswan, you deserved a Razzie for that and Worst Picture."

But I will put it into my own words.\n\nWhile I will admit there are like 4 lines in the movie that made me laugh hysterically (mostly Kevin Nealon parts), the movie itself is disaster. There is no way to explain the outright awfulness of it, but I will try.\n\nIt's hard to believe that such an amazing cast would even SHOW UP for this movie. Bottom line. And yeah, Nick Swardson is usually hilarious.. but come on. The character Bucky Larson is the most unlikeable character I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen thousands by now. And that alone makes the plot unbelievable.\n\nI suppose there is a whole, \"even guys with small dick's deserve love and can get a hot girl\" message there somewhere, but its clouded by stupidity, and its never very moving, because there is just NO CHANCE Christina Ricci would ever touch \"Bucky Larson\" - Stephen Dorf has a line in the movie \"Am I in the Twilight Zone?\" That is the only place where the story of this movie would ever be even remotely believable.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, there is ONE conflict and it happens in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest is literally climbing action. There's no climax. It is seriously the worst movie I have seen in years.\n\nDon't bother. The Hangover 2 (so horrible as well) was better than this movie, and I think I laughed more here... That's saying something about the script/plot of this movie. It's just a disaster.\n\n1/10."

Going in I saw the reviews for this (2.2 out of 10 on IMDb, 33 out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes) and I am usually skeptical of bad reviews. Like most good ones they tend to exaggerate how good or bad a movie is. This is did not. This is awful. A few funny parts mixed in with the same joke over and over and over. The best part of this movie hands down is Kevin Nealon but he is not in it enough. I will say that I have seen worse, but this is a movie that people will watch out of curiosity and may regret it. Overall, not the worst comedy I have seen, but without Nealon it may have been. I give it a D+."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Adam Sandler-produced Nick Swardson vehicle \"Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star\" is arguably one of the most dead-on-arrival comedies of the past decade. The film is an attempt to make a fun, quirky, raunchy comedy based on the idea of a clueless, semi-ugly nice-guy who gets pulled into the world of the adult film industry, but the material is all too basic, and it doesn't take advantage at all of the situation. Jokes are all phoned-in and are the sort 13-year-old boys snicker at to each other, and the writing is downright offensively bad.\n\nNick Swardson plays Bucky Larson, a simpleton with an outlandish set of buck-teeth. Upon discovering that his parents were famous porn-stars in the 70's, he sets off to travel to Hollywood and break into the family business, intent on becoming a star. Along the way, he meets a failing director (Don Johnson), an adorable waitress (Christina Ricci) and an antagonistic male porn star. (Stephen Dorff)\n\nThe film is a definite mess. The writing is very basic. (With the most basic sexual jokes about \"size\", \"stamina\", etc imaginable) And the few attempts at raunchy, gross-out humor are poorly conveyed and equally basic and unfunny. And characters are alternating gratingly boring, or breath-takingly over-the-top. Although some of the performances give a few characters a likable edge. Particularly Ricci as Kathy, an absolutely gorgeous waitress Bucky falls for. Swardson is also not bad for the role, and despite the absolute mess, Bucky is well-played. In addition, his constantly-aggressive roommate is an absolute blast, yelling at Bucky for absolutely everything.\n\nEverything in this film is sub-par. as I said, the writing is far too basic and uninspired. The director is also bland and boring, supporting roles are underdeveloped. There are almost no laughs in the film, and the conflicts of the characters are completely and utterly unrelatable, and therefore not funny or sensical by any stretch.\n\nThis is just an example of a film where everything is fundamentally underwhelming and basic to the point where it's tedious to watch. You may notice this review is pretty anemic, and that's because I simply have not been able to finish the film. I've only watched about 45 minutes of it, in pieces, fast-forwarding through the rest because it's such a flawed piece of work that I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing.\n\nI'm giving this an extremely generous 2 out of 10, mainly for Ricci' adorable-ness and a few funny side-characters. But seriously, take it from me- I tried to give it a chance, and I'm kicking myself for watching it. Avoid this mess."

I'm giving it a grade of 7 out of 10, because it is a great laugh whenever I'm down.\n\nAlso, Christina Ricci is just adorable. Perfect for her role."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, Quite possibly one of the greatest family movies of all time. This movie is very multi-cultural and lives up to the great critic response. This movie has impacted society so much following the come of the infamous young notorious 'Bucky Larson'!. Bucky appears to be your every day sweet heart but deep down he's a chigga chigga bad boy, unlike P'diddy Bucky Larson is not gang related, he is affiliated with the top people in the industry of L.A and uses his ol' folks skills to succeed in life. This movie will inspire young people all around the world to follow their dreams and not give up when the chicks are down. This movie smashed in records at the box office snatching a whooping '$2.5 million' the budget happened to be '$10 million' but its times like this when the chicks are down that like 'Bucky Larson' that you buckle up and follow your dreams.\n\nWatch other movies like 'Shawshank Redemption' 'Batman: Darknight' or the basic and generic 'Babby Driver' none of these movies compare to the sophisticated 'Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star'. The amount of diversity and satisfaction you obtain is quite unique and fresh to the audience. In conclusion this film is far better and timid compared to the 'Doogie Howser TV SHOW'. The kids will love it as well whats better then that? That's a rhetorical question by the way of course there going to love it. Bucky Larson the character is the definition of raw perfection and 'Nick Swardson' the actor is very talented. Thankyou for reading my review remember at the end of the day everyone is en- tilted to their own opinion xox - Regards the LU WIZZAR foundation"

Pain. However I'll give it an extra star because there are a few gags that actually land and you'll probably have one or two hearty chuckles. And Christina Ricci delivers a solid performance. Actually the supporting cast in general is pretty solid. It just makes it all the more confusing, like how are these people supporting Nick Swardson.

The first is Don Johnson's concept of playing Miles Deep as a porn industry vet.This is not particularly funny, but I kept thinking it might have been more funny if his character had also been named Don Johnson, as well as a completely acceptable porn name de plume.(Look, I didn't say it was that funny, just funnier than anything in the movie.) The other thing is that Edward Herrmann, in the same week this movie is published, will also see the launch of a project more adapted to his talents, the voice of Roger Ebert's autobiography's audio version, \"Life Itself.\"In other words, Roger Ebert is only one degree of separation from the people responsible for \"Bucky Larson.\" As he is currently at the Toronto International Film Festival, I couldn't ask what he thought about this connection, but I think that if I had, his response would have been a mildly abashed nod and a request for a Purell bottle of \"Contagion\" size.Believe me, the feeling I understand."

You can't say it was an \"awful\" movie in the sense that it was poorly acted, written and directed. It wasn't. I think \"stupid\" is actually what Swardson, Brady, Sandler, etc. were going for. It's on the same level as making fun of handicapped kids or laughing at farts.\n\nThere is an audience for movies like this, and who are we to judge this audience and the people willing to make movies to cater to them?\n\nAccording to IMDb, \"males under 18\" rate it just as low as everyone else. I suspect that the 11-14 year old boys who would find this movie the most amusing are not the sort to visit IMDb."

The fact that men masturbate was not dodged or hinted it was an obvious fact and even in a group scene was not reflected as homo-erotic just as being a natural.\n\nI particularly liked the way the parent/son relationship was portrayed. Mom and Pop, even though they had starred in porno back in the day, came across as loving proud parents and Bucky had obviously embraced good social values.\n\nThe normalization of the porn industry was well handled and yet the essential goodness of faithfulness was also brought to the fore.\n\nAll in all an amusing evening and the enjoyment of seeing some sensitive issues handled with a deft touch. Hats off to everybody involved."

There is something uplifting in the story.\n\nNick Swarsdon I thought was kind of annoying in 'Just Go With It' and in this movie he is annoying too but that is part of the character. He isn't a terrific comedian but he tries hard. The supporting cast is actually better than expected - quite good for what they are cast as. Christina Ricci is prettier than before and is quite sweet and touching as the girlfriend. Don Johnson is quite good as a slightly sleazy but kind porn director. Stephen Dorff is an arrogant porn star.\n\nOverall if you are in the mood for a crude comedy then it's quite cute in parts."

It's your standard Happy Gilmore comedy, not too good but not the worst movie ever made. The comedy in it isn't that bad if you really think about. The issue is, it's almost too raunchy even for today's time. The raunch in it made it almost unwatchable at certain parts. It's almost like a junior boys movie to be honest.

        "review_detailed_main": "I understand the movie is ridiculously stupid, but Nick Swardson is hilarious in this. I think it has to be his funniest performance hands down. I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw his face and the bucked teeth with bowl cut. Coming in to this movie you knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. If you can't handle comedies that are stupid and funny you should avoid them. I think the people giving Buck Larson a 1/10 were the same ones giving Warrior 10 and comparing it to Rocky, but let's stick to the review anyways. With Happy Madison movies it's either always a hit or miss. I think Sandler gave us another great dark comedy that will be loved by a small group of people, and hated by most. The dark humour in Bucky Larson is very dirty, so be prepared for that. I think it appeals to mostly men who are 18-35. If you saw Grandmas Boy that would be the best way I could describe the very dark humour of this movie. I was disappointed Allen Covert didn't have a bigger role in Bucky Larson but im sure Sandler has other plans for him. At the end of the day this was Swardson at his absolute best. Christina Ricci also did a great job with the role she was given. Stephen Dorff was good as always, but Kevin Nealon (bull dance guy from Happy Gilmore) had me in tears. I have never heard him swear before so when he goes off it's priceless and unexpected. I think Bucky Larson Born To Be A Star deserves an 8/10 and it's unfortunate that people these days can't handle a great comedy just because it's dirty. No dirty isn't the word for it, this movie is filthy. I am laughing again just thinking about the concept. At least Sandler gave us something really filthy for a change, finally back to his roots."

Obviously this movie isn't for everyone, so if your into Sopranos or don't know how to be goofy and fun then stay away! To be indirect, it might offend the \"smaller\" crowd, and at the same time giving hope.\n\nThis movie touches on all the bases of what a movie needs, and then disregards them quickly. We come to expect movies to have way to much drama, and long scenes of terrible progression but Bucky didn't annoy me like that. What we find is a comedy to chat during and throw some popcorn. Being such a serious and critical society I found this film to be very refreshing."

        "review_detailed_main": "People say it's the worst movie they've ever seen, but I'd bet those people haven't seen many movies because they already have a stick where the sun doesn't shine. They also say you'd have to like Happy Madison to enjoy it, but I've seen a lot of Happy Madison movies and they don't compare to this. There are cheesy moments, but they are done in a manner that barely trips you up or takes you out of the moment. I think there are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and honestly, If you like Nick Swardson you'll find plenty of entertainment in this movie. Based on other reviews I was expecting bad cinematography, lighting, jokes, plot, and dialog. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's on par with other comedies. People seem to think that every movie made needs to be on par with the greatest movies of all time but I'd recommend it for anyone who finds humor in silly films that are obviously ridiculous from the premise."

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought Nick Swadson's acting as Bucky Larson was hilarious! It may be offensive to some people. I think this is because it has some awkward scenes of a sexual nature. I don't usually hassle my friends to watch movies or watch a movie myself with a low review rating, but for 'Bucky Larson' I've no regrets & friends who love this movie have confirmed it's humor quality. This is not a badly acted movie. Nick Swardson commits to his character outrageously as 'Bucky'! He's a lovable and gentle hearted outsider but unknowingly has no inhibitions, & it is his genuinely played innocence that makes this such a laugh out load movie, & Christina Ricci, Don Johnson are great supporting actors."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bucky Larson is an absolute joke... A joke that lands over and over and over again. I can't help but bust up laughing several times throughout the film. I think the film is very underrated, and people just rip it apart as if it wasn't a comedy, but guess what. It is a comedy... and I am not an easy laugh, yet I cannot help myself here.\n\nPeople claim they didn't laugh a single time throughout the film, and if that is actually true for you, then I think you are the problem. Yes, you read that correctly. I can't even list all the moments that earn a laugh just from being so ridiculous, and it really sounds like a \"you\" issue.\n\nThere are issues. A few characters are indeed abrasive and annoying. The Dick Shadows guy. The roommate. The diner owner.... but the whole film is produced so well, and I laugh so hard at some things that I don't care at all.\n\nBucky Larson is a silly movie with hilarious moments, and if you can't enjoy that, then you are a low quality person."

I have not laughed that hard in many years. That alone warrants me to write this review. Nick Swardson is so very funny to me; always. His performance in Blades of Glory was stellar. His Comedy Central stand up appearance; was pretty good. With some work he could be really great at stand up.. Christina Ricci was really great too. Her expressions were so convincing. She really made me think she was a all American wholesome girl; through the whole movie. Don Johnson was also so entertaining; his performance alone would have made this movie great. Kevin Nealon as Gary; was just icing on the cake."

Easily a 7.0\n\nI would say that I got a lot of fun from watching this impressive work of art that defies convention and goes where no other movie has gone before. It was a \"bad movie\" done entirely on purpose by the director and writers. Just like the porn movies Bucky made in the movie, this is innovation and film critics, people who were brainwashed in film school to like 1940's stuff, cannot simply understand the genius of this film, as did the people on the porn business which were shown Bucky film's."

These are expressions of a collected effort that take hundreds of professional artists, technicians and engineers working towards that final goal: to produce a piece of Cinema that truly touches the viewer. They make the audience open their mind eye's and see the world around them for what it really is or what it could be. Other Directors and Writers see this film and are inspired to raise their own standard even higher. Having never known one could produce a work of this quality they know they must surpass it.

Something like Grandma's Boy...\n\nThe character of Bucky is very inspirational. He finds and lives his dreams, despite some issues that would stop most people, and despite people telling him it wouldn't be possible. And he's from a humble Midwest background, which is cute.\n\nUltimately it all works. Show this movie to your friends and they will think it's great too!"

It's the character quirks and the silliness of the situations that make the comedy so hysterical and I honestly laughed throughout so I don't know what the haters' problem is.

If you liked Grandma's Boy, you'll probably like this. It had most of the familiar stars from the Happy Madison movies plus Christina Ricci, and she was adorable in this movie.\n\nThis isn't Happy Gilmore level, but fun to watch. All of the negative reviewers should stick with the cookie cutter romantic comedies so they won't get offended so easily."
