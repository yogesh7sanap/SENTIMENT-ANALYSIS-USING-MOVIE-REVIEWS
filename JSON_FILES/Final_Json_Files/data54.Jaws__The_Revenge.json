        "review_detailed_main": "In Jaws 2 a person told sheriff Brody that sharks don't take things personally...in this one they apparently not only do, but they also will hunt you down to the ends of the earth. This focuses on the most mediocre character of the first two Jaws, Ellen Brody. It starts with one of her sons being out on a boat and being killed by a shark. Why he is out on the water is anyone's guess seeing as he was afraid of water in 3, which I do believe this one completely ignores. This attack is probably the only real good scene in the flick cause we are off to the Caribbean where Ellen goes to visit with her other son who just doesn't seem all to upset by his brother's death. What is waiting for her here, but the exact same shark that killed her other son. Michael Caine is in this and this somehow makes me wonder why couldn't they have just forgotten about the Brody's and maybe have it be about Caine in Australia or something as a shark hunter...why do we have to have the same family, you have a better chance of being struck by lightening than you do of being attacked by a shark yet this family is constantly being attacked by sharks. Maybe they all bath in fish blood before swimming? Anyway this film is quite bad and was a pretty bad way to end the franchise."

When the movie was over, Jaws: The Revenge left me with more questions than answers. Here's a laundry list of my questions:\n\n1. How did a movie as good as Jaws spawn this junk?\n\n2. Regardless of where the shark is in the ocean, how is it capable of knowing the moment a Brody sticks so much as a big toe into the water?\n\n3. If you attributed your husband's and son's deaths to a great white shark, wouldn't you want to go to someplace like Oklahoma instead of the Bahamas?\n\n4. Do all Bahamians slip in and out of their accents the way Mario Van Peebles does in Jaws: The Revenge?\n\n5. Could they have possibly made the shark look any more fake?\n\n6. Snails?\n\n7. You mean that piece of welded together scrap metal was supposed to represent all that is good about the Bahamas?\n\n8. Do sharks really jump out of the water like Shamu and roar like a lion?\n\n9. What's more frightening - a great white shark or Ellen Brody's hair?\n\n10. Is there a bigger acting whore on the planet than Michael Caine?\n\nThe best way to watch a movie like Jaws: The Revenge is with a group of friends. There's plenty here to make fun of."

        "review_detailed_main": "On the island Amity during the Christmas break, Mrs. Ellen Brody's younger son Deputy Sean is taken by a great white shark one night after being called out to move a piece of wood tangled up with a buoy. After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family. Ellen wants Michael to not go near the water, but he convinces her that it's all fine, since great whites don't like the warm water. But hold on as the shark that killed Sean is now stalking the family and has only one thing on mind - to wipe out the Brody family.\n\nLeave those Brody's alone! Err, what crud\u0085 yeah reading the outline above you'll be just rolling your eyes at how ridiculous this film does get. The last sequel \"Jaws 3\" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast. While, the rest were simply one-note and Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent was just so dodgy. But what was in need of a life-jacket was the dire script that threw out many awful lines of dialogues. \"I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.\" What?! The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled\u0085 what? I just don't see it. Well, the sprawling beach lines and crystal blue waters were a nice sight. Too bad that the mechanical, but crooked plastic shark slowly got in the way. The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.\n\nIt's definitely as bad as its reputation. This is one shark that just won't let go!"

Or maybe (and here's something they could have pursued) it was the WIFE of the previous shark who decided the wife of her husband's killer should suffer. Well she did suffer, by appearing in this movie. For Jaws 5 I suggest the surviving family members of Mrs. Brodie swim back to New York and start biting sharks."

        "review_title": "So bad, it's incredible...",
        "review_detailed_main": "If there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the Jaws series is it. The original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors. By comparison, Michael Caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. Lance Guest and Mario Van Peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while Lorraine Gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening.\n\nClearly, the budget spent on this film didn't go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. Exactly why Michael Brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. Perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. An alternate explanation of why Michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. The true Ed Wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at Elaine. This is the first time I've heard of sharks having vocal cords. Given the box office draw this stinker had, I suspect it will be the last.\n\nThe shark takes a real beating here, too. The reason the shark wasn't seen often in the original was because Spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesn't move like a real shark. In this edition of the Jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the model's flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. There are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. There is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the shark's main fin.\n\nTo its credit, Jaws: The Revenge is well-photographed. While the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. The fact that even frames with one character in them won't make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. If only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film.\n\nAnother area where Jaws: The Revenge deserves due credit is the score music. While the score is very much inspired by that which John Williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. In fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. The music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of film-making, really shouldn't have any.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I gave Jaws: The Revenge a one out of ten. It works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. As a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. It's not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible."

Ellen Brody is now living in the Bahamas after her youngest son Sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become Chief of the Amity police, is killed by another Great White Shark. In what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the Brody family, and after it kills Sean, it swims against the Gulf Stream down to the Bahamas so it can kill Ellen and Michael as well. Jaws: The Revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series.\n\nThe plot is completely wrong in this movie. The whole plot is built off of bs. I can't even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the Brody family. It's ridiculous! Aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. The shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry.\n\nThe acting in this movie is so bad that...You know what? I don't even want to discuss it. It's bad. Terrible. Loathsome. Repugnant. What else is there? Lorraine Gray played Ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. Even Michael Caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all.\n\nEvery copy of Jaws: The Revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film.\n\n1/10"

Throughout my Jaws reviews I've likened each one to a Shark, Jaws 1 is a Great white, proud, majestic with a huge bite. Jaws 2 is a Blue Shark, a lesser beast but still a meanie, 3 was a Basking shark, toothless, Jaws the Revenge is Bile, it's not even a shark, it is simply bile. The effects here make Jaws 3D look like a stellar 21st century blockbuster, the shark looks like a rubber monster from a Pound Shop, the acting is atrocious, Caine himself is shocking.\n\nBy now I think all behavioural aspects of a shark have vanished, this thing in the sea is not of any known life form. A shark with a vendetta is quite funny I guess, the stylish terror of the first has vanished. Simply put this should not be watched under any circumstances, and yet it was a relative box office hit. Wonders will never cease, avoid. 1/10"

It also functions as a lesson to movie executives (like Sheinberg) about when to let go of a franchise.\n\nIn a movie that is so universally panned for its story and effects it would be pointless for me to put the boot in further, so I will highlight what I think are positives.\n\nPersonally, I think the actors do their best with bad material. Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, Karen Young and Michael Caine have moments when they make their characters feel genuine as opposed to just players in a dodgy production. These for me are the scenes of interaction between characters that do not involve shark horror. I am not saying many are strong, but I think some of them work.\n\nGary would have been capable of carrying a better story, as her emotions and strength shine through in various moments, but overall there is very little material that showcases her ability.\n\nYou can tell the filmmakers are clutching at straws for entertainment at times by sexualising Young's character in certain scenes, but at least she does make the character alluring. In fact, I think the scene where Michael looks out of the bedroom window, with shadows of the rain cast on him, and Carla flicks an item of clothing to get his attention is quite cinematic.\n\nCaine plays his usual persona and his charismatic presence is enough to lift certain scenes but not the overall viewing experience. You have to admire the honesty of anyone who can see the positive by focussing on the house built with the acting fee.\n\nI think Michael Small's musical score does a good job of enhancing certain sequences and making it more tense than deserved given the premise and footage captured.\n\nVisually, I like the location shots in The Bahamas, as it makes for a suitably tropical backdrop for the action taking place. If anything it is a reasonably good advert for the Nassau area. I am not going waste any time restating all flaws associated with roaring sharks, the infamous finale and other generally dodgy nautical horror. It appears the actors and editor had very little material to work with in a rushed production.\n\nIt made a relatively good profit at the box office so I guess the Universal executives had the last laugh."

Similarly, the creative black hole of a script somehow bests its own storyline absurdities by shamelessly stealing elements from Spielberg's classic original through clunky, senseless flashbacks (Ellen Brody recalls her husband killing the shark, despite not having been there to witness it) and in certain cases blatant plundering and rehashing of scenes (the charming interplay between Roy Scheider and his son from the first Jaws is leeringly plagiarized, devoid of any redeeming values whatsoever).\n\nAll of which goes without mentioning the most glaring absurdities of the very premise: a shark seeking vengeance against family members of one who once killed a completely unrelated shark, enough so to track them to the Bahamas shows such a staggering lack of logic that one wonders how the film could possibly have been greenlit in the first place. But in this twisted reality, such qualms are easily explained away, as is the shark's outracing planes, standing on its tail, roaring and spontaneously combusting - it is difficult to imagine anything sealing the film's utter absence of quality any further.\n\nWhile Spielberg masked the clunky falsities of his mechanical shark by mostly obscuring it with subjective point of view camera work, director Joseph Sargent appears to positively revel in his antagonist's foibles, keeping his obviously fake shark in plain view to a comical extent. Similarly, viewers are even denied a high body count of entertainingly poor shark attacks, as the film's near non-existent carnage is devoid of any campy gruesomeness, resorting to extreme close-ups of the absurdly unconvincing attacks, generating less menace than watching a snail crawl.\n\nAs a secondary character, the relatively poor acting of Lorraine Gary's Ellen Brody was for the most part easy to miss, but thrust into a lead role and her complete lack of a performance is unmistakable. Embarrassingly melodramatic or completely devoid of emotion depending on the scene, the banality of Gary's imbalanced attempted character is one of the film's weaker points, which is saying a lot. As her allegedly heroic son, Lance Guest's height of emotional intensity appears to be a slightly bewildered stare, proving comical at best, but little more. The hilariously ill-advised Michael Caine (the only cast member to escape with his career intact, and must have collected a considerable paycheque) usually appears to be reading his lines from a teleprompter offscreen with the same lack of emotion one would expect, and the absurdity of his sporadic romance with the far older Ellen Brody only furthers the stupidity. Finally, Mario Van Peebles is simply inexcusable; his atrociously bad Jamaican accent is a constant tarnish on the film's already consistently sullied quality, and once again, he fails to be over the top bad enough to prove enjoyable, simply resulting as noisy and pathetic.\n\nAstoundingly horrible only scratches the surface of what can be considered no less than a masterpiece of lapsed logic and catastrophic film-making, even failing on the front of being overblown enough to make a suitable unintentional comedy. While the film's atrocious quality is hardly a surprise, it still boggles the mind simply how bad an outcome it was possible to achieve. In fact, the film's laughably ludicrous tagline \"This time it's personal\" could well apply to the audiences watching the film: this time the franchise is not only resoundingly poor, but a personal insult to every last viewer unfortunate enough to find themselves watching it.\n\n-1/10"

The story is about a killer great white shark who comes back to amity in the winter and kills one of the Brody sons at the very start of the movie. Then when the rest of family goes to the Bahamas, the shark hell bent on revenge follows them and tries to kill them all. This movie would have been definitely if Roy Scheider was in it like Jaws 1& 2 but the movie redeems it self itself with some very good acting from Lance Guest and Judith Barsi(RIP) and from some very great scenes with the shark that are unforgettable. This movie passed my expectations plus it had a menacing score which I personally like more than the original's score. It works but a few areas could be better like the ending but all in all Go and See It. It 's most definitely better than the 3rd."

The storyline follows the widow of Sheriff Brody and her remaining son who is now a marine biologist in the Bahamas. The widow believes the original Jaws is still out there hunting her family and they're in danger. Could that really be true or has the events of her past caused her to lose her mind? This movie is directed by Joseph Sargent (The Taking of Pelham One Two Threw) and stars Lorraine Gary (Jaws), Mario Van Peebles (Heartbreak Ridge), Lance Guest (Halloween II) and Michael Caine (The Prestige). The storyline for this as a whole is bad but is entertaining to watch unfold. I will say the first kill over the Christmas music was a good start to the film. Michael Caine and Peebles were fun in this and provided good comic relief. The underwater scenes were excellent again as they were in the historic films and the banana boat kill was well done. The shark in this was just okay but better than the previous film. Overall this is a bad but entertaining film. I'd score this a 4.5-5/10 and recommend seeing it once."

Moreover, the shark in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" performed such amazing aquatic feats that certainly it must have been trying out for the Olympic synchronized swimming team.\n\nIf it's terror and vengeance on the high seas you're thirsting for, take my advice: bypass this last installation in the Jaws saga and curl up with a reliable volume of Melville instead."

First, the action scenes are better in this one. I liked the surroundings better too. The Caribbean was a really great place to shoot a Jaws-movie. The story isn't very good, but I think it's nearly impossible to make a good story this late in the series. On the interesting side, Michael Caine is in this movie.

This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quartet protagonist, Larraine Gary,Lance Guest, Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles . Acceptable cinematography by John McPherson and is absurdly directed by Joseph Sargent.

        "review_detailed_main": "Why people dislike this film is a mystery. In view of the four \"Jaws\" films this film ranks number 3. \"Jaws 3-D\" is the worst of the four. The reason for this is due to \"Jaws 3-D\" being removed from the series (Mike and Sean Brody in Florida), whereas \"Jaws the Revenge\" begins where the first two were placed; Amity. As such, the story is a continuation of the first two films; in the \"Jaws\" universe. There is a bold move in the begining of the film (which must be seen in context of the other films to get its impact) involving an attack. The acting during this attack is very well done. It would be the actions and words of one in real life.\n\nPerhaps the reason people dispise this film as much as they do is due to the same reason they call the shark \"Jaws\". The shark is not named Jaws; the title refers to a part of the shark.\n\nAnother factor that places this film above \"Jaws 3-D\" is the music. John Williams' score is used rather than mangled as it was in the third film. \"Jaws 3-D\" used an altered version, while \"Jaws the Revenge\" used Williams' music combined with Michael Small's score.\n\nNow, the film is not a strong film, yet it is a studio release and far better than many similar direct-to-video releases. It is also better than the many similar plotted shark films released after the first film.\n\nThe director of \"Jaws the Revenge\" stated on Entertianment Tonight, \"Jaws 3 was not that good.\" The errors here are due to the fact that the screenplay was written in such a short time. The first film had many drafts by Peter Benchley. This is what makes the difference. Something that is worked on over a period of time will be greater than something done as a first (or close to first) draft.\n\n\"Jaws the Revenge\" was a return to the series. It is not as bad as it is made out to be."

I understand that the fact that a great white shark following them to Bremuda is a little hard to believe, but this film is basically about how the Brody family for some reason have always been cursed by sharks. It's also about confronting your fears. Michael Cain plays a very likable bloke and Lance Guest and Mario Peebles are solid actors. The special effects aren't the greatest, but I didn't feel they were the worst ever either. Some of my favorite moments include the opening credits sequence set to Michael Small's pulse pounding score. In fact, this theme is an excellent extension of the original theme written by John Williams. It's a soundtrack I listen to often (yes, I even own a very rare promo CD of the score). Speaking of 'Jaws The Revenge' memorabilia, I actually have a framed original one sheet to this film hanging on my door... but back to my favorite scenes...\n\nThe banana boat sequence was suspenseful and the moment where Michael Caine's plane swoops over the boat just in time to see the shark rise up from the ocean is excellent.\n\nThere are some great things going on in this film and I think people should back off and take a look at the film and forget about all the vitriol it so undeservedly gets."

There is also a large, prominent photo of Roy Scheider in the police station, so he made an appearance here, as well (sort of). After that, it becomes a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe \"script is lamentable,\" according to Howard Maxford. Apparently he hasn't watch a lot of horror sequels -- this one is something like Shakespeare in comparison. But he is right if he is implying that it makes no sense. What's with the extremely unlikely attacks on the Brody family... what the? Sharks that have picked them out and even (through some magical power) tracked them to the Bahamas?\n\nThere are some respectable guest stars, including the gambling-addicted Michael Caine, and Mario Van Peebles. Caine alone makes this film a lot more tolerable. His voice soothes me in a way that not even warm milk and a shoulder rub can match.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and say this is on par with \"Jaws\", but I will say this: it's not as bad as other sequels (like \"Leprechaun in da Hood\"), and not even as bad as other shark movies (\"Megalodon\"). If you make it through the first three films, give this one a go."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jaws: The Revenge\" is currently #26 on the imfamous Bottom 100 on IMDB. I really don't know how it made the list. Now I am NOT saying it's a good film...in fact it's a pretty stupid one. But surely there are many, many, many worse movies out there. This isn't exactly a glowing endorsement....I still don't think most sane people would enjoy this movie...unless, of course, they're looking for a laugh!\n\nThe story begins around Christmas. Yet another great white shark strikes...eating Sean Brody. Apparently, according to his mother, the sharks specifically have it out for the Brody family. And, she's apparently right, as when she moves to the Bahamas to live with her surviving son and his family, a Great White shows up....and looks as if it's ready to eat the son! Talk about carrying a grudge!! After all, Great Whites do not normally inhabit warm waters like those around the various Bahamian islands. And this one, apparently, has GPS...as it manages to find the son again and again and goes to great troubles to chase him! Dumb?! Certainly. It got so ridiculous, I half expected to have a shark waiting for him in his bathroom or in his garage or disguised as the UPS man making a delivery! So, it's up to Grandma (yes, Mrs. Brody is a grandma in this film) to take on the shark...mano y mano (as Ricky Bobby is prone to saying).\n\nOn the positive side, it was nice seeing the underwater diving footage. I have been diving in the Bahamas and Hawaii (and the film was made in both locales) and it was nice seeing the pretty water. Of course, considering that I am focusing on this and not the plot says a lot!\n\nOn the negative, the film is just plain dumb. I was especially laughing at the plane crash scene...as it just defied common sense and seemed in the movie just to add to the excitement...though NOT to believability! Very little of the film, actually, made sense and it seemed like they were just squeezing every last ounce they could out of a moribund franchise....one that should have been laid to rest long, long ago.\n\nOnly of interest to bad movie fans or anyone curious how low Michael Caine was willing to go in order to get a paycheck!"

        "review_detailed_main": "There is no explanation for \"Jaws: The Revenge.\" It is just there. You either accept it as it is, or come to love it. I prefer to deny its entire existence, if that is at all possible.\n\nIf the people who made the film had half the smarts they should have had, not only would they have ended this series three sequels ago, but they would have at least come up with something exciting, much less original, as potential material for this film. I can accept one lousy sequel. I can live with a second. But when a third sequel comes around and it keeps getting lousier every minute in, I have no choice but to fume smoke out my ears and write a review with a grimace on my face.\n\nIt's been an odd number of years since the original \"Jaws.\" Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), now widowed and living in Martha's Vineyard, a.k.a. the seaside town Amity, has basically forgotten about the shark that she had nothing to do with. Other than the odd occasion when she gets flashbacks of events that she never witnessed, and in most cases no one ever witnessed, she's just dandy.\n\nOne night on Christmas, her son, seen as a teenager in \"Jaws 2,\" gets eaten by a shark off the shore of Amity. Ellen remembers the shark, and is convinced that \"this time it's personal.\" So she catches a ride to the Bahamas, to live near her other son, and plead with him to quit his job as a -- whaddaya know -- marine biologist. He assures her that no Great White Sharks have ever been spotted off the Bahamas...but before you can say \"duh-duh-duh-duh,\" a revenge-filled Great White Shark arrives at the Bahamas (in three days, mind you) and proceeds to try and eat Mrs. Brody. I wish it had, so we wouldn't have to sit through the rest of the film.\n\nAll her friends ignore her pleas for help. Just as is the case with most horror sequels, they pooh-pooh her away until something really awful happens, and then ask her why she never told them about what was going to happen. But Ellen doesn't wait for that to happen, which is at least one thing about this film that breaks away from the horror-sequel mold.\n\nEllen Brody instead rushes into the water to sacrifice herself to the shark, in a last-ditch effort to stop the killing. When she does so, her new boyfriend, Hoagie (Michael Caine) rushes to her side...by crash-landing his airplane at sea, being attacked by the shark, and swimming to the boat, climbing in without any wet clothes, and doing absolutely nothing to help her other than scream a lot and look worried. Hoagie's black friend, Jake (Mario Van Peebles), who was no doubt forced to help Hoagie help his girl by Hoagie himself, helps out just long enough to get eaten by the shark. (But, seeing how this is a \"believe it or not!\" kind of sequel, he comes to the surface five minutes later looking just fine, even though he was just carried underwater by a savage beast moments earlier.) And if you fast-forward the next scene, in which they attempt to defeat the shark, you'll see just how humorous the image of a Great White Shark standing on its fin can be.\n\nI go to the beach every year, and that, for me, is part of the fun of the \"Jaws\" series. I've always been squeamish when I think of sharks. The ocean(s) is/are like another universe, occupied by strange creatures, most of which we know nothing about. And sharks are the rulers of this underwater world. \"Jaws\" played right to that idea, showing us all just how powerful and scary these creatures can be. But they also used the idea that these beasts of the depths are mortal. \"Jaws: The Return\" plays with the continuing trend that the shark is now invincible; the creature is no longer something the audience can relate to, but is an invincible monster. \"Jaws\" used to be more than just another invincible-monster-movie. \"Jaws: The Return\" ruins this and ends the series on a low-note, ruining the suspense of the first film. I really hope Steven Spielberg returns some day to end this series on a high-note. Besides, it can't get any more screwed up than it already is.\n\nBut the film's non-existent suspense is not the only problem. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" isn't good at all. It isn't even fun to watch. It's so awful that it's not humorous the least bit. I've seen my fair share of bad sequels coming off of good movies, but \"Jaws: The Revenge\" takes the cake as one of the worst.\n\nThe only remotely funny thing I found about this movie is that the shark, Jaws (or is it Jaws no. 4?) eats people. And Michael Caine's name is Hoagie. You put it together.\n\n0/5 stars (no stars) -\n\nJohn Ulmer"

The movie also requires a heavy suspension of disbelief. The shark trails the surviving Brody family members from New England to the Caribbean for revenge.

The acting is slightly better, such as by Lorraine Gary and Mario Van Peebles. The movie tries to go back to the series roots. However the plot, the shark follows the family from Amity to the Bahamas, is ridiculous. Michael Caine does not help in his supporting role, but he does try hard. Don't feel bad for the actors in this movie, though. They got to work in the Bahamas!!! I would take any job that would put me in the Bahamas. Still, the movie has the worst climax of the series and I have to deduct points for that. 5/10 and I am being very generous. It's sad to hear that the little girl who played Gary's granddaughter was murdered by her own father along with her mother. This is a very sobering postscript every time you see this movie."

The storyline is a good way to round off the Brody saga, the cast are all pretty good, the shark effects are excellent, and it's tense and exciting. And when the shark appears it's as scary as ever. The music wisely sticks closely to the familiar, unnerving theme, and the idea of Ellen Brody obsessed with the shark that she thinks is intentionally hunting her family is a good one - and we never find out if she's right or just delusional through grief. The shark attacks are frightening, and some of the photography is superb. Above all, Jaws 4 isn't as good as Jaws, but it's far better than Jaws 3D and is solid entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Joseph Sargent, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" (aka \"Jaws 4\") chronicles events when widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) vacations in the Bahamas where her son, Michael (Lance Guest), lives and works. Meanwhile, a huge killing machine in the ocean has its eyes set on her & family. Mario Van Peebles plays Michael's associate while Karen Young plays his wife. Michael Caine appears as a small plane pilot who seems to be interested in Ellen.\n\nThere's been a critical feeding frenzy over this movie for decades, no pun intended. But it's really a decent nature-runs-amok creature feature laden by dubious filmmaking at the climax. There's a nice build-up and the material is taken seriously by the quality cast. Ellen's developing relationship with the amicable pilot is kinda heartwarming and both Guest & Van Peebles are effective male protagonists. Moreover, the switch to the Bahamas keeps things fresh after the first three movies.\n\nOf course, the idea that a vengeful great white shark follows the Brody family to the Bahamas is absurd, but we've all heard of dogs or cats following a family hundreds of miles. This is just an imaginative stretch and we find Michael seriously wondering if that ridiculous premise could be true when just such a creature shows up. So the dramatic build-up is effective, not great, but certainly effective. Unfortunately, there's almost zero female eye candy despite the resort setting and, like I said, the climatic scenes are awkwardly done. It's like the creators really needed to reshoot some scenes and add others, but they lacked the funds so they tried to force the footage they had to \"work\" in the editing room.\n\nThe four Jaws movies detract in quality chronologically, but \"The Revenge\" is still worthwhile if you enjoyed the first three, just disregard the closing sequences. Beyond that glaring weakness, it's not even close to being as bad as people criticize.\n\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 29 minutes and was shot in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and Bahamas, with studio work done at Universal City, California. WRITER: Michael De Guzman.\n\nGRADE: C+"

Jaws 3D was a horrible movie but at least at times it was so bad it's good, the 3D effects while being gimmicky are also meant to be pretty good (from what I hear) and it at least had one tense moment. Nothing in this film is tense, like with all the films in this series none of the kills are overly gory or interesting (it's the tension and horror that makes them good in the originals). They also have way too many shots showing the shark instead of making it more of a mystery and therefore more tense. They also have a really stupid plot about the shark having a psychic link to brodies wife and the shark wants to take revenge on the family. Every single thing about the shark in this film sucks. The story is also awful, most of it feels unfocused with honestly not much happening and yet half the film is focused on it, I couldn't even tell you what the story is about because it feels that unfocused and is so incredibly boring. None of the characters in this are interesting (except Michael Caine as himself) and their plots all go nowhere. The ending to this film is simply one of the dumbest endings I've ever witnessed in a film, it literally feels like it was written by a toddler with how nonsensical and pandering the ending feels. Overall this is an incredibly boring movie with almost nothing going on, zero tension or horror and many dumb moments that aren't frequent enough for this to even be so bad it's good. Only positives I can possibly say is Michael Caine is enjoyable in the few screen time he gets and a jaws film set at Christmas is a really funny idea (if only they went all in for it)."

Brody p***es off a voodoo priest, he gets angered and curses the Brody family, and the curse is the shark!!! in the book Hoagie is a drug dealer also, and it has some good character development,\n\nBrody is off with is bud diving for Conch shells, while the shark is feasting on drug dealers...before it gets to the Brody's\n\nunfortunately, the film cuts the whole drug dealer/voodoo stuff..and makes hoagie a great guy without any personal demons.... this film was shot in a GREAT area too! there were so many possibilities here to make a Great film...but isntead they went \"campy\"...so my advice would be to just enjoy this film for all of its cornyness, and watch it as a \"fun\" movie....\n\nits too bad , they didnt try to make the shark look more real also, this rubber one looks the worst!!!"

I didn't mind the idiosyncrasies of the shark following the family 1000s of kilometres faster than it can or the roar it makes which a shark could never make. All those make it dumb fun for me. The film tries to be emotional a bit and fails. But the cute kid made up a lot for it. The obsession of the characters was nicely portrayed but there was never any tension or drama to it. It was pretty light and whenever Michael Cain came on screen he made it feel like this is a slice-of-life feel-good movie. Overall it is a very mixed bag with nothing particularly strong but it was an easy breezy watch that kept my interest. If I'd have actually saw the three movies before this, maybe I would have been bored by this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Watched for the \"How Did This Get Made\" Podcast, I've seen \"Jaws: The Revenge\" before, or rather, I must have done, but I remembered almost nothing about it. It has a reputation as one of the legendarily bad films, though when you watch a lot of the films covered by this podcast, you can see that whilst it's not good, it's nowhere near the worst cinematic experiences out there.\n\nAfter losing her youngest son, Sean (Mitchell Anderson) to a Great White Shark attack, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) travels to the Bahamas with her eldest Michael (Lance Guest) and his family. Ellen is convinced that this shark is targeting her family, which meets incredulity from anyone she tells about it. However, the same shark then arrives in the Bahamas, which is very unusual given the temperature of the water there. Michael is a marine biologist and, despite his own family history with Sharks, is convinced by his partner Jake (Mario Van Peebles) to study the unusual arrival.\n\nAgain, after watching so many awful films for this podcast I might be grading on a different scale to most people and again, within that, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is not good. It's got some extraordinary plot holes that it just ignores and that's before we come to the idea that a shark can have a vendetta against a family, let alone set traps to encourage them into the water. The performances, particularly from Gary are ... questionable and, as was often the case when he wasn't that bothered, Michael Caine plays himself.\n\nThe shark is generally a ropey effect, where you can see the unnaturalness of the movement, as week as occasionally the wires moving the puppet. That said, on the couple of occasions when a full human actor ends up in its mouth, those scenes look quite good.\n\nIt is a bad film, don't get me wrong, but I've seen a hundred worse ones."

        "review_detailed_main": "The previous two Jaws movie sequels are not as good as the first, because Jaws (1975) is a classic from director Steven Spielberg with John Williams composing the music, so it is hard to beat it with a sequel/follow-up; the second movie was not as good and the third movie was worse than the second, and the fourth movie is no different. The fourth movie Jaws: The Revenge (1987) is as bad as the third movie but where the third movie was entertaining and more of the shark, this movie takes a while to get to the shark with it taking its time with its slow pacing; the performances were off, the dialogue was not that good, the editing in attack scenes was very bad, and the characters will act weird in the weird situations for no reason.\n\nSince the character Brody is not in the movie with a poor reason, and since this is a continuation in a way of the first two, we follow Brody's wife Ellen Brody once again played by Lorraine Gary; though I understand why she would not want her family to go near the water, I still think it is stupid to think the shark followed her away from Amity Island to somewhere in the Bahamas and specifically targeting her and her family. The characters tend to do dumb things or a character, mostly the two family members in Ellen Brody's family, have a job of some kind that has them going on the water that will lead to them getting killed off in a hard to see bloody way or luckily survive somehow. All I can say about the characters is that they are not likable, they can change their emotions or opinions on something in seconds for no reason, so you question it, and they act weird at random moments like acting sad in a happy moment and acting happy in a sad moment.\n\nThe shark is once again an animatronic, which is still impressive, but whenever the shark is shown clearly swimming around or jumping out and attacking people, it looks silly, and you laugh when you should not; speaking of the shark attacking people, the attack scenes are edited and cut badly with it being hard to tell what is happening to a character and if they survived or not, all you can see is splashing of water and some blood effects until they are gone. The music is not as good as the music done by composer John Williams, and the use the same good Jaws theme that is used in all the movies; there is not much else to say about this movie except that it is a stupid unintentionally funny bad movie that has bad pacing for a short movie with it taking a while to get to the shark.\n\nJaws: The Revenge (1987) is as bad as Jaws 3-D (1983), but this movie was a bit slow, where the third movie went from dumb scenes to dumb scene to make the movie entertaining, even though it was not good; this movie does not have likable characters you care for, bad editing, bad use of effects, bad dialogue, and lots of unintentionally funny moments. I would highly recommend watching the original Jaws (1975) directed by Steven Spielberg if you have not already, and if you have, just go and rewatch it; you can at least watch Jaws 2 (1978), but do not bother the third and fourth movie if you are that much of a fan of the original."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why is it that co-called 'movie critics' always seem to hate sequels? I bet half the time they don't even bother to watch the movie themselves. If anyone had actually bothered to to watch Jaws 4 they'd soon realise that it's a great movie. Forget the first three movies in the series (I can't remember what they were called, but don't bother looking them up - it ain't worth it) this is the one to watch. It's got a great cast, a great script and a great villain.\n\nSome people complain about the low body-count in this movie. Well, I say if you want a high body-count go and hire out some 'dumb-a**' action movie like 'Cross of Iron'. Plenty of people die in that movie. What you get with Jaws 4 is a serious attempt to get inside the mind of Great White Shark. As it says on the movie's tag line \"This time... it's personal\". And it certainly is as the shark seeks to avenge the deaths of the other sharks in the previous movies by swimming off to the Bahamas in an attempt to eat Lorraine Gary (she's the wife of the guy in the first two movies). And who can blame it? Sharks always seem to be cast as bad guys in the movies (just look at all those James Bond movies - the bad guy always seems to keep killer sharks as pets). People seem to forget that the sharks were there first, no wonder they get a bit annoyed when idiots in boats keep chasing them, and anyhow they're only trying to get something to eat. How would you like it every time you went into Burger King for a Big Whopper you got some guy chasing you with a harpoon gun?\n\nAlso, some people complain that the shark isn't very realistic, that its rubber teeth can sometimes be seen bending - well you'd hardly expect them to use a real shark!\n\nIt's also great to see a major Hollywood movie with a 'mature' woman leading the cast, not some 20 year old bimbo with silicon implants. Maybe that's what a lot of the critics didn't like - a strong, intelligent middle-aged woman."

His mother, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), believes that the shark is seeking revenge against her family since her husband and son have been killed by a white shark. Michael Brody (Lance Guest), who is presently married with the artist Carla Brody (Karen Young) and with a daughter, Thea (Judith Barsi), and living in Bahamas, invites his mother to stay with his family. They fly home with the pilot Hoagie (Michael Caine), where Michael is researching snails to complete his PhD with his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles). Ellen is still obsessed with the white shark, and when Michael and Jake find that there is one in the area, they use a GPS device to track it. Further, they hide the information from their wives and Ellen. Until the day that the shark attacks a beach where Thea is on a banana boat ride.\n\n\"Jaws: The Revenge\" is the worst movie from the franchise, with the stupid premise of a great white shark seeking revenge to the Brody family like an Italian mobster. The cast of \"Jaws 3D\" does not participate of this turkey, and is weird to see different actors performing Michael and Sean Brody. The most surprising is the name of the great actor Michael Caine in the cast. The ridiculous Ellen Brody destroys the vessel of her son and the plane of her boyfriend to do what? \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is probably the source of inspiration of \"Sharknado\" franchise. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Tubar\u00e3o 4: A Vingan\u00e7a\" (\"Shark 4: The Revenge\")"

This would have built up suspense, if it weren't so unrealistic. Second, the shark only kills people in water. Smart move staying right next to a home surrounded by it, don't you think? Third, it somehow manages to get out of the water and bite off somebody's arm in the beginning. Fourth, the shark can't stay in the temperature of water it was in. It's cold-blooded, right? Fifth, was that there was a plot hole some where near the end. The sixth reason is that the shark came up to a dock or whatever, and started biting it, when the people were so far away.\n\nBut, I didn't notice many of these reason when I first watched it. The thing I hated the most about Jaws: The Revenge is how interesting it was, and it wasn't very interesting. If I could describe this film in one word, it would be: *yawn*.\n\nIf you see this, see it somewhere where you can easily walk away from.\n\nGood: ...\n\nBad: Unrealistic, boring, plot holes, etc.\n\nFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

        "review_detailed_main": "Perhaps the title refers to the revenge taken on anyone who said that the earlier Jaws sequels were bad. This is quite the most monumentally massive mistake in movie history. Even more so than Batman and Robin this film raises the question, 'which studio executive heard the pitch/script and said \"hmmm, sounds promising. Here's a budget - go make me movie...\"? Alan Smithee wouldn't put his name near this nonsense.\n\nThis film was made 12 years after the original but has positively the worst effects of all 4 films. The Jaws 3 model was bad enough but this thing is barely a shark. The fact that the shark has a gaping hole in it's belly means that the camera views are highly restricted and every time it jumps out of the water (which is nearly every appearance) it seems to pivot on its tail. During the banana boat scene it looks as if its floating on the surface it's so far out of the water.\n\nFor a 'scary' film, its death count is even worse than its predecessor (2 or 3 depending which ending is used). Basically everything about this film sucks. There's too much time wasted on land (there seems to be more emphasis on Ellen and Hogie's romance than on the shark), a ridiculous plot (Great White swimming to the Bahamas on personal vendetta) and, in the end, absolutely no feature worthy of anything other than ridicule.\n\nGive a ten year-old a video camera, a rubber shark and some ketchup and you'd have a more effective film than this.\n\nMaybe one day, a good script will be written and, with the aid of CG effects, the Jaws series will be put back on track. Perhaps the title 'Jaws 4' could be used just to wipe out all evidence of this."

That is the whole point of films, to do things can you can't do in reality.\n\nAnyway, back to the film, The fact that this film ignores the events of Jaws 3-D, is a bad idea but, the film survives well with what you are given. A shark related to one of the other sharks, attacking the remainders of the Broady family for revenge. Farfeched? OK maybe a little but overall this film, by reverting back to the originals formula, is very good. 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I didn't see Jaws:The Revenge until recently, after hearing so many bad things about it. And I do wish I left it alone, this has a reputation on the whole as being one of the worst sequels ever, and as far as I'm concerned that reputation is deserved. Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.\n\nJaws:The Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? Jaws:The Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.\n\nThe production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use. Don't get me started on Mario Van Peebles, him, his character and his comic lines are annoying and get old fast.\n\nOverall, a terrible film and one of the worst sequels I've seen and I have seen a lot. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me just say that this film has to be one of the most terrible and embarrassing films I've ever seen in my entire life.\n\nThe first \"Jaws\" movie that Steven Spielberg directed back in 1975 was an absolute classic, one which didn't even need any sequels to it whatsoever.\n\nAlthough \"Jaws 2\" was a surprisingly good sequel and \"Jaws 3-D\" was a fairly okay sequel, \"Jaws: The Revenge\", this is a movie that shouldn't even have been made if it was going to be this terrible.\n\nThough the beginning of the movie starts out pretty good, it slowly begins to go downhill right from there. I can see now why this film was nominated for so many Razzie awards because it most certainly deserved it.\n\nLet me begin shall I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nThis is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my entire life. Heck, on the back of the DVD case it says that it's a \"suspense-packed thriller\" and that it's \"the scariest 'Jaws' of them all\". Yeah? Well, that's complete bulls***! It is in no way, shape or form a suspense-packed thriller and it certainly isn't the scariest 'Jaws' movie of all time.\n\nIt's just like any other regular B-monster movie with poor actors, poor script and poor special effects. Only this one doesn't even show the shark most of the time, there's barely any action in this movie whatsoever, and not a lot of people get killed or eaten in it too. I've finished counting up exactly how many people actually get eaten by Jaws in this movie. The result is 2. How disappointing is that? That in the other \"Jaws\" films, more people got eaten by Jaws and in this one, the filmmakers made only 2 people get eaten by Jaws in a 1 hour and 31 minute film?\n\nI don't even need to explain how terrifyingly bad this movie was any further. I think I've pretty much covered all of it up. If you're a fan of the first \"Jaws\" movie, I would recommend avoiding watching this poor excuse of a sequel. Trust me, it's totally not worth it.\n\nWith all of that said, I give \"Jaws: The Revenge\",\n\n1 star out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film really did have potential. I mean, (most of) the Brody family is back, it's set back in Amity Island (instead of boring Sea World), and we get to see some familiar locations. Unfortunately, the potential flies out the window right when you pop this movie into your DVD player. The film score is great, but that's all there is to worship about the movie.\n\nI may be wrong on this one, but wasn't Amity Island the Brody family's summer film? What the hell are they doing living in it in winter? Oh well, maybe since Martin's death, they couldn't pay for two homes. And speaking of Martin, I have to admit, the picture of him in the police office is pretty clever. He was supposed to be the one who dies, but Roy turned the role down. Instead, we get Sean, an interesting character, who dies. How sad. And is it me, or can you feel that Ellen is talking about Martin when she says \"It's waited all this time and it came for him\" and other phrases concerning Sean's death? Anyways, this movie has moments of bi-polar disorder, like when Ellen comes downstairs and is about to cook dinner, a bunch of pots fall and she's in an upset mood, saying \"I want you to get out of the water!\" and when Jake is yelling at Mike, he randomly stops and says \"Sorry about your brother, man!\" The shark was always a great part of the Jaws series. In Jaws 1 and 2, the shark was always memorable; in Jaws 3-D, the shark is pretty damn forgettable, since she's barely in it. It's all about boring humans. But in this one, it's shameless. It's pretty unforgettable, but for the wrong reason: The shark always has a \"DURRRRR!\" expression on it's face. It's always open-mouthed whenever you see it. I guess it has problems. Is that why it just randomly blows up when Ellen's boat hits it? Which reminds me, the ending fiasco is a real pain. The original ending was awesome! Sure, the shark looked like a dinosaur in some scenes and it looked a bit CGI in the scene where Ellen's boat tip hits it, but it still looked cool. It was spitting blood and everything. So after an unsettling feeling by the test audience, what happens? The ending is changed to a one that looks completely fake and makes no sense. So, Ellen's boat tip stabs the shark and it blows up for some reason. If you pause at the moment before it blows up, you can see how phony it looks. It looks like it was shot in a bathtub. The original ending at least made sense. The shark was stabbed and slowly fell down to it's death after the injury. In here, it's just... BOOM! When I was a kid I though the \"bathtub\" ending looked cool, but now... It looks stupid.\n\nThe flashbacks are like the flashbacks in D3: The Mighty Ducks, it just makes us wish we were watching the movie (or in D3's case, MOVIES) in which the clips were taking from. That also doesn't make sense. Ellen is the one having these flashbacks, specifically the scenes where Martin shoots the shark and where he bonds with Sean at dinner. She clearly wasn't there in those scenes, but yet she's having them.\n\nThe dream sequence is pretty non-sensical, as well. Ellen has a dream where she's swimming in the Bahamas, and the shark eats her. She doesn't like the water, so why would she be having a dream like this? Overall, this movie doesn't get me enraged like other things, but it's a mess. It's along the lines of \"so bad, it's good\" at moments.\n\nAlso, great touch on not doing the clich\u00e9 of having the black guy die! That's a movie clich\u00e9 that EVERYONE likes to point out and say that every film does it."

In the movie the shark eventually followed Ellen Brody and her family to the Bahamas! The movie could do a bit better if it had Roy Schieder(or any other person in Martin Brody's role). The worst part is the climax.I actually could not understand the destruction of the shark.The shark was quite massive compared to the other sharks in the Jaws series.The sharks size was as huge as the sharks in the movie-DEEP BLUE SEA.But even though DBS had gone a bit further with it's action packed scenes.Another hating part is the kissing of Ellen & Hoagie.I had expected a lot better plot line from Michael De Guzman,the writer.The worst movie award should be handed over!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you were to ask a serious movie fanatic what some of the worst films of all time are, chances are they would include Jaws: The Revenge. Jaws: The Revenge is the fourth and final film in the Jaws franchise and was released in 1987. The film was directed by Joseph Sargent and stars Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, and Michael Caine. The film still performed fairly decent at the box office but is the lowest performing film in the Jaws franchise. Now, this film was universally panned by critics and audiences. So much so that the film is often considered one of the worst films of all time.\n\nWe are back in Amity as we see one of the Brody brothers, Sean, gets killed by a shark. Mourning the loss of her husband and son, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) moves to the Bahamas with her son Michael. But the shark wants revenge and this time, it is personal.\n\nI have seen this film a total of three times (as of the time that this review is being written) and I have come to the conclusion that this film is bad. The most recent viewing of this film, I decided to just turn my brain off and just let it all happen. It seems to work well that way I suppose but why should I do that? Even if I was to find any good, it seems insignificant because the negative aspects of this film are far, far, far, greater. Let me just put things into perspective here. Superman IV is worse than this film and if I could, would give it zero stars. This film, rightly deserves the one star rating that it will get from me. With Jaws: The Revenge, the only good thing I can truly say is that at least there are returning characters and the continuity seems to be picked right back up because it appears that this film may or may not ignore Jaws 3-D. But it is all still a big slap in the face to viewers who really enjoyed the first film. The film is highly absurd with it's plot that I am certain the film itself is aware of it's utter absurdness. The film likes to have our main character Ellen Brody to have sepia toned flashbacks of events that she never witnessed. Also, apparently there is an unexplained psychological connection between this shark and Ellen Brody. Apparently sharks are aware of the concept of revenge and somehow knows where a family is located by swimming from Amity to the Bahamas in a span of a couple of days. Those are just a few of a whole boatload (pun intended) of absurdities. If one is brave enough to watch this film, you will certainly find more. It is basically a given. The acting is not very good (though I can certainly say it is a minor improvement over the acting in Jaws 3-D). This film spends more time focusing on the characters and not really doing much with them. This film ends up being a sort of melodrama where a shark makes cameos. I feel bad for Michael Caine because this is one of those films that he worked on to just get a paycheck. Michael Caine just seems to be a really friendly person in general and I hate to see someone like him in a film like this. Gone is any sort of suspense. The music is not very good and as you may know, the original film relied on the music to effectively build suspense. This film's music for me, does not help build suspense and just feels off in key scenes. Lastly, the special effects are bad. People who know this film are aware of one infamous effect in this film so I just ask to see it for yourself if you are ever so curious. The shark itself oddly enough spends more time out of the water instead of in the water and looks even more fake.\n\nI struggle with whether or not calling Jaws: The Revenge the worst film of all time. It is certainly not the number one worst film, but it certainly is up there."

Its objective was to milk the American people out of more money.\n\nI read here on IMDb.com, that Jaws: The Revenge had a budget of 23 Million dollars. Give me 1/16th of that budget and I'm positive that I could make a better film.\n\n1.Sharks cannot roar. 2.Sharks cannot stand on their tails. 3. When sharks are impaled with large sticks they do not automatically explode. 4.Mama Brody cannot reminisce about things she didn't witness. 5.Sharks cannot follow people vast distances. 6.Sharks do not enjoy swimming in warm bahaman waters. 7.Michael Caine shouldn't be in this movie. 8.Sharks do not have feelings. I could really go on forever there. I enjoyed Jaws 2, its not a bad film. Jaws 3 is laughable, but still holds up. Jaws: The Revenge is simply a steaming heap of movie making feces. Judging by the cinematography alone (revealing the inner workings and external moving parts of the extremely fake hunk of plastic thats supposed to be a shark) the director gives Bruno Mattei a run for his money.\n\nDo not buy or even rent this piece of cinematic garbage, unless you want to have a good laugh."

I am admittedly a huge Jaws fan and have watched the original movie over 40 times. I have seen Jaws The Revenge possibly 25 times. I know that it isn't a classic by any means, but the movie really is good.\n\nFirst off the acting. It wasn't terrible. Lorraine Gary did a terrific job as the lead. I felt sympathy for her and she does have some ability. Lance Guest as Michael was fantastic also. I am still waiting for him to get his break out role in Hollywood because I think he has potential. Mario Van Peebles brings some Bahamian humor, and it sheds some light onto the movie. And Michael Caine maybe isn't at his finest, but he is decent enough.\n\nThe cinematography is just beautiful. It just makes me want to go to the Bahamas every time I watch. The music score is better than the original. It has a sort of mystical, on the edge feel to it. It's too bad Michael Small didn't get any recognition for it, and anyone would be hard pressed to find the soundtrack, even though it's one of the finest ever.\n\nJoseph Sargent does an okay job directing. I admit that it isn't anything special, but it's not trash. A lot of people have problems with the special effects and some of the things the shark does. Yes, the shark looks fake. That's a given when the film has such a low budget and the studio behind the picture isn't totally committed. There is one scene in particular that many have a problem with and that is when the shark is doing a so called stand on the water. It's obvious to me that the scene is in slow motion, and the shark is leaping from the water, which makes it appear to be standing on its fin. There are many aspects of the film also that are very authentic. An example is when the shark is attacking the boat and it's eyes roll back in its head, which is what a real great white would do.\n\nThe ending is terrible and totally brings down the film. But once again, I come with my defense. In Michael De Guzman's original script, the ending was much different and rather exciting. As I alluded to earlier, budget constraints kept this film from producing an adequate ending. If you are interested, there are many links on the Net with the original script.\n\nJaws the Revenge is a movie that I guess you have be a really big Jaws fan to enjoy. I know that it isn't perfect by any means and that it never will be considered to be a good movie by anybody other than the \"Jaws Junkies.\" But, for all the people that like to tear it apart and dissect its every mistake, remember that it's only a movie and not real life. 6 Stars"

He must already have been a very rich man in 1987, and could not possibly have 'done it for the money'. Surely an actor must have to consider a box office hit in favour of a shed load of money. Not so here it would appear. I'm so disappointed Micheal! But, at the end of the day, it's just another case of over stretching a good idea. There ought to be a law concerning the making of sequels. They are invariably never at least as good as the original, given that that the original was that good to begin with. Even the 'Godfather' series suffered."

You get to see some seriously nasty Shark Attacks which include arms being ripped off and the clear carribean oceans in which the majority of the action takes place are turned red with blood on more than one occassion which is a big plus. The one thing that stops this from being a really great movie is the ridiculous plot, you cannot seriously believe for one moment that the shark holds a grudge against the Brodie Family. This suggestion of the supernatural is more than a bit stupid and is impossible to overlook. Despite of this Jaws: The Revenge is still a very good film featuring the best Shark Attack scenes and Underwater Footage in the \"Jaws\" Series and the hilarious bonus of getting to see Michael Caine make a fool of himself and for these reasons alone is worth watching. Overall this is a good film that does not deserve the excessive criticism which it has got from so-called fans of the series and know-it-all film critics."

        "review_detailed_main": "You try and put them together but its like trying to put a shark shaped peg through a Dreyfuss shaped hole. Jaws and Jaws: The Revenge. Two movies, the SAME series and yet one is a classic and the first summer blockbuster and the other is, er, well...I'm not quite sure. We'll attempt to work out what it is together over the course of the next 300 words or so. Where to begin? No doubt the producers of 'The Revenge' asked themselves a similar question. What was left? Amity had endured two shark problems which is quite a lot for a small coastal town, especially a fictional one and they'd tried the Jaws in a different setting thing but it was curiously one-dimensional, even with 3-D glasses. You could of course just have another shark wander into the waters off Amity's shore but that night be construed as stretching credibility in some way so instead they came up with something quite wonderful and zoologically spurious - a vengeful shark with a murderous grudge against the Brody Family! Absolutely brilliant! Except that this is of course the most insanely misconceived idea in movie history. It's so bad that the only explanation for its passage to production is that someone pitched it as a kind of joke only to be horrified when the backers gave it a resounding thumbs up. Screenwriter Michael De Guzman who strangely hasn't subsequently become an A-list Hollywood scribe must have been too embarrassed to correct his bosses and so off he went and the result may be not just the worst sequel of all time but possibly one of the worst movies of all time. It does however introduce us to the most intelligent Shark in the history of the world. More cunning than his predecessors no.4 can set traps, learn the details of local law enforcement and manipulate certain people to come out on to the water, use its contacts on dry-land to find flight information on the Brody family and alter its own bio-chemistry to survive in warmer waters having swam some 3,000 miles to pursue the unlucky Brody brood. Is it any wonder Roy Scheider's character had a fatal heart attack? Teams of experts should be descending on the Bahamas to study the most unique animal that's ever lived but instead Michael Caine wants to kill it, which is baffling frankly. So the script isn't so much Quint as Jack Sparrow but at the least there's the taunt direction, the polished production values and the impeccable performances and if believe that you'll believe a Shark can roar."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"This movie sucks\" \"I hate this movie\" \"i can't believe what i just saw\" Typical reviews to this stupidity parade called Jaws: The Revenge. And the sad thing is it's all understandable. I still HATE this movie, so much! I'm like Burce Wayne, even after avenging his parents death the rage and fight is still there. Even after writing an argession filled review three years ago, i still have to come back here every few months to read these same reinforcing hate filled reviews. Because no matter how many times a reviewer points out that a SHARK stands on its tail and roars my head can never fathom the earth-shattering stupidity of it all. Bruce Wayne will never get his parents back, I will never get my 90 minutes back, and the scar left on the name of a groundbreaking piece of cinema will never heal.\n\nI'll forgo the instinctual impossibility that a shark would camouflage himself near a piece of driftwood to eat a person on a boat rather than just swim up and eat another fish. I'll forgo the logistical impossibility that a shark fearing widow would flee her island home to ANOTHER ISLAND! As I type this I just watched today's best NHL goaltender come out of his zone, drop his stick and let an open ice puck crawl right between his legs for a goal in the Stanley Cup finals. So people make stupid mistakes in times of pressure, I'll forgive you Ms. Brody, just as I forgave Mr. Brodeur. After all what brings more pressure than a telepathic, reborn, teleporting, roaring, exploding, vengeful predator of the seas? I'll even forgo the physical impossibility of surviving the bends.\n\nThis ending, although cannot be forgiven by Jesus Christ himself. The last twenty minutes is just an unbelievable orgy of every irrational idea conceived by filmmakers. There was a method behind Spielberg's exiting finale in 1975. He said that by that point he \"has his audience.\" After taking them on this thrilling yet conceivable ride, that for just a few seconds they would suspend their beliefs and allow a great white to swim around chewing on an oxygen tank. Well he was right. Maybe the makers of Jaws: The Revenge had a reverse plan... maybe their plan was to constantly bombard you with inconceivable acts of stupidity and impossibility until you are rendered retarded from the whole ordeal so when they unleash a plethora of insanity at the climax you barely realize it.\n\nCan there be any other excuse for a shark to walk on its hind fins, roar, catch a man in his razor sharp mouth in slow motion, let him survive, get poked by a stick, and explode!? Ok let us look at this systematically. A shark on its hind fins: Maybe they were trying to out-do the original scene where Bruce capsizes the Orca. \"Well a shark lunging out of the water to surface onto an already half-sunken, half decaying boat is pretty amazing. Let's do something really amazing!\" Too much of a good thing, no wonder this is a sequal. And what they can't \"improve\" on from the original, they just steal. Just random scenes of the original thrown in the movie, as if to say \"Hey, she's saying the same thing her husband said while fighting a shark, what a great example of..\" bullshit! it's pointless and only reminds me of what film I SHOULD be watching! And she's not heroically surviving one last face to face battle with the predator armed with only a rifle. She's on a huge boat with all her surviving friends and family about to poke the gravity defying fish that's wearing some flash cube. Not exciting at all, it's pathetic! Two last comments before I finish... why would they make the shark roar? I suppose the filmmakers knew they weren't gifted enough to make a giant hungry silent eating machine about to attack be scary, so they made it roar to add \"a scary sound effect.\" You know in slasher movies when they just make a nail-on-chalkboards sound whenever the murderer pops out? That kind of cheap garbage. But they can't have someone just scream, or have a loud wave crashing sound. No, it has to be this insanely thoughtless roar. Finally, the explosion. Have you ever seen that Simpsons gag where something clearly stable and inflammable like a shopping cart crashes and explodes? That satirical gag is EXACTLY what this movie pulls, and wants you to seriously accept it! Try to think about that fact logically for more than a minute and don't blame me when you regain consciousness. To see something like this even referred to as a serious idea is inconceivable for even half a second!\n\nWell, as I finish this review, the Devils paid for their mistake and lost the game. So that piled on all these horrible factors that equal Jaws The Revenge, i must retire before i simply throw my computer out the window. To conclude, I hate this movie, you should hate this movie. And it is NOT healthy to imagine Spielberg making a sequel to \"save\" this franchise. It should have never been a franchise anyway. It was a wonderful suspenseful work of art about nature, fear, and survival; and now the name is synonymous with monumental acts of stupidity and ridiculousness. Please, enough damage has been done."

This movie pretends that \"Jaws 3\" never happened. Sean Brody (Mitchell Anderson) is the police chief of Amity--his other brother Mike (Lance Guest) works with Jamaican Jake (Mario van Peebles) in the Bahamas. Sean is killed by a shark (who supposedly set up the trap!!!) and his mother Ellen (Lorraine Gary) is positive the shark is targeting the whole family (!!!). Mike brings her to the Bahamas to recover...but the shark follows. Ellen knows this because she has a telepathic link with the shark (!!!!!).\n\nYep, it's as stupid as it sounds. It starts out OK with Sean being attacked and killed--and Anderson was actually very good in his role-- but I'd like to know HOW the shark was able to set it all up. It moves to the Bahamas and falls apart swiftly. First off, two white sharks were killed in the first two movies. What is this one? A cousin of them? Second--Gary having a \"link\" to the shark is just absurd. Third--van Peebles (a good actor) has to use an annoying accent and if he had said \"mon\" one more time I would have screamed; fourth--Michael Caine pops up as \"Hoagie\"--he deserves better; fifth--the shark looks fake; sixth--watch for the scene where Caine is pulled out of the water...and is completely dry and seventh--the ending is annoying stupid and abrupt. Also Gary looks terrible--but it fits the movie I suppose.\n\nOn the plus side--Guest and Caine are very good and the Bahamas location looks breath-taking. Still that doesn't excuse the ludicrous script and lousy acting from everyone else. And van Peebles \"comic\" lines are painfully unfunny.\n\nAt least Caine and Guest have excuses for making this--Caine said it was for a free trip to the Bahamas and Guest said he did it to work with Caine. Still, this can safely be skipped completely. A sad ending to what started out as a great series. A 1."

She moves to the Bahamas to get away from things but...the shark follows her!\n\nJaws: The Revenge is the third and final sequel to Jaws (1975). It's a film that almost requires no introduction on account of its reputation as such a monumental mess of a movie. It's easy to see why it attracted such scorn to be fair as its story-line about a shark that has the ability to follow someone \u2013 presumably via psychic powers \u2013 hundreds of miles, it's beyond ridiculous; while what the shark is precisely seeking revenge for is never fully explained. The great white itself is notable for having the unusual ability to roar like a lion, which is at the very least an unexpected skill given sharks have no vocal chords. But you know what, I consider all of the above nonsense as positive aspects which go in this film's favour. Its sheer ridiculousness kind of makes it so entertaining. The real drawback to Jaws: The Revenge in my book was the excessive amounts of tedious melodrama which accounted for quite a bit of the run-time of the middle third of the movie. But whenever the shark popped up to play, things got a lot more agreeable and thankfully he appears pretty often throughout. And while it did look fake, the shark sort of still looked quite cool nevertheless. Essentially all the attack scenes are good value in my opinion and, aside from some fast-editing used in the earlier moments, I thought the cinematography was actually more than decent in capturing those moments rather effectively.\n\nFamously Michael Caine missed out picking up his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) in order to film one of the re-shot endings for this. The one I saw has Mario Van Peebles character ludicrously survive being pulled down into the depths of the ocean while clamped into the jaws of the shark - he tiresomely re-emerges with a few light scratches and several wise-cracks. The actual destruction of the shark itself was also somewhat unclearly achieved as well but what the hell. It's such a silly film that such issues become relatively moot points by its conclusion. Also of note was the blink-and-you'll-miss-her re-appearance of Lee Fierro reprising her role as Mrs. Kinter, so memorable as the mother of the little boy who was killed on the beach in the first movie, leading to her angry and emotional dockside confrontation with Chief Brody. In this one she now appears to be a friend of the Brody family, so bygones must be bygones.\n\nDespite its reputation, I definitely prefer this sequel to the somewhat annoying previous entry, Jaws 3D (1983). It does feel like more of a continuation of the story, even if it takes the characters into an extremely silly direction. But the sharksploitation genre has produced films over the subsequent years that have rarely been known for their understatedness and intelligence. Jaws: The Revenge is no different, it just achieves the same level of daftness on a massively bigger budget. The honest truth is that this is definitely much more enjoyable than the majority of other shark-attack monster movies."

A massive gaping hole with pullys and levers can be visibly seen as the 'shark' is chasing Brodys son into that ship wreck. Also, when did sharks grin?, the state of the sharks mouth is a joke, not to mention the roar of it, near the end of the film. I thought it was going to turn green and into the incredible hulk it roared that loud!.\n\nIf they would have made this movie into a comedy then it would have been plausible and acceptable. Surely they cannot possibly expect a half intelligent audience to take this criminal film seriously??!!.\n\nJaws for me, is only 2 films long. Jaws 2 was okay, mainly because Roy Scheider in it (not that I think much of him in Seaquest), the original Jaws was sheer genius. Fantastic film.\n\nAvoid Rubber Jaws:The Revenge, at all costs, except if you are feeling depressed and could do with a good laugh.\n\nRating 0.5/10"

The main one seem to be they don't think its realistic, as if any of the other Jaws movies were! The concept of Jaws:The Revenge is that the family from the original movie are seemingly being targeted by great white sharks in revenge for the deaths of the sharks from the other movies. What I find strange is that this very same plot had been used in the movie Orca which no one seemed to take issue with, but because its Jaws somehow everyone has a problem with it? The other big criticism is that Michael Caine is in the movie and his acting is bad, it isn't. Also we have complaints about Mario Van Peebles Jamaican accent, again its not that bad. The movie itself is not great but its certainly not as bad as some people want it to be. It may be the weakest of the franchise but not by much, what it is not is a carbon copy of the first two movies which seems to be what some people wanted for four times over. Most of the reviews on here are exaggerated at how bad this movie is, some people obviously havent seen a truly bad movie. This has a decent story line, decent effects, decent acting and some gory deaths. What else do you want in a shark movie?"

I know that this movie is widely disliked, but I have to admit that I have always enjoyed it, since watching it as a kid in the late 1980s. But then again, I've always enjoyed the \"Jaws\" franchise and shark-themed movies in general.\n\nSure, the storyline in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is not the most well-written, and looking at it objectively it is quite far out there. I mean, a migrating shark hunting a single person, well it is just beyond the realms of possibilities, isn't it? Regardless, I still found the movie to be adequately entertaining for the campy fun that it is. Writer Michael De Guzman put together a fair enough script and storyline for the movie. Sure, it has its flaws, but it is entertaining nonetheless.\n\nIt is nice to see Lorraine Gary return to reprise the role of Ellen Brody. But aside from her, the cast ensemble in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is all newcomers to the franchise. There are some familiar faces on the cast list, however, with the likes of Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles.\n\nThe special effects in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" are actually fair enough. It is a \"Jaws\" movie, so you know what you are getting. And while the movie doesn't have a slow moving shark outlined in a shroud of black, as in the \"Jaws 3-D\" movie, it does, however, have a shrieking shark. Yeah, I kid you not.\n\n\"Jaws: The Revenge\", from director Joseph Sargent, actually is a guilty pleasure movie, I will admit that.\n\nMy rating of the 1987 movie \"Jaws: The Revenge\" lands on a five out of ten stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Jaws: The Revenge\" (1987), all of you know how much I loathe \"Jaws 3-D\" (1983). That film has a poorly conceived and executed storyline with mediocre special effects. Now, that being said, \"Jaws 3-D\" is a masterpiece compared to this worthless and retarded pile of filth! \"Jaws: The Revenge\" has a predictable yet confusing story, the acting is a joke, the special effects are garbage, and the soundtrack is cliched! The plot is, Ellen Brody is now a widow since Martin Brody died of fear between the third and fourth film. Then, after Sean dies from a shark attack a grief-stricken Ellen and she her family move from Amity down to the Bahamas where a great white shark actually follows them, seeking revenge. Yeah, it's every bit as dumb as it sounds. I may not be a fan of any of the \"Jaws\" movies, but the fact that a Martin Brody is killed off due to fear of fighting a shark is insulting to his character. That's about as lazy as you can get! It was their excuse for him not appearing in this \"film\". Then, after Ellen tells her family to stay away from the water, they decide to move to the Bahamas and be completely surrounded by water. Finally, to top it all off, the shark actually follows them from the United States to the Bahamas! I honestly couldn't finish typing the storyline aspects without laughing. This is easily, one of the worst plots I have ever heard of in any movie. There is no suspense, no thrills and on top of that, the story is boring! What were the writers thinking?! How does the shark know about the Brody family? Why did they move to the Bahamas where there's even more water than at Amity?! All right, I think I've ranted on about the story long enough. As for the acting, it's nothing short of dreadful, from the whole cast. Not even Michael Caine could save it! Yep, somehow he got bribed to be in this \"film\". He's the only one who appears to be putting forth some sort of effort with his acting. That being said, effort doesn't always result in a good performance. This is, in my opinion, Michael Caine's worst acting performance out of all his movies! Don't even get me started on the name of his character. His name in this \"film\" is, Hoagie. I guess Sub, Grinder or Grilled Cheese were already taken? Come on, writers, you seriously couldn't come up with any other name? Like, I don't know, a human name? All of the acting is an embarrassment, but the worst performance comes from Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. Her acting is, without a shadow of a doubt, some of the worst I have ever seen in any movie, I'm not kidding. Why did she deserve her own starring role and \"film\"? No one cared for her character in the other films, including me! Fun-fact, Lorraine Gary was married to the President of Universal Studios at the time. Maybe that had something to do with it? On top of that, her character is so annoying and obnoxious, that I was rooting for the shark to eat her! Really, whenever I saw her precious face show up on the screen, I wanted someone to slap her! Granted, I'm sure that she's a nice person in real-life. But, when she's on the screen, she sucks! All of the acting is terrible. As for the special effects, I have a lot to say about them. However, I'll keep it short, sweet and to the point. They suck! There are very few that are adequate, but the majority of them are trash. The worst special effect is the shark itself. You can see the hinges in it's mouth, the harness holding it up in the air, etc. Plus, are you ready for this? Jaws roars in this \"movie\". I'm serious, the shark roars! Did elementary school students write this script? Although, to tell you the truth, I think children would've been better screenwriters than the wastes of life who vomited out the screenplay! Sharks don't roar, they cannot roar, it's impossible. They don't have lungs, or vocal cords. At this point, an unborn fetus is probably smarter than these incompetent writers! The special effects are nothing short of a joke. There are endless logical errors and flaws that are so bad, that you can't help but laugh. In one scene, Michael Caine's character swims in the water and as soon as he climbs into the boat, his shirt is completely dried. I'm not joking with you. When I first saw that part, I actually shouted: \"What?!\" But, I immediately burst into laughter just as fast as I yelled, if not faster! That's barely scratching the surface as far as how bad the special effects were. Some of them were so horrible, that I said to myself: \"was the budget $100.00, and $99 dollars went to the actors' salaries?!\" Finally, the soundtrack is a disaster. It's about as generic and cliched as you can get. There is nothing redeemable in this film score at all! Now, let's get to the only good element in this piece of garbage, the sets/locations. They give a good atmosphere, but that one positive is just simply outweighed by the negatives. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only thing that keeps it off my top ten worst movies list, is the fact that it makes me laugh and that it actually merits a one-star rating. That being said, for a film to qualify for my top ten worst movies list, it has to have zero stars. For some reason, this \"film\" manages to salvage one out of me. It's a miracle! Even then, I'm struggling to give this \"movie\" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. For the sake of your decency and intelligence, stay away from \"Jaws: The Revenge\". Thankfully, it's the last one in this apparent franchise. I'm actually embarrassed for it. Although, this film isn't even worth being embarrassed for at all! All of the \"Jaws\" movies are a total waste of time, especially \"Jaws: The Revenge\". Everyone involved with this worthless \"movie\" deserves to be eaten by sharks!"

Part 3 was pretty different!\n\nIn the Bahamas, Jaws stalks his prey all the way from Amity Island. The premise of a personal vendetta of shark vs. Humans is pretty ridiculous. But that is the main reason for my low score.\n\nStill, the death scenes are entertaining, and the climax is possibly the silliest of all ending, but still entertaining albeit unbelievable."

It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.\n\nMichael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly stated himself. Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.\n\n5*.

But what is clear is that this movie is based on a really dumb premise. I mean, let's face it, sharks don't take things personally! So to base an entire film around this ridiculous concept is just plain crazy. Add to that the fact that the scenes on land were extremely dull and essentially what is left is an incredibly boring--if not ludicrous-film. On the other hand the tropical scenery was nice and Lynn Whitfield (as \"Louisa\") was equally pleasant to look at as well.

Maybe she had a heroin addiction to feed. Doubtless, she made millions from this film. I'm sure that the famous Joseph Sargent (who was mostly a TV director and has never actually made a decent film) thought that the script was money, and the film would make his career. Or end it (he has not directed a film since, only television). All in all, Jaws: The Revenge is an epic (as epic as a flatulent attack) end to an exciting motion picture quadrilogy.

Despite this, she accepts the invitation of her older son Michael (Lance Guest) to stay with him and his family in the Bahamas, where - surprise, surprise - he works as a marine biologist. Yes, despite everything that happens to them, this stupid family just won't stay out of the water. And yes, you guessed it...the *same* shark that ate Sean tracks the Brodys to the Bahamas.\n\nThe patently absurd script by Michael de Guzman is the worst flaw in this lackluster effort. The filmmakers actually go out of their way to show the shark as often as possible, which only serves to point up how obviously phony it is. There is, for the most part, a sufficient lack of tension, and the main reason why \"Jaws: The Revenge\" would be entertaining at all is because it's so laughable. Gary, sporting a none too flattering hairdo, does take herself pretty seriously, but the other cast members certainly don't look too happy to be there; Mario Van Peebles speaks in a ridiculously unconvincing accent, and Michael Caine offers his effortless charisma to a supporting role as a pilot who tries to romance Gary. It may not be a great role, but his presence in anything is always welcome. One worthy component is the music score by Michael Small; both adapting John Williams' legendary themes and adding his own compositions, he helps to make the scenes just a little bit better. Admittedly, this is also shot rather well (by John McPherson).\n\nLike many bad movies before and after it, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is a compelling train wreck in spite of itself.\n\nFive out of 10."

Who knew that sharks could roar? Or come up out of the water so many times? My mom and I watched this movie together and we were having fun with the beginning where Sean has to get the log out of the water, we were coming up with how the shark probably put it there and called the secretary to get Sean in the water. This movie was a complete insult/slap to the face for the original. But like I said this movie was great for a laugh and I even recommended putting it in the comedy section at Hollywood Video, the guy agreed with me. If you enjoyed this movie and thought it was a good HORROR flick, oh, man, do I feel sorry for you.\n\n2/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Alas, Jaws: The Revenge; the fourth (count them) Jaws film and third successfully insignificant sequel to that of Spielberg's fantastic 1975 film Jaws but Jaws: The Revenge shouldn't just be compared to that of Jaws but also to that of any other film ever made in terms of quality. Jaws: The Revenge on its own is not even entertaining enough to be a second rate monster movie like an Anaconda (1997) or a Deep Rising (1998) or something along those lines.\n\nThe things wrong with Jaws: The Revenge just spill off the screen like a barrel of grease down a water slide \u0096 anything that CAN go wrong in terms of logistics, what we're seeing or even the entire premise in the first place; DOES go wrong. Early on one character actually states about how the thought of the shark coming back for revenge on the Brody family is simply impossible \u0096 you know that and I know that \u0096 shark's don't know who's who on land so the fact one of the characters openly denies the fact this plot is even feasible on screen is mind blowingly backward film-making on its own merit.\n\nAnother problem with this film is just its basic content which is split into two different pieces: dialogue on the land, sea or in the air and action scenes. A lot of the dialogue scenes at least to me just seemed pointless and to be honest, were rather dull. Examples of this are: the scene on the beach in the Caribbean as Ellen looks out to sea in a silly 'I know you're out there' sort of a way, the sea bed digging scene involving Michael Brody (Martin's son) as he looks for sea snails or something (we don't need to know what he does for a living) and the new year's eve party which serves as an overly long and tedious scene where the outcome is just Hoagie (Michael Caine) admitting some sort of a feeling for Ellen \u0096 this whole love side plot was very out of place and in the end, so pointless that the film could've chopped the whole new years eve part out.\n\nSo many things backfire on so many levels, it's incredible. The fact we need to stomach this shark is actually out for 'revenge' against the Brody family and that it can swim from Amity to the Caribbean as well as pinpoint where it is the Brody family are now living; the fact the child is smart enough to recognise Ellen is called evasive by her mother and be able to imply it herself when Ellen is actually being evasive in front of her yet is not smart enough to know that you 'fly' a plane and not 'drive' it; the way in which Michael, Jake (van Peebles) and the rest of the characteristically non existent Caribbean crew are stupid enough to continue whatever pointless exercise it is they're doing even though the shark has struck \u0096 Jake even wants to go after it bringing back rehashed ideas Jaws 3-D had when the water-world employees wanted to capture it for their park.\n\nIf there is any saving grace it's the finale where the shark and the characters do battle on a little boat that Ellen took out on her own \u0096 something I still can't fathom the logic behind. The film borrows so heavily from the first Jaws film that the flashbacks involved are practically retelling the way the first film concluded and as a result, it feels like we're watching the first film's climax! With continuity problems abound, an insane and impossible premise as well as a really comic atmosphere and rather bland film-making, Jaws: The Revenge is the slow and painful death of what was the Jaws franchise."

The opening kill, when a policeman gets his arm bit off is not terror, it's just buckets of blood, which is only entertaining for grade-school kids. The last scene, when Jaws is shocked out of the water and roars, is beyond belief. I didn't know sharks made noises out of water! I saw that this movie is in the bottom 100 of all-time.

        "review_detailed_main": "So this is what a train wreck looks like...\"Jaws The Revenge\" is the fourth and, not suprisingly, final installment of the famous \"Jaws\" series. All right so the series isn't really famous, so much as the first one is. I haven't seen the middle two, but I don't think that would have helped me comprehend this weird movie any more than I did.\n\nNow I understand that movies, especially horror movies, call for the suspension of disbelief. Skeptics could say I'm jaded, but I disagree. I do suspend disbelief, to an extent. When I see a \"shark cam\" shot, I accept that. When the shark cam shot is above water and we cut to a wide shot of just the fin sticking out the water, my suspension disappears. Unless Jaws is a super-shark, he has no eyes on his fin.\n\nThen again, maybe he is, given the laughable behavior of this crazed fish in the movie. The essential plot is that this shark is still on the loose after all these year, even though I'm pretty sure it's been killed at the end of every single movie. I guess it decided it was tired of being killed by the Brody family (Stars of all the \"Jaws\" movies), so he decided to start offing Brodies one by one. The wife of Sheriff Brody, Ellen, is the only one who believes that the shark is out to get her and her family. Well, you know, it sounds so logical that I cannot imagine why anyone would disbelieve her!\n\nI tried to understand this movie, I really did. But it is so completely devoid of talent and thought that it's impossible not to laugh at its total stupidity. The fin-cam is just the tip of the iceberg. Jaws not only can spot his prey well out of the water, and even on boats, but he can nimbly hop out of the water, up to the deck to chomp on his victims before quickly returning to the depths. And let's not forget Ellen's recollections of scenes she didn't even witness! The shark is so intent on revenge, that he swims from Long Island to the Bahamas in about two days. Someone sign that fish up for the Olympics! And the climactic confrontation with the shark is edited so poorly, I honestly couldn't tell you what happened. I know the characters lived, but as for Jaws, it's a big bloody mystery to me.\n\nWhile making the first \"Jaws,\" director Steven Spielberg realized his shark didn't look very realistic. So he intentionally kept it out of sight through the whole movie. I guess the director here had a little more confidence in his aquatic creation, because you see a lot of the shark in the movie. Of course, the thing looks as fake as ever, maybe even more so now given the ridiculous situations he is forced into. The worst detail about the fake shark? It always, always, has its mouth gaping wide open. I just felt like I was looking at something someone made in shop class.\n\nAgain, this movie is dumb and goofy and ridiculous. If you're looking for a scary movie like the first \"Jaws,\" rent the first \"Jaws.\" Looking for that here will only cause you great pain and discomfort. If you're watching to see how NOT to make a movie about a revenge obsessed shark, well, look no further."

I don't want to reveal how the film ends (though I don't recommend seeing it anyway), but Mrs. Brody has a bunch of flashbacks from the ending of the classic original \"Jaws\" (despite the fact she wasn't at those scenes) and somehow saves the day. The whole film has little to do with a shark, but with Mrs. Brody's meloncholy state and mourning for her late husband (who supposedly died of a heart attack).

But the next story would not use the elements from Jaws 3-D, instead they would use elements from the first Jaws. It would be interesting to see how the next story would be developed, by using elements from the first chapter which is still iconic. But the only actress to be back for the next Jaws movie, is Lorraine Gary who appeared in the first and the second one as Ellen Brody. The rest of the cast never appeared, in any previous Jaws movies neither did Michael Caine. In 1987 came out Jaws: The Revenge by Joseph Sargent, with Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine. The movie's plot: Martin Brody's widow Ellen Brody would confront a great white shark, that is seeking vengeance by following her to the Bahamas. As the movie is the last establishment of Jaws franchise, there have been expectations to surprise the audience and the critics. Instead it completely failed by becoming, a much worse Jaws chapter than the third one. The movie has a rhythm to be boring and predictable, which unnecessarily repeat some elements from Jaws by Steven Spielberg. The attack scenes didn't work to be suspenseful, but it worked to be predictable and laughable. The score by Michael Small tries to be as workable as possible, but it does not worked to be unforgettable. The editing has been elaborated to be acceptable but the using of some footage, from the first Jaws make the narration of the story pointless by distracting the audience. The cast like Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine did well with their performances, but it would entertain not as much as necessary to make a good movie. Jaws: The Revenge is one of the worst movies of all time."

Logic tells me this was going to be trash. So I had to see it, just to prove it was what I thought it was going to be. You need to double bag this baby and tie the twist tie in a knot for good measure.\n\nSheriff is dead (O no, not Roy, please don't tell me they killed Roy) but please believe Mrs. Brody is going to come to the rescue. (Hey Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out the hat... o no not again,)\n\nTo sum it up, The Shark loses, again, even to this competition. But hey, thats Hollywood."

It's beyond boring as you follow the dull life of Mrs. Brody and her son. There is nearly no plot to the film as it drags on about nothing. For some reason almost no one dies in the movie. There is little to no suspense, as the shark barely does anything. Everything Michael does in the film makes no sense. The last part of the film is beyond bad as it literally makes no logical sense. And that scene with them in a pool with a painting as the background while they pretend to be in the ocean?? Cringe!

        "review_detailed_main": "If you thought that the vengeful killer whale from Orca (1977) was exceptionally resourceful, wait until you get a load of the malevolent great white shark from Jaws IV: it follows Ellen Brody (widow of Chief Brody from the original film, who has since died of a heart attack i.e., Roy Scheider said \"No!\") all the way from Amity Island, Massachusetts, where it snacked on her youngest son Sean, to the Bahamas, where she has gone to stay with her remaining son, marine biologist Michael (Lance Guest), and his family.\n\nDespite being told by Michael that sharks do not visit the Bahamas, Ellen (once again played by Lorraine Gary) is still afraid, her psychic powers warning her that the shark is nearby. Meanwhile Michael and best pal Jake (Mario Van Peebles) encounter the shark and attempt to study its behaviour, while pilot Hoagie (Michael Caine) tries to take Ellen's mind off all things finned and toothy by showing her the sights.\n\nEven ignoring the ridiculous notion of a shark somehow tracking Ellen's flight south for 1200 miles, Jaws IV is still a really poor film, with none of the great characterisation, atmosphere, suspense or sheer horror of the original (hell, it doesn't even come close to Jaws 3-D). Way too much time is spent on Ellen's romance with Hoagie, Michael's relationship with his wife Carla (Karen Young), and his friendship with Jake, when it really should be focusing on the shark.\n\nEven when it does get to the man-eating fish, the film is a complete let down, the rubbery shark completely unconvincing and not nearly deadly enough: only two people are killed throughout the entire film, Jake and Hoagie surviving their close encounters with the shark because it would be upsetting for the viewer if they died (they're too nice to get eaten). After plenty of silliness (including the shark pulling a plane under the surface of the ocean), the killer fish is stopped when Ellen rams it with the hull of Michael's boat, causing it and the vessel to explode.\n\n3/10, purely for the banana boat scene, which delivers the kind of human chomping action that there really should have been more of."

It kept me on the edge of my seat, it entertained me and It all correlated with the prior movies. People were irritated with Ellen's psychic connection with the shark which I also do not understand, it's a fantasy horror? No one has complained about movies like Chucky etc because it doesn't need to be realistic. I am very outnumbered with my opinion, but feel I should voice it.

        "review_title": "Mind blowing!",
        "review_detailed_main": "This film is truly mind blowing. Oh yes, there is certainly no denying that. Why? Well that's simple. Because it's the biggest piece of crap excuse for a film that I have ever seen!!! The whole plot (???) is contrived, the shark looks more fake than in the prequels, and as if SEA WORLD weren't an unlikely enough target (#3) now the target is anyone in the Brody family!!! This is NOT Jaws!!!\n\nJaws stands as one of the most memorable and excellent films of all time. And Jaws 2 is a great sequel. I refuse to count the last two films as part of the series at all. Actually, I like to pretend they were never made. Here are some things I really hated about this film:\n\n1) Horrible directing- No one's gonna top Spielberg's astounding direction in the first film, but Jeannot Szwarc did a great job following it with Jaws 2. This film has some really awkward cuts, and it just doesn't feel right. The style is not as tense.\n\n2) Fake attack scenes- In Jaws 1 and 2, attacks are barely shown if at all. There are sounds, splashing, and some blood. But in this film, we see graphic death scenes. Not only that, but the shark leaps from the water and somehow suspends itself in the air???\n\n3) Shark looks MORE fake- You'd think that the animatronics would have improved from the earlier versions. Wrong. The shark in this version looks different and frankly much more unrealistic than in 1 and 2. It also GROWLS... Come on people! I am still baffled by how the effects of Jaws 1 and 2 were achieved, but this film just makes me laugh.\n\n4) Plot???- I've already mentioned this, so I'll be brief... Uhhhh,no. Just, no.\n\n5) The Music Sucked- Jaws 1 and 2 were both accompanied by the wonderful compositions of John Williams. Not only is the Jaws theme memorable, but the other music in the soundtrack fits in perfectly with the action. You don't see much, but you can certainly hear the tension in the music, which is scarier. This movie barely even uses the main theme, and when it does it's in the wrong spots. Sometimes in this film, there is no music at all when there should be some. And the music there is is all cliche and overdone.\n\n6) Characters- Even without the incredibly stereotypical African-Americans in this movie, the annoying child, and the really unfunny Brit, this film has no sympathetic characters. I could really care less about the life of Ellen Brody. I could care less about Michael and his conk research. And frankly, if I were anyone in this movie I'd want to be Sean so I could get out of there as quickly as possible so as to avoid the rest of this horrible movie. Basically, this movie has the same character problem that Jaws 3-D had- No Roy Scheider. Come ON! Once the Chief was no longer in the picture, the story ends. Martin is Jaws, Jaws is Martin. Who cares about everyone else???\n\nAnd last but not least....\n\n7) Atrocious Climax/Ending- I don't even understand how this shark is supposed to have died. It went insane??? What is THAT??? He also got poked by a stick??? It was so incredibly stupid that I was just completely lost. And as if you couldn't tell how bad this ending was, just look to the fact that they had to rely on the climax of the FIRST film to make this one work! Actually, I'm glad they put this part in there. The best part of this movie isn't even from this movie. It's Roy Scheider's famous end scene from the first Jaws movie. Imagine that.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this film to anyone, ESPECIALLY not to anyone who's a fan of the true Jaws films. Stick with 1 and 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "What could be more common than Hollywood making sequels to very successful movies? If it was successful and earned us money then a sequel must be made. In other words the aim is not so much to entertain as to make a quick buck! Jaws was simply not fit for a sequel. The shark dies in the first film. Bringing a new one along just to terrorize Amity once again is so stupid an idea that one wonders how did they come up with it, the weirdest part being that no resident of Amity seems to ask him/herself \"why is it that great whites have a thing for our island?\" Having Brody's wife assume that the shark came for them is so dumb, it actually insults our intelligence as an audience since we are supposed to buy that load of garbage.\n\nThe thing that struck me the most about the revenge is the final water sequence when they've killed the shark,(by driving a boat into it! Don't make me laugh) the horizon backdrop is obviously a painting. It's so obvious it physically hurts since even the water splashes against it! How are we supposed to not notice something that's literally thrown at our face. I'm sure most of you who've seen the film know exactly what I am talking about.\n\nIt seems that Universal has quite forgotten what constitutes a good sequel. Robert Shaw (Quint in the original Jaws) suggested that they make a movie about him on the Indian outpost in World War 2 (see his monologue in the first film) where a bunch of sharks ate many of his army buddies. This could have made a good sequel since it's unique and quite possible. But no! Universal had other plans. They'd rather show us a group of stupid kids trying to get away from a shark with Brody's son with them (of course, great whites never forget!)\n\nIn the revenge the studio has taken its overwhelming stupidity to the next level. A shark eats Helen Brody's son and then another shark hunts her and her second son in the Bahamas. As the poster says: This time it's personal. Indeed it is. The great white sent a message to his buddy in the Bahamas asking him to do some killing on his behalf and obviously he agrees. This friend of the great white is apparently some kind of X shark due to the fact that he is blessed with vocal cords that enable him to roar (maybe its mother mated with a lion) and has another extraordinary ability to stand on water. So he is an X super shark.\n\nI can't believe I bought the damn DVD. But anyway it serves a completion purpose. I'd like to finish this article by making a film suggestion to Universal pictures and Hollywood. You seem to be so into making sequels and prequels e.g Saw3, The Texas chainsaw massacre:The beginning, why not make a 5th Jaws? \"Jaws: The return of the great white\", where the shark gets cloned by modern day technology and is then free to continue his hunt for the descendants of the Brody family. Sounds stupid? What do you care as long as it makes money we are all happy and we do't give a damn about quality."

How must steven speilsberg have felt when this was added to the other 3 Jaws films. Michael Caine in it for the money and has never hidden the fact. A shark swimming all the way down to the Bahamas seeking revenge, it sounds stupid in the cold light of day and to be honest you'd need a few drinks to watch this rubbish. The film is best summed up when Mario Van Peebles is taken into the water by the shark and then turns up at the end of the film. A dreadful film which ruined a good trilogy of shark films, even if they were declining in quality. I bet Michael Caine has never seen the whole film and not a lot of people knew that."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you've seen Jaws' Revenge, you're probably wondering where my review is. Well, Bam. Anywho, Jaws and the Revenge is the story of a shark who swims around looking for people named Brody. Oscar winner Adrien Brody, rocking guitarist Brody Dalle, ostensibly foreign pro wrestler Bruiser Brody, if your name is Brody, the shark would like to have a quick this-and-that with you. Ellen Brody is a mother who lives on Amity Island and after losing a husband to post-traumatic disorder after killing not one but two of the these buggers, and seeing her son turn into Dennis Quaid for the last movie, is letting her young son work in law enforcement. Her only caveat is that he only go close enough to the water where the shark can lunge (and baby, the shark in this movie got some moves!) and chew his arms off. The shark does, but then the son leans forward to yell at it. The shark then eats the rest of the son. Ellen has had enough of this and moves with her surviving son, who is no longer Dennis Quaid, to the Bahamas. The shark decides that's cool with him, and he swims down there before they can get there in their plane. Not exactly a fast plane, there. Upon arriving we meet the rest of the cast. There's Lenny, played Jamaicanly by Mario Van Peebles, who you may recall from his other work, unless you've never heard of him. And of course Chewie, played by Michael Caine, who like Louis Gossett Jr before him, used winning an Academy Award as a stepping stone to get involved with this franchise. (Look it up). How Jaws got Revenge is about the mind of a killing machine, who swims, eats, and gets revenge. Ellen takes things into her own hands and drives a boat to find this shark. Peebles' character is grabbed by the shark and dragged under water. Don't worry kids, he's totally fine though. This shark is aggressive though. He roars, bellows, moos, coughs, and growls. Chewie is very attracted to Ellen Brody, who after four movies of this would probably like to change her name from Brody. Chewie, in a role that would establish Michael Caine as a legend, is insatiable in his quest for her. He roars, bellows, moos, coughs, and growls. At the end of the day, The Revenge of Jaws will keep you on the edge of your seat, white-knuckled, biting your lip, making you wonder what will happen next. After seeing this film you will know what the words \"revenge\" and \"personal\" truly, truly mean. And knowledge, unlike sharks, is something that will never just come and go.

A million chimpanzee's randomly banging away on typewriters could come up with a better concept. This was a bad, bad movie, and I even heard it lost money. (Ha ha, there is justice). There were two redeeming qualities, though, the first was that it was not Jaws 3(D), and the second was the music, was was better than Jaws 3(D!). And when I write that, I mean that it could be actually good (whoa, the music, I mean) and that the rest of the time, it wasn't so bad that it made me want to tear off my ears.\n\nBut enough praise for this piece of cheese. The 'story' was basically this: a giant sock-puppet shark plans to hunt down the remaining members of the family from the original Jaws and kill them in a series of incoherent jump cuts. But the mother, being the astute little one, comes to the conclusion that the shark is seeking revenge for the other four sharks that the Brody's killed through-out the other movies. So she logically goes with the LAST STARFIGHTER to an even smaller island in the Caribean populated by a bunch of 'Jamacians' and Michael Caine.\n\nThere is some romantic banter between Caine and the widowed Lorraine Gary (the mom), and we get to see the LAST STARFIGHTER and his good friend (snicker) Mario Van Peebles put tracking devices on conchs.(?)Though out all the remaining running time, only one person gets killed, and, I would like to note, that person was driving a Bannana Boat....\n\nI won't give away the ending, although I will say that Gary (Lorraine) steals a boat to kill the shark, Michael Caine's seaplane gets eaten by the shark (?), Mario Van Peebles get munched and dragged underwater but...doesn't..die, THE LAST STARFIGHTER's huge scientific ability as he try's to fix the weird shark-zapper thing by lightly tapping the outer-case. And, oh yeah, the shark roars repeatedly, jumps 20 feet out of the water, stays there for about 30 seconds, gets impaled on the boat, and blows up.\n\nWhoops.\n\nWhile enjoying this movie, its fun to try and find bloopers and technical mistakes. For instance, whenever the shark appears, there is always a pool of blood, even if it hadn't attacked anything. Also look for the pole that propels it attached to its side in practically every shot (or the rail attached to the bottom as it stalks the corridors of the sunken ship(?)) There are also fun little tidbits and factual errors such as the fact that sharks don't roar like lions, and even though they can in fact jump out of the water, they tend not to stay there for half a minute. They also try to avoid traveling hundreds of miles in a single day, and usually, they arn't fixated on the death of a single family.\n\nI could go on forever complaining, but I already have. I recommend watching this if you have insomnia or if you have no choice."

I really think the Jaws films sort of took a nose dive after the second film. Though I still stand by my statement when I say that Jaws 3 was still my least favorite. One scene in this film shows very clearly that while they were in the plane, the effects were added in afterwards, meaning they probably weren't even in a plane at all and probably just the front half of one, with video shot from inside a real plane put in the background, though honestly, this was not the first time someone did that in a film."

My guess is the makers were trying to show the detractors of the first Jaws movie how a badly designed shark REALLY looked like. As for the performances- don't even get me started.

How did a classic film end up a big rolling turd after a few years time? We all know JAWS: THE REVENGE is bad, but it's made worse by the fact that it was a spawn of a masterpiece. It's hard to mention Steven Spielberg's JAWS right next to this awful insult of a sequel, even for simple sequel-sake. This is just bad.\n\nI liked watching the original \"Jaws\", the first two sequels were fine, but when it comes to \"Jaws:The Revenge\", things change. This film is obviously trying so hard to be, not like to be, the original. The film tries to turn Lorraine Gary as a fighter, turning her into something like Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens\", which is simply silly. She obviously allowed herself to be sucked into the role, and she even tries hard to be Ellen Brody's Husband Martin, like saying his lines before shooting the shark(\"Smile you son of a B#@*h!!!\").\n\nThe plot involves Ellen Brody's (Gary) attempt to avenge the death of her son's death. Fair enough, only director Joseph Sargent wants us to suck in as much lame-brained silliness and pass them up as willing suspension-of-disbelief. Just how much stupidity can this viewer take while watching this film? Well, once the real plot unfolds, I'm already losing track of the numerous moments of stupidity. I think I just found a film that reaches new heights of incompetence.\n\nCamp is probably one reason to see this, but as yourself: Do you really want to spend money of something you desperately want to laugh at but have to endure 89 minutes (that's long enough!) of tedium and insulting stupidity? Funny, in one scene, Mario van Peebles' (in a ridiculous Jamaican accent) says to some of the characters \"If mediocrity were fat, you'd all be whales!\". It's easy to say this to anyone involved in this mess.\n\nRating: * out of 5."

This is a travesty from start to finish. The movie should have been titled \"Jaws, The Quest To Be Eaten\". Every character seems to go out of their way to literally throw themselves in the path of the shark. Correct that, \"character\" is the wrong word. Caricature is the term. Also, even \"shark\" is inadequate to describe our wee beastie of nature. Supersonic shark is the more correct description as \"Bruce IV\" manages to swim half the length of a continent in three days. He also, honest to god, roars. Yes, roars. Sure, whatever. The plot is a meandering mess, establishing certain story and character development points, only to completely forget about them when the next scene roles around. Though it's not like you particularly care about any body anyway. The acting would embarrass Anson Williams. Again, it's easy to pick on the likes of Lorraine Gary or Lance Guest. They are obviously not real actors and are merely taking a paycheck. If they themselves think they can act, well, delusions delusions. It is Michael (pay me! pay me!) Caine and Mario (I'm not a stereotype!) Van Peeples that should know better.\n\nThis movie makes \"Yor: Hunter From the Future\" look like a taut, masterfully crafted artistic triumph. nuff said."

The cast is good enough but completely wasted by an awful script, bad direction, and anything else that can make a movie bad.\n\nThe story centers around a great white shark apparently seeking the Brody family out to get some revenge for all the others which have died in these films. Maybe it's just some kind of ghost that continues to haunt the Brodys. Anyway the films begins with some murky shots of the bottom of the harbor near the coastal resort town where the family has always lived. The camera work is nothing special, then the audience is hit over the head with some laughably unintelligible narration about fate and whatnot.\n\nThe first shark attack claims young Sean Brody who is following in his late father's footsteps as a local cop. The grief-stricken mother then heads to the Bahamas to spend the Xmas holiday with her other son Mike and his family. You see, great whites don't like warm water, and there has never been one seen there before! So naturally, our shark would not dream of turning up to spoil their Xmas, would it? The film is terrible in many, many ways. Let's look at some of them...\n\nThe shark is poorly constructed, and looks very fake. At times you can see the mechanical devices holding it up and making it move. The shark seems to float very slowly and almost on its side most of the time. When angry, this shark even has the ability to roar and growl.\n\nThe editing is seriously flawed, as well. In one scene, Mike Brody and his partner Jake (Mario Van Peebles) are talking about how \"the money is gone... the shark's gone... can't track it.\" That would be fine and dandy if only for the fact that these two clowns don't even see the shark for the first time until the NEXT SCENE!!!! What the hell?? How could have this slipped past the editor? The dialog is putrid and forced. Mario Van Peebles ad-libbed all of his lines, and it shows. Nobody has anything either important or interesting to say about anything. Even Michael Caine is hard to stand, and he has always been a very likable actor.\n\nThe film has very little action. Huge gaps of dead spots buffer the shark attacks. There are flashback sequences had by people who were never there to see the incidents take place. The final showdown between Mrs. Brody and the shark is ridiculous from any standpoint. It defies logic, physics, and common sense all at once.\n\nWhat do you suppose the studio bosses at Universal said after they first saw this stinker? What could you say? This film has been criticized by everyone under the sun for the past 18 years, and deservedly so. It truly is the worst film ever released by a major studio.\n\na very generous 1 of 10 stars from the Hound."

The acting, directing, script, and visual effects are beyond terrible. The story is stupid and the title is absurd. The movie is never exciting nor scary. The Shark is laughable and looks cheesy in every scene. The movie is not worthy of the name Jaws. Jaws 3D was a bad movie but next to this junk it looks decent. The Shark gets the revenge on the moviegoer by delivering a sequel so bad that it insures no further Jaws Movies or Movie Sharks will die. Jaws was the first great Blockbuster and Jaws : The Revenge the great movie franchise mega-bomb. The director and screenwriter should never work again after this incompetent mess. The horrible film is regarded by many to be one of the worst films of all-time. It is the second worst movie of the 1980's after Garbage Pail Kids the Movie. 1/10 Truly Terrible."

Never mind that some shark kills yet another Brody in one of the opening scenes, to the ocean they go! Are we really supposed to feel sorry for her when she gets into trouble? The great white and his trusty propeller soon find her, and then he kills some people that really have nothing to do with anything. We're led to believe that he's just after the Brody family, but the makers can't kill of any more of them so they just have him eat a couple of nameless characters with zero lines. Exciting times. Michael Caine appears for some reason, and he really just enjoys his free vacation and pads out the running time by playing the standard love interest. He brings in some class, which this movie is just seriously undeserving of. I know it had to be cheaply made, but that's no reason to deliver something this bad."

People who hate this movie do not hate it really.They love it more than the original yet refuse to acknowledge it publicly. Michael Caine excels in his role as a travel weary pilot, trying to find a reason to live and finding it in Lorraine Gary. Thus follows a tale of two lonely people trying to find company in their later years. Beautiful. True, the shark follows Lorraine Gary to the Bahamas, but so what? Have you never been followed by a wild animal on your way home from the supermarket? I was once followed by a cat. I went on holiday to Austria and on opening my chalet door, there it was, purring for meat. The cat had followed me abroad. These things can happen. Great movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie doesn't receive much love but I think it really deserves some. It's understandable why this movie is regarded as a bad one. It's the third establishment in a series of unneeded \"Jaws\" sequels. Both 2 and 3 were disappointing movies, especially compared to the first of course so how could the third sequel be possibly any better? It's easy to bash a movie like this but I'm not going with the majority here on this one.\n\nI'll explain why I feel that this is the second best movie from the \"Jaws\" series. Despite the previous two sequels it actually tries to recapture the atmosphere of the first movie. Also of course the fact that Lorraine Gary reprises her role as Ellen Brody adds to this feeling and atmosphere. The movie has lots of returning character and references to the first \"Jaws\" movie, something that the previous two sequels mostly ignored. This movie is actually the closest to the first \"Jaws\" movie in its atmosphere, story and tension. The only reason why this movie is not as good as the first \"Jaws\" movie is the fact that it hasn't got the characters Quint, Chief Brody and Hooper in it. Also of course Spielbergs skill and subtle touch is missing and so is John Williams' musical score.\n\nThe use of some archive footage from the first \"Jaws\" movie, in some flashbacks scenes might be a bit cheap but in my opinion it works effective. It perfectly binds the first and last establishment of the \"Jaws\" series. It also explains the 'lame' story better. The story is that a shark wants to take revenge on all the Brody's. It's of course incredibly silly that a shark would ever do such a thing but a story like this was necessary to put an end to the \"Jaws\" series. After this vengeful shark would die, it would be highly unbelievable that any of the Brody's would have a later encounter with a great white. This sort of story was simply needed to put an end to the series and for me it's really satisfying.\n\nIt is a really great and enjoyable monster movie. It has some well build up and executed sequences and an ending that also doesn't disappoint. In my opinion it's a great way to end the \"Jaws\" series, even though my opinion still is that none of the \"Jaws\" sequels should had ever been made because they are simply pointless.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

'Are you going to be okay?' he nods and she says..... 'Okay'. brill!\n\nMichael Caine has some of the best lines, such as the classic.. 'Oh Sh^t!' when his plane gets attacked by Jaws. and the profound 'There's a lot of ocean out there'\n\nThe sound in this film is comical, at the end of the movie for some bizarre reason we have inaudible dialogue going on from Michael Caine as the plane pulls away. This technique is used elsewhere also when a car pulls in.. inaudible dialogue suddenly becoming clear as Caine opens the car door! Very stylish sound design!\n\nIn my view this movie must have been made bad on purpose, maybe originally designed to be a comic take on Jaws that never quite made it. Anyway it makes for some light entertainment, and Caine looks very happy throughout with the pay cheque he undoubtedly picked up for the project!!"

Surely after the farce that was Jaws 3D no one in their right minds would try to milk this concept any further, right? Wrong. Jaws 4 \"The Revenge\" is a jumbled mess of ideas that only a person on a raging coke binge would have thought as passable material. Are there any redeemable qualities to this movie? No. Michael Caine was the lone hope in this movie, and gets terrible lines and looks generally bored with whatever is going on. Lorraine Gary is in this movie because her husband owned the studio that produced it, and she comes across as a crazy widow who at this point should honestly be committed to a mental institute. The shark is shown very early and very often, and to call it laughable would be the understatement of the movie. It is amazing that I can't tell whether the terrible CGI shark in Jaws 3D or the terrible mechanical shark in \"The Revenge\" is worse. In the end, it doesn't matter. The story is incoherent and boring with very little tension or suspense. The characters are bland and forgettable while being played by actors who either took this movie too lightly or too seriously. The effects in this movie are something that a college student could come up with. No redeeming qualities in a movie that is a blatant cash cow. I wouldn't even call this a good movie to riff on, because it is just so boring."

So ANYTHING can happen. I admit that the shark's personal quest for revenge is stupid even for a fictional movie universe, but at least makes the movie work because Jaws 3 was a total mess, and in my opinion is even worse than Jaws 4.\n\nNow lets think about it. After the first movie (a true cinema masterpiece) everyone got the \"jawsmania\" and wanted to go to the theaters and watch the shark eating his victims. So the shark became the driving force behind the whole franchise (even they never planned to make it one). Bottom line we all watched the sequels for the shark and the shark delivers big time in this one. This movie its mindless fun and full of carnage.\n\nIn conclusion. The producers wanted the Brodys in the film, (this family with sharks is like John Mclane with terrorists), they had the shark and they needed to find a way to make the Brodys get in a situation against a shark again. Someone said to make it personal, and the others agreed! So what? At least is not Shark In Venice!.

Another aspect of the film that was completely absurd lies within the idea that the great white is out seeking revenge against the Brody family. Lastly, it mentioned that Chief Martin Brody died earlier from a heart attack caused by a great white. What a joke! No wonder why this film is constantly bashed and often seen on worse movie lists. This loss falls squarely on the director and writers.\n\nThe only redeeming aspect of The Revenge was scoring Michael Caine to be in it and bringing back Lorraine Gary but let's be honest the two of them couldn't save this film. Half the budget for this movie had to go to Caine or he just wanted to vacation in the Bahamas, maybe both. It was odd too seeing these two great cast members having to try and sell these really cheesy bad lines. The beginning of the film had a surprising twist, which is respectable since it took some stones to pull off but it was way too rushed. From there, a lot of flashback scenes were inserted, with laughable dialog and crappy shark effect scenes. The Revenge was a really poor attempt to create a meaningful Jaws movie and solidify the series, it might have ruined it for good."

Where do I begin? Well, I give you one thing about what is the plot of this ridiculous movie: another great white shark comes in, but instead of attacking more people it wants revenge on the Brody family. Wow! That has got to be one of the most stupidest and ridiculous plot that I've ever heard in my entire life. From the show \"Siskel & Ebert,\" Roger Ebert asks Gene Siskel what shark is this? A brother? Cousin? Maybe a distant relative? I don't know, but this revenge plot really makes no sense at all; its hardly a revenge movie because the movie keeps focusing more on some parts that we don't care, and while the shark only pops in whatever it feels like it. If its not focusing well with the revenge plot, then just call it \"Jaws 4.\" Also, the movie has many errors like Michael Caine's character coming out of the water while his clothes is almost completely dried off (thanks to Siskel & Ebert); then you have the shark that knows where to find our human characters from traveling the United States to the Bahamas, and last but not least, the shark roars like a lion. Sharks can't roar! Here is another thing, how is the shark able to reach out to eat people by what using its tippy toes or thinking that the shark is Mr. Fantastic? I blame how the movie was written by a bad screenplay. Even the movie is badly directed by Joseph Sargent who also produced this. Do both the writer and director know that sharks can't roar, and making some dumb excuses that the shark is being powered by the magic of voodoo? Heck, they made Martin Brody's wife Ellen who she thinks is Spider-Man that her sharky senses are tingling, and having these flashbacks that she wasn't there. Except where she witnesses her granddaughter who almost got killed by shark, and watching her late husband and son having their moment at a dinner table from the first one. The dialogue in this movie is really terrible like Ellen's granddaughter asking about Uncle Sean coming back. Uh...he just got killed by a shark, and can't come back. Such a dumb question that she brought up. I really hated that the filmmakers made Ellen saying that her husband died because not only a heart attack, but his fear of sharks. Lorraine Gary should've know about this, as she may have seen the first two movies where Martin was trying to be brave and strong to kill two sharks; she could've say no to say that line because its really insulting to Roy Scheider's character, but no the filmmakers want her to say it and just made everyone mad on how much we love Roy Scheider from the first two movies. I find it just as bad as making Megan Fox's character looked bad in the third \"Transformers\" movie, where she was replaced by a model that can't act. I don't think the acting in this movie is good, and I don't buy Lorraine Gary as the lead. She is no Ellen Ripley. By the way, I like to point out that when she sees her granddaughter almost get killed by a shark, she steals a boat or ship as we know that she can't take it anymore but here is one question: if she is going to steal a boat to find the shark, then why can't she bring any weapons to kill it? She is not well prepared onto anything. Heck, after Sean dies at the opening scene, some cop leaves Ellen her son's gun and never bothers to take it with her to kill the shark. Well Ellen, you are some hero. You know that? Some hero. I do feel sad for Michael Caine for doing this movie, and I think I'm sure that he regretted for not attending the Academy Awards for getting his Oscar on his work for \"Hannah and Her Sisters.\" I never saw that movie, but I wish if he hadn't done this movie. The shark itself looks good on the first three movies (while the third movie made the shark cheap looking in 3D), but here its so darn fake looking. The effects in this movie are just as bad as the effects from \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\" This movie won the Razzie for Worst Visual Effect over the fourth \"Superman\" movie. The movie has two ending that were filmed: one the shark gets stabbed, and two it explodes for no reason while Michael Brody's friend survives. I don't care which ending I like best, because they both have bad effects and they're both lame. I do kind of like Caine's reaction of the shark before his plane got taken down. Oh, I also don't care for the music either. You wish if this movie never existed, but hey this is the last one and I am glad that its all over. I think the \"Sharknado\" movies are more entertaining than the last two \"Jaws\" sequels. I give \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a flat out zero. But I have to give it a one, because giving it a zero won't make its 2.8 rating go down. I wish I could, but got to be respectful to IMDb's rating system; and seriously, this movie sucks!"

Jaws 3-D? What the hell was that? The special effects were so faked that I bet those who saw that film just walked out when the special glasses didn't work. Why do we need more sequels to films that should've been left alone in the first place? Somehow there's a disease with the Brody family where sharks just keep to be coming by the numbers and bothering this poor family. Roy Schinder is not in this sequel but is seen through flashbacks from his wife (Lorraine Gray in her final film) after the family's young son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) gets his arm ripped off before being devoured by a new menacing shark. The remaining son Michael (Lance Guest) is in Jamaica working in oceans and studying the effects of fish while seeing that his mother comes to visit after the death of Sean where that pesky shark keeps returning. Is there a radar on the Brody family? Other stars include Mario Van Peebles in a Jamaican accent and Michael Caine who skipped his Oscar win for Hannah and her Sisters to do this hunk of junk.\n\nAHHHHH!!!!"

How could there be any pretense that this was going to be a good movie when the poster tag line is, \"This time it's personal.\" How is a shark going to take things personally from the prior three films? And when the shark got killed in all of the prior films, is this film's shark supposed to be the third cousin twice removed coming to get revenge on Chief Brody's wife (the only person from the original film appearing in this fourth installment). There is no reason to watch this film outside of put camp. It's awful and is only watchable when the mechanical shark appears."

This is one of the most poorly made and badly acted movies that I have ever seen. Joseph Sargent, the director of this trash, is a good director. He has directed lots of movies mostly on TV. He's won a couple of Emmy Awards to prove it. But what on earth was he thinking of when he made this. Certainly he got no help with the script. The screenplay is by Michael de Guzman. How can somebody write a script that is so incredibly stupid? The plot of \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is such an incomprehensible mess that it has to be seen to be disbelieved. And what about that acting? It was a travesty to see Michael Caine in this movie and watch him waste his considerable talents. And what was even more shocking is that when he won his first Oscar for Woody Allen's \"Hannah and her Sisters\" in 1987, he didn't show up on Oscar night to collect his award; he was making \"Jaws: The Revenge\"! Lorraine Gary (reprising her role from the first two \"Jaws\" movies as Ellen Brody), Lance Guest, Karen Young, Mario Van Peebles, and (the late) Judith Barsi all give bad performances thanks largely in part to the hilariously awful script. An easily seen continuity error late in the film proves that \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is as ineptly made as everybody has said. Oh, I forgot to mention the performance of Bruce the Shark. Whoever made that shark didn't even try to make it look real and convincing. The shark ended up looking fake and unrealistic. And as a result, of all these bad qualities help to sink \"Jaws: The Revenge\". And boy does it sink fast. Only the beautiful Bahamas locations keep me from giving this catastrophe no stars.\n\n1/2* (out of four)"

        "review_title": "This time it's personally offensive",
        "review_detailed_main": "The tagline for Jaws: The Revenge states, \"this time it's personal.\" Really? I thought it was already personal after the second Jaws film was made and another shark attacked poor Amity Island again. If Jaws: The Revenge should be seen as anything personal it should be viewed as a personal attack - better yet, an assault - on a tremendous horror film that capitalized off of suspense and editing.\n\nI should've reviewed Jaws: The Revenge three weeks ago, but I've been putting it off because I've needed to review other films since then. And also, what can be said about Jaws: The Revenge that hasn't already been reiterated and restated time and time again? The film is a dreary slog that consists of waiting for suspense and atmosphere to build, waiting for the shark to appear, being disgusted when the shark finally does appear, and then finally being greeted with the end credits, concluding the mess we just witnessed. If you still want to classify the film as a horror film, even though I'd argue the series thrust its way into the action genre after the second film, then this is one of the worst, most redundant horror films I have yet to see.\n\nThe film stars Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), whose husband Martin from previous films has died of a heart attack, which is believed to be brought on from the stress of dealing with sharks in Amity Island. Ellen now lives with her son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), who is sheriff deputy, and his fianc\u00e9e Tiffany (Mary Smith). Despite normality seemingly coming back for the gang, Ellen is convinced she is being followed by a great white shark when she vacations to the Bahamas to visit her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest). Now it's a matter of killing another shark before the shark can kill them.\n\nIt's no wonder Steven Spielberg had no interest in pursuing a sequel to his original Jaws film and had no involvement with any of the three sequels. I imagine he recognized that a \"man vs. shark\" is only really fresh the first time around and that doing the same thing film after film would begin to become monotonous and painfully familiar. Even if Jaws: The Revenge wasn't plagued with such lame acting, terrible effects work, and collectively sterile camera-work, it would be hard to convince us that a fourth movie about a group of people going after another shark would be something worth paying to see.\n\nI recall when I watched Jaws 3 and got so tired with the characters and the plot that I just wanted to see a shark attack. Then I saw how painfully cheap and ridiculous the shark looked and kind of wanted more exposition. Then when I received more exposition I kind of just wanted the entire thing to end. The film was a muchness. Jaws: The Revenge suffers from the same form of monotony. One is constantly waiting for something to happen, then upon being rewarded, they wish they had never seen such a thing. For the purists who complain that the shark was clearly artificial in the original Jaws, I'd love to see how they responded to the shark in Jaws: The Revenge. I doubt there's enough howling in the world that could do justice to its artificiality and stunning banality.\n\nThus concludes the Jaws franchise for now, thankfully. This is one of the few franchises I know of (next to the contemporary Paranormal Activity series) that failed to have another \"good\" film after its first film, which, in both series' cases, was phenomenal. One should take the hint how in conversations about the original Jaws, rarely do the sequel names come up, and by God is that for the better.\n\nStarring: Lorraine Gray, Mitchell Anderson, Mary Smith, and Lance Guest. Directed by: Joseph Sargent."

        "review_detailed_main": "After the death of her son, a woman decides to go visit her other son in the Bahamas where everyone comes to believe that the killer shark that killed their family has arrived and is stalking the area forcing them to race to stop it from attacking the rest of the community.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot to like in this one. One of the few bright spots here is the action sequences when they occur as the few attacks the shark has aren't all that bad. The opening attack, where a victim is savagely ripped up and bitten savagely before being pulled underwater, is quite stunning and really shocking as it sets a great opening for the film, a later attack on a crowded beach where a victim is snagged off a marine toy in front of a small group of kids is really a great sequence for its cruelty and viciousness than anything else and the chase sequence in the sunken galleon does have an air of suspense as the shark does manage to constantly get at the victim after every possible method is used to put distance between them. Beyond these, though, there wasn't much to really like about it as there's a lot to really dislike in this one. The utmost flaw is that the film has the most unbelievable and nonsensical plots ever. Beyond the fact that sharks are incapable of living in the location chosen, the fact that it manages to get to there in a short amount of time is very hard to believe. There's also the family history of the sharks that the film brings up. Using the film, the shark is in fact the first film's third-cousin twice removed, and would have no motive to carry out the vengeance issued. That's assuming that the connection is correct, and if it isn't, then it's even more off in terms of where the shark falls in the family circle. The other big mistake in the film, beyond trying to figure out where the shark comes from, is the very slow pacing involved. Scenes drag on for far too long or have no reason to be there other than padding out the length. The biggest one is the family quarrels about being in the water, which was done nicely enough at first but then it happens twice in a half-hour span, and nothing comes of them since they all go into the water afterward. The struggling marriage scenes have no bearing on the plot and seem needlessly thrown in as well. There's a couple of other big problems in the film, the biggest of which is that the film feels really flat. In fact, the film flat out ignores all opportunities to create tension or fear. Just about all the attack scenes seem perfunctorily rushed and no effort is whatsoever made to make them frightening or even suspenseful. The ending, which should've been a big rousing affair to finish off the shark once and for all, plays out really flatly and the stupidity found within has a lot to do with that. Finally, the shark does look really fake, and there's really no scenes where it looks the slightest real. It simply floats along with minimal movement, being even more distracting. This really wasn't all that great.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence, Language and children in danger."

Its true, seldom does one come across a film so awful, that it actually inspires admiration for the people who made. Whoever they are however, i'm sure that they have long since been fired from the film industry. I might be a tad mean, but the gap in quality between Jaws and Jaws the Revenge is so massive, i don't think another one exists in the entire history of cinema. The one star a gave to this film is for the guts of the filmmakers to actually attempt putting such a lame, and utterly pathetic film on the film reel.\n\nThe only good aspect of this film is the music, although it variates on the classic John Williams tune, as it allows one to close their eyes while watching the film, and admire the music. But then there's the roaring shark (really, a roaring shark? you must be kidding? sharks don't roar!) Oh, they do, in this film apparently. Actually both the shark and anyone watching this film has something in common when it comes to jaws. the shark is using its jaws to chow people, while your jaws are hitting the floor. Oh yes, and did i mention that the shark also seeks revenge on the Brody (Sharks don't seek revenge! What are you talking about?) Yep, thats what makes this film truly unique. A shark, probably a second cousin 5000 times removed from the original Bruce. Apparently Matin Brody has died from a heart attack from \"FEAR\"! Like he new another Great White was coming to attack the town. Its like he had some sort of telepathic link with it. (That's impossible!) I know it is.\n\nI don't think anyone enjoyed seeing young Sean Brody getting killed like that, especially considering that he is the little kid from JAWS, who everyone thought was so cute for imitating his father's movements like that. AND, you know what? The SHARK LAYS AN AMBUSH!!!!!!! Wow, i bet you'd never heard of that in the history of cinema. In fact this film is so bad, that almost every Jaws spinnoff is better than it, and that's just insulting.\n\nAlso, this film leaves Amity island and takes place in the Bahamas. Unless the shark flew, or hitched a ride on a speed boat, which is the only way it would have gotten there in time, this doesn't help the credibility of this picture. Oh, and for peaks sake, in the sharks death scene, they actually had the nerve to steal a shot of the original film. That i admire. That, and the whole roaring shark shark thing. Apart from that, the film has undeveloped characters, a crappy story, and is 87 minutes long, which is just unbearable for such junk. Oh, and just for the record, great white sharks cannot stop moving, or else they stop living. Someone should tell that to the films director."

Mind you, this is the least of the problems with this film (especially since you can't really tell that those guys in 3D are supposed to be the Brody kids just by watching the film.\n\nThis movie is worth watching if you like bad movies.

That is a mother's natural way. But what's silly about it is Ellen becomes somehow psychically connected to Jaws and that is where I think this film fails. If she was just looked at as an odd woman then I would be fine with that but the psychic connection is silly.\n\nThe movie is still watchable to me but just a bit, well, silly. Plus I find this movie a wee bit better than 3-D where this group of extra large great white sharks are suppose to live - not way off in Disneyland errr ummm Seaworld.\n\n6/10"

Each sequel was worse than its predecessor, and Jaws: The Revenge does not disappoint in that regard.\n\nBy the end of this film, it unintentionally makes a complete mockery of the entire movie series. I'm specifically referring to the instance where Michael Caine's character almost in jest flips himself back on board of the fledging boat without so much as a scratch on him moments after being attacked by a gigantic white shark. I remember joking with my friends, saying: \"What if the pilot of the crashed plane (Caine's character) miraculously survives and climbs back on board? Wouldn't that be hilarious?\"\n\nWell, it was hilarious, and so was the rest of this picture.\n\nThe acting is downright dreadful and the storyline is completely ridiculous. It's somewhat unsettling that a team of professionals called a meeting, sat down and approved a plot line that calls for a giant shark to miraculously come back to life (unexplained) and stalk the family of the man who tried to get rid of him in the original title. Are you kidding me? The first significant moment of the movie occurs when the youngest Brody son Sean -- who is now the Police Chief of Amity -- is attacked and killed by Jaws during the holidays. The sound of a choir caroling on the beach mutes his cries for help a mere yards from the shoreline.\n\nHmmm....\n\nAnyway, the plot continues and the eldest Brody son, Michael, visits for the Holidays/funeral and convinces the now stricken Ellen Brody to visit him at his home in the Bahamas. Though originally reluctant, she agrees and the film shifts to the beautiful islands.\n\nWhile there, Ellen begins to lose it, fearing that the shark that killed Sean and terrorized Amity 10 years prior is out for revenge, suggesting it followed her to the warm waters of the Bahamas (a place unfit for sharks) and will instantly chase down the entire family the moment they enter the salty sea waters. Michael thinks it's a crazy idea, but when his daughter is nearly killed by the shark, he begins to think his loony mother may be on to something.\n\nThe ridiculous climax takes place in the middle of the ocean when Ellen decides it would be a clever idea to confront the sea beast alone on her son's boat. Making a painfully long series of events short: Ellen, her new love interest Hoagie (the surviving pilot), Michael and his assistant survive the wrath of Jaws, joyfully cheering as they float aimlessly in the middle of the vast blue ocean after watching the shark explode into smithereens."

Jaws... is a masterpiece in horror movie making and is considered by many as one of Steven Spielberg's best (rightfully so). Jaws 2 is decent, flawed but saved by Roy Scheider's great performance. Jaws 3 is... a funny movie.\n\nBut then there is Jaws: The Revenge... Why was this movie made? Did they really expect us to go \"Oh, that makes sense\" at this egregious premise where a shark goes after Martin Brody's wife as revenge? This doesn't make any sense whatsoever considering the shark Martin hunted DIED. All right? He killed him. But considering we now have a shark which is so p'issed off it swims aaaaaaaaaall the way to Bahamas, that has to mean it's another shark who was informed one of his friends died and so now decides to go after Ellen. You might believe this is a joke, but it's not! This is what actually happened!\n\nThe acting is a joke. Lorraine Gary is decent for what she has to work with, but the rest? Not very good. I don't remember much about Michael Caine's performance (he probably tried, but the stupid script didn't give anyone good material to work with), but Mario Van Peebles... He was absolutely ABYSMAL! What was up with the hokey slang he had to speak all the time? He sounded like an idiot! Whenever Jake (that's his character's name) was on screen, I was either laughing or shamefully shaking my head.\n\nThe shark itself looks... weird. It's very different-looking from the other sharks, although mostly in a negative way. It has a really silly design and makes you chuckle rather than horrified. Christ, the shark in Jaws 3 was at least believable enough to make the movie work. What I'm seeing here though, is a plastic toy. Was the budget a nickel or something?\n\nThe worst sin though is how boring this movie is. There are several scenes where you hear these knuckledhead characters \"talking\" with each other and you are just waiting for it to END already. If you are gonna develop characters... GIVE US CHARACTERS WORTH DEVELOPING!\n\nIt's funny because it's so bad... but it's groan-inducing for the same reason. I wouldn't say I don't recommend this movie, but I only recommend it if you want to see something which at least almost is unintentionally funny. If you are looking for what resembles even just an OKAY installment in the Jaws franchise... you've got better shi't to do."

The mouth cannot even contain it's own movements, the teeth have the worst case of \"human tartar\" even for a robot that I have ever seen. Roger Ebert said it best when the shark rather looks like it had a bad case of tooth decay. Lance Guest has some poor acting performances with his on screen wife, but surprisingly had some nice moments with Mario Van Peebles whilst on the boat that they do their biologist researches work upon. Michael Caine does well in the movies that I have seen from him, & has a likable performance as Hoagie the adventurous pilot who has a whisk for living life to the fullest if you will. All & all, the movie was too short (87 minutes) As I say with ALL the 'Jaws' movies, they should've been rated 'R' for potential graphic violence, script was dull, & didn't make the most logical sense, so if you are trapped inside your place of residence on a snowy, or rainy afternoon, with nothing on your agenda & looking to waste some time, then this bore-fest is for you. If you're as knowledgeable & passionate about good movies, then I would suggest the original \"Jaws\", & \"Jaws 2\""

Tragically, this was not the case with \"Jaws\".\n\nJust to highlight the remarkable capability of Hollywood's cinematic alchemists to turn gold into lead, I must hasten to remind the reader that the original \"Jaws\" was an excellent film that set a high standard for the horror genre. Spielberg's original (which I gave an IMDb score of 9/10) stands, with the original \"Alien\", as one of the exemplars of my #1 rule for horror films. Don't let the audience get a good look at the monster -- until it's too late! Who ever would have thought that a simple dorsal fin could be so scary? Who even knew what a dorsal fin was before they saw \"Jaws\"?\n\nBut back to the grim task at hand, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" flagrantly violates this rule. If you get to see the shark all the time (and it's easy to see how poorly constructed the \"shark\" is as another reviewer has pointed out) then it's not scary. At all. Once that happens, what's the point of making a horror movie?\n\nLet's talk about the title -- \"Jaws: The Revenge\". They really, honestly, sincerely mean that. It's not one of those movies where the monster goes berserk and the body count soars with gruesome special effects galore. No, not that type of revenge. You know, the type of movie where a sleazy corporate lawyer talking too loudly on his cellphone wades a couple of feet into the water and then ... CHOMP! (And the whole audience cheers.) I could imagine enjoying a movie like that -- in the right mood.\n\nBut I did not enjoy \"Jaws: The Revenge\". At all. When they say \"revenge\" they mean that other, human type of revenge. The shark actually has a personal vendetta against some poor woman throughout the movie, then jumps out of the water and roars at her. Now there are just three problems that I have with that.\n\n1. The shark has a personal vendetta against a human being.\n\n2. The shark jumps out of the water.\n\n3. The shark roars.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I have a great deal of difficulty believing that any fish would or could do such things. Maybe in an animated feature where the fish also talk to each other and sing songs. Tragically, this was not such a movie.\n\nThe last straw for me is the abuse of genuinely talented, famous movie stars in this picture. Tragically, Michael Caine, Lynn Whitfield, and Mario and Melvin Van Peebles were all tricked into appearing in \"Jaws: The Revenge\". That may be my biggest bad-movie pet peeve. A low-budget schlock-fest with no-name actors is one thing. I can almost forgive the makers of \"Manos: Hands of Fate\". (Almost.) But when a major Hollywood studio drags good actors we know and like through a festering pile of manure like \"Jaws: The Revenge\", I cannot forgive that. At all.\n\nIMDb Score: 1 out of 10 (only because I can't give it a 0)"

The acting and dialogue is awful...I don't know how its possible to recall flashbacks that you haven't witnessed. The deaths are extremely tame, with cutting back to a fake shark's mouth. Finally the death of the shark seems very tame, the version i've seen is the edited version, with the unedited being slightly better.

        "review_title": "The Most Ridiculous Plot in Movie History",
        "review_detailed_main": "Jaws: The Revenge is an unwelcome addition to the franchise, a movie no one truly desired. Jaws 3-D seemed to put the nail in the coffin of the franchise, clearly displaying that the filmmakers had exhausted all possible routes. They were clearly out of ideas. Yet, Jaws: The Revenge exists, and without exaggeration, it has the most stupid movie plot I've ever seen.\n\nThe story revolves around Lorraine Brody, the widow of Chief Brody (played by Roy Scheider), who supposedly died of a shark-related, fear-induced heart attack. After her youngest son, Sean, falls victim to a shark attack on Amity Island, Lorraine relocates to the Bahamas with her remaining son, Michael, a marine biologist. Astonishingly, the same vengeful shark manages to pursue them all the way from New England to the Bahamas. Having known about the plot of this movie for years and even having just watched it, I still can't quite believe Jaws: The Revenge is real. It undeniably ranks among the worst films I have ever watched.\n\nThe initial shark attack, admittedly, represents the film's least terrible aspect. It embraces a gory, horror-like execution that momentarily provides a flicker of trashy entertainment. However, this fleeting sense of promise swiftly dissipates as the movie rapidly deteriorates. Jaws: The Revenge is remarkably short on action, instead prioritising a melodramatic romance between Lorraine and Hoagie, played by Michael Caine. However, I didn't care about these characters or their situations due to the atrocious script. Still, Caine is the film's best part, even if he is phoning it in.\n\nThe sporadic action sequences lack any tension or suspense, primarily because the shark is persistently visible, looking artificial and rubbery. One of the original film's greatest strengths lay in its sparing use of the shark's on-screen presence, a principle that Jaws: The Revenge blatantly disregards. It seems as though the creators of this film had never even laid eyes on the masterpiece that started it all."

        "review_detailed_main": "My Rating:1/2 out of ****.\n\nIn 1975, A Masterpiece was made, it was called Jaws. In 1978, Jaws 2 came out, it was good but not great. In 1983, it was Jaws 3-D, it was a guilty pleasure. Together these 3 would have made an uneven but decent trilogy. But no Hollywood is greedy and came out with Jaws 4. This film is one of the worst films of all time. Even the worst Halloween sequel (Part 6) cant compare to this.\n\nOn the trivia area it is reported that the events in Jaws 3-D were ignored during the making of this film. I heard the filmmakers hated Jaws 3-D and ignored everything that happened. Jaws 3-D was not a great film at all, but most people would have to admit its better than this ridiculous piece of crap.\n\nThe Shark in the films are not realistic at all. The model in the first was barely passable. However, Spielberg used the less is more technique to achieve suspense. Not much of the shark was shown but there was a great deal of Suspense. The shark is shown way too much here and it is fake looking as hell. Joseph Sargents does a terrible job at achieving suspense, ok there is no suspense. He is not Spielberg.\n\nThe acting is horrible. Lorraine Gary overacts all the time. Michael Caine is wasted. Why is he in this film anyway? Mario Van Peebles is annoying.\n\nThe way the Shark is killed is ridiculous and doesnt make sense. There is no way Lorraine Gary could take on the Shark by herself. She is not Sigourney Weaver, she is an old hag. The movie is consistently lame, everything scene is drenched with lameness. The flashbacks of the first movie have no purpose, just to block off the fact that the screenwriter had no idea how to kill off the Shark. I am surprised there is no Jaws 5. The Shark is supposed to be invincible and yet it looks like if you kick him he'll die.\n\nYet for all that is terrrible about Jaws 4, the Ocean is beautiful looking. It looks great to swim in. Who cares about the Shark, check out the Ocean. The Carribean is beautiful. For those images I was able to give Jaws 4 half a star instead of zero."

Basically, yet another shark shows up at Amity, and the widowed Mrs.Brody is convinced this shark is out for revenge against the Brody family when her adult son (possibly the character that Quaid played in Jaws 3, I'm not sure) is devoured by the shark.\n\nSo she goes to the Caribbean. The shark follows.\n\nSomehow, Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles get involved and they set out to re-create the last half hour from the original Jaws. Even going so embarrassingly far as to provide \"flashback\" footage that none of those characters ever saw first hand!\n\nAlso known as Jaws 4, run away from this one no matter what it calls itself. Only rates at a two because it is ever so slightly more tolerable than \"C.H.U.D. 2\". Stay away!"

Sadly, the three prequels were ruined by glory-seeking amateurs, so focused on their own little vanity project, that they forgot that their one job was to set us up for the main event. Sargent, soldiers on bravely, here; but, without the groundwork, it just seems too much of a reach.\n\nOkay, joking aside, I won't try to sell you on this movie on its merits. It really doesn't have any. But, I will sell some of you on this movie. Firstly, it makes a great cheesey double bill with Bula Quo. Secondly, there is the been there, done that, got the T-shirt aspect - although, admittedly, not as good as a T-shirt that says \"Nilbog Milk\" on it. Thirdly, even if you decide not to watch it, just be glad it exists. Be glad it exists for the same reason why you're glad that the final two episodes of the Prisoner exist. Be glad it exists for the same reason you are glad that the finale of Game of Thrones exist. Be glad for the simple pleasure of knowing that there are people out there who are looking forward to watching it, and they have some high expectations. Just enjoy the schadenfreude of it all.\n\nI knew I would convince you."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me state the obvious to begin. The idea of a shark having a personal grudge against a certain family is crazy. How would the shark even know who is a Brody and who isn't? That being said, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. While the idea is silly, the actual story of some of the Brody family being scared that a shark is targeting them is preformed pretty well. The action scenes with the shark are so much better than the third movie and are not far behind the second. I enjoyed all the nods to the first movie and felt it was just enough without dwelling on the past. The ending is alright until you get to the moment of the shark's demise which really doesn't make sense. From what I understand the original ending made a lot more sense even though it's still far fetched.\n\nI realize that few will probably agree with my opinion but, I don't think this movie deserves the low rating it has. It is no classic but, it's a decent enough movie if you get past cringing a little whenever the \"the shark is out to get us\" statements are made. I think it still ends the franchise a good note and I'm personally glad the it didn't end with train wreck that was Jaws 3. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie very much but, I was pleasantly surprised."

What is Michael Caine doing in this piece of cr*p? Oh I forgot Michael actually enjoyed doing these silly flicks sometimes.\n\nIt's all in the set up really. You can't overdo a good thing. Jaws was genuinely frightening. With Jaws, The Revenge all you wanted was for the ending credits to roll by. As to the set ups - well contrived is too easy on them. Just make a situation up and hope you scare the cr*p out of people ^ not.\n\nThat is the trouble with disaster/horror flicks. They often really work the first time. Then someone gets the brainwave or is it brain dead and decide to do it again and again and again. It doesn't matter who it is - Friday the 13th, Halloween etc. the original was great and then they wreck it. Film deserves better. Of course on the other side I wasted my time watching it."

Honestly, I am saddened at the fact that a franchise can go from critical acclaim to being unanimously loathed by critics. It is also a shame that the franchise had to end on a bad note."

The plot is beyond bad although it has a decent opening sequence. This scene is underrated in my opinion, but then the movie terribly falls and becomes a mess.\n\nThe body count is minimal taking in account that these kind of movies need many death scenes. The gore, F/X are very cheap and don't have nothing to do with the original \"Jaws\".\n\nThe movie is a disappointment and I can understand why it's on the Bottom 100 on IMDb. What else to say?

Were they really that desperate for a film that they financed something just because it has the name Jaws in it? Ohhh please. So let's get this right, this shark has a personal vendetta against the Brody's now? Why? Did they do anything to this particular shark? Did they kill it's mommy? And if they did, why is it waiting 12 years to extract revenge on the remaining Brody's? Why didn't it come get revenge right after the first one blew up and the second one fried? I guess it had problems communicating with the dead! Oh but wait, there is more stupidity. Ellen has flashbacks of things that she was never there for. I'm sorry, was there a fourth on the Orca? Did she help Brody fire that rifle? Was she on the grassy knoll?\n\nAnd, yes ladies and gentleman, there is more. When Sean dies she wants to get away from it all and she decides to go the Carribbean. Hey there's an idea. Let's got to the one place where the shark actually has a chance to be. How about a trip to Northern Ontario? Or even to Wisconsin. How about Russia, Germany, Lichtenstein! Anywhere that doesn't have a salted body of water around. I know if I ever got attacked by a bear in the mountains, the first place I would go to get away from it all would be to the mountains, but a little further south! Cause ya know, bears aren't in the mountains down south! Oh and of course the shark makes it to their place of destination before they do. So as one of the other reviewers in here alluded to, I too am going to travel Air Sharky next time I go somewhere. But you know what? I have a perfect script for the next Jaws and I was hoping that maybe they would be reading this review and they could contact me. The story would be simply that Ellen Brody, Michael ( her son ) Michael Caine and all the execs that made this film should be in the next one. Hell put in Joseph Sargeant as well. After all, he is the one that tried to make a film here. So you put all of them in the film and you make Bruce a real shark and we can just watch all of them get eaten, for real. I'm serious too. That would have more of a plot and a story ( a plausible one that is ) than this piece of !@##*. You can call me at 1-976-STUPID-MOVIE.\n\nIt's kind of strange, Jaws is my favourite movie of all time. I also think it is the best made film ever. Jaws 4 has got to be the worst film ever made. What a pity. What a piece of #@^*!."

After Sean is killed by another shark, Ellen decides to head down to the Bahamas with her other son Michael (from the first 3 films). According to Michael, there has never been a great white shark down there, because it is too warm for them. Things get ridiculous when the shark follows them to the Bahamas to seek revenge. The movie has some good points; the cast was decent, the effects were alright, and really might not have been that bad of a movie...However, the idea of humanizing a shark is simply absurd."

The effect of white sharks in this film is so stiff and bad .. Unlike in his first film White shark effect in the movie Jaws (1975) is very realistic, and not like a robot ....."

The actors stand around like dummies because they don't know what to do. It is just so illogical and unconvincing. The climax is absolutely terrible!!

It mines it's heritage and uses the classic moments from past films to create a story rich in callbacks. Although they are often unwittingly comical, they give fans of the films, something to love.

After watching Jaws 3 and noticing how bad it was in comparison to the previous Jaws film. Jaws: The Revenge is quite worse.\n\nHere the location is set in the Bahamas and features more unlikeable and irritating characters. Giving the wife the lead was a bad decision as her character is far more annoying than the original two films. She came across as too whiny and nagging. Michael Caine comes off across as obnoxious as well and the son Michael Isn't interesting either.\n\nThe main lowlights include the climax with the shark roaring than exploding for little to no reason. Easily the worst looking and low budget shark of the series. Also very little shark kills in this film (only 2- the lowest deaths of the franchise).\n\nFeaturing virtually no suspense and thrills, this film is just boring to get through. We also wonder as to how Jake survived in the end after being brutally attacked by the shark and taken underwater for a long period of time. Overall this film was not needed and is as terrible as the low ratings suggest."

Maybe Mario van Peebles is not top tier for some, but he and his father (a is there a theme her I missed?) changed the landscape of (black) cinema ... anyway the movie has nothing to do with it. Some might even feel this goes the different direction - as good as Mario is, his I reckon Jamaican character is annoying ... and that is putting it mildly.\n\nAnyway, the shark looks good and I imagine if you cut it a lot of slack and accept the \"connection\" to the first movie (and the major character) ... I guess one can enjoy it ... still carrying it the Jaws name .... the anticipation is way too high a burden ..."

Yes it's a bad movie, it's story is truly garbage but again for the millionth time, this is a sharknado situation where the movie is so bad it's entertaining while I watched jaws 3 it bored the hell out of me, it's the first time I watched a movie and was dreading for it to be over.

This would be fine if the writing was strong enough to support a dialogue-driven film, however all the lines are dull and uninteresting. Even when the shark attacks, it can feel boring due to over-use of slow motion. This is why I'm giving it a 3, because I reserve the one and two star reviews for films so poorly constructed that they become fun to watch. This will simply make you wait for it to end."

Lance Guest should have stuck with flying spaceships and talking to turd people. This movie killed the careers of these poor actors. A shark that has revenge on a family in Massachusetts somehow follows them down the coast against the current and suddenly can survive in warm tropical temperatures. I would tell people to watch this movie mainly for the laughs and nothing else. Beware of the banana scene though. The underwater scenes are somewhat decent though. With the eel jumping out and with the conk shells. Maybe Michael Brody was tagging the shells to see what their migration periods were like. At some points the shark looks as big as a house and at others as small as a door frame. I give this a 1 and if I could, a 0.5. The only redeeming parts were the underwater shots. So get some popcorn and get ready for a wildly stupid film."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is what we want! This is what the punters have all paid to see: Michael Caine battling a shark with a personal vendetta.\n\nDisappointingly, though, Jaws: The Revenge's reputation as a superturkey of the highest calibre is a little overblown. Oh, sure, it is pretty bad, but it doesn't qualify for the premier league of celluloid waste that counts among its number Batman & Robin, Speed 2 and The Avengers.\n\nNone of the Jaws sequels were really dire, of course, merely so-so and average. The first possessed possibly the most famous tagline in movie history, though was strangely unengrossing. The second suffered from the obvious demands of its 3-D format, though even that probably isn't as bad as you might remember.\n\nWhile obviously not containing the worth of the original mainstream classic, the sequels were popular enough to reach film No.4, which surprisingly features Michael Caine in only a relatively minor role. That said, an unusually tubby Caine does give sufficient enthusiasm to what you can tell he knows are third-rate lines. However, despite cod Jamaican accents, the general personal workings of the film are well in order, if not terribly exciting. The word of mouth that the shark is after revenge turns out to be a misnomer. The only person in the film who believes this to be the case is the traumatised Ellen Brody. Okay, there is one point where she seems to be psychic, but generally this is never as silly as it is purported to be. The frequency of the shark's attacks may seem farfetched, but never more than in any of the other films. In conclusion, the subtitle for the film seems to be based on Brody's desire for vengeance, rather than that of the \"overgrown goldfish\". The tagline - This time it's personal - has been similarly misunderstood.\n\nBut the real sticking point comes with the shark itself. Whereas the others had used a dummy shark only sparingly, opting in the main for genuine shots of such a creature, here the action seems to be wholly taken over with an animatronic puppet. None of the movies in the series were able to do this successfully. The original and Jaws 3-D were acceptable if you squinted and applied a kind eye, whereas the second produced the odd wry smile. Here though, the dummy used looks shabby and plasticcy, several shots appearing to reveal zippers and wiring on the creature's casing. Let's be honest \u0096 even Stevie Wonder wouldn't be convinced that this was a real shark. It looks ridiculous, and every time it appears, which is often, the audience cannot help but roar their hysterical disbelief.\n\nSome hilarious goofs - including a waterlogged Caine emerging from the ocean with dry clothes, and a roaring shark - push the laughter factor even higher. Underdeveloped denouement drags this half-hearted film towards the end credits, a shambling mess with a joke as its major star, the actors only underwritten support. Yet, sadly, it's still not enough to make this a enjoyably bad film. Jaws: The Revenge suffers the ultimate indignity of merely being lacklustre. 4/10."

Sure, the island scenery is gorgeous to look at and there are plenty of pretty girls but, yikes, that first reveal of the shark is the final blow to any credibility that this movie was hoping to have.\n\nThe alternate TV version, in an attempt to make some sense of what the viewer is about to see, adds a needless voice over that only serves to make the entire premise of the movie even more absurd.\n\nThis was near the top of my bad movie list (just before MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE) but both have been displaced by Timothy Hines' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.

Plus, by his own admission, it was certainly an effective way to remind moviegoers of the dozens of excellent pictures on which he has worked. He was paid for his performance, and given his remarkable talent, he deserved it. But his natural screen presence was so utterly out of place in this vomit-inducing train wreck. Caine aside, the acting is horse manure, and the already inept cast members are not helped by a disgraceful excuse for a screenplay. A shark that singles out the relatives of the man who killed a couple of other sharks once? Where does this nonsense come from? Finally, the mud on the worm cake is Joseph Sargent's utterly by-the-numbers direction. Granted, he had so very little to work with, but he still failed, as did this movie."

She tries to unwind in the Bahamas with her oldest son Mike (Lance Guest) and a local pilot (Michael Caine). But the shark won't let her, and it comes down to a climax that, while spectacular, is also totally ludicrous, and not helped by the device of Gary having flashbacks to events in the original film she was never even a witness to.\n\nThe only thing that saves JAWS 4 from total disaster is the relatively good direction of Joseph Sargent (COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT) and Michael Small's score, which integrates John Williams' original theme. Otherwise, this revenge is a dish either best eaten cold or not eaten at all."

However, the Great-White Shark shows up again, taking younger son Sean's life and causing uneasiness to Ellen. Therefore, she wages a personal revenge mission against the shark that has caused her and her family so much grief.\n\nThe plot sounds pretty interesting but, to sum it all up in a few words, this movie is pretty boring. It is basically just mediocre drama with sub-par acting, showing the characters preaching endlessly about their livelihoods and plans on what to do with the shark, which appears in a few scenes only. There is really not much shark action or suspense until the climax of the film.\n\nOverall, it's the worst off of the Jaws movies and one you can definitely stay out of the water.\n\nGrade D--"

Of course it is a mark of a great director with huge talents, but it really didn't work out for me. I gave the original Jaws a rating 6/10, so it wasn't still that bad --- compared to its sequels. If I can remember correctly, this is the fourth and the most futile chapter in the series and yes, this is one of the most lamest movies I have ever seen. The plot is just ridiculous and the acting and the special effects were like from a movie made in 1920's. Perhaps not, but this movie is a disgrace for the movie Jaws --- even when I didn't like it, I can't deny the fact that it is a classic --- and one of the most lamest movies I've seen.. hey, did I already mention that?

Not so apparently when you see what this shark does to a banana boat looking more rubbery than a latex muppet and at a reported forty feet (!) giving way to the sheer absurd.\n\nSame old story rehashed with Lance Guest now assuming the lead role (taking up where Dennis Quaid left off in 3D), his long suffering mother (played by the original Lorraine Gary, though one wonders why she waited nine years to return for this abomination; perhaps it was the Caribbean location) hell-bent on taking revenge on the most recent predator to rip a limb off her diminishing family tree. And then there's Michael Caine playing a care-free helicopter pilot named \"Hoagie\". It's a toss-up between this turkey, \"The Swarm\", \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" or \"Blame it on Rio\" as to which is his all time worst effort. Caine dances in this film while romancing Gary, so it's a tight contest.\n\nNot an ounce of suspense or even mild shock is created by the director of \"The Taking of Pelham 123\", Joseph Sargent apparently absent from the director's chair for most of what ended up on the screen. Good to see younger and elder Van Peebles together, even if they have to share the ignominy of it being in this film. There's little to recommend, needless to say if you're a fan of the franchise, then you absolutely must see this to fully appreciate just how good the others are by comparison."

When this first starts, it seems like it might be an okay film, with interesting camera angles and direction, but it gets worse. The protagonist of this film is Brodie's wife, and she gets really annoying. This movie also houses perhaps the dumbest scene in any movie I have ever seen where the shark comes out of the water and roars. Later we hear the roar in the end credits theme song. I'm almost hoping for a Jaws 5 to redeem this piece of ...., but I'm sure it would also be bad, so let's just pretend like the last three Jaws movies didn't happen.\n\nMy rating: 1/2 out of ****. rated PG-13 for violence."

Her other son convinces her to go to the Bahamas with him and his family, to take her mind off everything. That just makes her go even more crazy, and insist the shark has targeted her family as part of some ridiculous voodoo curse.\n\nYes, you read that correctly: a voodoo curse is the reason why her family has been beset by shark attacks.\n\nVoodoo curses, revenge, drug smuggling, the return of a little-used supporting character having flashbacks to events that she was not present for, and a large plastic shark (which roars!) are all thrown into this mix, then Pur\u00e9ed in a blender, and thrown onto the screen, in one giant *splat*\n\nThis is the only Jaws film not written by Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, whether that's good or bad is open to debate.\n\nThere is a difference between fictional story writing, and insultingly stupid story writing. The makers of this thing thought that the audiences would accept, with perhaps only a minor suspension of disbelief, any story at all, no matter how ridiculous or implausible it is, as long as it has the \"Jaws\" name attached to it, and as long as someone from the original cast returned. It expects you to not only suspend your disbelief, but also requires you to be dimmer than a one- star restaurant, and pretend to not notice the footage from part I being reused at the ludicrous climax, and not question how characters miraculously return to life after being devoured by the shark. And repeatedly ignore the very obviously visible tracks the shark is \"swimming\" on. And ignore the support beams used to lift the shark into the air. And ignore an obvious miniature, which explodes for no apparent reason, and does so four times, for the film's quickly reshot alternative ending. And, is that duct tape I see, holding the body of the shark together? Supposedly a twenty million dollars budget for this, and that's the best they could do, duct tape and stock footage?\n\nThe Jaws theme is used all throughout the opening credit scene, quickly ruins its effectiveness; it is a dramatic piece, not to be used during something as mundane as the opening credits, seemingly just to remind people they are watching a Jaws film. Michael Caine's potential love interest for Lorraine Gray's character is filler material; it goes absolutely nowhere, and his character could be edited out almost completely and his absence would not even be noticed. But the same could probably be said for Gary's character, also.\n\nGood shock of the boat suddenly being attacked from underneath in the opening shark attack, one of the few memorable shots. The rest of the film is only good for lots of unintentional laughs, which is why I rated it as highly as I did.\n\nIf one doesn't include the three or four minutes long opening credits, and the four minutes long closing credits, the film's real run-time drops to about 81/ 82 minutes."

But a lot of inconsistencies and idiotic, laughable things occur in Jaws the Revenge. One of the most famous is the scene where the shark stands on its tail in the water and almost leaps onto Mrs. Brody's tiny boat. Apparently she wasn't told of her husband's quote about getting a bigger boat. Her dreams/nightmares provide her with memories of things she couldn't possibly have seen but not that one. Michael Caine brings nothing to the film, except for the novelty of the fact that he couldn't pick up his first Oscar because he was filming this movie! Lucky for him he won a second one (I think they felt sorry that he missed out for this trash film). No suspense, no horror, bad acting, horrible writing. They only green-lighted this based on the concept, you see. They thought 'Gee, we can make money with another Jaws movie. How 'bout if the shark is angry and wants revenge.'

It is also insulting to the audiences who should feel cheated and insulted at this atrocity of a movie. It should be an insult to the many actors involved in this movie, including but not limited to Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles. Steven Spielberg, director of the first movie should feel insulted considering the memory of the first movie has been stomped on but then again he has nothing to do with this movie. Peter Benchley, the author of the novel Jaws which the first movie was based on should also be insulted that this marked the death of the Jaws franchise. I should also add that this should be an insult to Universal Studios who was responsible for this, but then again somebody must have thought that this was going to be a good idea and like a cash cow, milk it for all its worth.\n\nJaws: The Revenge focuses on the now widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her family is being targeted by a great white shark following the horrific death of her deputy sheriff son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) who was killed while on duty. She becomes further paranoid when she believes a great white has followed her and her family to the Bahamas to target the remaining family members in revenge for the deaths of the sharks in the first two Jaws movies.\n\nThe tagline sums up the entire movie: \"This time it's personal\". Are you serious?! Are audiences REALLY meant to believe a great white shark is going to seek revenge on family members with its own vendetta. I'm very puzzled here. Are audiences meant to get excited about a shark targeting members of the Brody clan after Martin Brody (Roy Schneider) killed the infamous great white shark from Jaws (1975) and Jaws 2 (1978)? This is completely wrong and surely someone must have piped up during the development of the forth movie and said \"This is going to be a bad idea\" unless they were told to shut up or they decided that this was going to be a good idea. Already this movie was going to have disaster written all over it.\n\nJaws is a classic, the second movie was worth watching, and the third was an inferior movie which should have ended the Jaws series at number 3 (actually it was Jaws 3-D to capitalise of 3-D movies).\n\nJaws: The Revenge should be left to sink to the bottom of the ocean.\n\n1/10."
