        "review_detailed_main": "Although I am as old as this movie, produced in 1949, I have not aged nearly as well. This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (\"Odd Man Out\", \"The Fallen Idol\") and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.\n\nI spent a number of months in Europe after I graduated from college in 1971. Although the war had been over for more than 25 years by then, I was struck by a very pronounced attitude of cynicism on the part of many Europeans regarding uniquely American ideals and principles, which were widely considered to be naive. To me, this film accurately captures this cultural and moral conflict, which lasted for decades and may even survive to this day. \"You and your American principles,\" they would often scoff at me with mocking derision. In many ways, the character of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American who crashes into post-World War II Europe, is a victim of a serious cultural divide. Unlike the Europeans, Martins always has the option of fleeing from the chaos and returning to the United States. For that alone, he may be resented by the local Viennese.\n\nWhat does Anna (Alida Valli) know about the illegal activities of her lover, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), which includes the sale of diluted penicillin to Vienna's hospitals? For children with meningitis, watered down penicillin was not only useless, but it created an immunity from full strength penicillin so that these afflicted children could never receive effective treatment. Corrupted penicillin is a glaring symbol of a totally corrupted Vienna. Harry surely understands the consequences of his business, but what about Anna? Even after the truth about Harry's conduct is clearly revealed to her, she still sticks by him to the bitter end. Love conquers all? Stand by your man, regardless of the misery that he is causing to his innocent victims? While I don't blame her for rejecting the romantic overtures of Martins, who is somewhat of a schnook, what's with her anyway? She reminds me of the Europeans who never once caught a whiff of the burning flesh from the overworked crematoria of the concentration camps that blackened the air all around them. She is deeply in love with Harry, so just shut up about children with meningitis. OK, Anna, whatever you say, sweetheart. Perhaps those silly 18th century costume comedies in which you appear will provide the escape from reality that you so desperately seek. At least you manage to crack a weak, forced smile on stage, which is the only smile that we will ever see from you.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the unusual camera angles, the dark, somber, haunting sidewalks of Vienna, and the conquered city's eerie, drenched cobblestone streets contribute to the overall foreboding atmosphere of the film, which was remarkably photographed by Australian Robert Krasker (\"Odd Man Out\", \"Brief Encounter\"). From every direction and without advance notice, unforgettable images and characters appear before us, emphasizing an overall mood of mayhem and unpredictability. We witness, for example, Anna's landlady, draped in a bedspread for warmth in a state of deep distress by the sudden invasion of her house by \"officials\" representing not one foreign nation but four of them. Then we observe a ludicrous, bureaucratic \"cultural re-education conference\" offered to the Viennese by the allied victors, presumably to rehabilitate them after seven years of Nazi domination. And from where on earth did the balloon seller come as he pathetically peddles his merry merchandise on the dark, abandoned streets of Vienna, which are not only completely void of children at the time but of all people?\n\nAnd what of the inquisitive, confused character of Holly Martins, played with the usual, smooth agility of Joseph Cotten? As the writer of mass marketed western novels that even a young British sergeant happens to read, why is he broke, and what kind of job would Lime have offered him in an unfamiliar, German-speaking Vienna that is gripped by post-war disorder, unemployment, and foreign occupation? Construction work, perhaps?\n\nWhile some reviewers disliked the zither music of Anton Karas, I think that the unique, high pitched sound contributes to the general atmosphere of nervous tension and uneasiness that prevails. Would you prefer Strauss waltzes instead? They wouldn't be nearly as effective in conveying the overwhelming atmosphere of chaos, even insanity, that plagues Vienna on so many levels at the time.\n\nFinally, we are brought to the hidden network of grand Vienna's underground sewers. What could be a more fitting symbol of the underlying foulness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call \"civilization\"? This subterranean labyrinth provides the perfect setting for the ending of an extraordinary film that very effectively portrays a world that has succumbed to a state of disorder, misery, and even madness. Ultimately, it is all destined for the sewer. Bal-loon?"

        "review_detailed_main": "In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.\n\nBut in searching for details of Lime's death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don't add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.\n\nThe film's story is okay. But what makes \"The Third Man\" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame's geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.\n\nAll of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly's disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime's absence. In most outdoor scenes there's a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.\n\n\"Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this\", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.\n\nThe script's dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.\n\nThe film's acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the \"zither\", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.\n\nMy one complaint about this film is that it's hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.\n\n\"The Third Man\" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography."

        "review_detailed_main": "Even today in Vienna, one can take the \"Third Man Tour\" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn't go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.\n\nWestern novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.\n\nHe then meets Harry's girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it's better that he's dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.\n\nOne of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there's some brilliant dialogue, particularly the \"cuckoo clock\" speech made by Orson Welles.\n\nThe cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.\n\nOne feels Lime's presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.\n\nThough none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.\n\nThere was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero.\n\nHe's no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen."

        "review_title": "A movie ahead of its time",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.\n\nOf all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).\n\nThe cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where to begin. For starters Graham Greene. You know he understood the devastation Europe had gone through. You just can't make a film like this without it. That's what The Third Man is about - the devastation of Europe and how that affected people, both morally and physically.\n\nHolly Martins, the main character, is who's eyes we see the post-war world through as he uncovers the mystery of the death of his friend Harry.\n\nBack to Graham Greene - He wrote the novella. He writes about human misery as well as anyone. And there was no shortage of misery and lack of morals in post-war Vienna. He's also a master of conflict, both external and internal, which is where I'm going here. His characters struggle with their own souls to the point of anguish. Loss is another thing he nails.\n\nThere are a few more reasons this is the best movie ever made. The next is the editing. The chase scene at the end gets all the love but-this is going to be hard to articulate but the editing is so innovative I have to try-unlike most editors who edit based on sound and dialogue, this movie is kind of reverse. It's almost like the rhythm of the scene is dictating when to cut. It's a \"feel\" thing established either within a scene or the entire movie or both. It really has to be experienced, not just written about.\n\nThe next reason is the grandiosity of the visuals. It's unbelievable how grand everything is. This totally falls in line with Orson Welles noir style and the German expressionism that influenced this film. Carol Reed's choice of lenses throughout the film are perfect. Space is played with perfectly. This falls in line with my next reason, which is the noir style that is done so well. The mood is established and kept throughout, employing the noir and the expressionist style.\n\nAnd lastly, this movie didn't just defy convention, it obliterated it - the visuals, the sounds, the story, the locations, the style, the score (which consisted of one musical instrument), and the people; the way Carol Reed presented their despair. I'm preaching to the choir. I know you know."

Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) is Harry's girlfriend.

His camera work is amazing. The best scene for me is the balloon man. When he walks around the corner, it is the funniest and most shocking moment in the movie. Orson Welles is so tied into this movie but I don't find him threatening enough. He's more of a trickster. I would like Harry Lime to be scarier. Also Anna is an infuriating character.

Set in postwar Vienna, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to visit an old friend who had offered him a job. From there the twisty, fast paced ride begins with the first twist being thrown at you in under ten minutes. The film aged very well, and even if you don't usually watch black and white movies, this one should be made an exception. Although the movie deals with lots of dark themes such as murder, corruption, and the Black Market, it is portrayed in a comical way, especially due to the performances and unique score. The fast paced dialogue, perfectly timed music, and direction all add to the films wit and pace. There are lots of short shots, dutch angles, jump cuts to keep you engaged and you are never bored or unsatisfied. The cinematographer certainly earned his paycheck because the films cinematography is unbelievable. With each transition you are prepared for a little more of the truth and intrigue to be revealed so you can try to figure out the mystery before the ending. And may I add that the finale is one of the greatest you'll ever see. The classic sewer chase sequence will stick with you forever. In conclusion, The Third Man is a film that must be seen if you are a fan of mysteries, classics films, and interested in seeing truly one of the best films (One of Roger Ebert's top 4)."

There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed.

Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh \u2013 is anybody going over the edge?\n\nA mention must be made of the music \u2013 it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French caf\u00e9 accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror.\n\nThe story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting \u2013 we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as \u2013 it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers \u2013 a plot device that was done a year before in the better film \"He Walked By Night\" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase."

His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:\n\n\"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\"\n\nNo wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd done\u0085\n\nIt has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever \u0096 but what about his 'exit' \u0096 the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, too\u0085\n\nA beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti\u0096Hollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.\n\nAmazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had \u0096 the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose \u0096 instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place \u0096 cheerful but melancholy in the same time\u0085\n\nCriterion DVD is wonderful \u0096 the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available \u0096 British and American, and a lot of extras."

Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film.

And that twist, oh my word! That immediately sparked excitement in me for the rest of the film. The writing is excellent of course, it's no wonder the likes of Martin Scorsese have waxed lyrical about it. This is my first time seeing an Orson Welles performance and he was subtly but strikingly captivating, and Ernst Deutsch deserves a shoutout as he was intriguingly most magnificent when he wasn't even saying a word. The small nuances in his facial expressions were remarkably perfect to show his true thoughts to the audience. To end on a small negative, I found the music choice very odd, as it didn't suit the tone of this tense, dramatic story one bit. As a result, the feature as a whole felt too unserious, despite the incredibly serious nature of the events unfolding.\n\nBut overall a fantastic noir which I'd recommend not only to fans of this genre, but also to those who love a good mystery."

        "review_title": "One of the greatest British films of the Century",
        "review_detailed_main": "Carol Reed's 1949 masterpiece is a story that is perfectly presented through the medium of film. The dark post-war Vienna setting, the soundtrack and the striking cinematography all create the atmosphere of unease which is present throughout. It is a perfect example of why cinema is simply a wonderful way of storytelling as it not only uses words; but also, visuals and music to convey messages, allowing the audience truly to immerse themselves in a story.\n\n'The Third Man' is considered one of the greatest films of its era. Whilst the story and characters are very well-written, it is Robert Krasker's expressionist cinematography and Anton Karas' score that render the film so strikingly memorable. To make the death of Harry Lime far more interesting and sinister, Reed chooses to place the film in a weary and politically divided Vienna whose citizens are consequently forced into being more suspicious of the American protagonist Holly Martins, and his investigation into his friend's fate. This lends itself nicely to Krasker as his frequent use of the titled (or Dutch) angle and heavily contrasting black and white frames all reflect and add to the awry nature of the setting and the story. The external shots in the seedy neighbourhoods tend to be lit by moonlight or streetlamps which create vast looming shadows in a crumbling city, making it harder for Martins to investigate his friend's death, as every aspect of Vienna seems as if it does not want to help him. The city, therefore, is not as much a traditional location but rather a character in its own right. Nothing in this film is quite what it seems and every feature of the visual side of the film accentuates Carol Reed's intentions. It is fitting therefore, that in the twist at the end where Harry Lime reveals himself to be still alive, it turns out that he is in fact a malicious and twisted man who perverts the meaning of good and evil, putting him in conflict with his righteous old best friend.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about 'The Third Man' without mentioning its soundtrack. Like the cinematography, it is one of its most prevalent features. Anton Karas' zither provides an atmospheric score that adds an unexpected romance accompanying the menace. The music's somewhat jaunty nature, however, does not make the film seem upbeat in any way, but rather, like everything else, distorted into something that is unsettling but beautiful. The soundtrack ultimately makes the film the masterpiece that it is since it perfectly complements the dialogue and setting.\n\nReed contrasts the curious yet na\u00efve character of Holly Martins (who symbolises Hollywood America), with the much grimmer local characters forged by the War in Europe. His clean-cut and open face conflicts with the those of the hardened friends of Harry Lime. The majority are either unwilling to help or hostile towards this foreigner scouring the dark streets of Vienna as he investigates Lime's fate. Even Anna Schmidt's face is tainted with past strain and suffering, a contrast to the purity and innocence in the likes of Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn, her American contemporaries. Martins writes optimistic western novels that trivialise conflicts into good and evil, whereas the battle-weary characters of Vienna see the world in a far more cynical light. Even the setting reflects this sentiment, with the majority of the film being set in the evening or at night.\n\nIn many ways, 'The Third Man' is an unromantic observation on the effects of war on its victims. One only has to turn to Orson Welles' now infamous \"Cuckoo clock\" speech to see how Reed accentuates the true difference between the people like Lime and those like Martins. Welles' character believes that with conflict comes innovation and societal progress, compared to a country like Switzerland where \"five hundred years of democracy and peace\" has only produced \"the Cuckoo clock.\"\n\n'The Third Man' still stands up today as a masterpiece, and there is little wonder why it is widely regarded as the greatest British film of all time. Reed uses every component of filmmaking available to extraordinary effect, illustrating exactly why film is such a marvellous medium of storytelling."

Fortunately I saw it again in the Mus\u00e9e du Cin\u00e9ma at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in a much better version. Then I really thought that it was a masterpiece. Watching it now confirms that I was not wrong at the time. Looks like I still need 40 characters to be eligible with this review. So I will finish with two words: Forever Outstanding."

Although you get immersed in the action from the get-go, in the whirlpool of events there is always a place for some true romantic events, and a very melancholic spirit is felt throughout the whole movie. The old city of postwar Vienna, where the action takes place, was in my opinion a perfect place to set this kind of feeling, and it plays it's own role here.\n\nI can recommend this film (which is one of the most beautiful ever created) to everyone without any exception, but especially - to those who appreciate the feeling of aching loneliness and melancholy in cinema."

Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.\n\nThis movie owes a debt of gratitude to Graham Greene, a writer who had the most developed sense of intrigue among his contemporaries and one of the best writers of the last century. It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen. Mr. Reed was a director who had an eye for detail, as he demonstrates here, as well as in the rest of the body of work he left for us to enjoy.\n\nThe screen play is faithful to the original novel. If to all of the other elements we add the fabulous cinematography of Robert Krasker, the result has to be the masterpiece we see today. Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here. Mr. Krasker's wonderful night vision of this city enhances the story as we are taken along for a fantastic trip of the post war Vienna of 1949.\n\nThe casting of this film is amazing. Never had so many excellent actors been thrown together in a film, as it is the case as with this picture. Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Horbiger, Erich Ponto and Wilfred Hyde White are splendid in their roles. It is hard to imagine these characters played by other actors.\n\nOrson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short. This must have been one of the best roles in which Welles appeared. Of course, there are so many others, but his Harry Lime is an original and could have fitted perfectly in one of his own films.\n\nThe music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.\n\nThis film will live forever."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE THIRD MAN is an effective piece of late '40s film noir, but in my opinion is a rather overrated one, accompanied as it is by a distracting zither score that some believe is the film's crowning achievement, aside from Robert Krasker's B&W photography.\n\nJoseph Cotten gives his usual low-key performance as the pulp writer who wants to track down what really happened to his friend, Harry Limes (Orson Welles) whom he suspects has met with foul play and Valli is similarly low-key in her role as Limes' lonely sweetheart. Trevor Howard is excellent as Major Calloway who tries to help both Cotten and Valli, warning both of the dangers they face.\n\nThe B&W Oscar-winning photography of post-war Vienna is crisply detailed and shadowy in its display of virtually empty cobblestoned streets at night and the background score is unusual and sometimes even striking.\n\nBut therein lies the trouble. Not all of the famous Anton Karas zither score seems appropriate for the on screen action, although whether this is intentional or not, I don't pretend to know. For me, much of the score works against the story instead of creating the proper amount of tension in the script, as atmospheric as the Austrian music is.\n\nIf ever a story of post-war Vienna troubled by corrupt officials and black market thieves and murderers needed an orchestrated score by a Bernard Herrmann type of composer, this is it. Others have praised the zither score to the skies, but I'm of the firm opinion that \"The Third Man Theme\" itself is the high point of this particular score, effectively used every time the mysterious Orson Welles appears.\n\nHis theme became enormously popular as \"The Third Man Theme\" and deserved its success as a single--but as others have observed, the rest of the zither score becomes a bit monotonous after awhile and plays against what is happening on screen instead of deepening the emotional impact of the story. In fact, there are times when it becomes distracting and even irritating.\n\nIt's an interesting, almost semi-documentary kind of film from Carol Reed that has Welles appearing only toward the halfway point and then only briefly. He gives one of his better performances, more controlled, less florid than usual, although the film is carried chiefly by Cotten, Howard and Valli and some superb photography.\n\nThe story is told in such a cold documentary manner that there is almost an air of detachment about connecting to any of the characters we are supposed to care about. In this respect, it is Trevor Howard's Major Calloway that comes across as the most likable and fully developed character in the story.\n\nTrivia note: The kitten seen in Valli's apartment and devoted to Harry Limes is not the same creature that rubs against him in the doorway scene, an obviously older cat. How did they think a sharp-eyed movie fan would not notice??"

This is a deeply satisfying and intelligent picture to not be missed, using a considerable talent in acting, as main cast as secondary actors formed mostly by foreigner players of various countries and utilizing the cream of the cream of British experts in writing and technical departments. With a plethora of anthological images and dialogs, such as the scenes about conversation in the marry-go-round between Harry Lime and Martin, and the underground-sewers pursuits. Magnificent Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, great friends in real life ; Welles reportedly intervened in direction mainly on his scenes, though at an interview he explained that Carol Reed directed totally this outstanding movie.

After that, it's just a long and boring search for the one responsible, and a romance that never gets of.\n\nUltimately, this movie is interesting because of the camera work and the atmosphere, but in terms of story it's a huge disappointment.

It's very far from being one of the best ever, being clearly far more praised than it really deserves. Not even the fact that it takes place in Vienna can save it.

The feel of desperation in post-war Vienna is everywhere, the stunning B&W cinematography is flawless, and the acting is top shelf. I did find the pacing at times to be a little slow, and there wasn't the degree of suspense that I was hoping for, but neither of these detract from this Carol Reed / Graham Greene film noir masterpiece.\n\nJoseph Cotton is stellar as a hack American author turned sleuth, and Alida Valli shines as the love interest of Cotton's newly deceased friend, Harry Lime (played to perfection by Orson Welles). Since Welles was listed as a main star, we knew he had to turn up eventually... I thought it'd be in a series of flashbacks, but not so.\n\nThe story is good, but this film should be seen and appreciated for the visuals and on-screen depiction of a post-war Europe at the onset of the Cold War. In this regard, it is unparalleled."

In a way, I guess I should be thankful for having the opportunity to enjoy a work that clearly remains a masterful production. However, weaknesses in the writing seriously undermined my enjoyment of the experience. From the moment Holly Martins gave away the identity of a witness, leading very unsurprisingly to the murder of the porter, I knew the script would be either naive or just dumb. To name another flaw, the romance (or more accurately, romantic feelings) between the two leads were matter-of-factly and serves the plot rather than being realistic. Sure, the movie was from a very different era, but I've seen other classic films, and I don't think people were that dumb. Overall, the techniques were quite wonderful and yes, extraordinary, but the script was underwhelming, to say the very least."

The film's strongpoints however, lie not only in the more abstract but also in the cast featuring Joseph Cotten, Valli, Trevor Howard(among others) and Graham Greene's script which both lead us towards the final and most memorable aspect-Orson Welles.\n\nEven Greene admitted the best scene was the ferris wheel one which he didn't even write; Welles did. Though only a bit part Orson Welles brings all his charm, skill and (to use an overused word) genius to the role of Harry Lime and creates not just the highlight of this film but one of the most iconic moments in all of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"I never knew the old Vienna before the war, with its Strauss music, its glamour and easy charm. I really got to know it in the classic period of the black market.\"\n\nAnd with that brilliant opening voice over narration we are introduced to this landmark film, which in my opinion outdoes the Germans in its Expressionism. I've fallen in love with Carol Reed's masterpiece, The Third Man, which takes elements from classic film noir and German expressionism creating a timeless classic. To say this is the best British film of all time is an understatement, because it deserves to be considered amongst the very best the world has offered. Everything about this film is perfection, from the opening setting of the plot, to the iconic zither score by Anton Karas that accompanies it (which not in a million years I would've consider to fit this thriller, but it does), to the memorable Ferris wheel scene where Orson Welles delivers his famous \"cuckoo clock\" speech, to Orson Welles's spectacular entrance scene (the best in film history), to the spectacular chase scene through the sewers of Vienna, to the uncountable amount of Dutch angle shots that help build the tense atmosphere accompanied by an unprecedented visual aesthetic from cinematographer Robert Krasker who turns the evocative shadows into a character in this film, to Graham Greene's fantastic screenplay delivering on every twist, to the final long shot that ends the film in a magnificent and memorable way only adding to the romantic fatalism theme of the story. Every single decision made during the production of this film, even those they came across by chance, seems to have worked to perfection. This is not a case where you can say it's style over substance or vice versa, it's one of those rare films where style and substance come together to deliver a perfect visual aesthetic and an intriguing theme with memorable character.\n\nThe opening narration introduces us to postwar Vienna, a city of bombed buildings and piles of rubble that has been divided into four occupied zones by the victorious allies (British, American, Russian and French). It is a place where opportunists and racketeers have come to make a living in its widespread black market. This is where Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American pulp novelist, enters the scene. He is broke, but has been invited by Harry Lime, a good old friend from his school days, to stay with him in Vienna. Upon his arrival, Holly discovers that Harry has been killed in a traffic accident. Being the mystery novelist that he is, Holly begins to talk to some of Harry's friends who witnessed his accident and discovers some inconsistencies in their stories. He reports these suspicions to Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard), the man in charge of the investigation, but he quickly dismisses him and says he should return home. The Major believes it is best that Harry has died since he was a racketeer who caused many innocent deaths. Holly however becomes intrigued with the case after the porter of Harry's building (Paul Horbiger) tells him there was a third man involved in the scene, but who no one else accounts for. Holly also befriends and falls for Anna (Alida Valli), Harry's lover who had immigrated from Czechoslovakia, which gives him another reason to stay for a few more days to try to uncover the mystery of his friend's untimely death.\n\nThe film is so visually stunning (it's only Oscar win was for best cinematography) that at times people forget to mention how great Graham Greene's script actually is. He understood this post-war European world and how the black market worked because he himself was a former British spy. That is what makes the story so believable and gives the film its substance. Of course the style is what turns this into a landmark film with its clever shots playing with Dutch angles, lights, smokes, and shadows, its wonderful editing, and its amazing score, but the film has a great plot to go along with it as well as some solid performances. Joseph Cotten delivers a solid role as the lead hero who comes into this world as a naive child believing everything is black and white. He is flawed, he is a drunk who falls in love way too easy. Harry's friends all have faces who at least look very suspicious (Siegfried Breuer as Popescu and Erich Ponto as Dr. Winkel). And then there is Orson Welles himself who with less than 15 minutes of screen time steals the movie. He could've done so with his iconic entrance alone (delivering a perfect smile), which was gorgeously lighted, but he also delivers one of the most memorable quotes of the film as well. Alida Valli also delivers as the femme in this film and it all leads to an exciting finale. For all these reasons and many more which I've failed to put into words, I can affirm that The Third Man is a masterpiece. Let me end this review by citing Orson Welles's memorable speech:\n\n\"Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.\"\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Every detail is perfect too. Many are unrepeatable. We will never see bombed out Vienna again, and certainly not like Carol Reed showed it. Then there is Holly Martins, the pulp fiction writer in a pulp fiction noir movie written by Graham Greene, and Orson Welles with the best entrance in the history of movies and just one scene where he talks, but he talks for eternity. And it goes on and on, but I've reached my ten lines. They don't make them like they used to..."

Even in the minor roles, Bernard Lee and Wilfred Hyde-White provide some ofthe best comic relief I've seen. And, of course, Orson Welles, in surely the greatest cameo performance ever - full of irresistible charm while dripping with evil.\n\nAnd yet, the whole is actually GREATER than the considerable sum of its parts. This film is touched with rare magic - something you can't quite put your finger on, but is there all the same. Every single scene is magnificent; the timing and pacing are absolute perfection. And, just when you think you've seen it all, there's that final scene....."

The actual ride takes about the same ammount of time that it took in the film,roughly about 15 minutes. Being that the city has been almost completely rebuilt since the film was shot there, the doorway where Orson Wells (Harry Lyme) appears is no longer in existence. Wonderful nostalgia for a wonderful, unforgettable film."

I love classic films, but much about this one doesn't appeal to my personal tastes. For example, I have a hard time warming up to Joseph Cotten as a leading man. For me, he spoils Hitchcock's brilliant \"Shadow of a Doubt\" and I could do without him in \"Citizen Kane.\" Alida Valli is a fine actress, but her close resemblance to Karen Black prevents me from finding her attractive. The incessant zither music quickly wears out its welcome, as do the overused tilted camera angles of people running through empty streets and sewers. With that said, I was finally able to focus and understand what was going on. The mystery, for all its sound and fury, signifies not much. Even Orson Welles's fifteen minutes of screen time is redundant. I do admire the craftsmanship of this film and can see why some people love it, but I feel the whole experience is rather dissatisfying. Watching it feels more like a highly demanding chore rather than a pleasure."

The performances by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton are quite good, as is the zither music on the soundtrack, but overall it's an exasperating movie, full of promising scenes that don't quite take shape and have no pay-off. Alfred Hitchcock was a bit more playful with his stories; this one could have stood some hearty relief. **1/2 from ****"

What I like a lot is that there is no neat or even very poetic ending. Events transpire in a naturalistic fashion full of all the frustrations, disappointments, and unfulfilled expectations that make up life for so many people as they often fruitlessly struggle for some sort of contentment. My only quibble is that the soundtrack is somewhat overrated but that is only my individual opinion. Still a true classic, the film, and our first look at Lime, 9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "As you watch The Third Man, you are slowly sucked into the word of past war Austria. You can almost taste the wet stones that line the streets and you feel just as alone as Holly Martins does. Holly has come to Austria at the request of his boyhood friend, Harry Lime. Upon arriving in Austria, Holly learns that Harry has been killed. As Holly digs deeper into Harry's life in Austria, things start to get weird. Turns out Harry wasn't all that Holly thought he was. That only drives Holly to find out what really happened to Harry, and who the mysterious Third Man is. The Third Man not only showcases great performances from Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles, but it also boasts great black and white cinematography. Shadows abound from every corner and the angles give you a feeling of being off balance, which is how Joseph Cotton feels through the first half of the film. Post war Austria lends itself well to the story. The bombed out buildings and dark streets highten the mystery and danger that lurk in the corners. A great film that can never be topped, and once you've finished the film, you'll be in a dither over the zither."

        "review_detailed_main": "The life of the avid film-goer can actually be a depressing, disillusioning thing. After the initial gleeful devouring of the canon (about 300 movies), and the joyous stumbling over the odd undiscovered gem, the cineaste must be content with an endless trail of largely diminishing returns. The only counter against this is brilliant films which never disappoint on the 18th viewing, such as Vertigo, The Wizard Of Oz, The Wild Bunch... ...and The Third Man, a film containing such multitudes that it makes you forget that the majority of British cinema is parochial, unambitious, self-satisfied rubbish. A great film is by definition a labyrinth: whatever your mood, be it emotional or intellectual, you pick up a new thread of interpretation, and find yourself in places you've never been before, yet by the end, everything still doesn't quite fit, and you have to begin again. And you know that there is nothing in the world you want to do more.\n\nThis time around, I noted the theme of authority and authoriality. Authors write books, and have total control over their characters and narrative. Authorities (less obviously) have the same power over the people they govern. These two concepts make up the film's two quests, which in reality is only one. Our hero, Holly Martins, is a novelist, who continually claims that he will write the story he is actually participating in. Calloway is the authority (as morally detached as any modern writer) with the similar quest to find Harry Lime. And yet it is Harry who is the real author of the plot: everything happens to his plan, his power is otherworldly - he is truly godlike, without body (being dead). When we finally do see him, he is lit like a devil, or surveying Vienna like a deity. The opening credits show us a zither playing a tune, but we don't see who's playing it. And who is the jovial black marketeer, who narrates the opening montage, and then vanishes from the film? When Harry dies, the story ends, reaches the deadlock of the astonishingly, bravely bleak closing scene.\n\nThe Third Man is that rare film - perfect in every way, a popular narrative entertainment capable of holding great moral, artistic, philosophical, but most importantly, emotional weight. Joseph Cotten gives the greatest male lead performance in all cinema, yet it is Orson Welles, as the story's author, whose boyish charm, and weary, nihilistic evil must drive the film, even in his absence.\n\nThe movie is incredibly bleak - about people, about art, but it doesn't seem that way. The whole thing plays like a Nabokovian black comedy (Harry Lime IS Humbert Humbert) - genuine terror frequently slips into farce, and vice versa. The smooth, coherent narrative is always disrupted by non-sequiters and wild goose chases. Karas' score prefigures those of Morricone's spaghetti westerns, in his use of music not as a subliminal dramatic accompaniment, but as an ironic Brechtian commentator on the action, yet also sympathetic and yearning. Vienna is filmed as a sunken ship. Like Lolita, the film is obsessed by doubles (Holly and Harry, Holly and Calloway etc.), but, also like Lolita, this doubling is parodied, and there is no hope in resolution. The closure of the 'male' detective story is confounded by the hero's lack of progress in the romantic plot. Despite the film's cynicism, I was in tears when it ended, my ethics torn to shreds. I love The Third Man, and have so much to say about it (I love the demonisation of children - South Park is spiritually indebted to Greene)I could write a book. Do yourself one favour in your life and watch it; you'll never have to fall in love again. Incidentally, is Harry gay?"

        "review_title": "A Movie That \"thinks in terms of human beings\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "The negatives of this movie must be blinding! \"The Third Man\" is as dark as it gets. It is a very interesting experiment in Modernism. Up is down and down is up. \"You've got everything upside down,\" one character says to another and in those five words we have the motivating idea of the movie. And, closely related, is the breakdown of the hero concept. \"The world doesn't make heroes,\" Orson Welles says. Nevertheless, with an arguable amount of success, Holly Martins tries to be one. This is part of what keeps \"The Third Man\" from being completely bleak. Holly Martins search for \"the truth\" looks forward to that of Frank Bigelow, the protagonist of the next year's Noir classic \"D.O.A.\" Both men are sent hither and thither (amidst environments that range from the indifferent to the down-right unfriendly) to retrace the details of a crime whose trail of clue's is quickly growing cold.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous aspects of the movie is the heavy use of canted camera angles. Usually, camera techniques are lost on the average viewer, but you can't miss it in this one. The average conversation bounces back between two characters, one with a thirty degree tilt to the left and the other with a thirty degree tilt to the right. Simple but effective.\n\nAnd you can't miss that ubiquitous zither music. Annoying: yes. To be sure. But, the fact that it doesn't really seem to ever fit the images gives \"The Third Man\" a surreal, exotic feel. Nevertheless, I still think they could've gotten the feel and spared us a few of those annoying, manic tunes.\n\nFinally, Orson Welles, of course, is great. His two most memorable scenes are the one with the kitten in the doorway and the ferris wheel scene. In his first shot, Orson's cherubic, mischievous visage lets us know immediately the plot is getting thicker than a Sequoia.\n\nOn the ferris wheel, Orson perfectly embodies that villainous archetype: the Rotten Bad Guy with the Great Lines. Here he voices an idea that (while interesting, has been taken way too seriously): \"Nobody thinks in terms of human beings. Governments don't. Why should we?\" And Cotton's response (through the rest of the movie): \"Well, I don't really know but I will anyway.\" This is the response (never actually verbalized) that motivates every anti-hero hero from Sam Marlowe to Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman's character in Se7en). Good answer!"

Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly\".\n\nThe Third Man is about Harry Lime who has died in a car accident. Previously he had invited one of his closest friends to join him. His friend now must find out if the story is true and the mystery behind it.\n\nThe Third Man or best known has Orson Welles second best movie with Citizen Kane still at number 1. This time Carol Reed takes the directing chair and not Orson Welles but I got to be honest here I actually thought that Orson Welles directed this movie just by the way it was shot and acted it looked like his kind of film, because while watching the movie I didn't do any research on the film so I just watch the movie without nothing about the film and while watching the movie I was wounding if Orson Welles directed it's not until the end credits when I find out that Carol Reed directed it. Orson Welles and Carol Reed are both genius when it comes to movies and The Third Man isn't anything different as this is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nCarol Reed directing in this movie is absolutely magnificent and pure cinema gold. At times I felt like I was watching a Orson Welles movie just by the way it was shot and how it was acted and how it was executed made it feel like another great movies all together in one. Carol Reed was a fantastic director for this movie as he made a brilliant mystery thriller like The Third Man. Nice work Carol Reed.\n\nThe movie has this gloomy but yet a wide cinematic feeling to it that made this movie truly special then it is. With every shot in this movie that's both stunning and dazzling to my eyes. The famous scene in the sewers with that ionic image of Orson Welles is cinematography at it's best. Excellent work Robert Krasker the Cinematography of the movie.\n\nJoseph Cotten and Orson Welles both did a outstanding performance in this movie and so did everyone else in the film. Everyone in the movie delivered so much to they characters and to be honest I didn't find anyone else in the movie that did a terrible job. You can tell while watching the movie that these actors put a lot into they characters and it paid off brilliantly.\n\nNow for the problems that I had with this movie: I honestly didn't find a single thing that was a problem to me or even a flaw in this movie. You could say that it might be perfect, do I think it's perfect? well yeah, I do.\n\nOverall The Third Man is a movie that's absolutely worth checking out. These some other things in the movie that I could have brought up but to be honest and I do bring this up a lot and for good reasons. I want you the viewer to watch this movie like I did by not knowing much about the movie but only knowing the praise the movie got, I'm telling you to do this so you can experience what I experience. The Third Man is a classic at it's best."

By the time the film started I absolutely hated the music, it was driving me insane - so it took me a week to watch the video!\n\nWelles is competent - and definitely has that streak that made Kane such a compelling character - as the smuggler come drug thief in this tale of post war Vienna, but this film just didn't grab me as being anything special at any time."

That is to say, the unsettling effect produced by the camera's tilt off the vertical axis that nicely reinforces the notion that 'nothing and no one is who he seems'.\n\nThe not so good: whatever noir value this had has long since been superseded and bettered (the concept of \"noir\" was named by the French after a series of crime novels published with black covers, and would refer to authors such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett). This movie worked at the beginning of the Cold War, because of the audience's recognition of new political complexities, and especially the growing influence of espionage and Orwellian disinformation.\n\nBut not any more. What we get is a hack actor carrying the role of a hack writer in a foreign city whence so much art and culture originated. And Reed is just as uncultured as Cotten when it comes to handling the locals. It's as if the cinematic touches and the world which they reflect don't match at all.\n\nWelles and Howard can hold up their end no sweat, but that's not enough to carry this today. \"Foreign Correspondent\" and \"The Big Clock\" have more staying power. See this for its historical value, only."

Well, this one did.\n\n2) The lead female actress Alida Vali, born in 1921, was christened with the greatest name of any actress: Alida Maria Laura Altenberger, Baroness of Marckenstein-Frauenberg of the Holy Roman Empire of The German Nation. Now that is a name.\n\n3) In a drama, I can't think of a better match of music to a movie. The zither playing of Anton Karas is the only music in the movie and \"The Third Man\" or \"Harry Lime Theme\" song he wrote was the Number One hit in the US for 11 weeks on Billboard Charts and for 13 weeks in Great Britain.

The third man is the film which is set located in the city who did not recover from the Second World War and the Allied occupation forces have the main say. Extremely impressive are authentic locations of devastated city, great photos, scenery and noir style. The atmosphere skillfully shows us all the anxiety caused by the beginnings of the Cold War. All this in a movie about two friends, who do not seem to know much about each other. They love the same woman.\n\nThe bottom line is finding. The novelty is the black market. The element that has stepped up the plot. The problem is in man, not in situations. The story boils down to the suspicious death of a good friend which remains unsolved case of the third man. From that moment all the skilled thriller game between tension and climax. Very good dialogue accompanies even better humor that pervades between light joke to the grisly interruption.\n\nIt is simply amazing to see well-constructed script in the complex drama. Despite the fact that after all the acts is calculated and well designed, the voltage is present. Of course, there those hasty turnaround, but when all is summed up would be superfluous.\n\nThe acting is pretty good.\n\nJoseph Cotten as Holly Martins is in a double error. Friendship and romance. Alida Valli as Anna Schmidt is a good girl who chooses between the living and the \"dead\" man. The fact is that she runs away or just passing. Trevor Howard as Major Calloway is a British police major who with a lot of experience leading the investigation. The protagonist who took advantage of misleading in that they hoped the main characters. Orson Welles as Harry Lime is a treacherous criminal, friend and lover, who in the darkness shows the shadow of the third man.\n\nI'm just thrilled. In the last sentence I will boast of great music. Rhythmic, creepy, sad, provocative ... different and excellent."

        "review_detailed_main": "Filmed as though the camera had one tripod leg shorter than the others, along with zithers, seductive shadows, echoing sewers, ferris wheels, cuckoo clocks and a magician's touch, this film is more of an experience than a movie. Impossible to remake, it also captures Vienna at a critical time just after WW2 when it was still occupied by the Allied powers.\n\nEven after 55 years, \"The Third Man\" has a compelling story, superb performances and enough style for ten films.\n\nAnd that story by Graham Greene stands up even when compared with all the brilliant mystery films over the intervening decades as well as literate crime series on TV such as \"Lewis\", \"Wallander\" and \"Vera\" etc.\n\nHolly Martins (Joseph Cotton), a rather nerdy, and slightly annoying writer of paperback westerns, arrives in post-war Vienna to discover that his good friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has supposedly been killed in an accident. He encounters suspicious British policemen (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), and also Harry's enigmatic and beautiful girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli). Eventually Holly learns things about Harry that trouble him deeply. It all leads to a confrontation in the cavernous sewers under Vienna.\n\nThe film also features one of the most unexpected endings ever. I won't spoil it in case one of the five people who haven't seen the film happens to read this.\n\nSuffice to say that the original script had a more conventional ending and it was actually David O Selznick who came up with the one used in the film. It was always assumed that it was director Carol Reed's, but Charles Drazin in his fascinating book \"In Search of the Third Man\" pretty well pins it down to Selznick, who attempted to interfere with the whole production. Although ostensibly a British film, Selznick had money in it with Alexander Korda - before the inevitable falling-out.\n\nThere is so much to observe and enjoy including Orson Welles' famous monologue, and the stunning Alida Valli. She was so beautiful, \"head-swivelingly beautiful\" as Martin Scorsese once said. Even the shapeless raincoat she wears for most of the film only makes those luminous features even more striking. She had already made a couple of Hollywood movies including Hitchcock's \"The Paradine Case\", another film where her mystique is caught if a little chillingly, and she wasn't even a Hitchcock blonde.\n\nCarol Reed went on to make other movies including \"The Man Between\", which tried to recapture the spirit of \"The Third Man\", this time set in Berlin. It even foreshadowed \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\", but it didn't have that self-contained, indefinable magic of \"The Third Man\". Maybe it's only one true masterpiece per customer, although Reed's batting average was always strong.\n\nWhatever the case, \"The Third Man\" has lost none of its lustre and more than lives up to its reputation. I'd have to say it's a desert island disc for me."

After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.\n\nTo me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.\n\nIn addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.\n\nThe visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy"

The awkward music draws the passion and darkness out of every scene it appears in, ruining some fairly good performances. Thankfully, the score is fairly minimal.\n\nLesson: Low budget? If you must have only one instrument, pick a piano, not a zither, to orchestrate your film. Or spend a little more money on the score....\n\nThere is also some emotional confusion in this film. Harry Lime, we are lead to believe, is a sleezeball worthy of death. However, he managed to win the love, and loyalty, of a beautiful woman of character and the lifelong friendship, and loyalty (he tried to find out who murdered Lime) of another fairly good guy.\n\nSleezeballs worthy of death don't earn the loyalty of people like that. They earn the 'loyalty' of other sleezeballs.\n\nSo, you wonder, is he really a sleezeball or a hero up to something important just masquerading as a sleezeball? You don't really know until the end of the movie. This leads to confusion, not suspense."

I particularly like two things about the film: One is the post-WW II venue, which contributes to the story's intrigue as well as providing historical, cultural, and scenic value. Another is the fact that the story is not as predictable as the viewer might expect. Those of us who critique every film we see always will find something--however minor--to criticize, but this film is well done in every respect. It's a definite classic, one that belongs in every film buff's library. I prefer the British version to the American, just because it's the original, but either way it's hard to go wrong on The Third Man."

Joseph Cotten is Holly Martins an American writer of westerns who comes to Vienna to see his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles.) He's informed that Lime had just been run down in a strange automobile accident and is dead. In talking with people about the accident he discovers that their stories don't match. He meets Anna, Harry's girlfriend (the beautiful Alida Valli) and starts to fall for her. The British police are also quite interested in the circumstances of Lime's death and want to know more Martin's relationship with him. Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard) calls in Martin for questioning and sends Sgt. Paine (Bernard Lee -- M from the James Bond films) to keep an eye on him. This movie is multi-leveled with the surface level story about Lime's death and underneath about what post-war Vienna was like. Director Reed won an Oscar. From a story by Graham Greene. Ranked #57 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list."

I had heard from many reliable sources that the film was good and I had seen it ranking highly in many 100 Greatest Films lists. I was expecting a great film. I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThis is a classic piece of cinema. Brilliantly written by Graham Greene, the film presents the challenges of friendship and the weight brought to bear on people by the callousness and selfishness of others. Carol Reed's direction is outstanding and when his efforts are combined with those of Robert Krasker, the cinematographer, the films is produced with an exquisite look and feel. The moody lighting and breathtaking use of angles lend the film a superb brilliance in its look. Anton Karas compositions for the film and his use of the Zither are fantastic and give a wonderful second layer to the piece.\n\nThe story, all though slightly slow to get into, is compellingly brilliant and its characters are brilliantly performed by the cast. Joseph Cotten is fantastic whilst his support from the wonderfully charming Orson Welles and the fantastically subtle Trevor Howard is delicious. Bernard Lee also shines in what is only a minor cameo.\n\nThere isn't much more to say as the film is quite simply a sumptuous piece of cinema, brilliantly constructed. It must truly be one of the all time greats."

Recently i've been catching up on a lot of old films (Hitchcock, Boggart, Cagney, old musicals etc.) and due to their age even the great films date, thats in someways part of the charm a different style of dialogue and film making than todays films. But watching this film with the exception of the picture quality (i was watching and old VHS version) this film really could have been made yesterday. I just can't believe it was made back in the 40's it just seems so modern, i'm sure many of the techniques used are still being copied today.\n\nAs has often been noted Welles is superb as Harry Lime and the cuckoo clock speech must go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. In some ways his performance as Lime even outdoes his role in Citizen Caine as he dominates the film with so little screen time. But the real star of the show is the depiction of a war ravaged Vienna all menace and shadow. The supporting cast are all superb and the musical score is one of the most memorable i've heard.\n\nOne thing to note is how shocking this film must have been back only four years after world war II had ended. It's easy now to look back on this as a historical piece yet these characters were representative of real people at the time.\n\nI can't recommend this film enough, if you in anyway love film you should see this. It's not an ageing classic, its a truly timeless masterpiece.\n\nRating 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not one to rave about \"glorious black and white\" cinematography. Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (but NOT colorized). However, there are exceptions. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the \"Movietone\" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium. And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white. It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color. Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.\n\nIt's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII. The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops. There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market. Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote. And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect. From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.\n\nBut The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody. The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around. The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling. The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.\n\nThis is a great film because almost everything was done right. The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches. I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen. Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.\n\nThis is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there. But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil. Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own. It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end. But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe. There is in this film no compromise with that truth.\n\nSee this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)"

        "review_detailed_main": "While I regard the \"Third Man\" as artistic, very strongly so, in the sense of being \"minimally graphically depicted, filled with memorable images and intelligently photographed,I disagree,for many reasons, with calling it more than very good. I review the film here because its artistic successes have been much imitated, as have elements of its storyline. The story of \"The Third Man\" can be stated simply. \"A writer of genre westerns travels to Vienna to find his boyhood friend Harry Lime, at Lime's request. He discovers the man has recently died, a fact attested by several of Lime's friends. The local occupation force's leader, whom he seeks out to ask about the death, warns him to stay away from the case, that Lime was a thoroughly bad sort. Deciding to investigate the death and perhaps clear his friend's name, or at least prove the authorities were wrong about Lime, the writer becomes involved with Lime's girl friend, finds rumors of Lime's death were exaggerated, then must face a final crisis--what to do about the man.\" Acting in the film is decidedly uneven, I assert. As the writer, Joseph Cotten captures the man's psyche but he does not sound like a writer of westerns. As Lime, Orson Welles is understated, quirky, powerful at times and generally perhaps believable. Trevor Howard as the head of the authorities is not as strong as he soon will be in a series of 1950s triumphs, while Alida Valli as the girlfriend seems the best feature of the film, visually and professionally. Unfortunately, owing to the noir nature of the writer's central role--he cannot ask the police for help, since he is ignoring their assessment of Lime's bad character--and to his being a stranger in Vienna, the characters he meets remain intelligently defined but on the adventure level of types and acquaintances. Even Lime's friends cannot be individuated; so that the best scenes in the film, by my standards, occur when Cotten or Valli has something specific to do--she being questioned by police or he by literary overly-intellectual zealots, he chasing after her, or she telling him he does not understand his old friend. Lime ,at one point, revealing himself to the man he had sent for, defends his action in committing black market crimes; he famously likens the people (whose lives he is destroying) to \"ants\" he is stepping on, which is what people glimpsed from the top of a Ferris Wheel upon which he and the writer are riding look like from that remove.. The motive for Lime's needing to disappear after being found out as the perpetrator of a deadly dangerous fraud seems more real to the viewer, I claim, than does his idea that he might get away with such a crime for any length of time. This I found to be quite unconvincing. And it goes to the heart of three matters--why Lime sent for his old friend, what he thought he was doing and how convincing is the entire plot. But the shadow-haunted, textured B/W quality of the scenes filmed, the over-used but generally splendid Anton Karas' zither accompaniment and the artistry with which director Carol Reed has presented his story are the triumphs of the project. Credit for the artfulness belongs to cinematographer Robert Krasker, set decorator Darion Simoni, assistant director Guy Hamilton and others such as art director Joseph Bata, Ferdinand Bellan, Vincent Korda, John Haworth and James Sawyer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is there any greater entrance in cinema history than Orson Welles's in this movie? His character, Harry Lyme, supposedly dead, is hiding in a dark doorway. His American friend, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who came to Vienna to see Lyme and instead has gotten wrapped up in trying to solve the mystery of his death, is looking toward the doorway at the figure in shadow. Suddenly, someone in an upstairs apartment across the way turns their light on, which shines directly on Harry's face, revealing him to his friend. The look Welles gives at that moment was singlehandedly deserving of an Academy Award. With just a faint smirk on his lips, a twinkle in his eye, and not one single word of dialogue, he manages to say \"hello\" to his friend, apologize for lying to him, and invite Holly in on what Harry seems to think is a great big joke. When people talk about those classic moments in films, they're talking about moments like this.\n\n\"The Third Man\" is like a Graham Greene novel come to life, and not surprisingly, since Greene wrote the screenplay. But it catches the tone of a Greene novel in a way no adaptation of any of his stories has ever been able to do. Many people will call \"The Third Man\" a film noir, but it's not really. It's got noirish elements, but underneath the seriousness of the storyline, there's a tremendous sense of fun that is unique to Greene's style of storytelling. He's out primarily to entertain you, but if he makes you think a little bit along the way, that's o.k. too.\n\nThe atmosphere of post-WWII Vienna is brought to vivid life with lots of location shooting amid bombed out buildings and rubble. This movie has some of the best black and white cinematography ever, shown to best advantage in the breathless race through the sewers at the film's climax. And of course, there's that glorious zither theme that recurs throughout the movie, which adds much to the funhouse tone of the film.\n\nThe performances are flawless. Welles is great as mentioned. Cotten has almost never been better. Trevor Howard is urbane and witty and Wilfrid Hyde-White (you'll know him as Pickering in the film version of \"My Fair Lady\") is a hoot as a dotty Englishman (when he finds out that Holly came to Vienna to meet a friend who has shown up dead, his response is \"I say, that's rather awkward.\") Only Alida Valli disappoints. She's a vapid actress who delivers everything in a boring monotone, but in this case her acting style fits the character she's playing so well that it doesn't hurt the film.\n\nA fantastic film that I can watch again and again. Heartily recommended.\n\nGrade: A+"

All in all, worth a look if you like classics.\n\nOne minor note, I recently watched Porter's \"Laura\" for a film class and this movie, which came out 4 or 5 years after \"The Third Man\" is clearly inspired somewhat by this one. A great B-movie that should have been A-list, check out \"Laura\" if you like \"The Third Man\" or vice versa."

The motivations of many of the characters are dubious at best, such as the appearance of the Third Man. Orson Welles did fine, but the role is not as legendary and epic as we are lead to believe. Not seeing this film will not make one any less of a film connoisseur.\n\nThe camera-work, shadows, and atmosphere are to be commended. The actors other than Joseph Cotten are very good. Overall, it makes for a \"so-so\" film by today's standards. Some older films created tension quite well, but this film simply doesn't, which is probably a prerequisite for a thriller to succeed, no?"

        "review_detailed_main": "This film would be on my top ten list of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It established British director Carol Reed as a director of international repute. He already had a long string of excellent movies to his credit. \"Stars Look Down,\" \"Odd Man Out,\" and \"Fallen Idol\" are among the best British films of the 1940's. Unfortunately, though he made other good films after \"The Third Man,\" none matched the skill and daring innovations of his masterpiece. Based on a story by Graham Greene, Alexander Korda, Welles, and Reed with the screenplay by Greene, \"The Third Man\" gets its energy and style mainly from two sources, Carol Reed's masterful direction and Orson Welles' stunning portrayal of the central character Harry Lime. Unfortunately, the gifted actor Joseph Cotten must play second fiddle to Welles and is not allowed to shine the way he was in Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" Actually the second best performance in the film is by Alida Valli who plays the vivacious Anna who continues to love Lime even after discovering that he is a despicable character responsible for hundreds of deaths and abnormalities. She never sees beyond the good times she had with him. The cat is used not only to identify Lime but also to point out that the animal loved him and he loved the animal, whereas Holly Martins (Cotten) almost kicks a dog and is bitten by a parrot, indicating that Holly is not all good and Lime is not all bad. Also, note what Holly does to his erstwhile friend Lime at the end of the movie. Maybe Lime was good earlier but the war turned him into a murderous cynic. The famous meeting between Holly and Lime at the amusement park shows Lime to be a sociopath who loves no one but himself. He uses false analogies and fallacious reasoning to justify his nefarious activities. With the use of his eyes and facial expressions, Welles makes Lime into an incarnation of the devil himself. Yet during the chase in the sewer Welles facial expressions show a kinder, gentler side to the alleged monster. Many times international criminals such as drug dealers close their eyes to the end results of their heinous trade just as Lime does in an attempt to justify their vicious crimes. Sometimes the media makes heroes out of the likes of Harry Lime. When Harry Lime is trapped he tries to escape through a gutter. His fingers are shown feeling the freedom above that is not to be his, another indication that perhaps Lime was once a different person in character and morals but now he belongs to the sewers that flow into the blue Danube.\n\nOne striking feature of \"The Third Man\" is the shadowy forlorn photography of the streets of post-war Vienna, now an occupied closed city. Robert Krasker's photography abetted by Carol Reed's direction reminds the viewer of the magnificent photography by Gregg Toland in John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" Toland under Ford's guiding hand shows dust blowing over the shadows of the Oklahoma dispossessed, no longer the men and women they once were. So in \"The Third Man\" leaves are falling from the trees and are shown blowing in the wind, a reminder that post-war Europe is in shambles and history has moved westward. The lives of the people who reside in Vienna are also like the leaves blowing in the desolate deserted streets of the city that was once the cultural center of the universe where artists such as Mozart performed masterpieces.\n\nAnother striking feature of \"The Third Man\" is the unforgettable zither music played and written by Anton Karas. This haunting piece became a best selling record and would be recorded over and over for a decade. Even with the advent of rock 'n' roll and hip hop, \"The Third Man Theme\" has lost none of its relevancy. It fits in so well with the photography and story of \"The Third Man.\"\n\nThe final scene will remain in one's mind long after the projector stops running. It is not the ending most viewers would like but it is the only ending possible."

The Third Man quietly shows Orson's ego trip how it should be done ( and so for that matter does A Touch Of Evil ). Robert Krasker's sublime camera work is still to be marvelled at, including,as it does, some of cinema's most unforgettable images.The lighting on this film is just sheer poetry;shapes,shadows and style. The opening titles with Anton Karas' zither music sets the scene for the masterpiece that follows,from the opening line of \" I never knew the old Vienna...\" to the heartbreaking final two minute scene when the beautiful Alida Valli silently walks past Joseph Cotten in the cemetery while the zither music winds up the tension like a clock spring. There is just no excuse not to reach for the kleenex and have a good weep. There is nothing in this film that can be improved. The script is packed with great lines, the cast ( of mostly obscure international bit-part actors )aren't allowed to detract from the power of the film. The direction is so tight that in places it seems as though the scenes are being ad-libbed. Orson Welles has been justifiably credited for his mesmeric performance as Harry Lime, his first appearance as the window light crosses his face as he stands in the shadow of a doorway still makes the hair stand on my neck. There is no comparable scene in all of cinema. It is a brilliant moment that has been imitated but never bettered. If you have never seen this film you are missing out on what is an object lesson in perfection, every child should watch this film instead of Star Wars."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another gap finally filled in my viewing catalog! The mood and setting is almost everything in this classic of American writer Cotten tracing his childhood friend Welles in post-WW2 Vienna, with a wrap-up no one could've dreamed of. Starts slowly but builds surely into an enthralling and entertaining mystery thriller in the best Hitchcock tradition, with fine characters and striking noir photography. The climax in the sewers is impressive, but my favourite bit is the fantastic scene in the ferris wheel between Welles & Cotten!\n\nNow for my complaint: the music theme. I know it's famous because it stands out- but I seriously find it SO out of place in its la-di-da strut, that it wrecks the thriller mood, and I'm convinced this would have fared even better with a different score. Nonetheless- an essential cinematic staple, indeed.\n\n7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"

        "review_detailed_main": "Since this movie appeared on the IMDb top rated movies list, I felt obliged to watch it, so last night I settled in to be blown away by a what has been described as a film noir classic. Instead of film noir, I saw film nu-uh.\n\nThe black and white film is generally well shot and pretty to look at - with the occasional hilariously fake car scene - one scene with 3 or 4 men in a jeep early in the film in particular stands out in my mind, as it almost looks like the actors are inwardly cringing, knowing how fake the scene is going to look. Nevertheless this is a comic distraction that can be written off as a technical limitation from the time the movie was made, and indeed many modern films and TV shows still haven't mastered a realistic car scene.\n\nThe flow of the plot reveals contrivance after contrivance. Some of the acting borders on pantomime - in one early street scene there are several \"watchers\" on the sidewalk, or in apartment windows or shadowy corners, who cast what are supposed to be surreptitious glances towards the action, \"subtly\" looking away or appearing to mind their own business when they sensed they are being noticed. Gee, do you think these people might know something the guy on the street doesn't??\n\nTwo thirds of the way through the film, the \"twist\" or the \"Third Man\" in the plot is revealed, and by the time the end of the film arrives, it is obvious that the twist made no sense. In a real life situation, the Third Man has no reason to reveal himself, in actual fact it would be completely detrimental (dare I say suicidal?) to his own interests to reveal himself. Towards the end of the film we are watching an underground chase scene, which is really just a long montage of a chased man looked desperate in a tunnel and policemen climbing down manholes and shining torches into the darkness. The way this scene ends is comically flawed and loses its last piece of credibility when lead policeman literally forgets about chasing the criminal to attend to a friend, complete with a pantomime shaking of his head as he snaps out of it and realises that he is still supposed to be involved in a chase.\n\nI'm prepared to make allowances for an old film and shrug off its technical flaws or inadequacies and accept the cultural and artistic aspects that link it to a certain time. However the flimsy plot of The Third Man is its achilles heel. I also found the constant switching of languages (particularly early in the film) to be quite jarring and wasn't a fan of the frequent zither throughout the soundtrack.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are a few likable aspects to The Third Man. Every now and then there is snappy line of dialogue that makes you smile and some of the minor parts, particularly those played by Siegfried Breuer & Ernst Deutsch are roguishly charming, and it is at these times the film does shine briefly as these character actors are free to beguile and charm. And I must finally say that the final scene of the movie does actually achieve one lone moment of classic film noir - it is beautifully shot and is a genuinely classic scene complete with the lighting of a cigarette as the film fades out."

        "review_detailed_main": "An American author arrives in post-war Vienna following a job offer from a friend.\n\nThe Third Man is a classic film with incredible visuals, a unique soundtrack and streak of darkness running through its heart.\n\nWith a mysterious death driving the plot, we journey through the city with Holly Martins the American author who writes Western novels about heroes, villains, right and wrong. On the way we encounter cynicism, exploitation, betrayal, loyalty and complexity lurking beneath shadows.\n\nAs the mystery unravels so does a number of interesting themes. A European city ravaged by war and infested by criminal enterprises, home to displaced citizens and where innocent lives can be crushed like ants underfoot. Who is to say what is right and what is wrong following a period in history when heroes carpet bombed and nuked entire cities? Certainly not Hollywood script writers or pulp western novelists.\n\nEvery scene is captured by some of the most striking and effective cinematography of all time. The high contrast imagery is incredibly beautiful and sometimes distorted for maximum weirdness. Darkness, light and shadow have rarely been used to better effect.\n\nThe characters are compelling and embody Graham Greene's cynicism and dark humour in what they say and do. Nobody is straightforward or particularly logical, other than one important individual in his own self-serving way.\n\nAll actors are perfectly cast with Joseph Cotten leading strongly and the likes of Trevor Howard, Valli, Bernard Lee providing brilliant support. Orson Welles of course has a memorable cameo in some of the film's most famous scenes.\n\nProbably the most memorable aspect of The Third Man is Anton Karas' zither composition used to score it. The first time I heard it was with an 89 year old relative who hadn't heard it since the cinema in 1949 and before I even inserted the DVD he started humming the tune accurately.\n\nAdd to the mix some excellent practical sound effects and everything comes together for a perfect assault on your eyes, ears and brain.\n\nThe third man has one of the best plot reveals and arguably the greatest ending in cinema history, but I'm sure that's very much up for debate."

(I figured out who the Third Man was as soon as the Romanian guy denied there was a third man). Also, while Welles' brief performance is probably the finest of his career, Cotten's acting is rather flat and uninspired, making his character more one-dimensional than is really necessary. The cinematography is inspired, truly some of the finest to be found anywhere, but the editing is rather choppy. The movie deserves to be on the AFI 100 list for its contribution to cinematic history, as it is really the forerunner of the entire film noir genre, but on its sheer artistic merits it does not quite rank with Fantasia, Network, The Manchurian Candidate, and a number of other films AFI placed farther down on the list. However, on the whole The Third Man is certainly worth seeing--Welles' entrance (however predictable) and the superb ferris wheel sequence can make the film worthwhile all by themselves."

When he tries to find out more about the accident that killed his friend, Holly encounters surprisingly strong opposition.\n\nThe Third Man is put together amazingly well and contains some truly amazing cinematography, including several scenes on the war-torn streets of Vienna. Maybe the most unusual quality of this film is the fact that it is pulled along mostly by the quality of the story, rather than star actors or special effects (which were, of course, much less common in 1949 than they are today). The story is so complex and well-told that it almost overshadows even such stars (in true \"star roles\") as Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. The Third Man is a classic post-war film. It is amazingly well done, and should not be missed."

Older movies like Metropolis (1927), Modern Times (1936), and To Be or Not to Be (1942), to name but a few, are all very engaging throughout their runtime.\n\nUnfortunately, The Third Man is a disappointing \"too little, too late\" movie. The movie should be cut down to 1 hour because it doesn't really get started until the last 30 minutes. The first 1 hour is a long, melodramatic nothingness. Storytelling is clumsy. Scene transitions are awkward. True, the background and characters need to be developed before Lime shows up; but the job can be done in 20 minutes, 30 at most. The movie gets more dull than suspenseful if it takes too much time showing too little. The music doesn't help, either.\n\nIn my opinion, this movie doesn't stand the test of time as other classics do. It may have been ahead of its time when it came out, alright. Is it worth watching now? Not really."

It is also regarded as one of the greatest British films of all time, but sadly I failed to find anything fascinating in this film.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the film is well made. The outdoor locations of Vienna are picturesque and well shot and the cinematography is flawless. The use of lighting in the climax is also amazing. But that's about it as far as the positives go for me. The storyline is set at the backdrop of Vienna, a city tortured by the perils of the WWII and it also deals with the context of the inevitable rise of corruption in a broken economy and a suffering society where corrupt people employ devious means to earn big by making use of the common person's deficiencies and in doing so climb to the top of the food chain. But unfortunately the director didn't go deep into the aforementioned themes and the story itself felt so flat and none of the characters seemed interesting and deep. I sat through the the initial scenes with the hope that things will get better, but they never did. A noir film at the basic level has to keep you engrossed,but this film didn't keep me so and the big reveal wasn't shocking at all.\n\nOrson Welles is good in it, but the acting as a whole in the film is just acceptable with nothing in particular worth a special mention.\n\nSo in a nutshell, The Third Man is a technically well made film with great cinematography, but every other aspect of the film is mediocre at best. Maybe it is the raised expectations due to its critical acclaim that let me down in the end."

And look out for the strong supporting roles (Trevor Howard's cynical army officer through to Wilfred Hyde White's slightly dotty cultural liaison officer). In conjunction with the fortuitous use of Anton Karas' zither score, this is a movie you will want to come back to time and time again. Enjoy.\n\nPS there is a very good BBC documentary on the making of the film - well worth catching if you can!"

All this is at the service of a fascinating story: a large cast of great characters (all the way down to the babbling old landlady in Anna's building), lots of twists, good irony, witty dialogue. I don't agree with previous writers that the story is hard to follow. I think it develops quickly, logically, and clearly. Anna is a mysterious character, but she was meant to be that way. Joseph Cotton delivers a brilliant, underplayed performance that leads us into the story. All elements comes together in this movie to make it the incomparable masterpiece that it is."

I didn't understand the plot but the black and white images were hypnotising. Carol Reed's classic really is a gift for any cinema lover. Anton Karas' iconic zither score winds its way throughout the film and perfectly accentuates the backdrop of a war-torn and ruined Vienna, itself populated by the superb cast of characters.\n\nThe closing scenes in the sewers demonstrate a mastery of the black and white format, with the phenomenal photography from the great Robert Krasker perfectly highlighting the contrast of shadows and light. There's also some unbelievable editing that consistently ratchets up the pace and tension to the famous climax.\n\nEven after 70 years, The Third Man is still as exciting, seedy and thoroughly immersive as ever and superbly demonstrates the inherent magic and power of the silver screen."

Wonderfully acted, with Joseph Cotten doing an excellent job as leading man. Trevor Howard is perfect as the patient Major Calloway. The audience is carried through the mystery as an outsider, following Cotton's Holly Martins as he learns of his friend's death and things not adding up. If I am to be critical, some of the sewer chases are a bit tedious, but they do not take away from the film. And what surely has to be one of the best reveals in film history. I truly wish I hadn't known what the twists are ahead of time. However, knowing the story won't make this any less of a great film."

Every technique here seems to be in service of a filmic translation of the tumultuous state that post-WW2 Vienna underwent. This is sadly incorporated into the score, which ends up in laughable and even vexatious dissonance with the atmosphere, a brooding underworld accompanied by music that sounds not too dissimilar to Spongebob's theme. Despite my appreciation for this directorial aim, though, I found most of this slightly underwhelming in that department. Lots of quick cutting during regularly paced dialogue and no eagerness for blocking lengthier shots. Made me yearn for Welles in the director's seat, which is funny considering the film instantly gets better as soon as he shows up (his reveal is the best moment in it). Until that point, I found myself somewhat disinterested in the mystery plot that meanders a bit. Still, these are all blemishes on an otherwise gleaming surface that I hope to appreciate more when I take another (and closer) look at it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Very disappointing. This film is highly over-rated. The story is set in the war-torn Austrian city of Vienna, just after the Second World War, and is told from the point of view of an American pulp western author, Holly Martins, who is searching for a college friend, Harry Lime, who had offered him the opportunity to work with him in Vienna.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Martins discovers that his old friend Harry Lime, whom he had not seen since before the war, has been killed in an accident under mysterious circumstances just prior to Martins' arrival in Vienna. The deeper he delves into Harry's death, the more Martins finds that there was more to Lime than he knew and that Harry has been accused of being a black market racketeer, trafficking in adulterated penicillin.\n\nThe only interesting angle to the film is the way in which Martins sort of becomes the heroic advocate of justice that he writes about- only this time the setting is post-war Vienna (which is fairly wild and untamed) not the wild west- a rather intriguing parallel, but not enough to save the film, which suffers from a generally lack-luster plot."

It is amazingly written, easily quotable, mostly grabs your ears when it is being said by Orson Wells, hence the cuckoo clock talk. Another thing that is definitely worth mentioning would be the cinematography. It was pretty slick, very original for that time. It's kind of distorted, some lack of light on the actors faces. Well, and then there are other things that make this movie a classic - the acting, the zither music, the story itself, portrayal of the post - WWII Vienna.\n\nSee this movie, if you still haven't.

        "review_detailed_main": "Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. \"The Third Man\" is set in Vienna, \"The Man Between\" in Berlin and \"Odd Man Out\" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in \"The Third Man\" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American stars.\n\nIt is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word \"man\" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of \"The Third Man\" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of  writer pulp Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?)\n\nThe film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh lighting, expressionist black-and-white cinematography and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was \"The Lady from Shanghai\", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor.\n\nThere are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a forged passport and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities.\n\nThe film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous \"cuckoo clock\" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely.\n\nDiscussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. \"The Third Man\" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's \"The Long Memory\" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's \"Brighton Rock\", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I have just seen this again for perhaps the fifth time. Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots: there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father: this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell. Orson Welles's 'spell' seems to grow with each viewing of this film, as if each time one sees it, more phosphorescent light is emitted by that eerie face so suddenly illuminated in the doorway. And oh, the haunting atmosphere of that deserted postwar city at night! The alleys! And the subterranean river with its sewer drains, of which Carol included so many extra brooding shots, to such great effect. How many 78 rpm records of Anton Karas's theme song were sold? It must have been more than a million. This film has never ceased to live in our imaginations, nor should it."

When a shocked, bewildered Holly asks the witnesses about the accident, their answers don't match up, and Holly believes there might be a third man involved\u0085\n\nThe Third Man (1949) is an amazing film-noir thriller directed by Carol Reed. I have only just started to get into noirs and this has most certainly confirmed my love for them. I think this film was particularly unusual and innovative because of the constant use of slightly slanted camera angles \u0096 almost like a comic book. There were also lots of shots of a character talking to another character that has their back to the camera, this also made it very comic book like but added to the intensity which is needed in a film noir.\n\nAnd for those of you who like films that keep you on your toes, this is certainly one of them! There are a lot of plot turns and it keeps you guessing\u0085 but it is still believable.\n\nHarry Martin is constantly torn and Cotton captures his nonchalant hero quality exceedingly well. Welles is also amazing as Harry, and Valli who plays Anna (Harry's lover) is also very dark, brooding but also warm. The acting is brilliant, no qualms there.\n\nI have heard people \u0096 in particular, my Mother \u0096 complain about the plot holes in this movie. I can understand what she is saying but these so-called plot holes can be easily 'filled up' with a bit of common sense (I suggest the IMDb boards).\n\nAll in all, a purely magnificent film like so many other films of this genre. The story is witty, intelligent, dramatic but also slightly comedic at times, the acting realistic \u0096 great performances from all\u0085 but what truly sets this film apart is the cinematic experience that you get when you watch it, as it is completely fresh and nothing like I've seen before. Ten out of ten for this superb thriller noir."

What I found was a film with tremendous cinematography, several extremely powerful images, and a few memorable exchanges of dialog. However, it was not able to create an overall mood of other films typical of the genre. This may be due to my dislike of the score, which interrupted the growth of tension or intrigue, rather than enhancing it.

Less easy to overlook was the upbeat musical score which a friend described as sounding like it was from a bad Italian restaurant; it played relentlessly throughout the film regardless of what was happening on screen which was off-putting at times. Overall though it was a fun watch and a gripping final 30 minutes in particular."

It makes it all look like a light-hearted comedy, not to be taken seriously. The dialogues are presented in a mechanical, artificial way: normal people do not respond so quickly to surprising and unknown information. The plot fixes too much attention to the girl, rather than to the complex and confused story. The good things are the cinematography and the atmosphere of postwar Vienna, where the action takes place, but even they should have been given more attention."

The crooked camera angles of the streets, the brilliantly acted characters of Harry and Holly and their intertwining relationship, the dryness of Calloway, the absolute wit and grace of the script and of course, one of the most memorable scores in movie history all combine to create an incredible piece of film noir but with so much more humour, irony, tension and characterisation than others in its genre (not dismissing such other greats as Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil which are also superb).\n\nSo at the risk of sounding like a rabid fan, yes, I do believe this to be the greatest film of all time - and the ferris wheel scene should be more than enough evidence to prove this!\n\nPerfect - 10/10"

They could have pulled someone off the street to \"act\" her part better.\n\nAnd apparently she really thought a lot of herself, based on her insistence that she be credited by one name only \"Valli\". How utterly precocious & vain, especially considering her complete lack of talent. Exactly who did she think she was - the next \"Garbo\", as she was supposedly promoted when this picture came out?

        "review_detailed_main": "Like most people who post reviews on this site, I love movies. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I've seen lots of movies in my day. And from that vast list, most of which has long since faded into my mind's oblivion, a very few stand out. Casablanca. Chinatown. The Godfathers. Bridge On The River Kwai. Annie Hall. The Third Man stands in that company, and maybe at the front. This site contains so many excellent reviews of this movie and its cinematography, its music, its Graham Greene-inspired plot and dialogue. I won't try to re-do what so many reviews have already done. No, I'm writing this comment to honor Joseph Cotten. This movie will always be associated in the first instance with Orson Welles, who, as most readers will know by now, is on screen for but a few minutes. And while those minutes may represent the most memorable small role in the history of cinema, it's Joseph Cotten who carries this movie. His performance as the bumbling, naive, yet ultimately heroic Holly Martins, is perfect. It's an incredibly demanding role, because in order for the movie to work, we have to see Holly as childlike in his adoration of the evil Harry Lime (played by Welles), adolescent in his pursuit of Lime's bereaved girlfriend, slippery enough to have been Lime's one-time running mate, yet clever enough to unravel a mystery that's fooled the cynical British army cop, Major Calloway, played brilliantly by Trevor Howard. And all that and more, we have to like him. Cotten, who is in virtually every frame of the movie, pulls it off. Nowadays, little is written about Joseph Cotten. Maybe it was his man-on-the-street looks. More likely, he'll always be seen as a lesser satellite in Welles' galaxy. Pity, because he was great, and his performance as Holly Martins in The Third Man, is fantastic."

On the arrival, he learns that Harry has just died hit by a truck in front of his building and he goes to his funeral. Holly Martins sees a beautiful woman, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), and a friend of Harry and sooner he learns that Anna was Harry's lover.\n\nMaj. Calloway (Trevor Howard), who is commanding the investigation, offers the ticket to Holly return home, but while waiting for the trip, he talks to two friends of Harry that tell that they had been the firsts to help his friend. However, the porter of Harry's building tells that there was a mysterious third man that helped Harry and Holly Martins becomes intrigued with the inconsistency and decides to investigate further. Sooner he discloses that Harry Lime was the leader of a gang that robbed penicillin from the military hospital to adulterate and resell it, and has caused the death and anomalies in many children. He continues to investigate and he has a great surprise when he finds who the third man is.\n\n\"The 3rd Man\" is an unforgettable masterpiece of mystery and thriller by Carol Reed. The fascinating story has no flaws, with witty dialogs; the acting is perfect and the cinematography is wonderful with the perfect use of black and white and shadows to show the environment and corruption in Vienna in the post WWII. The manhunt in the end in the sewage system of the city is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Terceiro Homem\" (\"The Third Man\")"

Even during the melancholic scenes. I guess it is used to emphasize the fact that the film is tragicomic.\n\nSome of the camera angles and imagery (especially the scene on the staircase, the scenes inside the Ferris wheel, the man with the balloons towards the end and the action scenes inside the underground sewer) are amazing.\n\nThe film is quite critical of American enterprise. The Orson Welles character could be symbolic of American capitalism and attitude towards life. His attitude is characterized by this line:\n\n\"Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.\"\n\nJoseph Cotton is a writer of pulpy American westerns. I wonder if he is supposed to represent impending American cultural hegemony after World War 2. The film was released in 1949, so if this is what the director intended, then it is very prophetic.\n\nThe female character played by Alida Valli, who covets Orson Welles despite all his flaws is not portrayed in very good light. Women prefer the bad boys.\n\nSome of the characters (like the book enthusiast who invites Cotton to a book discussion) were inserted just to make the plot more complicated. That whole scene was quite unnecessary. The film gets really good towards the end. It has a very cynical tone throughout - emphasized by the music and the desolate visuals of Vienna, ruined and devastated by the war. The child spy was quite sinister.\n\nIt is a reasonably enjoyable film. I guess it is a classic if you consider the cinematography and the year it was made in. But I was not enamored by it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film has been noted as one of the best films ever in the history of the American cinema!!! While this website ranks it 48th best movie out of the top 250, and AFI (American Film Institue) has ranked it as high as the 14th best picture out of the top 100 American films ever made, something even more significant looms on the horizon!! Many intellectual spawns of the American film academy have ranked this film in the top five films ever produced!! One prominent critic from Boston ranked \"Third Man\" the number one movie of all time!! So!!! What justifies such critically acclaimed praise anyway? Start with the fact that the intellectual complexities to the plot in \"Third Man\" are intensely riveting!! The esoteric demeanor with which this film carries, has a deliberately convoluted line of logic!! The derivative responses from so many of the characters in this film spark a necessary ambiguity with regards to the prevailing circumstances for whom the third man must relinquish his mystique to!! The conversations pertinent to any kind of plausible resolution to the core issues in this movie were always philosophical!! Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles are a highly classic and highly talented duo of actors (As demonstrated in \"Citizen Kane\") who immediately necessitate a lofty aura of academic concepts. This detailed and contemplative cerebral quandary invites the movie audience to a very noteworthy ideological rumination of the story line in this film. Whether it be \"Citizen Kane\", \"The Third Man\", or any other film, the indisputable mark of the majority of intelligent actors ( Including Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten) is one where they convey the understanding of a situation, and instantly establish whether this situation is really complicated or very simple!! This is about the seventh time I have seen this movie \"The Third Man\" and, I believe, that finally!! I have a grass roots recognition of what this movie is about!! The visceral components to this film induce a correlation to an adamant political passion, as well as, yes, what else? love!! The trials and tribulations of espionage became a form of mutual vindication, thus establishing a kindred spirit for emotional devotion!! Set in Vienna, this film was very identifiable to me, as I have been to Vienna, and I recognize a lot of aspects of splendor to this city. All of it ignited an auspicious recognition; the Gosser Beer signs, the Sacher Cafe', the Mozart concertos with the players wearing wigs, ( I saw a production of this nature while in Vienna!!), and, of course, the cobblestone streets where a cross section of dubious walks of life perennially congregate!! Vienna is a city which is proverbially known to be a hotbed of political malcontents!! Just by virtue of the copious number of summits and dignitary gatherings it has hosted suggests that Vienna is a city which vicariously straddles the political fence!! With the intransigent aftermath of WWII, and the world almost ready to go to war again over the conquest of Berlin in 1948, central Europe had become totally dissected!! By 1949, when \"The Third Man\" was made, the overall infrastructure, which was ruined in Vienna, from confrontational combat during WWII, was ubiquitous!! The city was divided in four sections, belonging to four nations, the American, the British, the Russian, and the French. The center of the city was international, and for Joseph Cotten's character, Vienna presented itself as a mecca for diplomatic intrigue!! I loved this movie!! Based on the screenplay by Graham Greene, this film erupts with talent. Carol Reed ( Known for \"Oliver\" and a remake of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\") does a remarkable job as director with his efforts in the making of \"The Third Man\"!! The acting in \"The Third Man\" was utterly superb, basically second to none !! Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten are an unbeatable combination, and Alida Valli, who plays Anna, is flawlessly disconcerting with this role!! The speech Orson Welles made was one which he wrote... the gist of it being (I am paraphrasing)\" War, terror and bloodshed are adversities which brought on greats such as Michaelangelo, Leonardo DaVinci, and the Renaissance, Switzerland has had 500 years of peace and democracy, and all you have gotten out of them is the cuckoo clock\". I thought this little doggerel of Welles' was very impressive!! Orson Welles is a lone rebel cynic who raised the bar on directing and acting excellence, not only in Hollywood, but also, in New York and London Theatre!! Orson Welles has the same birthday as I do, I guess this day was earmarked for brilliant byproducts of unprecedented genius!! (My personal vanity in this case is totally in kidding of course!!) The Hawaiin music in this film served as an aside for anachronistic flippancy with this picture!! The cinematography and lighting in this film were spectacular!! Accomplished actors, directors and producers prefer a movie to be filmed in black and white, as it exudes the absence of distraction!! The film \"Third Man\" is a must see for virtually every movie aficionado on the face of the earth!! I agree with the discerning movie critics, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!"

Sometimes, the guitar player sounded like he was free forming the music and often lost his way.

The entire soundtrack should have been in an Italian Comedy film where some stud is trying to impress a beautiful woman on the beach."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some of the mystery in this mystery film is very quickly spoiled early on with the application of simple logic. But aside from that I have further complaints about this classic. On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy it either.\n\nWhat the story has going for it are some fairly interesting characters, some acted very well, and a nice mystery plot. More interesting are the relationships between some of the primary characters and the expected turn-about in character direction. I like that few of the characters are what we initially think they are and how their relationship to each other changes. There are also just a few really well done scenes that are still pretty memorable.\n\nOne of the problems with this film is that it's not much of a mystery. It's not hard to figure out what's going on from the start, which sort of neutralizes a little of the suspense. Another issue is that it's not consistent. There are a number of really good scenes and there are a number of mediocre scenes. That's not to say it isn't interesting, and unless you're really focusing on the direction, you might not see it--I didn't until I was looking at it a second time.\n\nBut those issues aren't too big. I suppose my biggest issue is that it feels like a popcorn movie. It doesn't have a potent \"so what\". You saw glimpses of important decisions that might have been made, but the story is so railroaded that you never really get a sense of you wanting the characters make decisions, but rather, just follow along. It's an enjoyable popcorn movie, mind you, but you never have to get invested in it.\n\nAnd so, I guess it was a letdown for me. The movie has a lot of esteem as a classic and such, and I think that led me to believe that it would be a particularly impressive movie. Rather, it just ends up being an enjoyable but rather simple mystery tale. I guess I prefer my movies a little less obvious. The zither music is a neat diversion though. 7/10."

I had always thought of Orson Welles more as a great director than a great actor, but here his presence looms large and his Cuckoo clock speech is one of the best in all of cinema.

The scene where Harry appears at the station is the start of an emotional journey. This is a timeless story of a search for a lost friend. The music of Anton Karras is essential to the mood.\n\nThe words of Harry (Orson Welles): \"In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and what did that produce - the cuckoo clock!\" are a great counterpoint to his earlier words in the ferris wheel and his disregard for human life: \"You know, I never feel comfortable on these sort of things. Victims? Don't be melodramatic. Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever? If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped, would you really, old man, tell me to keep my money, or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare? Free of income tax, old man. Free of income tax - the only way you can save money nowadays.\n\nThe scene where Alida is about to depart on the train, leaving Holly, is a haunting reminder of betrayal: \"They have a name for faces like that..\"\n\nWatch the scene in the children's' hospital \"They gave it some of Lime's penicillin...terrible shame...\" without a twinge of compassion and you're not human!\n\nThe closing scene where Anna walks past Holly Martins down the cemetery road is a signal of the betrayed and lost love."

The story and screen-play by Graham Green is superb. The music by Anton Karas is perfect. The photography by Robert Krascer is brilliant. The direction by Carol Reed is innovative and faultless. This is the original noir classic. Its Vienna after WW2 and racketeering is rife. The naive Holly Martins (a small time novelist from the U.S.A.) stumbles into town. He has to get smart quickly as he discovers that fact can be stranger than fiction....and much more deadly. Made in 1949 it remains an exemplary film in all ways. To-days \"special effects\" and CGI are what movie goers now want....which is a real shame. It means that the writers can get away with murder----by coming up with poor scripts, again and again. This is an INTELLIGENT movie....it requires full attention. They really cant make em like this anymore. This is a movie which is rightly celebrated by anyone who loves high class motion pictures."

Whilst I would never dispute this, keep in mind that \"Best\" doesn't mean the same as \"Favourite\". Kane is influential, important and is required viewing for anyone with even a cursory interest in film. However, it can be a difficult watch if your not in the right mood. The Third Man, on the other hand, is a joy from start to finish. From the (perfectly) cast to Robert Krasker's outstanding cinematography, the film persists in staggering me every time. Technically speaking, The Third Man is on a par with Citizen Kane and rarely gets the credit for it. The reason for this is simply because, whatever skill,craft and/or effort was displayed for the film, it is unobtrusive. All the composite elements (photography,design,editing etc) seem so perfectly suited to eachother, to the point where they're rendered almost \"invisible\". However, whilst watching Citizen Kane, you're always conscious of it being such a (staggeringly) well put together film. Which seems, to me, to run counter to the whole \"Magic of Cinema\" thing. The \"Magic of Cinema\" thing being where you can let go and enter the world you're being presented with. Which becomes increasingly more difficult, the more you're aware of the technicalities of filmaking, however impressive they may be. So, sit back and enjoy quite the finest example of \"Romantic Thrillers\"........ The Third Man. My favourite film, though not necessarily the best."

It is funny how trailers have evolved just over the past 20 years. I had calmed myself down and prepared to watch this film with an open mind. I had read so many reviews of this movie and heard the praises. So many said that even though it was made in the late 40's it had a look and feel of a film of the late 50's to early 60's. They were right. This movie kept my attention and played with my imagination all the way to the end. It is also funny to look at the scene when Harry Lime is revealed for the first time and to remember standing in that same spot in Vienna at 16 so many years ago and not know why your crazy German Teacher is going nuts and taking pictures. Also at the end I had realized that my initial judgement of Karas' zither was incorrect. It helped define the movie and especially Orson Welles' Harry Lime. This movie is film-noir at its best."

The title hints of a character who has surpassed the ordinary; who has defied conventional restraints; an outsider; a modern Kurtz [Heart of Darkness]. No coincidence that a sinister, cynical Kurtz actually exists in the film.\n\nOf what is Lime guilty anyway? How guilty is he? What has he done? Does it even matter? For a long time, he is nowhere in sight. We don't know where he is, if he even exists, or if the terrible rumors about him are true. So why do we so desperately want to meet him and hear his side of the story? We begin to identify with this mystery man, we want to side with him.\n\nOnly one thing is certain as the story unrolls: Harry Lime has gone too far and he must pay the price.\n\nJoseph Cotten plays an artistically-compromised American writer, who is too naive -- in his charming American way -- to realize it. Can he even begin to offer the insight and integrity needed to evaluate Lime's guilt or innocence, the evidence we long to disavow?\n\nThen there is Harry's American girlfriend. She is depressed by Harry but is mentally loyal to his \"memory.\"\n\nTouchPoints\n\nThe transcendently evil character to whom a genuine, yet inexperienced character is inexplicably and irrevocably drawn through a long, convoluted journey toward absolute darkness. (Conrad)\n\nVienna, the city of intellect, intrigue, and ambition with its dark streets, gothic shadows and subterranean sewers providing the ultimate metaphor for the mind (Freud) Life as a dizzying carnival of dizzying perceptions of good and evil, sin and salvation, and the relentless need to make choices. (Fellini)\n\nThe investigation of murder, and the subsequent surprises, secrets and thrills that unveil character and motive. The use of creative sound, light and cinematography to embroil the viewer in the hunt. Tall buildings and dizzying heights. The propensity to fall from grace. (Hitchcock)\n\nThe presumption of guilt as a foundational assumption of modern life. The chaos, frustration, loneliness and deep fears occasioned by endless and inescapable and endless bureaucratic and architectural webs, mazes, and tangles. (Kafka)\n\nThis is certainly one of the top ten films of all time -- if not, in fact, number one. It's complexity continues to fascinate, amaze, entertain, awe. It is perfect."

Without his promised job, he starts to chat with the friends of the dead man and swiftly spots some inconsistencies that lead him to become suspicious. He determines to try and find out just quite what happened. It becomes harder and harder for \"Holly\" to get straight answers - even from those whom he ought to be able to rely upon - \"Maj. Calloway\" (Trevor Howard) nor even \"Anna\" (Alida Valli), the dead man's lover - seem to be able (or willing to help). Gradually, also, he begins to suspect that he is being followed. Pinpricks of light from cigarettes in the shadows, shifting bodies hugging the dimly lit doorways - and he begins to realise that maybe his friend was not quite as scrupulous and honourable as he might have wished or appeared. Right from Anton Karas playing the distinctive zither theme at the top of the film we are treated to a wonderfully evocative adaptation of Graham Greene's mystery thriller and Carol Reed really does well with the pace of this too. We do make progress, but \"Holly\" has to work hard - as do we - for it, and his shady protagonists remain in the shadows, really effectively. This is a super story of trust, loyalty and greed that really is still as good now as it was 70 years ago."

Carol Reed continued to direct movies for many more years (he even won an Oscar for \"Oliver\" in 1968) but would never make a film of that stature again.\n\nIn 1940s England, most movies were shot on the companies' sound stages. But Carol Reed had other ideas. \"Odd Man Out\" was filmed in Belfast, while he brought his crew to Vienna to make \"The Third Man\". Where Reed got into trouble. The film's star, Orson Welles, refused to go down into the city's foul-smelling sewers for the dramatic chase sequence. Instead Reed had to use a body double, dressed in Welles' clothes for the scene.\n\nOne evening when Carol Reed wandered around Vienna, scouting locals, he heard street musician Anton Karas playing outside a bar. Reed was immediately fascinated by the zither player, and decided to use his music as the theme of his film. This, in turn, made the unknown musician famous. After touring all over Europe, Karas could open a nightclub in Vienna in the '50s, aptly named \"Der Dritte Mann\".\n\n\"The Third Man\" is filled with lots of unusual angles where the camera is tilted so that the horizon line is not horizontal at all. This is because Carol Reed wanted to create a feeling of uncertainty in the audience. After seeing the film, director William Wyler sent a spirit level to his good friend Reed, with a note attached: \"Carol, the next time you make a picture, just put this on top of the camera, will you?\""

So it is with every other detail of the film, actors with 5 lines seem like fully fleshed characters, and setpieces as simple as a sewer entrance are exotic little touches that make postwar Vienna seem almost like an alien world. Unlike the \"classic\" films of the last 20 years, The Third Man has no opinions on god, or death, it has no broad message, it's just a story. Just a single, luminous, story."

Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the \"bad guys,\" prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like \"Anna Schmidt\" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights). And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an \"Hawaiian sound\" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither. Cold War boilerplate or not: 10 out of 10."

The unique blend of creeping shadows and spectacular filming angles are one of the main standouts in the film.\n\nRarely has a film had a better cast. Joseph Cotten is perfect in his role as Holly Martins. Orson Welles almost steals the whole show with his almost cameo like performance as the elusive Harry Lime.\n\nThe story in the Third Man is intriguing and ultimately satisfying. It isn't the strongest point of the film, but is still admirable. The story is really just a basis for the excellent character interaction and dialogue on display.\n\nTo conclude, the Third Man is an essential film, one that should be seen by everybody. It is cinema at its most sub-lime!"

The film stars Joseph Cotten, Valli and Orson Welles. The locations in the city of Vienna, Austria are quite impressive. Welles has so much to handle as his famous character, Harry Lime.\n\nThere was a concern from David O'Selznick over the casting of Orson Welles. Welles had a struggling career, after the making of \"Citizen Kane\", but Reed found Welles to be the right fit for the main project. The ending of this movie is a true work of Art, and the tension is certainly there for its audience. The Cinematography is what really makes this film work. The trick is that everything is uneven, and Cotten has a hard time pronouncing certain character's names.\n\nThe film earned the award for Best Cinematography. While Welles was back in the game, he still struggled to gain his independence as a film director. If there is one Black & White movie that truly earns its name, it is The Third Man, one of my Top 10 Favorite Films of all time!"

Wienna as a lugubrious and damp ghost town filled with odd people, mostly viewed in close-ups - silent, tormented faces.\n\n(4) Plot: Believable enough. Actually a bit of a MacGuffin; the emotional drama is the true story, but it wouldn't have worked without the detective hyperplot. The title itself could be given almost a double entendre with respect to the famous final scene: the female protagonist has lost the first man, ignored the second, and eventually walks towards the third.

As Martins begins investigating his friend's death, he starts to hear conflicting stories on how his friend died and when he is lead to believe that a mysterious third man is involved he starts to suspect that Lime may have been murdered...\n\nI'm always up for watching an old classic film and spotting this film advertised on BBC2 this morning I decided to record it and watched it this evening. Here's my take on it...\n\nWith The Third Man what you essentially have is a fairly decent story that is relatively intriguing and yet for me there was still something missing here. It's one of those talky films which is fine if there is something else to back up all the chatter, but for me, the film lacked something in the way of pzazz and firepower. Even though the investigative side of the story is quite interesting the film is quite slow and I also found the score intrusive and over-used. Even from a technical perspective the film is on shaky ground; the editing and continuity for example are some of the worst that I've seen on cinema (though these things could be slightly forgivable given the age of the film).\n\nThe acting is acceptable but I didn't really feel that anyone truly shined here; again the presence of Orson Welles seems to increase the hype surrounding this film and whilst he is by no means bad here I fail to see why he is anymore worthy than many of the other good actors and actresses that populated this film.\n\nI liked some of director Carol Reed's touches in this film; his dark and dingy Vienna (with many scenes being filmed in London) does give the film a classic noir feel to it and some of the establishing shots showing large silhouettes was also a nice touch.\n\nFor fans of classic cinema The Third Man is definitely worth seeing as there isn't anything majorly wrong with it. However, for me to give a film a score of 7 or above it has to really involve me and have a true wow factor and/or something special about it. Sadly this film didn't quite manage to wring out that much emotion from me."

This would be a grand example of what movies today are doing to people.\n\nThe reviewer who stated this said that they lost interest in The Third Man about half way through? What? Here is a film that puts it's audience in a trance the second Joseph Cotten enters the screen. In fact it's ONLY flaw was the seemingly pointless narration at the very start. The rest of the movie is perfect.\n\nThe Third Man was perfectly shot, edited, directed, acted and told. The music stays familiar from the opening credits until the end. The score helps keep the movie from confusing itself, the score shows us that this movie had it's own personality and own flawless flaws. It lives and dies as it is. It doesn't try to put in songs of it's past, (the songs from the Billboard's Top Ten) that may make a feeling of nostalgia and confuse the viewer into believing they're watching a great movie, but are indeed being tricked with clever magic of the emotions. (i.e. Casino and the worst yet Forrest Gump). These movies aren't sure what they are, other than they are.\n\nNot mention, here is a movie that holds a climax of words and still finds the time to put one of the best chase scenes (if I can lower the standards of the film to say CHASE SCENE) at the end. A double climax? Yes, one for the high brows another for people who think Usual Suspects is a movie to compare other movies with. (If your wondering, I believe the \"Coo-coo Clock Speech\" is a definite climax).\n\nThe Third Man is magic. Magic! MAGIC!

        "review_detailed_main": "I bought this film after watching Citizen Kane for the first time, purely in order to see more of Orson Welles' acting (a fair enough reason, I think!) I hadn't really paid attention to anything else, so when Joseph Cotton appeared on screen, I was surprised but pleased, mainly because I recognised him from Citizen Kane as well. Over the next 100 mins or so he went on to prove himself one of the best screen actors I've ever seen, easily comparable with his co-stars: it's fair to say that Orson Welles dominates the film, but arguably Joseph Cotton dominates the screen. Add in to this Trevor Howard, an often overlooked but talented actor, and Valli, who is captivatingly melancholic, plus the absolutely brilliant final sequence, and you end up watching a great, great film. It's just a shame that the finest British film ever made dates back to 1949: couldn't we have gone on to even better things? To be honest, who cares: just sit down and watch this!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each \"genre\" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clich\u00e9s, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film.\n\nBut film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us.\n\nThe best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other \u2013 interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous!\n\n\"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'."

It is the British Academy's #1 movie of all-time. It is praised to this day by every credible film professor and critic in the world. I finally got to see it on an old grainy tape on a small screen in my university's library media room.\n\nAfter the ending credits started rolling, I walked out of the library totally awestruck. The cinematography was perfect; it was as if Citizen Kane's revolutionary techniques were honed to an even more immaculate edge. The pacing of the plot was perfect; never once had there been either a boring moment or a break in the suspense. The characters are cleverly ambiguous and incredibly deep; no one is in the right or in the wrong completely. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) is one of the most haunting and vicious, yet at the same time one of the most charismatic characters I have ever seen on film. The dialogue is nothing short of intense wit and haunting wisdom (note Harry Lime's \"cuckoo clock\" speech).\n\nThe Third Man is definitely a movie I plan to revisit again, and again, and again. I definitely can't claim to have caught everything this first time around, and there were many things that slipped over my head and wish to catch again. But when a film catches your complete admiration on first viewing and makes you want to revisit it over again, I'd say it is definitely a film worth catching if you can.\n\n10/10, and personally my 4th all-time at the moment (that could go up on subsequent viewings)."

So much so that it Balances all the Great Stuff, but Honestly and Objectively, make this only Above Average and a Very Different Film.\n\nThe Music...Nothing but Oddball Zither and near Two Hours of it might have You Screaming in Pain or at the very Least Turning the Sound Off.\n\nThe Woman...Constantly Moping about and Pining for Harry just gets Sad and Boring with Her relentless Drooping Demeanor and Praising the \"God-Like\" Lime. Her strong Rejection of Holly Martins in Virtually Every Scene as he Pants after Her like a Dog in Heat is just Embarrassing.\n\nThe Foreign Language Without Subtitles...Unattractive People Speaking Non-English all the time that goes Undeciphered because it is not Subtitled is a Distraction that Demands the Highest of Tolerance. The Elderly Woman Wrapped in the Blanket Takes the Cake.\n\nOverall the Good Outweighs the Bad and it is a Film that is Essential Viewing for Anyone but the most Aloof Movie Goer because it is Rated so High and it is a Visual Treat and the Dialog (that is in English) can be Intriguing and Amusing. If You can Tolerate the Three Irritants above it can be Considered a Fine Film."

Daringly angled shots, against the ruins of grand houses add a wonderful and fitting backdrop as shattered humans play out their parts. The Zither of Anton Karas is perfect, one of those serendipitous moments that can not be repeated. Like Kubric's use of Straus for the first view of space in 2001, it is difficult to imagine any other music in its place. The final shot in the cemetery entrance is heroically long."

Graham Greene's screenplay (based upon his earlier novella of the same name) is majestically given life on the big screen by Director Carol Reed. What ensues is a remarkable blend of witty dialogue, clever chase sequences and possibly the greatest character entrance in the history of film. The amazing cinematography blends consummately with the haunting Zither theme music of Anton Karas, to create an eerily authentic Viennese street atmosphere.\n\nThe trio of actors; namely Valli, Welles and Howard turn in thoroughly convincing performances in their respective roles. However, the standout performance of the film is supplied by Joseph Cotten; one finds that he is so often underrated in the history of film. Nonetheless, he is wonderful as Holly Martins; a character that is thrust into a role as a drunken, and at times seemingly incompetent, amateur detective.\n\nThis is a film that builds a strong case to be considered the greatest English language film of all time, especially when one considers the manner in which it is able to combine the elements of superb characterization, expressionist style and suspenseful drama."

The unique zither that strums along matches it perfectly.\n\nWhile some may find it dated, I find it a forward thinking masterpiece and you can see the shots that Scorsese and Spielberg have copied for their black and white work. After watching overblown and obvious films such as Crash (this won an award?), it was a gem to see this again. It's my third time, and it just seems to improve with age.\n\nIt's the little moments that count. Cotten's innocent writer (or is he- since he has some hints of a past with the villain), the great sewer chase, and of course, Orson Welles entrance. The film glides perfectly, with nothing out of place of not making sense.\n\nExcellent"

It just carries out a totally linear story and it's basically just dialogue and the film fails at making itself interesting to the audience. Sure this may've been original or what not at the time, but as a film on its own there's really very little strength to it, I mean the whole point and idea of the film (won't be disclosed here) is a fairly ordinary story overall and the twist may be interesting but to have all this completely underwhelming, boring old film attached to it is far too bad a deal for such a quick fix at the end.\n\nIt's also annoying, sonically: loud voices throughout, the debilitating omnipresence of that Hawaii-ish guitar theme...it's just often very loud and an annoyance. Then the fact it tries hard to be stylistic with tilted odd camera angles, or unsubtle transitions like the camera zooming in on that flower pot and into the street...\n\nOverall one could get the impression there's far too little going on, the film settles for telling some story it picked to tell and there's more talking than anything, is recurrently very slow... and what goes on just isn't interesting or important enough to ever get the right momentum going."

The wood furnace in her ruined flat is almost symbolic of the starkness and hardship which existed in post-war Europe. Highly recommended. 10/10."

Unfortunately, The Third Man doesn't live up to it's reputation for me. With a twist that is predictable from the very first scene, to the slow paced rest of the film, The Third Man is just an average film.\n\nI tend to love film-noir's. In fact I adore The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity to name a few, but this one failed to peak my interest. Granted there is a terrific performance by Alida Valli, and Orson Welles, being one of the great screen legends of all time, does make an appearance (Yeah he's really only in it for 30 minutes). So that's all great, but the score is distracting and feels like a 60's western, the pacing is abnormally slow, and nothing really happens until the final 15 minutes or so. Which I have to admit, was a great way to end the film. In fact the final chase/shootout is definitely worth re-watching. There is also a clich\u00e9d romance that develops between leads that doesn't feel genuine for nearly the entire film (but I did like where that eventually ended up).\n\nIt's just hard to get over a film that has glaring weaknesses across the board. It also didn't help that the back cover of the copy of the film that I watched spoiled the twist for me, not that I didn't already know, but it would have helped to have at least some percentage of doubt. The bottom line is that there is a lot of about the film I didn't like and a lot I thought was done really well. So I'm pretty dead even on this film. But I'll give the film the benefit of the doubt until I watch it again someday.\n\n+Valli\n\n+Thrilling final sequence\n\n+Welles\n\n-Twist is predictable\n\n-Score\n\n-Slowly paced\n\n6.0/10"

Pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives to the city looking for a job his good friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has promised him. Immediately upon arrival he finds out that Lime has been run over by a car. Police think it a simple accident, but Martins has other ideas.\n\nReed is a known expressionist and this shows heavily in the film. Dutch angles fill almost every shot and a lot of time is given for the buildup and the atmosphere of the city. And the film is to be praised for this. Many of the shots seem eerily familiar to the viewer. Not because you've seen the film but because so many later directors and cinematographers have been influenced by it. The shot of Lime's shadow looming against a wall as he slowly approaches is a fine, fine piece of film making and the most iconic the film has.\n\nEerily familiar also describes the story to a tee, but in this case that is not a compliment. The plot is fairly easy to predict, despite of it containing some pretty clever twists. I can only imagine how revolutionary a film such as this one must have seemed like back on its day. But now, as someone who has watched so many other similar films... Well, it honestly makes the film something of a bore. I can appreciate it visually and the actors are extremely talented, but the story didn't leave me with much.\n\nAnd this is honestly the problem with a lot of mid-century films. At least for yours truly. There is something to be said about being one of the first to do something. But if that thing continues to be done better and better throughout the years, is it okay, at some point, to let the first examples go. Am I doing this film and others like it a disservice by not having seen them earlier when I would have been more able to appreciate them?\n\nPerhaps. Or perhaps history and time march on, like they always do. Nevertheless, it's a fine film. Very well made, very well acted. And the story is a good one. The fact that it has been made again so many times since then is a testament to that."

I first saw it as a 7 year old in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since. This is the only perfect movie ever made. I guess most of the great things about photography and charisma and zither theme and story have been said by people far more articulate than I. However, there are two points I would like to make. Firstly, the camera angles seem to be designed to preclude the viewer from ever being comfortable in involvement with what is not meant to be a comfortable story. Secondly, the ending is just perfect, but the scene just prior to the ending is even more so. Watch as Lime is trapped in the sewer and Calloway tells Martins to shoot him. Harry turns to Holly and gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Holly pulls the trigger. Now that has some impact!"

The only thing I didn't like was how the female lead turned out, I couldn't believe her reactions in the end. Still, it is worth a look!

        "review_detailed_main": "The Third Man is a noir thriller set in postwar Vienna which tells the story of a couple of Americans trying to renew a childhood friendship in a foreign country after growing up to be very different people. Like all of Graham Greene's fiction, the film makes themes of betrayal, the loss of innocence, and the true difficulty of forming apparently simple moral judgements.\n\nMany people count this as their favourite movie, which is remarkable for a British film of the 1940s. It is just a very successful coming-together of many wonderful talents: Greene wrote a classic screenplay, Carol Reed's direction is inspired genius, and Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotton and others contributed unforgettable performances. Anton Karas's theme music is legendary. The cinematography is stunning.\n\nYou can become obsessed with this film, and if you do you will want to read Charles Drazin's excellent 1999 book \"In Search of the Third Man\". I also recommend the reviews by the eminent British critic Philip French, who has much of interest to say about the sources for Greene's screenplay."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is obviously a timeless classic and one of the best movies ever. A full sixty years after its filming it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. Brilliant script, brilliant acting, brilliant direction, brilliant cinematography, brilliant music. And all this was shot to the bizarre backdrop of a still rubbled post-war Vienna, one of the first feature movies to be shot in Europe at that time. You can't say fairer than that, can you? I first watched this as a child when I didn't understand much about Penicillin and black-marketeering, but I easily grasped that this charming fellow Harry Lime was one of the evilest lowlives ever to have crept across this earth.\n\nWhat really marks this movie is its authenticity. I doubt whether many inhabitants of Casablanca would have recognised their city in Bogie's eponymous classic, but The Third Man could easily double as a socio-documentary of the city. In scenes such as the one where the little blond boy runs after protagonist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) gleefully exulting \"Murderer, murderer!\", Director Carol Reed readily grasped the Viennese soul and spirit, which very frequently borders on the macabre."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Third Man (1949) ****\n\nCarol Reed and Graham Greene's 'The Third Man' is regarded as one of the greatest and most entertaining films ever made, and I would not for a second disagree. The Third Man contains a quality that is uniquely rare in film: it embodies all that is magnificent about going to the movies. I was not born when this film was made and released. Nor were my parents for another 3 years. Yet the film transcends its age and retains such a great story, and for that it is nearly impossible for anyone to dislike. I love the film. I have since I first saw it, and I've only grown fonder of it as the years pass. I waited for a while to purchase a DVD, as I knew that it was going to be re-released on Criterion. And now, I'm proud to say that I finally own the new 2-disc edition, and very pleased to report that it is one of the best purchases I've ever made.\n\nThe film follows the lost and lonely Holly Martins as he searches post-war Vienna for clues about the death of his friend and supposed-to-be business associate, Harry Lime. He arrives in Vienna on the day of Lime's funeral. There he meets Inspector Calloway who offers him a drive back to town, and then explains that Lime was involved in the underground diluted penicillin ring, which caused the deaths of many. Martins, an unemployed pulp novelist, dedicates himself to finding out the truth and clearing his friends name, only to find out perhaps that Calloway is right, and that perhaps Harry Lime may not be dead after all. His journey takes him through shadowy Vienna and introduces him to shadowy friends of Lime and his girlfriend. Martin's falls in love with her, but her love for Harry is eternal, and perhaps even fatalistic.\n\nThe Third Man contains three key elements which makes it so perfect. First, is the razor sharp dialogue by Graham Greene; second, is Reed's brilliant direction and ingenious shot angles and shadows; third, is the extraordinary zither score. Many then, and even today, find the score perplexing and distracting. But to take it away and The Third Man would lose one of its most important aspects. It manages to be cheerful but not jokey or light. Its ironic tones bring a heavy sense of disillusionment that fits perfectly with the narrative of the film. Robert Krasker's cinematography also presents the film with a disillusioning effect. Many shots are filmed at a tilted angle which throws off the equilibrium of the shots and presents a window into the confusion and upheaval of Martins' world.\n\nThe story is typical of a thriller, but not really typical at all. The entrance of the films biggest star and plot mechanism doesn't even make his entrance until over half way through the film, but his entrance is one of the greatest, and most infamous of all movie entrances. He also delivers the greatest adlib in the history of the movies, the famous 'cuckoo clock' speech. The eventual and inevitable doomed final act culminates in one of the great movie chases. It's not fast and furious like a car chase in Bullitt, but it is slow, meticulous and intelligent like the brilliant metro chase in Melville's 'Le Samourai.' The fatal game of hide and seek is beautifully shot in bleak and shadowy cinematography and rife with the hollow sounds of footsteps, no music.\n\nThe Third Man is one of my all time favorite films. It's as entertaining as any movie, and totally re-watchable. I've seen it at least 10 times so far, and will see it certainly many more than ten times. The Third Man embodies all that is joyful about going to the movies.\n\n4/4"

Although he doesn't appear in person until fairly late in the film, his character, Harry Lime, pervades practically every scene. Joseph Cotten may appear an unusual choice to play the American Innocent Abroad, but he is ideal as the man from the New World who is completely out of place in the Old. And Alida Valli is also perfectly cast as the world weary refugee, stateless, obsessed and vulnerable. The film grips from the start, but builds up to an exciting and frenetic climax with the justly famous chase through Vienna's sewers. And that ending... Apparently Graham Green had proposed a happier ending, however the famous final long shot, with Cotton waiting at the side of the road, and Anna walking towards him down the cemetery road through its litter of fallen leaves... is an image that has kept with me ever since I first saw this, perhaps most favoured of favourite, film. A footnote: if you enjoyed this film, try to catch the film Reed made immediately prior to it, \"The Fallen Idol\"."

Unfortunately for me the story just did not cut the mustard. The film noir gene is an acquired taste and I am truly sorry but it is not mine. To me the film was vastly overrated and the stars it gets are given people who are rating it for other things other than the actual plot.

        "review_detailed_main": "Why did I wait so long to watch this film? Only the Lord knows. But what I saw made me find peace: I now know what my favorite film is. I'm sure of it! Before, I toyed around with the ideas of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961) or \"Random Harvest\" (1942), but now I know that I have been waiting to fall in love with \"The Third Man\" all my life.\n\nThe cinematography, script, acting, editing, sound, production design--all superb. Need I go into why? It was like the gods decided to let all of those Hollywood elements fall into place perfectly so that the ultimate film could be made.\n\nAs a big romantic film buff, my first question after the film was naturally, \"So, do Martins and Schmidt get together?\", but that was immediately drowned out by, \"Oh my God, what a film!\" thoughts filling my head. I really started loving it the moment the different establishing shots of Vienna started flashing. Some of the editing there reminded me of editing in films that were released within the past two years--surely, \"The Third Man\" was the originator!\n\nJoseph Cotten made a smashing heartthrob and a hero when I saw him in \"Gaslight\" (1944), and he continues in that status in this film. I thought that Valli was striking in \"The Paradine Case\" (1947), but she *really* shines here. And that first shot of Orson Welles, when the light in the upper bedroom window flashes on and he smiles that subtly diabolical smile--you just know that no one else could have played it the way that he did. Forget \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) for now. Really, do. He is my favorite here.\n\nThe DVD from the Criterion Collection is a must-own. I will order it first thing tomorrow morning. The only gripe that I have is that there is no suitable soundtrack...I really want Anton Kara's zither music. It really is totally unique, and fits eerily AND romantically well in this film. Surely director Carol Reed's move to use only the zither music as the primary soundtrack was exemplary, leading to the similar use of one primary artist in such films as 2000's \"Finding Forrester\". There is a unity and special quality that such soundtracks lend to films, and Reed started it.\n\nThe feel of this film is what films like 1999's \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" aims to recreate. Will it ever happen? I highly doubt it. But until it does, \"The Third Man\" will fill a warm space in our hearts, and I am not one to complain.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I must go search for that soundtrack."

I have not read the Graham Greene novel but I would have to believe that, contrary to the usual book/movie comparisons, this movie has surpassed the book. I say this partly because of the almost dreamlike scenes and camera angles , something of a signature of Welles' work, and partly because of the hauntingly lovely strains of Anton Karas' zither, tying one scene to another and delicately enveloping the whole work. A book cannot do that. I don't know how many times I have seen this movie but, like a fine painting, I see it again at each opportunity. If you have not seen this movie you are missing a major contribution to the world of cinematography."

It's not as if there are any serious contenders from the previous century) - and I was still a trifle disappointed upon seeing it a second time, in a cinema. Not that I disliked it on either occasion.\n\nPart of the problem is that I knew too much about the story. I'm sure you will enjoy your first viewing of `The Third Man' at least twice as much if you know as little as possible about it beforehand. There are people out there who think that if a film is fifty years old it's okay to give away all the surprises, as if we know them all at birth anyway. And then there are those who think that if a film is any good to begin with it can stand having its secrets revealed. Well, yes: people will still take DIMINISHED pleasure in `The Third Man', as I did, if they know what's going to happen. They will also still get some pleasure out of it if forced to watch it from uncomfortable seats. That's no argument in favour of uncomfortable seats. Anyway: you should be VERY careful what you allow yourself to read about this film before you see it. Look over all the comments here with fitful, darting eyes. That applies to my comments, too. Anyone who hasn't seen the movie should stop reading now. Please take this warning seriously.\n\nI'm not too fond of the ending - that pursuit through the sewers. (Although the VERY end, the coda, that long shot of the tree-lined street, was just perfect - as good a closing shot as I have ever seen.) This is the kind of ending you get when no-one can think of an ending. Maybe it would work better if Harry Lime were a sympathetic character; but despite what so many people say, he's NOT a sympathetic character, and he isn't meant to be; or if he IS meant to be, then Graham Greene and Carol Reed and Orson Welles have misunderstood their own creation. Obviously, Lime is meant to have some charm. He's meant to have whatever it takes to win over Anna and Holly. But he's not there to win US over, not even in the slightest degree. `The Third Man' is the story of someone who is close friends with a man who, as WE recognise, is a monster. We're shown that he's a monster before we even meet him and sense that he's up to no good long before that. However laden with charm Welles's performance may be it comes too late to fool us. In any event, Harry Lime is clearly the kind of charmer who works on one victim at a time, and he never gets a spare moment to cast his spell over the audience. I think, though, that everyone assumed that this MUST be the story of a likeable rogue, including perhaps the writer, which is why the film's climax never really ignites.\n\nThat's my only complaint about the film itself. In fact I agree with all the other favourable remarks people have made, about the story, characters, presentation and music - I only wish I had been allowed to watch the film in the correct frame of mind."

This also has amazing cinematography and editing, with some camera angles that I have not seen in anything from the late 40's, or many other places, for that matter. The lighting is also gorgeous. I understand that this is British Noir, a sub-genre I don't believe I've been exposed to before. The script is marvelous. Every character is great, well-developed and credible, and the dialog is all sharp and delivered with perfect timing. The plot is brilliant, compelling and intriguing, and not so convoluted that you can't follow it, or even require a second viewing to piece it all together, and the mystery and its conclusion are satisfying. Every acting performance is spot-on, and there is a lot of charm and chemistry to it. Heck, *the kid*, whose age I cannot possibly imagine had hit double digits at the time, is quite good, and certainly convincing. This actually uses other languages than English when it makes sense, German and Russian, often broken. Tension and suspense is built up well in this. The only negative I can really say about this is that the score, whenever it appears in the last half of the picture, is disruptive and draws attention to itself in how little it fits in tone with what's going on. I have experienced that in other older movies. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief mild to moderate violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and this type of fiction. 10/10"

        "review_title": "from Casablanca to Vienna",
        "review_detailed_main": "Were the 1940s the best years in cinema history? The top three films on my personal list were made at the beginning of that decade. One of them is - you guessed it! - 'Casablanca'. If we can say that 'Casablanca' opens the cinematic decade, this is masterfully closed by 'The Third Man', the 1949 film by Carol Reed. In many ways these are mirror films. Both take place in the shadow of the terrible world war that is not seen on the screen. In one the fighting takes place in Europe, far from Casablanca, in the other the war has been over for several years and has left Vienna occupied, divided, in ruins. The locations are 'exotic', but in a very different way. Both films are about friendships at test and love stories, with love triangles between two men and a woman. In none of them does the 'good guy' end up with the woman he falls in love with. The actors, the cinematography, the soundtrack are formidable in both films.\n\nThe script of 'The Third Man' was written by Graham Greene. The screenwriter, the director, the producers all knew the war from personal experiences. Today we look at this film as a historical story, and the formidable images of Vienna bombed and divided into occupation sectors are also a document. Robert Krasker's cinematography also received an Academy Award, the only one won by this film and the first ever won by an Australian. For the filmmakers, however, it was about a realistic film in contemporary landscapes. This is the scene of a drama in which Holly Martins, an American writer of cheap novels, comes to meet Harry Lime, a childhood friend, to find that he has just died. Instead of a meeting, he arrives at the funeral. Accident? Crime? Or maybe none of these? Holly will try to solve the mystery of Harry's disappearance. He will find out that he was involved in criminal business. He will meet Anna, his lover, an actress who was hiding under a false identity to avoid being sent beyond the Iron Curtain. The plot has subterranean ramifications - literally and figuratively.\n\n'The Third Man' is one of those films that can be pinpointed in geography and historical moment, and yet manages to be universal. One of the secrets is filming in the city that was experiencing the scars of the war and the consequences of the occupation. Filming on the streets of Vienna and using local extras, everything feels authentic. 'Dutch angles', i.e. Shots with the tilted camera amplify the tension and uncertainty surrounding the fate of the characters. A special quality is given to the film by the music performed on the zither and composed by Anton Karas. The use of a single instrument recreated the atmosphere of musical accompaniments from the silent film era, where the piano musically accompanied the images seen on the screen. Orson Welles only appears halfway through the film - but what an appearance! This is one of his best roles, even if today it would be considered only a supporting role. Welles is said to have contributed much more - dialogue, direction suggestions - but today his degree of involvement in the production is disputed. I liked Joseph Cotten less in the lead role and think that if Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant had played Holly (as other rumors claim it was considered) the film would have been better. I'm not a big fan of Trevor Howard either and this movie didn't change my mind. Alida Valli on the other hand, as Anna, is fascinating. She radiates an exotic beauty and reflects an inner drama that makes her attachment at any cost to the man who doesn't deserve her love seem painfully poignant. The final scene is masterful and seems to conclude not only the film but an entire cinematic decade."

        "review_title": "Visitors from the New World find the Old World a bomb site",
        "review_detailed_main": "According to Wiki, legendary film critic Roger Ebert said, \"Has there ever been a film where the music more perfectly suited the action than in Carol Reed's The Third Man? And yet recently I heard a Youtuber, one of those reactions video people, describe the music as \"obnoxious\", also inappropriate to the film's subject. Hmmm. Wiki also reports this: In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past.\" Different places, different times, different people - different viewpoints. I guess that's right for a film whose protagonist attracts such wildly different characterisations and confused emotions.\n\nIt's fascinating to see post-WW2 Vienna in this movie. The sewer scenes, or some, were shot in UK at Shepperton, and probably some interior scenes. Vienna is a magnificent, surreal bomb site of a city, with a bizarre collision of nationalities and everything flipped from official to unofficial, clean to black market, or simply everything is in the grey, trying to survive and struggle on. The zither music, for me, aside from being a unique cinematic attribute, allows the movie a kind of queasy humour, as if dignified proceedings were taking place in a world of carnival and farce. Certainly there's nothing cliched about the music, nor the movie's ending (director Carol Reed had to fight to hold onto the ending as shown).\n\nI don't think I liked this film when I was a boy. Not enough action. Maybe too much Viennese melancholy. Getting older can mean becoming freer with regard to certain things, even as one becomes fussier and habit-bound. I watch the character played by Joseph Cotton, pulp novelist Holly Martins, playing detective and wallowing in his hopeless love, with a good deal of headshaking sympathy. Looking at Alida Valli, in the role of Anna Schmidt, it's easy to see why he'd fall so hard. She's Italian, by the way, playing a Czech pretending to be Austrian (or German); anything to avoid the Russian authorities. Magnificent because, not inspite of, limited screen time, is Orson Welles as Harry Lime. This is a bit like Sir Anthony Hopkin's brief, Oscar-winning turn in The Silence of the Lambs, but with more flattering costume and lighting. British actor Trevor Howard is unrecognisable from the soppy lover in Brief Encounter, and it's nice to see Bond movie legends Bernard Lee and Geoffrey Keen in smaller roles.\n\nThe Third Man, which in case I forgot to mention is all about an American trying to investigate the shady circumstances of his shady friend's death, conveys a good deal of feeling, contained emotion, without sentimentality. Sang froid and a few doses of drunken self pity, and some low key humour, such as the scene where four nationalities of police come to arrest Anna, the Russian stern, the German demanding, the British sympathetic, the French making sure the lady doesn't forget her lipstick. The film also doesn't go in for explicitness, so, as an example, the visit to the hospital ward is neither maudlin nor grotesque, leaving the horrible results of the contaminated Penicillin to our imagination. The askew camera work also cements the image of a world rocked by a massive earthquake, WW2.\n\nOk, so it's a legendary classic. Wiki informs us that the BFI voted it, in 1999, the Greatest British Film. I'd never really thought of it as a British film, but then the Americans think of Game of Thrones as an American thing, despite the largely British cast, European settings and fantasy-medieval world. We don't always know who we're dealing with, do we Harry?"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Third Man\" is a fascinating film noir that masterfully combines suspense, mystery, and an unforgettable atmosphere. Set in post-WWII Vienna, the film captures the decaying beauty of a city divided and grappling with the aftermath of war. The story follows Holly Martins, a pulp fiction writer, as he investigates the suspicious death of his friend Harry Lime.\n\nThe film's standout element is undoubtedly its stunning cinematography. The use of shadows, tilted angles (known as Dutch Angles), and stark contrasts creates a haunting visual style that perfectly complements the film's noir mood. The famous zither score by Anton Karas is another highlight, adding an eerie, almost whimsical quality to the unfolding drama.\n\nOrson Welles (one of my favourite directors) delivers a captivating performance as Harry Lime, with his brief but definitely memorable screen presence leaving a lasting impression. His iconic molonogue on the Ferris wheel is chilling and thought-provoking, just as you would whistle in the dark, encapsulating the themes of mor ambiguity and the corrupting influence of power.\n\nWhile the plow can be a bit slow at times (I watched the UK version), and some of the dialogue may feel dated, this movie remains a classic for a good reason. Its atmosphere, visual style, and memorable performances make it a must-watch for any fan of film noir or classic cinema. The film's exploration of post-war morality and human nature adds depth to what could have been just another whodunit detective story, making it a truly compelling watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "That's what Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) became, and his was the lead role in the film.\n\nI am unsure why they called it \"The Third Man\", I know why , its because the porter noticed a 'third man' helping to carry Harry Lime's (Orson Welles) body across the street, who became a point of interest for Holly Martins, to discover who he was, which he never did. But since that was only a small part of the film, I don't understand why they called it that, Maybe 'Funeral in Vienna' or something like that.\n\nThere are a few misconceptions about this film, firstly it is not a Spy film, although its set in Vienna just after WW2 (lots of spies) and with the tensions between east and west, and that the original story is written by Graham Greene who mostly wrote Spy novels, also Harry Lime is not a Spy (nor is the third man), and its not the best film of all time, as per what many people say. Its actually a crime thriller, based in Vienna, in that time period, but it is a good film, very good, but surely not the 'best of all time'. Another thing is that Orson Welles got a lot of credit for this film, but he's hardly in it, even in the sewer scenes, where they used a double, as Welles refused to go down there (They are the real sewers of Vienna). Joseph Cotten is the real star, in the lead role, and he does an excellent job, Using real Viennese scenes, European actors and Viennese extras was also crucial to the realism, also the story line, based on an original story, by Graham Greene, but which was fiction.\n\nThe main story being that Harry Lime faked his death before being caught by the police for supplying faulty drugs, which ruined the health or killed many children, the mystery was surrounding his death. Alida Valli was excellent has the the 'beauty', showing what a good actress she was, Trevor Howard, who is usually good, did not disappoint. And it was aided by several good British character actors, playing brits.\n\nI did like it a lot, but not as much as others, and although Orson did act well in his few minutes on screen, it was only as good as a support role would be. He did not have enough screen time to do more.\n\nVery good, but not the best."

Here goes: Harry is dead, and yet he's still causing trouble to the people in his surrounding!\n\nNot necessarily a personal favorite, but I'll gladly admit that \"The Third Man\" is one of the most astounding film-noirs ever made, and this has everything to do with the immediate post WWII-timing and setting in Vienna, Austria. Half of the city (and thus also the filming locations) are still in ruins from the devastating war, the local populace is unfriendly and distrustful, and clandestine activities pop up everywhere due to poverty and lack of perspectives. In this woeful environment, the American pulp novelist Holly Martins is trying to clear out the mysterious death of his lifelong friend Harry Lime, but his findings will not bring satisfaction.\n\nSober but brilliant cinematography and directing, legendary music (by Anton Karas), and stellar performances by Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and the inimitable Orson Welles. Those are the aspects that contribute to the brilliance of \"The Third Man\", but - as said - the authentically depressing sight & atmosphere of Vienna in the year 1949 is what truly makes it an indestructible cinematic classic."

I strongly recommend avoiding other versions - the transfers do not do this beautiful film and its unique soundtrack justice.\n\nCarol Reed's the Third Man follows desperate pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) through the streets of post-war Vienna as he attempts to discern the truth about the death of his boyhood friend and would-be benefactor Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Lime was killed by a truck driven by his own driver on the very day that Martins arrived in Vienna to begin work with Lime on a prosperous business venture. The main witnesses were two shady Austrians and a mysterious third man who nobody seems able to identify.\n\nAs Martins digs deeper, he begins to understand the deep corruption of his new-found home through an adversarial acquaintance with a British military policeman (Trevor Howard) and slowly falls for Harry's similarly mysterious former lover, Anna Schmidt (Valli).\n\nCotten makes a rather unsympathetic character (Martins is a classic noir loser) sympathetic. In a role that is barely a cameo, Welles creates an unforgettable persona. Valli is remarkable. And Howard and the rest of the supporting cast are great. Despite the excellent cast, however, what makes The Third Man the great film that it is the combination of absolutely perfect noir cinematography, an entirely believable and compelling story set in exactly the right location, and tight, powerful, directing. And the unusual zither-dominated soundtrack helps to make the film unique even among noirs.\n\nLike many of Kurosawa's best efforts, every scene of The Third Man is wonderfully framed and painted in stark contrasts, making the camera as much of a performer as any member of the cast. It's BAFTA award (best British film), Cannes Palm d'Or(Grand Prize), and Oscar (cinematography) are minor achievements in comparison to the film's lasting impact on its genre and on cinematography in general."

Intelligent film making at its very best with great story telling, atmospheric photography and music perfectly capturing the immediate post war chaos of a shattered city with masterly direction from Carol Reed to top off Graham Greene's screenplay. All the performances are excellent, but my particular favourite is Trevor Howard as the world weary Major Calloway who steals the film even from Orson Welles. Joseph Cotten is underrated and does a tremendous job as the central glue to the plot, which is not an easy part to play. Ignore the Philistines who demand everything goes at 100mph.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Third Man is one of that smattering of pictures that have become the epitome, not just a movie that would continue to inspire countless other films but a paradigm that would embed itself deep within the id of a massive amount of viewers, counting people who've never even seen it. The first time you do, your encounter is sprinkled with little jolts of recognition, lines and scenes and moments whose resonance have already made their way to you intermediately.\n\nAlthough both Greene and director Carol Reed were British, the perspective of this pinball machine of a movie feels very American, a detail that's only partially clarified by the presence of Cotten and Welles. Post-war Vienna characterizes Europe's remains. It's thick, for sure, with actual remains, though the diversely twisting and regal structural design of its more practical edifices looks devastated by being rendered worthlessness. Similarly, most of the Europeans we see are remarkably played by an ensemble of Austrian and German character actors, who correspond superbly with the mixed doubts and disdain of the inexperienced American, Holly Martins, who lumbers through the alleys, down the holes, up the ladders, seemingly a toy of fate, but one who appears to usually break even. The American Martins is upfront, yet surrounded by Europeans, and their paths oscillate between confrontation and tiptoeing, like minor cultural traits represent an inherent bylaw.\n\nWelles is, sure enough, the mind-body dualism of the story. His character is mentioned in each scene, in addition to the title, and has the most hands-down unforgettable lines in the script. Moreover, his interactions with Cotten, a recurrent performer in his directorial work, take on Welles's distinguishing metrical hallmark: mood intersecting and colliding with figure of speech, lines treading on lines in a persistent roundabout of broken tides.\n\nReed, a director far too obscure in the US, made outstanding films both preceding and following this one. Reed was amply accommodating to offer a noteworthy argument against the auteur theory. The Third Man is constant with his superlative form, wheedling a taut drama with penetratingly illustrated characters, in a locale so defined it may too be regarded among the cast.\n\nThe Third Man is such a hysterically visual event that it's easy to overlook what a petite, intuitive film it basically is. Think about how Anton Karas, without whose score the picture wouldn't be remotely the same, was discovered on location, playing in a restaurant. That kind of fortuitous find, during production, of a deep-seated constituent of a movie would've been tough if not unimaginable in Hollywood even then. The Third Man is indeed a virtuoso progression of make-or-break gambles, a sort of contrarian recipe of contrasting essentials that somehow come together as if they had been fated to. It's an extraordinary item, an accident, a well-lubricated mechanism, a historic cache, an innovative sensation. There has never been another movie entirely like it."

The performance of Joseph Cotten is very good, but the real star of the movie is Orson Welles who shines every time he is on the screen.\n\nThe plot is about a pulp western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) who travels to Viena after WW2 to work with his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but when he gets there he is surprised to find out that Harry is being buried at the cemetery after he died in an accident run over by a car. Holly is not convinced that Harry's dead was an accident because of the contradictions of some witnesses about a man (the third man) who was or wasn't present when Harry Lime died, so he will begin his own investigation to find out the truth.\n\nThe last shot of the movie is really a masterpiece like the movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "It took me several years and a lot of thought, but as someone who enjoys movies, I selected \"The Third Man\" as the greatest film ever made. I have a list of similar favorite films, and it is hard to rank them in order of preference (it often depends on my mood, so many are equally great).\n\nHere are a few reasons:\n\n1) \"The Third Man\" is the most outstanding reason for why I love to go to the movies. It welds images, sounds, dialogue and music into my memory, my personality, and my soul. When I think of why I love the cinema, I think of this film as an example.\n\n2) Joseph Cotten. The man has a screen presence wrought not from the elements which make other \"Great\" actors like Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart or Jimmy Stewart, but from his own normalcy. He is Joseph Cotten, a nice guy, someone you'd like to have speak for you at a college admissions board or at a traffic court. He's the kind of guy you hope your new girlfriend's dad is like. He's not just \"nice\", either, in a Cary Grant way. We actually like the guy. And it is this niceness which hurts us most when we see what he must do.\n\n3) Alida Valli. She was in the 1977 hidden treasure \"Suspiria\", but otherwise dropped from view after this film, in which she blasted through a handicap (that accent) with the most affecting female performances of all time--we love her and hate her, because she's the unrequited love to end all unrequited loves.\n\n4) Orson Welles. He's such a convincing bad guy, but he's the coolest. In the pantheon of directors, he was sometimes overlooked as an actor, but here he tops them all. He almost has us taken by his scheme, and we doubt the movie (and Major Calloway) will be able to counter him. It does, nearly, and he becomes both the despicable rat villain and the glorious rebel martyr at the same time.\n\n5) The zither score.\n\n6) The final shot."

The story was fantastic, the acting was superb (Orson Wells' monologue on the Ferris Wheel = ausgezeichnet), and the scenery was unbelievable.\n\nNow my view of the film may be a bit skewed; seeing as how I'm currently studying abroad in Vienna and I just watched the movie for the first time in Vienna. Seeing old Stephansdom and Ruprechtskirche in 1949 was a moving experience. Witnessing a city in ruin really made the destruction of Europe after the second world war come alive and it added infinitesimally to the undertones and tensions of the story. Orson Wells was astounding. He wasn't on the screen for long, but when he was he was fantastic.\n\nThe one thing I felt could have been improved was the music. But overall it was an incredible experience. See it in WIEN! and then go on a walk and visit all the sights from the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I haven't watched this for 30 years. It is the consummate example of using light and darkness to produce effect. It involves the death of one Harry Live (Orson Welles) and the attempt by a friend to juggle his loyalties with his moral duty to try to fathom the circumstances. This is a film about mood and face. It's a bit expressionistic and off kilter. The one most important thing is that it fires on all cylinders. Joseph Cotten is magnificent as the man who steps into more than he knows. He meets a woman who despite LIme's evildoing can't stop loving him. As soon as we expect something to happen, there is a twist. When we expect characters to change they don't. There is a whole series of vignettes that are priceless. One of my favorites is when Cotten, a hack writer of Westerns, is forced to lecture on his literary techniques to a crowd of intellectuals who are asking him questions about James Joyce and others. He is in fear for his life at the time and the whole thing becomes a surreal event. Post war Vienna, Austria, is also a character in this film because it is actually four cities, divided, each with its own idiosyncrasies. This is one of the best films in history and does not disappoint."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't help believing THE THIRD MAN is a film highly regarded because of its technical achievements rather than by its story . The plot itself is rather simplistic : American writer Holly Martins gets a message from his friend Harry Lime offering him a job in Vienna and when he arrives in the city he discovers Harry is dead . There's a mystery involved in how Harry died but because everyone is so familiar with the plot twists ( This film was made nearly 20 years before I was born ) there's no real surprises as to the story\n\nThe film ( Can we describe it as \" film noir \" ? ) succeeds because of its breath taking technical achievements . from the opening shot we're shown a montage of shots of post war Vienna , some real life film footage , some specifically shot for the movie with a voice over that is breath takingly conversational . When ever a film opens with a voice over it's always done by some dour American but here it's said by some cheerful English chappie . This alone sticks out in the mind and clearly states that it's a !!!!! British !!!! film . I don't mean a \" British made film \" financed with American money , I mean a film that was made by a British studio . Of course Carol Reed has an eye for an American market hence his casting of Orson Welles as Harry Lime and it's Welles casting that helps make THE THIRD MAN the screen legend that it is . He has very few lines but Welles speech about the cuckoo clock was ad libbed by the actor and is one of the most memorable lines in cinema . But for me the stand out aspect of the movie is the Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Krasker , it's impossible to think of this movie without thinking of shadows against walls\n\nThere are a couple of flaws though . Considering Austria is in such a bad state after losing the war a couple of years previously I couldn't help noticing that scotch is freely available ! I know the black market is booming ( That's part of the plot ) but even so th way people reach for a bottle and pour themselves a stiff drink seems very unlikely , I mean how many people do you know that drink that amount of booze ? and we're in a period of time where strong liqueur is very easy to acquire . Can I just repeat that because the over familiarity of the story the plot holds no surprises ? Perhaps I' , the first person to point this out by saying I don't like the score . Anton Karras plays the zither and after a few scenes I found myself being irritated by it"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a devotee of post-World War II black-and-white realism, whether it be the films of Vittorio De Sica or American movies like ON THE WATERFRONT and 12 ANGRY MEN. THE THIRD MAN, Carol Reed's classic from 1949, can be considered one of the first \"Method movies\"; certainly Orson Welles' acting in the great Ferris Wheel scene is more naturalistic than your typical 1940's acting, and the slanting camera angles and evocative shadows lend this film an artistic, poetic quality lacking in many potboilers of the era. Graham Greene's script for THE THIRD MAN too has literary quality and depth; in classic film noir fashion, it presents a cynical, pessimistic view of life in which humanity is caught in a web of deceit, upright moral actions do not yield a story-book ending, and a woman would rather be true to a dead lover and his corrupt values than wake up to a better love that awaits her. The powerful, expressive images\u0097a fleeing shadow down an alleyway, a long tree-lined road past a cemetery, a puff of silver smoke from a train, the dying Harry Lime's hands grasping at life through a sewer grate, as well as that magnificent underground network itself\u0097will haunt you, and you will feel enriched by this superb film."

        "review_detailed_main": "A young American novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), arrives in Vienna looking for his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Once in the city, however, he learns that Harry Lime has passed away. Shocked, Holly Martins starts asking questions, a lot of them. He is told a number of different stories that eventually lead him to believe that Harry Lime was killed.\n\nDetermined to find out who is responsible for Harry Lime's murder, the American embarks on a treacherous journey amidst the unfriendly streets of Vienna. Soon, he is entangled in a web of deceit and dangerous machinations. Along the way, the American also encounters the beautiful Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech national with forged Austrian papers, who agrees to help him.\n\nWritten by the legendary Graham Greene, Carol Reed's The Third Man is a terrific hybrid of a film where noir, neo-realism and Hollywood bravado are mixed to perfection. Set in post-war Vienna, the film is very much a dark caricature of sorts where the finesse, elegance and tradition of Old Europe are seen through the eyes of a naive but ambitious American looking for his missing friend.\n\nContrary to what many critics have claimed, the actual story is rather complicated. A giant mystery surrounding Oscar Welles' character, Harry Lime, is slowly peeled off, piece by piece. As a result, The Third Man quickly evolves into a guessing game where every little detail is worth analyzing. As expected for a noir-film, there is also a dangerous femme fatale who becomes a prominent player as soon as the main protagonist reaches Austrian soil.\n\nIn addition to strong dark overtones, The Third Man also boasts a great deal of nihilism. Betrayal and impossible love for example are depicted by Carol Reed with a sense of realism that feels uncannily contemporary. Not surprisingly, The Third Man works incredibly well not only as a non-stop adventure film, but also as a realistic depiction of a world struggling to recuperate after an enormous tragedy.\n\nFurthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American. The clash of cultural ideologies, as witnessed through the interactions between Alida Valli and Joseph Cotton, is particularly impressive. There are entire scenes where Carol Reed focuses on the American whose alarming naivety produces some of the most hilarious yet, disturbing sequences that compliment the mystery.\n\nFinally, Anton Karas' soundtrack is beautiful. The mellow sounds produced by his zitner grant The Third Man with an entirely new flavor, one that blends with the dark vistas from Vienna's sewers exceptionally well. Not surprisingly, the atmosphere The Third Man sustains is often cited as its greatest strength."

Music is by Anton Karas and cinematography by Robert Krasker.\n\nWhen writer Holly Martins (Cotton) travels to Vienna to hook up with his childhood friend Harry Lime (Welles), he is distressed to find that Harry has been killed in a road accident. After attending the funeral, Holly comes to believe that Harry's death was no accident and begins to try and clear his friend's name. But nothing is as it first seems.....\n\nIt's well over 60 years since it was released and Carol Reed's film noir thriller continues to feel fresh and hold up under the closest of critical scrutiny. A haunting tale as it is anyway, the black market racketeers and penicillin tampering bastards leaving an unsavoury taste in the mouth, but the film is still further boosted by the director's ability to craft unnerving atmosphere by way of style and clinically paced passages of play. Performances are superlative across the board, with the film producing equal amounts of iconography and mischievous myth-making. It stuns with the narrative structure unfolding amongst a post war ravaged Vienna that dovetails with the fractured nature of the human characters.\n\nA maze of moist cobbled streets do host foot chases involving man and long shadows, there's a fairground scene that is now steeped in folklore, which in turn is a witness to the banality of evil, and of course those cavernous sewers, home to such sullen tones. Reed brings the canted angles, with moral decay the order of the day and a side order of confusion to finally fill your noir hungry bellies. Krasker deals in expressionistic chiaroscuro as Karas plucks away at his Zither to land in your ears for eternity. A murder mystery, a pained romance and a suspense laden film noir, The Third Man is enduring in its qualities. Cuckoo clock and cat, shadowed doorway and the lone sombre walk of a female, it's still today entertaining the film purist masses and still being pored over by film makers home and abroad. The Third Man, it's a masterpiece by jove. 10/10"

The main villain is dreadfully shallow, \"I am evil for the sake of being evil\", but not twisted or demented in any interesting fashion like Heath Ledger's Joker from the Dark Knight trilogy.

        "review_detailed_main": "Many reviewers of \"The Third Man\" have noted the themes of truth and justice versus love,friendship, and loyalty, and there are those, but the work of the source novelist and screenwriter Graham Greene, is never far from the slippery interfaces of good and evil, and director Carol Reed doubles down on that theme by packaging Harry Lime's moral depravity in the magnetic figure of Orson Welles.\n\nWe have no trouble spotting the seamy evil of the unctuous Baron Kurtz, the weaselly Dr. Winkel, or the brutal Mr. Popescu. But, in the scene in which Joseph Cotten's Holly Martins first sees Lime, when Welles is revealed in the doorway beneath Anna's apartment, in what Martin Scorcese has called one of the most thrilling moments in film, we are dazzled by Welles's urbane smile, and are no more prepared to believe that Lime is responsible for the crimes Major Callaway has described than were Martins and Anna. With only about 15 minutes of screen time, Welles steals the show because of the dissonance between what we have been told of Lime and what we see: Welles, with all his sparkling charisma, charm, wit, and polished elegance. Welles's Lime retains his pull on us even as the worst is revealed. It takes Callaway's \"magic lantern show\" to convince Martins, and us, that this irresistible character is a moral monster.\n\nLime is a \"charmer\" in both senses of the word -- both a charismatic wit and a seducer, a deceiver -- he seduced Martins figuratively, and Anna literally, but he seduces both of them, and the audience, emotionally. Yet, like Anna's cat, which she says \"only liked Harry,\" Lime is an amoral creature, he has no real connection with anyone. On the Ferris wheel, those moving below are \"dots\" whose only value to Lime are twenty thousand pounds each if they \"stopped moving forever.\" Martins tells Callaway he met Lime \"back in school. I was never so lonesome in my life until he showed up.\" At one point, Martins makes a Freudian slip, saying to Callaway, \"I guess nobody really knew Harry like he did ... like I did.\" Lime radiates bonhomie and captures others by warming them with his counterfeit intimacy and enthusiasm. Martins says to Callaway \"We never did much. He just made things . . . fun.\"\n\nDuring the Ferris wheel ride, Lime attempts to manipulate Martins, offering one then another of a repertoire of gambits -- appeals to friendship and \"old times,\" appeals for sympathy, thinly veiled threats, joviality -- attempting to bring Martins around. At the end of the meeting, Lime even has ready a facile historical comparison with which to further confuse Martins -- the famous Borgias-cuckoo clock speech. It's a rhetorical pirouette and leap off the stage so beguiling that it almost allows us to avoid the recognition that Lime is sociopath of the type to which the weak, the lonely, the naive,the self-pitying, and the poorly grounded give their souls, just as had been shown yet again in the then all-too-recent war. Lime's comparison of himself with the Borgias is transparent nonsense -- it's Lime's own delusion -- but it is the type of contextual sleight-of-hand that, in combination with his indefatigable good spirits and boyish enthusiasm, has always carried all before it for Harry, and by which he has always been able to keep the loyalty of those he needed.\n\nBy the end of the film, it is clear that the war, in which good triumphed over evil, has, nonetheless, inured everyone to evil, especially in so attractive a form as Lime. Martins and Anna remain as deluded as they were at the beginning. As Martins says in the first line of the opening voice-over, \"I never knew the Vienna of the Strauss waltzes.\" Yes, it is indeed gone.\n\nThe long, achingly sad, final shot, after Lime's burial -- when Martins gets out of Callaway's jeep and waits for Anna, who walks from the cemetery down the cold, bleak road lined with pollarded trees and passes him (and the camera) without a glance -- reinforces the thematic tensions of the film: Having been compromised in loyally defending Lime, Martins is no less compromised in having betrayed him, even despite having ultimately accepted the responsibility of eliminating Lime himself in a kind of coup de grace. Moreover, Martins's acquired \"virtue\" in betraying Lime does not win him Anna. How could it? Martins's inadequacies are unchanged for her, and whatever Lime was, her life is empty without him. Friendship and loyalty may require the ballast of a shared morality. Love need not be so bound. Anna passes, the zither trembles, Martins flings his match, the end.\n\n\"The Third Man\" is not a great film because it's everyone's cup of tea. There is no anchoring character to channel our understanding and reactions. There is no \"hero\" to pull for. As Lime tells Martins, \"Oh, Holly, you and I aren't heroes. The world doesn't make any heroes outside of your stories.\" The film's protagonist is feckless and maudlin, the leading lady is desolate and inconsolable. The most fascinating and dynamic character is a heartless scoundrel. There is no hope for any of them. All their struggles have led to greater sorrow. In drawing upon the film, one is left to one's own orientation in a moral spacewalk. It is a great film because, from the concerns of a handful of obscure people in a ruined city in the wake of war, it presents a rueful view of the sorrows, contradictions, and tragedy of human struggles and obligations. As Calloway tells Martins, \"Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.\""

Then add to that a perfect setting such as you have in post-war Vienna. I can't think of another movie, other than San Francisco in \"Vertigo\", where perhaps a city figures so prominently into the fabric of a film.\n\nThe cinematography is the other stand out quality of the film. So much of the dark mood and somberness and suspense is captured by the angular and tense camera work.\n\nMy only complaint is the zither music. While many love it and think it sets just the right mood, I find it very distracting and annoying. This fact causes it to detract from the movie rather than adding anything to it. Perhaps if it was toned down some, or used less frequently it would have a been a better addition to the film. I understand that it is a classic instrument to Austria, but to me the tone of it was all wrong for the film. Maybe back in the period this was filmed it was more understood. But I just found it completely strange and out of place. Perhaps this was another piece of the \"unexpected\" they were trying to add to the film, like the unexpected twists and turns. But again, to me, it was just a distraction."

        "review_detailed_main": "A classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post WWll Vienna, `The Third Man,' directed by Carol Reed, stars Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles. Looking for work, American pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins (Cotton) arrives in Vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend, Harry Lime (Welles), who he has not seen in many years. But Martins is greeted at his hotel-- not by Lime, as he had expected-- but with the news that Lime is dead, having been hit by a truck two days earlier. Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard). Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market. Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him.\n\nIn talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day. And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him. So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words. A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene. And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man.\n\nWorking from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering. The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement. And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film. Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black & white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.\n\nCotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops. And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there. When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained. Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers. His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.\n\nCotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that `regular guy' persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life. The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established. Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly. Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly. It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin). Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, `The Third Man' is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level. The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice. In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector. I rate this one 10/10."

A real one.\n\nBeyond the usual, well-deserved praise for script, photography, editing, direction, music and every single performance, something more personal has developed in my regard, my affection, for The Third Man. Having been born into and brought up in the Cold War atmosphere symbolised by the divided Vienna documented so memorably by Carol Reed and his team, the portrayal by Alida Valli of a woman caught in its web has become increasingly significant with each successive viewing. Over the years, the set-piece final shot has become so poignant for me that it's become impossible to watch without tears welling up in my eyes. I mention this only because I know there are those who find the camera angles and the lighting - the visual art of the film, if you like - self-conscious. I think the opposite: they are as they are because Reed and his cameraman Robert Krasker are capturing emotions in picture form, emotions that one could have wished would have gone away, concerning the desolation of war, and the moral blurring that the ruin of war encourages. In every gesture, every look that Valli gives, that desolation is evident. It is a great, great performance in a great, great film."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Third Man, directed by Carol Reed, is an excellent film set in post WW II Vienna that offers more than just a slight tip of the hat to Orson Welles style. High camera angles, dark shadows, great speeches by the characters all have a certain Wellesian feel to them. Make no mistake, this is a Carol Reed film, but comparing this to his other films (A Letter from Home, Odd Man Out and Trapeze to name a few) The Third Man has a distinctive style Reed had not used before or after.\n\nThe story is one of an American pulp western writer, Holly Martins, wonderfully played by Joseph Cotton, coming to Vienna at the behest of his friend Harry Lime. Only problem is, when he arrives in Vienna Harry Lime is dead and Holly Martins has nowhere to go. Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) makes an attempt to befriend Martins and help him get back to the States. However, Martins has started asking questions about his friend's untimely demise and the answers don't seem to make sense. He launches his own investigation, questioning Harry Limes friends and work associates and the beautiful Valli, Harry's flame. Naturally, Martins can't help but fall for the sad beauty. He's like a schoolboy trying to prove his worth to her as he attempts to unfold the truth about Harry's death.\n\nThere is a lot going on in this movie thanks to a tightly conceived story and screenplay by Graham Greene. It's not simply a story about Holly Martins bad luck and the search for the truth. Holly is also a stranger in a strange land, out of his league and in over his head. The military is involved because it appears Harry Lime was a black market racketeer. Another man has gone missing and one witness to the accident claims there was a third man at the scene when Harry died. As Major Calloway tells Holly Martins, `Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.'\n\nThroughout the movie the tone is set for each scene by the camera. The camera towers over Holly Martins when he finds out Harry is dead, adding to his characters insignificance. Later hen we meet The Baron, one of Harry's friends we see him slightly off angle. The camera is used to enhance the tension or emotion of the scene, just as Welles would have used it. And when we finally see Welles, he steps from shadow, his face partially illuminated, the camera under him emphasizing his characters power.\n\nThis is a beautiful film with fine acting by Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles. Lime's friends are all mysterious and vaguely dangerous, with the exception of Valli who is somewhat of an innocent. The Vienna location is perfect for this story as the city stands as a stoic participant in the film. And of course, there is the Zither music, adding ambience to each scene. There is humor, romance, tension and intrigue that are seldom blended in movies these days. It is a well-crafted film that leaves us thinking and remembering the characters long after it is over.\n\nI haven't seen a lot of Carol Reed's films, but what I have seen suggests that he crafted this movie carefully, with attention to detail and a slight nod to the style of Orson Welles."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is great. This film is great because it had to be - simple. Everything that you can know about this film leads it to be more intriguing, but even watching it without knowing anything of its history it still fascinates and judging from all these comments that people keep on seeming to write it continues to cause the greatests divides since the invention of long division. Basically it is a film about a racketeering spy, whose faked death rouses an old friend into searching for the true answers. There are many different ways to interpret it further as discussed in other comments here, however I see it as a discussion of duality - between loyalty and betrayal, between the disgust for what Harry does and the need for him to continue, the public minded reporter of Cotten and the secret reports of the spies... all carried on across the divided war-torn city of Vienna, halfway between the polar opposite philosophies of her conquerors at the crossroads of Europe and at a time when the future still hung in the balance.\n\nThe contributions from all sides too, are to the utmost imaginable. Sir Korda, from his own Eastern European stock (and presumably not without pressure from his adopted countryland's government) and acquaintance of such characters in this region and period, as well as Greene (whose personal family history is full of British spies, not to mention his own dubious double-treble -whatever- actions) were able to draw upon their own knowledge to bring together a tale that can only be as close to the truth as the cinematography would allow us to believe. Welles and Cotten reunite the Mercury Theatre in classic roles subtly played with lines such as the famous \"cuckoo-clock Borgia\" text - penned by Welles himself? (and not to be improved upom until paraphrased in The Long Good Friday, substitute Cuckoo-clock for Hamburger and Swiss for American - see!). As well as, whether loved or hated, as both are, the cinematography of Krasker and score of Karas (in the days before soundtrack albums directed at specific market segments - so please have patience!) gelling fitting or not, they are undeniably memorable.\n\nSo what exactly did this leave us to credit Reed with, except the task of bringing this all together in his image and the overlapping contributions to be controlled, so that it would be a picture that lasts (as it has) and remains in the mind as those images of the non-touristic Vienna and Harry and the sound of the Zither do.\n\nThis was a film that could only have been made at this time and should be remembered as such, since even as the producton was coming to an end the city (and world in which this Vienna was formed) was changing around them, as the piles of rubble diminished."

Probably the movie's strongest aspect is the zither music. You can feel it moving the film along, almost as much as the mysterious setting does. But when they set up the trick at the end, it's especially neat how they set it up!

The story follows Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins to post-war Vienna where he is looking for an old friend named Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. It should be pointed out that crime and the black market are running wild in Vienna at the time. Lime doesn't show up as expected and Martins is told that Lime is dead, as a result of an accident. Martins strongly suspects something is amiss and Lime is at the top of the police hit list. Conflicting versions of the accident send him on a long chase. He even attends a funeral for his friend. One would think this is the final word on Lime's whereabouts; however, the chase continues. Through the backstreets and alleyways of Vienna, the audience sees some excellent shots, almost like a series of great photographs in black and white. The realist atmosphere is reinforced by the darkness, shadows, and damp cobblestone streets of the once glamorous capital of Vienna. A frantic chase through the underground sewer system and a ride on the famed Ferris wheel are part of this fast paced movie. There are many fine cast members like Valli, as Harry's former female companion, not to mention the chief of police played by Trevor Howard, as well as Wilfrid Hyde-Whyte and Bernard Lee. (Lee would later become \"M\", James Bond's London espionage contact.) All in all, a movie that movie buffs should consider seeing. It is often included among the greatest films of all time. To me it's a very good movie that ranks in the top 100. A great art house movie but not the greatest of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The third man\" really is an all time classic, but I had to see it a few times before I came to this conclusion.\n\nVienna, damaged by the Second World War, is a perfect location for this film noir. The damage of Vienna, although clearly visible, is nothing compared to the damage of German cities after the Second World War that can be seen in movies such as \"\"Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns\" (1946, Wolfgang Staudte) or \"Germania anno zero\" (1948, Roberto Rossellini). Vienna is nearly a character in the movie and \"The third man\" would not be out of place as the Vienna episode in the city films of Jules Dassin (alongside of \"The naked city\" (1948, New York), \"Night and the city\" (1950, London) and \"Du Rififi chez les hommes\" (1955, Paris)).\n\nThe film quotes and is quoted by some illustrious predecessors and descendants. The use of a ball and balloons refers to \"M\" (1931, Fritz Lang). The sewer plays a vital part in the final shootout of the film. This location was also used (and not only at the end of the movie) in Andrzej Wajda's Second World War movie \"Kanal\" (1957).\n\nWhat I told up till now explains why the film is good, but not why it is brilliant. Since I gave the film a 10-rating there must be something extra, and there is!\n\nFirst of all the cinematography of Robert Krasker, using unusual camera positions whenever it is possible.\n\nSecondly the acting performance of Orson Welles. His character appears rather late in the movie. In the first half it is much talked about but it is never seen. Welles utilizes however all the screen time given to him to the max.\n\nThe famous scene in the Ferris wheel. Black marketeer Harry Lime (Orson Welles) explains his world view in a brilliant quote \" Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\". Was the Second World War not meant to fight against such Nietzsche-like philosophy?\n\nThe film opens and closes with funral scenes of the same person. The first funeral is fake, the second is real. During the first funeral main character Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) gets interested in a mysterious woman (Alida Valli), during the last funaral he finally loses her. These two scenes grant the film a strange sort of symmetry."

Graham Greene's only screenplay is an all time classic on its own, but throw in Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and of course Orson Welles, it becomes one of the all time greats.\n\nHolly Martins is a broke writer, who has arrived in post war Vienna at the behest of his dear friend, Harry Lime, (Orson Welles) on the promise of work. Arriving in a foreign city, which, just happens to be under occupied rule by 4 separate nations, Holly is confused to not be met by his friend. Only later on does he learn that his friend was killed by a car careening out of control. Dazed, he tries to make sense of the news, and wants to find anyone that can help him find out more about his late friend. What he finds, however, will shatter his world, and the friendship he thought was the best in his life.\n\nIf you have not seen this film, please do yourself a favor and watch it. It is so well acted, and directed, that even Vienna and it's denizens become another character unto themselves, all with secrets to keep.\n\nRemember, \"Don't be so gloomy...In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce? The cuckoo clock\""

        "review_detailed_main": "While \"The Third Man\" is often lauded as a classic of cinema, its reputation may overshadow its shortcomings for some viewers. Directed by Carol Reed and set against the backdrop of post-war Vienna, the film's premise of a mysterious murder and the quest for truth fails to deliver a compelling narrative that resonates throughout its runtime.\n\nThe pacing of the film can feel slow and meandering, leading to moments where viewers may find themselves losing interest. The dialogue is occasionally stilted, making it challenging to connect with the characters on a deeper level. Joseph Cotten's portrayal of Holly Martins lacks the depth needed to carry such a complex story, leaving audiences wanting more from his character's development and motivations.\n\nMoreover, the plot, while filled with potential, becomes convoluted at times, which detracts from the suspense that the film aims to build. The infamous 'third man' reveal, while iconic, feels unsatisfying and raises more questions than it answers. Welles' character, Harry Lime, is charismatic yet inconsistent, which can make it difficult to fully invest in the unfolding drama surrounding him.\n\nThough the cinematography and musical score are often praised, they might not be enough to salvage the film's narrative shortcomings for those who prefer a more cohesive and engaging storyline. \"The Third Man\" ultimately feels overhyped, leaving some viewers wondering what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhile \"The Third Man\" deserves recognition for its stylistic achievements, its frustrating pacing and underwhelming character arcs may leave some modern audiences feeling disconnected and disappointed. It stands as a testament to a bygone era but may not hold the same allure for contemporary viewers looking for more substance alongside its style."

Another guy stated that Orson Welles is overrated. I'm not a snob, as a matter of fact, when I was fifteen I'd probably fall asleep watching this film. But any grown up person that gets nothing out of this film should stop reviewing films.\n\nFirst of all, the dialogue in this film is brilliant. After watching it ten times, you'll start dying laughing at some lines...not because they're meant to be humorous or they are silly. Because they're so good, so real, such great lines that when you analyze them, you'll laugh out loud. Like when Calloway gets called Callahan, he responds, Calloway, I'm British, not Irish. Of course an Englishman is going to correct that. Lol there's so many lines like that. Not to mention the cinematography. Brilliant!! The scene when the little boy is pointing at Joesph Cotten and they all chase him. Wow. Orson Welles standing in the doorway, the car by his feet. Anyone that knows what I'm writing about probably loves this movie. Sorry to have to write this for everyone to read but this site should let us respond to other people's reviews. This film is not an opinion, if you love films, especially film noir type of films. You can't criticize this film. There's a reason people will pay close to three hundred dollars for the out of print Criterion blu ray of this movie. They did an amazing job restoring it."

Furthermore, he is sceptical of the circumstances surrounding Lime's death - how did four of his acquaintances just happen to be at the scene?\n\nHe becomes hung up on the identity of the mysterious \"third man\" who, according to the porter at Lime's tenement building, helped carry the body to the pavement."

This is one of the best European film noir, with its distinctive atmosphere of postwar moral chaos and hopelessness, and an unhappy romantic love story that describes the crime and moral decay of the world in which the protagonists are trying to survive.\n\nAfter the end of the second world war-torn Vienna is divided into four zones, each governed by one of the military police of the winning countries - US, Soviet, British and French. Holly Martins (J. Cotten), American writer, comes to Vienna as he was invited by his friend Harry Lime (O. Welles), offering him some work. Holly came to the house where Harry lived in a rented apartment and finds out that Harry was killed the day before - run over by a car in front of the same house. Shocked, Holly finds himself at Harry's funeral and meets two British military officers, Major Calloway (T. Howard) and Sergeant Paine (B. Lee). Calloway is interested in late Harry Lime, and he examines Holly, advising him at the end to leave Vienna because of the danger. Holly meets two of Harry's friends, Baron Kurtz (E. Deutsch) and Popescu (S. Breuer), who allegedly witnessed Harry's death. Exploring the unfortunate circumstances of Harry's death, Holly is puzzled by many contradictions, Holly begins to suspect that something is wrong ... The character of criminal Harry Lime is one of the most charismatic in the history of film, and Orson Welles plays it with a lot of charm and humor. Particularly notable in the film music of Anton Karas zither on a theme Harry Lime is one of the most famous evergreens in history of film music. Reed's film won the 1949 Palme d'Or at Cannes, and the Oscar for best picture."

It is for this reason that acclaimed writer Graham Greene gave full freedom to his creative imagination by creating a character who belonged to the world of literature. It is the writer who emerges as the ultimate hero of the film by sacrificing his friendship for the greater glory of humanity. British film 'The Third Man' revived the sordid atmosphere of wartime Vienna where the growth of black market gave rise to various criminal activities. It was a time which witnessed an absolute dearth of ethical practices in business as black marketers chose to earn huge sums of money by using unfair means. This resulted in the death of many innocent people especially young children. Most leading actors of the post war period have left their mark on the film namely Orson Welles, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard and Joseph Cotton."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have gripes, but first I need to acknowledge how masterful this is overall.\n\nIt's a genuinely suspenseful mystery, with the mysterious Third Man of the title looming over all the proceedings for most of the runtime. Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli anchor the film beautifully as the plot unfolds. And that moment when the mysterious man is finally revealed? Perfection.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of levity to the movie (especially thanks to Cotton's professional writer who knows almost nothing of what he's expected to know within his profession), and even the humor is woven expertly into the suspense, such as when Holly finds himself in a menacing vehicle but ends up somewhere entirely innocent.\n\nYou also have the great morality diatribe on the Ferris wheel, the climactic scene with its labyrinthine pursuit, and a long but perfectly unexpected ending. While I wonder if the experience would be as good upon a second viewing, there is undoubtedly plenty to chew on here, which I love.\n\nNow, a few disappointments hindered my enjoyment of The Third Man somewhat. The meeting that initiates the final chase, for example, is brought on by an uncharacteristically foolish or possibly naive choice from the man coming through the door. Clearly, he has put himself at tremendous risk, and yet he seems to realize this long after we in the audience do. For a character whose (diabolical) intelligence has carried the intrigue of much of the plot, this unfortunately came across as a too-convenient setup for the ending, and thus the filmmakers intruded overly much in their creation.\n\nI'm also undecided on my opinion of the soundtrack. I like the music quite a bit on its own, and I'm usually a fan of music that intentionally doesn't match the expected mood of the scene. However, the main theme is SO jaunty and almost frivolous that, for me at least, diluted some of the philosophical potency of the movie. I wanted it to take itself a bit more seriously, I suppose, but that could be a reflection of me more than anything else.\n\nOverall, though, a great film that deserves its high reputation. I'm glad to have finally seen it."

Later, as he rationalizes his crimes for Martens (Joseph Cotten) during a Ferris wheel ride, he is the epitome of post-war cynicism. The relationship between Welles's and Cotten's characters in this film reminded me of their roles in \"Citizen Kane\", where Cotten has to state the truth or remain loyal to a friend. Other images remain with me after viewing - the loud-mouthed little boy accusing Martens of murder, the old balloon seller appearing out of the night, and the eerie, hypnotic zither music forever in the background. Finally, the climactic chase scene through the sewers of Vienna is one of the most striking black-and-white sequences this side of \"Potemkin.\""

Anton Karras, the zither player, was found in a dingy, cellar cafe in Vienna. Becoming well known for the background music and then his \"Third Man Theme\" record which was a tremendous hit worldwide, he was talked into opening a nightclub in London. Even though the nightclub was successful, Karas yearned for his former life and packed it in, going back underground to the cellar cafe in Vienna to play his zither. In one scene in the film Cotten has finished a talk on American writers. He runs up the hotel stairs pursued by two assassins and enters an empty hotel room. He exits a window, but not before being bitten on a finger by a parrot. I suspect that this \"nip\" was not in the script, but it resulted in the only amusing scene in the entire film. When asked by military policeman Trevor Howard why his finger was bandaged, Cotten replies \"A parrot bit me\", invoking an exasperated reply from Howard. I believe this to be the only funny scene in the film and it was over very quickly. Interestingly there was no novel or play that the film was based on. Graham Green was asked to do a screenplay for a film idea, which he did. Who knows? If this was done more often as opposed to films based on books or plays we might have a better variety of films for our viewing these days."

Unlike Brando in Apocalypse, Welles doesn't disappoint because he is more lyric with his role and more calculated in his approach. His acuity is too powerful for someone like Reed to direct him, how sad. Too bad the rest of the material here can't hold a candle to Welles' prose.\n\nThree Factors I appreciate: noir, black and white, and aged film. The drug scene has obviously changed since this movie, from extreme taboo to almost proud declaration, and B&W has changed from obvious budget cut to \"avant garde\". Pshaw! This is not the Maltese Falcon and mystery ranks with science fiction and horror as the three genres that age the worst. Look at the original version of The Thing or Little Caesar, there's a difference between \"aging\" and \"decomposing\".\n\nThe final 40 minutes are what this is all about. The story and scenes are a gaff, so it's up to the scenery and the setting to provide the atmosphere and the mood. That's noir.\n\nOverall, 2/3 of a rotten apple. Toss it back. Only worth for Welles' contributions and nothing else. (44%)"

The movie has most often been praised for its visual style. A true accomplishment from director Carol Reed, who has never really broken through though. He directed many more great- but lesser known movies throughout his career, that do deserve some more recognition. Perhaps it's due to the fact that he mostly stayed in England and didn't decided on going for a big Hollywood career, like many great British directors from the same era did, that he isn't that well known and his movies didn't received the appreciation they deserved. But to me the foremost reason this movie being timeless is its great story. It's a real typical mystery/thriller story, that has a couple of twists and turns to it. It's unlike for instance the film-noir movies from the same era, that were somewhat more or less being the 'normal' mystery/thriller movies of those days. You could perhaps say that \"The Third Man\" is in that regard already being a more modern movie. The movie often puts its emphasis on its style and then mostly its cinematography. I don't think I have ever seen so many Dutch tilts in one movie but it really works out well for the movie its atmosphere, that tries to be a bit of an uneasy one, for its main character to feel himself alienated in the for him unknown big town, filled with many different nationalities and languages that he doesn't speak or understand at all. The Vienna after the second world war serves as a great backdrop for this movie its story. After WW II the town got divided into different sectors, all ruled by different nations. It was before the cold war, so here we have British, Americans, Russians and French authorities all cooperating in the international zone to solve the movie its mystery. It at times has a surreal and odd feeling to it but even at the time of the production of this movie was still being a fact. The movie also really has some great acting in it. The movie does at times seems a bit dodgy with its accents, I mean it's obvious that some of the cast members weren't some native German speakers. Joseph Cotten plays a good main character but to me it was really Orson Welles who played the greatest role. He was such a fine actor, in basically every movie he ever appeared in. His acting-style in a way seemed to be decades ahead of its time. Perhaps a bit too much for its town, or otherwise he would had most likely been nominated more often for any awards for it. A great mystery movie, with an early thriller atmosphere. 9/10"

I won't give away anything because then it defeats the film's suspenseful purpose and would reveal the important details. I will comment on the performances of Cotten and Valli because I cannot comment Welles as I'll give away key elements. Cotten is a familiar presence for anyone who has seen 'Shadow of a Doubt', but this film is a different one for him. He is charming in his fashion and makes Holly Martin seem hard to figure out what he is about. Valli is the innocent woman who is also a puzzle we need to figure out, but she is a fine member of the cast. If you like suspense then you should check this one out."

        "review_detailed_main": "So a re-watch, and i was very interested in seeing this one again, because this is considered to be a masterpiece, and i actually found it overrated the first time i saw it, but i remember being very tired and not in a good mood when i first saw this, so that probably affected the way i saw the movie, and that was why i felt like i needed to re-watch this, after i had long seen this movie.\n\nThe Third Man is directed by Carol Reed and it stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Bernard Lee and Trevor Howard. And i got to say that unsurprisingly my opinion has changed, the thing is that it changed much more than i though it would, because this is quite something.\n\nAn out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has lead to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident.\n\nFrom talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. The Third Man is almost a perfect Noir, although not the column one, a man trying to find the truth, he sees himself dealing with criminals, he sees himself in love, he is completely confused and Joseph Cotten shows that perfectly on screen. And its funny to think that this 64 year old movie, actually had me in the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen, quite a few times.\n\nThe movie's power is enlarged by some AMAZING cinematography, The Third Man, might have the best cinematography i have seen from a movie that was made in the first half of the century. Most of the movie is shot in some peculiar angles, the shadows are amazingly beautiful, the cinematography adds A LOT to the movie, we feel this gloomy feeling on the air, it truly captures the devastated Europe after WW2. Quite weird to see that Robert Krasker only got this Academy Award win and nomination, because he shows here some very impressive work. Another two great technical things that the movies has, is its score by Anton Karas and its editing by Oswald Hafenrichter, both very impressive worthy of AT least a nomination.\n\nThen we get to the performances, and Joseph Cotten is the star of the movie, to say that Orson Wells is the star, would be very unfair to Cotten who does here some of the best work of his career, quite sad to see that such a good and charming actor never got any recognition. Alida Valli, is probably more known for some foreign language movies, but this one is by far the best English movie she did, she great in the movie, she does not play the usual girl that was in almost every movie made at this time. She proves that in the end of the movie, and what an ending. Orson Wells is undeniably great, as the charming manipulative villain, but the thing is that, i felt like he was not enough on the movie, i mean the plot is about this character, but just has 15 minutes of screen time, but he is great in every single minute.\n\nCarol Reed does here some fantastic job, he truly made a masterpiece here, an almost flawless movie that manages to survive time, a great story, with a big moral issue ( should you support your friends even when they are doing bad things, or should you try to stop him no matter what consequences) does rat on your friend make you a bad person, we know what Anna Schmidt thinks.\n\nThe Third Man also has some great charming performances, good writing, amazing cinematography,score, editing and direction, it is one of the best movies of the 40's, and i would not raise an eyebrow if someone told me that this was some of the best work he had ever seen.

        "review_detailed_main": "What makes this movie remarkable and unique apart from its great screenplay and cinematic effects is the musical background performed on an unusual stringed instrument, played by Anton Karas, the zither, which adds a repetitive haunting theme of suspense and intrigue to this well made production.\n\nIn post WW11 Vienna, American writer Holly Martins (played by Joseph Cotten) arrives there to seek out work with an old friend Harry Lime only to discover that he has been killed in a motor vehicle traffic accident. Martins investigates.\n\nThe plot thickens when he finds inconsistencies in the stories of witnesses to the incident with a hushed up look of fear and non cooperation on the part of those who knew Lime. It appears from the two men who picked him up from the roadway that there was a third man involved.\n\nMartins becomes all the more suspicious after meeting his loyal girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli) already under surveillance by the Allied military powers of the city and eventually the murky world of Lime emerges in the dimly lit streets of Vienna, with his reputation as a racketeer and black market dealer being exposed.\n\nLime is also pursued by Major Calloway, (played by Trevor Howard), of the British Occupational Forces, who does not at first believe that Lime is still alive after attending his funeral, but then after that was his sighting by Martins in a doorway one dark night.\n\nEventually, Lime, (now revealed truly, for what he is and acted superbly by Orson Welles), comes into focus with a conclusion well played out in the underground sewers of Vienna where he tries to make a dash for freedom from the authorities and his flight from justice.\n\nInteresting drama, shot perfectly in black and white filmography, backed by good performances from Welles and Cotten.\n\nBut who was the third man?"

        "review_detailed_main": "Look at how many perfect scores this community has given \"The Third Man\" (TTM). I am very glad I read the ideas from Cosmoeticadotcom (\"Great\", Cosmoeticadotcom, 1 September 2010). Cosmeticadotcom argues that many of the memorable visuals were actually composed by Orson Welles. As many times as I have seen TTM (somewhere between 25 and 30 times), it never occurred to me that of course, this must have happened. It is entirely possible that Carol Reed repeatedly asked Welles for help with the direction, and Welles maintained a proud silence over his contributions in the years that followed.\n\nTTM is one of the rarest cinematic experiences where every separate piece works. The story telling is so exquisite that the thrills that are produced are greatly fulfilling. Two scenes particularly stand out, the magnificent entrance of Harry Lime (Orson Welles) and the Ferris Wheel scene. These few minutes are sublime, as great as anything else in cinema.\n\nTTM uses foreshadowing a great deal. This is most obvious with the eerie child who annoys Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) when he is near Anna (Alida Valli). No need to clarify who the child represents. Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Paine (Bernard Lee) both repeatedly refer to the western fiction of Martins. The final image from the sewer sequence matches and contrasts nicely with what we know of Martins's novel, \"the Lone Rider of Santa Fe\". Only the lone rider doesn't exactly enjoy his transformation. There is a lot of life in this film.\n\nThe corruption that Holly Martins uncovers is nearly absolute, yet he insists on finding out for himself what everyone else seems to know. When Calloway unsuccessfully implores Martins to \"be sensible\" at the conclusion we know that much of the world-weary cynicism on display establishes a man's view of love; the last image reminds us that it is a bitter-sweet cocktail even when it arrives.\n\nTTM treats the audience as it is just as savvy and cunning as the characters, making Holly Martins the only boob in the theater. This helps us to favorably consider Harry Lime's morality, particularly as he is first betrayed, then hunted like a sewer rat.\n\n\"The Third Man\" is a cinematic treasure that demands repeated viewing. It has superior atmosphere, suspense, thrills, superlative acting, a perfectly minimalist zither score, a very corrupt set of characters and wonderful direction. It is greater than the sum of its parts; it is exceptional."

        "review_detailed_main": "Voted by BFI as Greatest British Film Ever Made\n\nSomehow the big ego-ed super-producers David O. Selznick and Alexander Korda were able to collaborate and make a film as flawless as The Third Man. Of course there are the stories of Selznick, director Carol Reed, and screenwriter Graham Greene all on speed working 20 hours a day. Much has been made of Orson Welles as Lime. His entrance around is great, the cuckoo clock scene is fantastic and the movie is most interesting when he's on screen, but there is much more to the movie than just Welles.\n\nJoseph Cotten, one of the most underrated actors of the Golden Age gives his best performance here, a performance that is rarely given the acclaim it deserves. His Holly Martins is a complex character dealing with themes such as loyalty, betrayal and morality. Complementing him is the Italian actress Valli, who plays Czechoslovakian actress Anna Schmidt, Lime's former lover. It is clear she loved him unconditionally, refusing to believe that he was any sort of criminal and resisting her newfound feelings for Holly.\n\nThe film is excellent from a technical standpoint. It almost has the feel of the feel of the Italian neorealism films of the '40s. The cinematography is great, making heavy use of dutch angles, jump cuts and other tricks. I just couldn't see this movie being made in color. The score is fantastic, entirely composed of zither music by Viennese play Anton Karas. It's upbeat tone contrasts the dark setting of the story in a great way. The dialogue is superb (I especially love the opening monologue spoken by Carol Reed himself.)\n\nOverall, this film is basically essential viewing. I find it to be far better than another Welles-starred movie Citizen Kane. I know that there are some people out there who won't watch just because this movie is in black and white or made over 60 years ago, but give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n\n10/10"

And, after seeing it the way it's meant to be seen, I now consider it to be one of the best films of the era. Aside from the odd soundtrack, which I'll talk about in a bit, the picture is just about perfect in every way--with great acting, direction and the best black and white cinematography I can recall having seen.\n\nThe film follows the oddly named Holly (Joseph Cotten) after he arrives in Vienna to take a job from his old friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). However, instead of finding a job he finds his friend is dead and begin buried in the opening scene. He's also soon shocked to find that his sweet old friend was NOT so sweet after all, though Holly is a good fellow and cannot believe Harry was THAT vicious and evil. What's to become of the idealistic Holly and is there much more to this story than meets the eye?\n\n\"The Third Man\" is incredibly inventive in many ways--especially with the film noir-like camera-work. The wonderful shadows, askew framing and dankness of the sewers are perfect for the film. And, I really loved Joseph Cotten, a highly underrated actor. My only complaint is the zither music. While it's very innovative and works well, I wish the film had used it much more sparingly as I felt like screaming out 'STOP THAT $^%@ MUSIC' near the end of the movie! Still, it's such a minor complaint and the rest of the film so incredibly well made, I can overlook this!"

I had to keep repeating scenes and repeating scenes. At one point, Trevor Howard is leaning against a cross-shaped tombstone. Howard is wearing a black leather trench coat, a fedora, a thin mustache, and a facial expression cooler than a gin and tonic.\n\nHoward is asked, \"Can you tell me, uh, who's uh...\" And Howard says, \"Fella called Lime.\" And the zither score jumps in.\n\nIt's a moment that in any other movie would just be a throw away, but in this movie it is so intensely well played, so cool, so stylish, I had to keep repeating it and repeating it to savor its brilliance.\n\nOkay, there is a plot here. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has been doing naughty things in Vienna after World War Two, when the city is divided between American, French, British, and Russian powers.\n\nHis friend Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) shows up to work with Lime, and gets tangled up in shady doings, mysterious characters, and international intrigue, including British officer Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Lime's moll Anna (Alida Valli), who is Czech, but trying to pass as Austrian, to avoid being handed over to the Russians.\n\nBut the plot and characters are secondary here. \"The Third Man\" is really all about style, and its style is awesome, untouchable.\n\nYes, it does get a bit precious -- the lights, the shadows, in each scene are as carefully crafted as if each scene were a painting. And yet it still has power. \"The Third Man\" has the wide-open and yet claustrophobic, urban and yet utterly remote and isolated look of a nightmare. There are shots that, in and of themselves, just make your hair stand on end, make you want to scream.\n\nAnd yet there are moments of laugh out loud comic relief.\n\nAnd then there is the zither score. If you know nothing else about \"The Third Man,\" you probably know about that score.\n\nThe zither mocks scenes and audience. The music at a burial is jaunty; it's a dance tune. That brilliant creepiness, with the weirdness of an aural clown with a painted on smile -- but the clown is strangling a puppy -- just underlines the movie's themes of criminality, treachery, and betrayal.\n\nThere are scenes here that no one who loves movies should miss. You have to see the very first appearance of the man in the shadows -- that man with the cat on his feet. The cuckoo clock speech on the ferris wheel. It is beyond brilliant, and genuinely deep and profound, if horrifying.\n\nI have long thought that the classic scene in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" where Omar Sharif takes forever to enter the shot is the best ever scene of a character entering a shot from a great distance, but in \"The Third Man\" there is a scene where Valli is far from the camera, and walks toward it, slowly, through an avenue of trees, as leaves fall on her -- stunning.\n\nFilm students will tell you all about the impact of German expressionism and Dutch angles ... but I can mostly just say how much this film knocked my socks off.\n\nWhy not give it a ten ... I wish that some of the characters had been more fully realized. Joseph Cotton never stopped being a cypher; I wished he had had a bit more substance.\n\nThis is not the case with Harry Lime. His screen time is limited, and yet it is one of the most devastating depictions of human evil I've ever seen.\n\nWow. You have to see this movie."

Curious, and increasingly suspicious as the stories become more and more inconsistent, Martins starts a personal investigation into the incident, especially into the identity of the mysterious 'third man' seen carrying Lime's body after the accident. The film is well regarded for its moody, expressionist B/W cinematography, excellent story (based on a book by Graham Greene), fine acting, and tight direction (by Carol Reed). 'The Third Man' was made less than four years after the war in Europe ended and, like 'A Foreign Affair' (1948), there are a number of images of destruction and of people picking up the pieces of their devastated cities as well as numerous references to shortages and of the black market. Much of the film was shot in Vienna and the locations, such as the Josefsplatz (where the hit-and-run occurs) are popular with tourists as are the Wiener Riesenrad (the century old (as of now) Ferris wheel) and the sewers (tours are offered). The film is also remembered for its diverting zither score (by Anton Karas), which became a huge hit in 1949. The Third Man is considered one of the greatest films ever made, a well-deserved accolade."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not really that big a deal that Orson Welles turns up over fifty-minutes into THE THIRD MAN, being that audiences awaited KING KONG for about the same period of time...\n\nThe term best describing Welles's Harry Lime is anticipated antagonist, and yet all his criminal activity is refuted by best friend Joseph Cotten as 'cheap novelette' Western writer Holly Martins, and especially heartbroken stage-actress-girlfriend Alida Valli, who Cotten attempts subtly romancing... but can't compete with the ghost...\n\nWelles's Lime is supposedly dead, and since there was an extra person carrying the body, told by Lime's criminal cohorts added by a doomed witness, the character is both anticipated and titular... yet most of the exposition is from Trevor Howard as Major Calloway along with faithful sidekick (and future James Bond chief) Bernard Lee...\n\nPolite loggerheads Cotten and Howard are the best things going during the first half... before Lime... then when he arrives, initially lurking in the kind of shadowy mystique Welles helped define in stylistic B&W classics from CITIZEN KANE to THE STRANGER to THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, the MAN, with a quick, page-turning cadence throughout, kicks into both second and third gear...\n\nAs English director Carol Reed makes THIRD all his own, with a classic zither score and dutch angles (the camera titled to provide an off-putting vibe), yet presenting a more standard than auteur approach, where the script and performances elevate the British crime thriller to heights exceeding every Welles' picture post KANE..\n\nIn fact it was THE THIRD MAN that gave Orson the comeback he couldn't garner himself, and his multi-collaborator Cotten landed a dream lead role that... despite technically playing a rather clumsy \"scribbler\", asking questions to various eccentric characters around the postwar ruins of Vienna (split into four halves of bordering countries)... story-wise, Cotten could've been a pulp-inspired gumshoe...\n\nBut he's a real human, and his overall vulnerability towards Valli's wistful stage actress Anna (with a dark, morose beauty of Ingrid Bergman and the denial-ability of Eva Braun) is more relatable than the usual gritty-noir male lead, while Welles himself makes ample use of his three strategic scenes...\n\nLime's desperate yet comfortable persona, already known to Cotten and the audience for a penicillin-stealing racket that killed innocent people, including children, still harbors an infectious, cinema-scoundrel's charm, making any horrible act seem not only necessary but commonplace...\n\nEspecially during Welles's most suspenseful and memorable scene with Cotten, high up on a carnival tramcar (where even an immense ferris wheel's far beneath), describing how anyone's expendable in an ironically blithe manner, proving he was an even more underrated actor than filmmaker...\n\nThanks to director Reed, who, backed by a tight Graham Green script and providing one of the greatest opening narrations himself, was keen enough to find gold in Welles the performer...\n\nAnd, despite an ongoing myth that Orson had a hand in directing or manipulating anything he appeared in, Reed needed no help, having already proven himself in countless motion pictures, including an even darker noir ODD MAN OUT...\n\nBut it's the action-packed finale chase, through the murky underground sewers, that puts THE THIRD MAN above any British noir, before or after, with two legendary Americans helping provide the universal, timeless appeal."

Far wittier than many modern films that we are told are comedies. It must be one of the funniest thrillers ever made with humour and dark drama tango-ing to and fro together throughout."

        "review_detailed_main": "A terrific film that intensifies the suspense superbly and holds it till the end.\n\nThis is widely known as one of the greatest noir films. I would submit to that opinion too. Orson Welles comes late in the film and from then on, takes the film on its head. I can say that Orson Welles is flawless as an actor.\n\nIt's a classic film that has all the ingredients to be contemporary as well. The soundtrack that uses only zither, the cinematography that seems grand and great, the production design that is immaculate are all superb. Especially the climax that takes place in the tunnel is one of finest moments in the history of cinema. Above all, the plot, the taking, the direction and the presence of a terrific Orson Welles make this a sublime thriller that we know, yet there are so many questions that are answered bit by bit.\n\nI will not say this is an edge of the seat thriller or that the suspense is so intense that it will make a viewer fall of his seat. But, I would say that is one of a thriller where we know many things, yet we are curious about the reason behind their happenings. Even now as I watched it, I felt it made now. The thriller element and the color that is black and white might be a thing of the past. But the dialogs, the execution, the emotions, and even the fear which Orson Welles as Harry Lime depicts make the film as it was it made in our times.\n\nCarol Reed the director must be credited for directing another director of the caliber of Orson Welles with such finesse. I have never seen Orson more vivid than I saw him in this film (I am not talking about films which are directed and written and acted by himself) in a film directed by someone else.\n\nKudos to all the makers and actors and also for those who have kept this film highly rated in the noir film. It's the rating that has generated the curiosity and made me watch this. I am going with 5/5 and for sure, this one of the greatest films ever made."

I wasn't around at the time, but people who were and lived in different European countries told me how much they were impressed by it and by the soundtrack that could be heard anywhere. Talk about a mega hit and deservedly so.\n\nThe story is performed by what nowadays would be called an ensemble cast, with strong characters all around, topped by the short but unforgettable performance by Orson Welles. His character Harry Lime is in the movie for less than 10% of the time but everything revolves around his shady deals, his unsavoury friends and his heartbroken girlfriend... and of course, his \"cuckoo clock\" line.\n\nThe tale is told by the cynical Major Calloway, assisted by Sergeant Paine on the tracks of black market racketeers. In the middle of the investigation stumbles hapless Holly Martins, the super charming Joseph Cotten, who while grieving for the disappearance of his friend Lime falls for his girlfriend and is repeatedly invited to leave Vienna by Calloway, who doesn't want any more amateurs on the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere of a \"bombed about a bit\" Vienna is memorable, the photography won a much deserved Oscar and the music is unique. One cannot ask for better entertainment."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've watched quite a few old noir/crime films by now, but The Third Man is the first one that really lives up to the genre's breathless descriptions given by its fans. It's sleek and sexy, well-shot, and lives in a morass of amorality. It's also tremendously fun to watch.\n\nThe key that makes The Third Man work where so many other \"classic\" crime films fail is pacing. It starts out slowly enough to draw the viewer into the uncertain world of post-war Vienna, and then slowly increases the pace of the twists and turns, while never being hard to follow. Its protagonist, a befuddled Western author, is a lot more sympathetic than your average private dick, which makes his descent into the underworld genuinely affecting. And of course, there's Orson Welles as the title role, which is pretty hard to beat.\n\nMoreover, The Third Man doesn't disappoint on the idea front. It plays around with the ideas of truth, metafiction, and morality without ever coming to a definite conclusion. The rather sloppy climax is the only thing that keeps this from being a 10 out of 10, but even so it's thoroughly recommended, even for people who don't usually like old movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE THIRD MAN opens with a voiceover and archive shots of postwar Vienna that promptly draw you into perpetual night time thanks to superlative chiaroscuro photography, made all the more memorable by a gallery of faces reminiscent of a Gothic church's gargoyles, and by quirky exchanges between Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), newly arrived in Vienna, and the concierge, as well as other characters.\n\nI found it interesting that Anna Schmidt (superb performance from Valli) finds Holly Martins a good man who deserves a loving woman, senses his good intentions, but she is in love with the criminal, Harry Lime. In fact, she mistakenly calls him Harry, a slip of the tongue that raised in my mind the possibility that reports of Lime's demise might be inaccurate.\n\nDirector Carol Reed has his finest hour with THE THIRD MAN, giving it a magnificent atmosphere punctuated by Anton Karas' immortal zither theme. The latter floats in when Harry Lime, played with great verve by Orson Welles, comes on screen. In addition to the great acting by all members of the cast, down to the smallest role, the script is superb, to the extent that it boasts a rarity in films noir: humor, in the midst of all the darkness, crime, and atrocious postwar conditions in a Vienna split into sections controlled by the US, UK, USSR and France, with all the atendant red tape issues.\n\nBesides being a tongue in cheek history lesson, THE THIRD MAN does perhaps more to elevate the reputation of film noir than any other film I can think of. Following the memorable introduction, there are many wonderful action sequences, gripping and intelligent dialogue, the famous chase in Vienna's sewers, and the mischievous ending, with Anna choosing to stay with Lime's memory and to avoid the well-meaning cheap novelette writer, Holly Martins - in my opinion, Joseph Cotten's career-best role.\n\nWelles is known for the cuckoo clock contribution and he is also believed to have given valuable advice to Director Carol Reed. Certainly, the film bears a few photographic resemblances to CITIZEN KANE, and it is a collaborative effort with everyone in exceptional form, right up to the majestic final sequence where Martins receives the ultimate kissoff from Valli.\n\nNow that a third world war looms large on mankind's horizon, to me THE THIRD MAN becomes all the more timely and interesting, an opportunity to see how Russians, Brits, French and Americans \"ran\" Vienna. This film remains the greatest movie experience of my life, and may I live long enough to watch it many more times.\n\nMasterpiece: 10/10 only because the system does not allow me to award it a higher rating."

The first thing I loved about this film was the composition of shadow/light and the actors. They dared to show things not in their most pretty way, but in their most desperate form. It allows us to really feel the tension of \"the pre-coldwar\" in Vienna. I think Joseph Cotton is such a natural actor; he never forces his lines or attempts to overact. All of his lines are said with clarity and conviction of character. He is as likable an actor as Jimmy Stewart. By far however, my favorite part of the film is the ferris wheel ride. Orson Welles could provide such a menacing presence. Here the subtlety of his acting (as in The Stranger) added to the tension. Was he going to throw his friend out of the ride? His eyes revealed his character so delicately. The subtle glances and narrowed eyes conveyed his potential for evil. It is amazing to me too, with cameras having been so bulky, that they were able to shoot the subterranian world of the sewer. Film also tended to be slow back then as well, and the use of light there is amazing. I agree with AFI, this is one of our treasures."

Included in western catalogs were such victory titles as Goldwyn's poignent, The Best Years of Our Lives, 20 Century Fox' eye-opener, Twelve OClock High, Warner Bros' family noir, The Breaking Point, British makes Cosh Boy (Daniel Angel) and the one like no other ever seen, or heard, before or since, Selznick Korda London's, The Third Man.\n\nChiefly written by Graham Greene, it's a tale of intrigue, murder & love in partitioned Vienna, one that disregards its motif (shortages) with a wealth of charmbursts, some stepping softly \"on little cat feet,\" others in kitten heels on long legs neat (Charlier stripper). A black & white feature, it rides nicely from opening frames on director Carol Reed's narration (\"a {black market} does tempt amateurs {one floats in the Danube} but, you know, they can't stay the course like a professional\"), Bob Krasker's award winning Dutchy camera and Anton Karas limited edition zither that runs the entirety like a strolling violinist (108m), sans the Baron title (Kurtz), a sound that would top the charts on both sides of the Pond, as too, Sacher's up-tempo instrumental of Fields & Gamse's popular Managua Nicaragua (46) (flower club). But things are not all black & white for our intrepid good guy, idled American pulp writer, Holly Martins: Maj Calloway: \"Be sensible, Martins; Holly: I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.\"\n\nJoseph Cotten stars as Holly, driven by loyalty to investigate his friend's death, then conscience to do the right thing; Trevor Howard is British Major Calloway determined to break the ring of racketeers who've filled the hospitals on sale of diluted penicillin; Bernard (M) Lee is the Major's well-read adjutant who figures prominently in story's end; Italian film star Valli is Anna of Melancholia, she Vienna's Eva Braun who's poor choice in men, that being Harry Lime, Orson Welles most memorable role and bellwether of GERD sufferings to come: \"these (antacids) are the only things that help (burp).\" Though he possessed a keen awareness and appreciation (Cross of Iron review), an ASC eye, a physical presence, commanding voice (CBS Radio hoax) and flair for acting, Orson's academically aided cult status eclipses these attributes in a campaign to sell his weak suit, direction, one he'd not admit (no choisis) but which financiers & movie-goers could no longer abide. Called box office poison (Selznick), if prepared properly (Lime), a Welles performance is a reel delicacy, if it's not (Quinlan), it won't shut down your kidneys (fugu) but you may feel a bit queasy the next day (badum tish!). Scary Harry proves the man from Kenosha's best act in front or behind the camera, the smooth talking profiteer a monument to the danger of misreading Renaissance writer Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, but also to the latitude artists in all mediums must be given for full, free expression, even as some today still stifle opinions that may merely displease.\n\nIf romantic means a demure expression of sentiment, then the closing frames have to constitute one of the most unique, sincere love scenes in all of film (at least she doesn't turn back). Does anyone yearn for another as Holly does the unreachable Schmidt (eyes meet in line reading \"H E Z T S\") (43m), she seduced by the devil's charms, he lighting on angels wings. As the story moves to the Casanova club, hangout for the Lime set, take note of Romanian Popescu (Breuer) as he may be template for Dr Strangelove (\"everyone aught to go careful in a city like this\"), the porter (H\u00f6rbiger), so eager to prove himself reliable to the Allies, and then the cop walking the Vienna beat after Kurtz & Martins break up their first meet and see if his look doesn't remind you of the one who died in a Berlin bunker in 45. Some sense of humor on that Reed (4/4)."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like film noir a lot, and I saw this film with pleasure. It's one of those films that you can't miss: it has an excellent story, complex characters, a lot of suspense and a good dose of humor, very elegant, almost intertwined with the main story, where we have a young American writer trying to unravel the very poorly explained death. From a friend in the half-ruined city that was Vienna in the years after World War II. The local police, rather than helping, seem to be part of the problem and, as he progresses in the investigations, there are more and more indicants of a crime.\n\nThe film is very good and is very well directed by Carol Reed. The most common aspects of noir are all there: the light, the dense shadows, the tense and dark urban environment, a crime, many potential suspects and criminals, an apparently corrupt police and an elegant young woman who steals hearts, but it may not be so innocent as it looks. The film doesn't let us down for a minute and gives us exactly what we want to see and feel, and that's truly satisfying.\n\nTo make things even better, we have good sets and believable costumes, a good use of exterior scenes and a city that, even destroyed, never loses its beauty and elegance. The cinematography couldn't be better, the camera work is worthy of being studied in film schools, and the effects are used sparingly and effectively. The cast is truly competent: despite being the most resonant name, Orson Welles is not the most visible actor. Still young and relatively good-looking (he would put on more weight in the following years, as we know), the actor appears little, but steals our attention whenever he appears. Joseph Cotten is the real protagonist of the film, and he does his job equally well. He is one of those actors that is forgotten today, but he deserves a lot that his work is reviewed and revisited.\n\nThe only thing, and it's really just that, that brings this film down is its soundtrack and insistence on a mandolin theme that couldn't be more inappropriate. It could even have been used as an opening theme, during the credits, but no... the annoying music intrudes throughout the film to the point of being unbearable. It sounds like a melody made for a Marx Brothers movie, and it doesn't stop here! It's truly annoying and cuts the mood of the movie!"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is impossible for me to decide on what my favorite movie ever is, but Carol Reed's 1949 masterpiece The Third Man is certainly in the conversation. Set in post-World War II Vienna, the film is inherently lathered with dark, deflating themes of exploitation, corruption and unrequited love. This ambience is brilliantly enhanced by its minimalistic score, which is played on a zither and echoes through the empty, rainy streets of what was once the mecca of the classical music world. A great story that begins as a mystery and then becomes something much more dire, The Third Man is immortalized by its unforgettable look. I stick to my opinion that the visuals could not work any other way, and that adding color would be more detrimental to this film than it would be to any other noir I have seen. The shadows, shapes and depth, particularly the scene in sewers, make everything that resembles it seem like a cheap imitation. Make sure you watch director Carol Reed's cut of the film, as it is the version that I would call a noir in the truest of senses."

The black and white (colourising the picture would be a crime), the shadows and the glistening wet cobblestones make you feel the cold and damp, and the fact that some parts are shot from an angle adds to the feeling of disorientation. The haunting zither music is inspired (zither is a traditional instrument in that part of the world). Add to that a gripping storyline focused on black-marketeering and the trade in stolen penicillin and fantastic actors (watch out for how Orson Welles' face appears out of the shadows when he is first seen), and you get a film on par with the best."

Calloway (Trevor Howard) as well, all others characters were added to assemble a fictional story, what we easily could labeled as just a fine plot with a period, however the cunning director Carol Reed exploited some ponctual elements that improves the movie in another level, first the dark atmosphere at the wet streets in Vienna, with rugged visual, second the sustained use of the camera in angle, given a startling results, third the undeniable charm of Orson Welles as the ambiguous Harry Lime's smile, that now his old pal Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) finally figures out, and to close the unexcelled chase on the large and dark sewage system at Vienna's underground adds values to the movie, further Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) gave a colossal seize on her character, cold and often pondering, who didn't expect that Martin and Anna could be falling in love? He did but she seemingly doesn't, now regarded as the best Noir made on England, quite sure owe on these magnificent elements applied that gave this current status!!\n\nResume:\n\nFirst watch: 2014 / How many: 2 / Source: DVD / Rating: 9."

        "review_detailed_main": "I first watched this film in the 1975, on TV, and I sang its famous zither theme for days, to the point of annoying my parents and siblings. I was 18, I loved it, and I was over the moon when I was finally able to buy a VHS copy in 1989, which I keep, and to which I have added a DVD release and the Criterion release, certainly the finest and most perfectly cleaned up version so far.\n\nAt 18, I was instantly overawed by the music and, perhaps most of all, by the haunting B&W photography, with the long shadows, the war-bitten faces protruding from windows, the cobblestone streets shimmering in the dark, the exquisitely filmed ruins contrasting with some luxurious interiors and embroidered building facades, and myriad other wonderful details that keep surprising me.\n\nThe documentary-like short preamble of a war-ravaged Vienna is a gem in its own right and sets the high standard for the rest of the film.\n\nI have also been consistently astounded by the quality of the acting. Trevor Howard and Cotten are superlative; Welles, in a much smaller part, stays with you forever; and that trio is superbly supported by Valli, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Bernard Lee, Paul Horbiger (memorable as the porter who wonders whether Lime went to heaven or hell), and Siegfried Breuer, the sophisticated Romanian heavy with the threatening smile, accompanied by a gallery of human gargoyles.\n\nIn truth, apart from a nurse clutching a teddy bear at a children's hospital, I cannot think of anyone in the film who does not perform at the highest level.\n\nThe dialogue is wonderful beyond words, punctuated by humorous moments, involving British vs American pronunciation of the word \"ranch,\" the fact that Martins writes cowboy books which a British Army sergeant avidly reads, a cat, a parrot, a cuckoo clock, the wonderful scene where Hyde-White mistakes Martins for a \"serious\" writer, resulting in a comic sequence where Martins fears for his life only to be left at the mercy of intellectuals who pump him on stream of consciousness, while consciousness for him is the presence of killers, the whole sequence punctuated with apparently harmless and jocund remarks redolent with fine irony.\n\nThe renowned scene with Cotten and Welles on the Prater Wheel shows two Americans crossing paths, supposed friends who are actually incompatible (Lime used to steal Martins' girlfriends, but the latter never thought much of that). Martins is like the lawmen in his cowboy books, looking for honesty and respect for the law, while Lime wades in the murky waters of contraband. One also suspects that Lime had Martins in mind to become the victim, when he invited him to Vienna. But Martins metamorphoses from dreamy cowboy to down-to-earth restorer of the law, and by the time Lime realizes his error in judgment, he has the law on his tail, and there is something rat-like about his face as he hides and runs in the limey sewers of Vienna.\n\nDespite the classic trimmings, the script is incredibly advanced for its time.\n\nThe action sequences are totally credible, brilliantly shot, and include the famous Vienna sewers chase sequence, certainly a masterful example of how to pull off a blend of sublime photography, top acting, and dramatic surroundings.\n\nWelles is known for the cuckoo clock contribution and he is also believed to have given valuable advice to Director Carol Reed. Certainly, the film bears a few photographic resemblances to CITIZEN KANE, and it is a collaborative effort with everyone in exceptional form, right up to the majestic final sequence where Martins receives the ultimate kissoff from Valli.\n\nTHE THIRD MAN remains the greatest movie experience of my life, and may I live long enough to watch it many more times. 10/10 only because the system does not allow me to give it 20/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rarely has background music made such a transcendent impact on a film-going experience, but such is the case of Anton Karas's haunting zither in Carol Reed's 1949 dark thriller, a genuine classic of post-WWII deception and desperation. The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed-out Vienna barely recovering from the war. There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.\n\nThe intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi-renowned pulp fiction writer of westerns, who comes to Vienna at the request of his old friend Harry Lime. Unexpectedly, Lime turns out to be dead, and Martins begins to discover that his friend was not what he claimed to be but an immoral racketeer dealing with tainted penicillin on the black market. The rest of the story depends on plot twists too rich to divulge here, but suffice it to say that things are not what they appear. Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin); the limited disclosures of Major Calloway, a likable British policeman on the Lime case and the allure of Lime's beautiful, mysterious lover Anna.\n\nGraham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles's masterpiece, \"Citizen Kane\". Both films involve the precarious nature of male friendships and feature two of the same leading actors, Joseph Cotten and Welles himself. Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career-best role as Martins. Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end. Eschewing the romantic yearning he displayed three years earlier in David Lean's \"Brief Encounter\", Trevor Howard plays Calloway sardonically but with a palpable sense of humanity. As Anna, Alida Valli provides a Dietrich-like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.\n\nAnother nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off-kilter angles. It's masterful mood-setting work. The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly. Celebrating the film's fiftieth anniversary, the 1999 Criterion Collection DVD package provides a crisp print of the black-and-white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first-person narration, a couple of related radio shows with Cotten and Welles. This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time."

It hasn't aged well in that respect.\n\nI did appreciate the fact that there were such obvious homo-erotic undertones in the film. Not only did it seem that Dr Winkel and Mr Kurtz were live in lovers, but almost that the whole crowd of fellas might have gathered for a right royal bu@@ery session every Saturday night in someone's basement and maybe that's why Holly had been invited to town, to rekindle a previous connection with Harry.\n\nThe music was very good, but perhaps more suited to something of a less serious nature, although it went perfectly with the chase scene, which was positively Scooby-Doo like. I almost expected a ghost or swamp monster to burst forth at any moment and for them to unveil the \"Third Man\" to be \"Old Man Smithers\", who would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for that pesky Joseph Cotton (Holly).\n\nOverall, it's an ok story, but I'm not sure enough was made clear, perhaps if we'd seen Harry's life before Holly arrived, it might have given a better picture of how that part of the world was dealing with the end of WWII. This is again where the age of the film goes against it today, as the viewers in 1949 would have a greater knowledge of these things more than I do in 2021.\n\nTo end on a positive, this is the first time that I have been even vaguely impressed with Orson Welles, so that was good and the cast as a whole performed admirably.\n\nJust not one for the millennials perhaps."

        "review_detailed_main": "Superb British thriller, a heady mix of post-war suspense, intrigue and danger, mixing stellar Hollywood acting talent (Cotten and of course, Welles) with journeyman but no less important British support, personified by Trevor Howard and a little European inscrutable glamour in Allida Valli, all corralled masterfully into place by Carol Reed.\n\nI'm a great fan of Graham Greene's writing and his imprint is all over this far from straightforward thriller. Present and correct are questions of loyalty, duty and the thin line between right and wrong in the pursuit of self-preservation. Cotten is the unsuspecting innocent abroad, seeking out old friend Harry Lime in war-torn Vienna, itself riven by differing occupation forces, making it a highly unsafe place from one area to the next. This edginess is reinforced in many ways by director Reed, for instance, there is a lot of dialogue spoken in the native Austrian, unenlightened by subtitles, throwing the viewer, like Cotten himself, off-guard and raising suspicions and confusion in equal doses. Then there's the bravura camera-work, the camera at many points tilted off-centre, at others mixing up extreme close-ups with high-angle viewpoints, with a fair degree of murky chiaroscuro also thrown in for good measure, emphasising further the out-of-kilter situation in which Cotten's Holly finds himself.\n\nThere's also Greene's superb dialogue, embellished, if we're to believe the old charlatan Welles, with caustic additional dialogue of his own invention, particularly the \"cuckoo clock\" speech denigrating Switzerland so deftly that its tourist board must still be looking for a suitable riposte to this day. The dramatic set-pieces too, like Lime's belated first appearance out of the shadows, the conversation on the Big Wheel and of course the breathtaking chase finale played out in the Vienna sewers where cornered rat Lime finally runs out of bolt-holes, are all spot on, but the sub-plots too are equally gripping, not least the fate of Valli as Harry's girl with that wonderfully enigmatic conclusion as she breezes unblinking straight past the waiting and hoping Cotten at Harry's second and final funeral.\n\nThrow in Anton Karas' justly famous soundtrack and really you have a film to stand with the very best ever to grace a picture-house."

        "review_detailed_main": "The post-war offered a veritable Marshall Plan of scripts for Studios, Soviet makers afforded their own Molotov version of storyline largesse. Included in western catalogs were such victory titles as 20CF's Twelve OClock High, WB's Breaking Point, Goldwyn's Best Years, British makes Cosh Boy (D-A) & the one like no other ever seen, or heard, before or since, Selznick Korda London's The Third Man.\n\nChiefly written by Graham Greene, it's a tale of intrigue, murder & love in partitioned Vienna, one that disregards its motif (shortages) with a wealth of charmbursts, some stepping softly \"on little cat feet,\" others in kitten heels on long legs neat (Charlier stripper). A b&w feature, it rides nicely from opening frames on director Carol Reed's narration (\"a {black market} does tempt amateurs {Danube floater} but, you know, they can't stay the course like a pro\"), Bob Krasker's decorated camera & Anton Karas' limited edition zither that runs the entirety like a strolling violinist (108m), sans the Baron title (Kurtz), a sound to top the pop charts, as too, Sacher's up-tempo instrumental of Fields & Gamse's Managua Nicaragua (46). But things are not all black & white for our intrepid good guy, idled American pulp writer, Holly Martins: Major Calloway: \"Be sensible, Martins; Holly: I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.\"\n\nJoe Cotten stars as Holly, driven by loyalty to figure his friend's death, then conscience to do the right thing; Trevor Howard is Major Calloway, determined to break the ring of racketeers who've filled the hospitals on diluted penicillin; Bernard (M) Lee is the well-read adjutant; Italian film star Valli is Anna of Melancholia, Vienna's Eva Braun who's poor choice in men, that being Harry Lime, Orson Welles most memorable role & bellwether of GERD sufferings to come: \"these (antacids) are the only things that help (burp).\" Though he possessed a keen awareness and appreciation, an ASC eye, a physical presence, commanding voice (cbs radio hoax) & flair for acting, Orson's cult status eclipses these attributes in the campaign to sell his weak suit, direction (no choisis) but one which financiers & movie-goers could not abide. Called box office poison (Selznick), if prepared properly (Lime), a Welles performance is a reel delicacy, if it's not (Quinlan), it won't shut down your kidneys (fugu) but you may feel queasy the next day. Scary Harry proves the man from Kenosha's best act in front or behind the camera, the smooth talking profiteer a monument to the danger of misreading Renaissance writer Machiavelli, but also the latitude artists must be given for full, free expression, even as some today still stifle differing opinions.\n\nIf romantic means a demure expression of sentiment, then the closing frames have to constitute one of the most unique love scenes in all of film. Does anyone yearn for another as Holly does the unreachable Schmidt, she seduced by the devil's charms, he lighting on angels wings. As the story moves to the Casanova club, hangout for the Lime set, take note of Romanian Popescu (Breuer) as he may be template for Dr Strangelove, the porter (H\u00f6rbiger), so eager to prove himself to the Allies, and then the cop walking the Vienna beat after Kurtz & Martins break up their first meet and see if he doesn't remind you of the one who died in a Berlin bunker in 45. Some sense of humor on that Reed. 10/10."

In eight years, the newly formed genre reached its peak with this mystery concerning an American visitor to Vienna, in search of a criminally linked friend. \"The Third Man\" was one of the last English speaking pictures that were of any major significance abroad for some 20 years. European Cinema, revitalized after the war, would always be intellectually superior, breaking new artistic ground until America's awful Production Code was finally lifted in 1967. In this pivotal, adventurously photographed movie, traces of the future New Wave movement in France are clearly visible, and thus, the original source of our man Quentin, the great pulp filmmaker of the 90's and an admitted follower of Goddard and Melville, can be found here as well."

Greene's screenplay may seem a bit rambling for modern audiences, but I enjoy watching these deeper dives into the characters. It's funny, too--the scene where Cotten is hot-airing his way through the presentation for the Brits' literary club is wonderful! Of course, Welles performance is so good that he's a tangible presence, even when he's not there---which is for most of the film. His speech on the Ferris wheel contains one of the most simple, believable yet profound depictions of the banality of modern evil that's ever been. The twists, the cinematography, the quirky theme song---all come together to make a true classic."

        "review_title": "A superb, enduring classic",
        "review_detailed_main": "I must say, I find myself surprised. This film carries an extremely high reputation, and moreover carries the very high favor and recommendation of people I know, and while I sat to watch with no foreknowledge, it's not what I had supposed it might be sights unseen. Anton Karas' music, greeting us from the outset, is utterly brilliant and ultimately marvelously effective, yet couldn't be further from the norm for crime thriller or film noir with its softly melodic and often upbeat chords. Except where they are specifically employed to artistic ends to bolster the shot composition I don't necessarily think much of those famous, proliferate, dramatic Dutch angles - I can easily envisage a parody, and it's not too far removed - yet with that said, at large this is plainly stupendous in how it was shot. Between the stunning filming locations, exquisite use of lighting and shadow, Robert Krasker's fantastically smart cinematography, and Carol Reed's truly impeccable direction, wide swaths of 'The third man' could be picked out frame by frame and either hung on a wall or slapped inside a coffee table book, for it is crafted with a masterful sense of artistry that at its best is altogether breath-taking. And I freely admit I spent pretty much the first half of these 104 minutes rather unconvinced: even as shady suggestions pervaded each scene, at first the story of Holly's amateur investigation wasn't gelling in an especially hardy or compelling manner, and the seeming introduction of an obligatory romantic element only met with a tired sigh as a trope I often find decidedly thin.\n\nYet when the narrative does shift around the halfway mark, or shortly thereafter, the plot kicks into high gear and the increasingly becomes intensely absorbing. One important midway scene of exposition puts (most of) the first half into perspective, and from thereon the picture plainly dazzles in every capacity as the story heads toward its conclusion. Emotional beats hit harder, some ingenious subtlety shines through at select points, and just as Orson Welles once again affirms the presence and nuance he wielded as an actor, other core cast members Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, and even Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee more readily impress with their performances. That romantic element is ultimately treated in a manner that is immensely satisfying, to the point that I wish other filmmakers could be so smart about it in their own works. Well made in general, with terrific contributions from all those behind the scenes, the lofty esteem in which the feature is held is firmly validated, and any discussion of 'The third man' becomes not one about its indisputable level of quality but personal perspectives on relative strengths and weaknesses - whatever that means, on an individual level, for something operating on this level. It's also important to observe how casually but definitively the movie speaks to post-war Vienna as celebrated writer Graham Greene very organically weaves glimpses of the period into the story and its characters, just as Reed and Krasker give us eyefuls of the city in the wake of the destructiveness of a few years before. And on a tangential note, it's very much worth observing that Welles' role is one that is readily, perfectly identifiable in 2024, which means that in addition to being altogether excellent the whole production continues to be horrifyingly relevant.\n\nThose who had recommended this to me, or who have spoken of it in grand terms, do not jest. I think there are interesting points to raise of what is extra sharp here or perhaps not so sharp, but this is completely separate from the incontrovertible fact of how superb the title is when all is said and done. Others have written far more about 'The third man,' and more eloquently, but allow me as a layperson but an avid cinephile to confirm that this is continues to stand tall as an outstanding, greatly satisfying classic, and anyone who enjoys watching films owes it to themselves to watch at least once. That's really all there is to it."

The plot, which is sometimes hard to follow, is well-crafted, full of unexpected twists and turns, and it's a shame that Orson Welles' fantastic acting is so short; the movie comes alive when it's on screen. Overall, it's a fine popcorn movie and a classic of its genre."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's classic film noir set ca. 1948 in Vienna, Austria. It covers about two weeks in the life of a mediocre American novelist invited to Vienna by a childhood friend he hasn't seen for 10 years to write for a medical charity.\n\nHolly Martins (Joseph Cotton), who writes popular Westerns, arrives in Vienna to learn that his friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), has just been killed in a traffic accident. He arrives at the cemetery in time for the ceremony in which most of the primary characters are present. These include Lime's girlfriend, Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli), a Czech woman using a false passport to avoid being forced behind the Iron Curtain. British army officers include Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee). Shady associates of Harry Lime include \"Baron\" Kurtz (Ernst Deutsch) and Dr. Winkel (Erich Ponto).\n\nThe film then follows Martins' efforts to ascertain what really happened, the black market activity in which Lime was engaged, and whether Lime actually died. It becomes clear that Lime is not as Martins remembers. It's also clear that Martins is falling in love with Anna Schmidt. Even the final climax remains ambiguous, as it's unclear exactly how Harry Lime died and who killed him.\n\nThis is genuinely classic film noir. The cinematography is marvelous. Anton Karas plays the zither in an unforgettable musical score. The pace and timing of the film are excellent. The film is one hour and 45 minutes long. Orson Welles doesn't even show up until the last 45 minutes and doesn't speak until the last 30 minutes. Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli are excellent. Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee are stereotypical British officers.\n\nThe movie is great fun and preaches little, except that Russians are not really to be trusted."

It's a common belief the 1940s & 50s were innocent/naive when in fact evil was just as prevalent in society as it is today.\n\nI'm an fan of Orson Welles and his unique dramatic style. This film feels very Wellesian, even though he only acts in this film. Joseph Cotten, I suppose an acquired taste due to his understated acting, and his deadpan looks, is brilliant. All the actors are top notch.\n\nVisually, it is stunning: the post-WW2 Austrian on-location images are priceless as a historical document, and the final sewer scene is crazy!\n\nMy only criticism: that effing zither music. Throughout I couldn't help but wonder if technically someone could rework this film to get rid of that hideous sound, how would it change the film? Maybe the soundtrack is intended to annoy the bejeesus out of the viewer? I don't know and would love to compare viewing experiences if such a version would exist. It may just need to be there and I don't realize it.\n\nAnyhoo I still wholeheartedly recommend this film. It's a classic for sure."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have seen THE THIRD MAN many, many times because it is a powerful and incredibly entertaining Post WW II Film Noir. Everything about it is perfect: shot on location in war-torn Vienna; intriguing characters played by a superb cast headed by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton; spellbinding black & white cinematography with ominous dark shadows, eerie deserted streets and unsettling camera angles. The police chase through the Vienna sewers is a fantastic and iconic Film Noir masterpiece.\n\nHow come then, I shed a tear every time I see this movie? Answer: ... because the ZITHER SOUNDTRACK COMPLETELY RUINS THIS MOVIE! Every time the music appears I wince and turn the sound on my TV down. The music destroys whatever is going on in the movie be it dialogue or plot development. The jingly-jangly sound of the zither truly undermines the greatness of this film.\n\nI have nothing against Anton Karas, the composer and musician of the zither music in the movie. He's a fine musician I am sure, but to have his zither as the one and only musical instrument in this movie was a bad decision. Carol Reed is a celebrated movie director and he did an exceptional job with this movie. Why he agreed to the zither music as the only music for this movie is beyond me. Who made this final decision on this mistake?\n\nPossible solution: It would be awesome if this movie could be re-scored with a completely new soundtrack, something more appropriate for a world-class Noir thriller such as this. With today's advancements in movie digital re-mastering (and working from an original print) it would be fairly easy to remove the zither music and replace it with something better. Actually, this movie would do well without a musical score, period! Let's put it this way ... no soundtrack would be better than the zither mess we have now."

He enters the murky post war world of gangsters and corruption and then a light is switched on.\n\nThe film starts off as a stark but routine thriller bathed in atmosphere of a bombed out Vienna.

This maybe is his most memorable role in a film which he did not direct.

It is catchy, and had it been used to orchestrate a sweet romantic comedy of errors set in the Swiss Alps, it would have been perfect. However, The Third Man is a mysterious drama about a man trying to solve his friend's murder. It happens to be set in Vienna, but there's nothing humorous about the story or the screenplay. It's practically a Hitchcock, especially because of the slow progression of the plot. The upbeat zither tune is just out of place.\n\nCarol Reed's direction is also out of place and extremely distracting. In every single scene, he randomly inserts a canted angle, edited into normally framed shots and shots tilted in the opposite direction. In film school, I was taught that filmmakers' jobs are to make the audience believe they're actually watching reality, not to remind them of the camera, microphone, and lights. It's impossible to believe you're watching reality when the screen keeps tilting back and forth. Reed's choices are so random and nearly nauseating (I mean literally, not insultingly), the only way I could make it through the movie was to create an alternate scenario in my head: To me, Reed's budget was so small, he couldn't afford to waste time watching the dailies. Unbeknownst to him, a crew member accidentally kept kicking the camera's tripod every other take. When Reed finally watched the footage, he was devastated! Out of money, there was nothing for him to do but put it all together and hope the audience didn't get motion sickness.\n\nThe good part of the movie comes in the last half hour. The slowness of the plot finally picks up, and the surprises finally appear. Joseph Cotten works tirelessly against both the Viennese villains and the uncooperative police, led by Trevor Howard, and starts falling in love with his dead pal's girlfriend, Valli. There's a surprise appearance by a very well known actor, and when he shows up, it's a delightful entrance scene. If you don't mind severe canted angles, music that doesn't fit, and a very slow beginning, you can rent this movie. It is a classic.\n\nDLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. There are canted angles in every single scene, so unless you just want to listen to the dialogue or watch the picture on a very small screen, it will make you sick. In other words, \"Don't Look, Mom!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Carol Reed's `The Third Man' is a wonderful noir thriller from 1949 that tells the story of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) who arrives in Vienna to work for his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives at his apartment, finds out that he just died. He is about to head back to America when he is wrapped up in intrigue around his late friend, and discovers that everything that he knows about his friend isn't quite what it seemed.\n\nNot only does `The Third Man' feature two of my favorite classic film guys, Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles, but its story (by Graham Greene) is flawless and the cinematography/photography is first-rate. The night scenes are so incredibly lit and the use of shadows so brilliantly executed, that even upon repeat viewings, they are breathtaking. Additionally, I rarely comment on the score of a film, particularly in a review that is largely a brief summary, but the score by Anton Karas is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nThere really isn't a whole lot that I can criticize about this film, because it is so well done. I highly recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet.\n\n--Shelly"

I've heard complaints about the over bearing music but personally I loved it, it just seemed to add so much to every scene when that very distinctive music would start up again. I'm surprised certain elements of this movie hadn't been ruined for me before viewing, with all the recommendations I have read and heard and for nothing to have been given away is something I am truly grateful for. The Third Man feels like a film years before it's time and not just in a few ways but in every way. Plus who will forget that scene, ya you know which one."

Contrast has been greatly improved, as well as shadow detail. This new print is gorgeously dark, as was the artistic intent. Grain also appears well intact and quite even. All the issues that the prior Studio Canal release had, have been eliminated, namely the annoying flickering. This print appears to be free of any damage, scratches, etc. I personally, cannot stress enough how beautiful this print is. The blacks are just perfect! Having only listened to the English DTS-HD master audio.2.0, I can say it sounds excellent! Clarity is front and center, and I did not hear any hissing, or other related age issues, typically found in a film of this age. And, the Harry Lime Theme, played on the Zither, has never sounded better. All in all, this is a truly wonderful release. The digibook(France release) was a nice touch as well, with somewhat better artwork than most releases of this film have seen. I personally also greatly appreciated the excellent array of special features. Mostly, the restoration featurette. Which provided some fascinating insight into the restoration process. Short of a new 4K UHD release, I'll never need another copy of this masterpiece!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Carol Reed's absorbing classic is one of most literate thrillers ever filmed. It takes place in postwar Vienna where an American writer, Holly Martins, played by Joseph Cotten in a superlative performance, arrives having been promised a job by his old friend Harry Lime who is a black-market opportunist who is utterly immoral and totally without a conscience, he is trafficking stolen diluted penicillin which has killed and also has left children brain dead. Lime is played brilliantly by Orson Welles in one of the most memorable performances in screen history, even though he has a short role and does not have much screen time his presence is felt throughout the entire film. Upon his arrival Holly discovers that Harry has been killed in a traffic accident and he just makes it to the funeral where he meets Major Calloway, played superbly by Trevor Howard, who tells Holly that Harry was a thief and a murderer; at first Holly is outraged and does not believe it, but then he decides to investigate, and gradually discovers that it's all true. Harry has staged his own death and is very much alive. The final climatic confrontation between Holly and Harry in the sewers of Vienna is truly one for the ages. Masterfully Oscar nominated direction by Reed, with majestic Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Krasker, and a striking zither score by Anton Karas. One of the greatest films of the 20th century."

It perfectly captures a country ravaged by war nd struggling to get to grips with defeat where the black market is rife. Director Carol Reed makes the black ands white images harsh and almost sharp to capture this feeling of despair. It is impossible to see that this film could ever have worked in colour. The cast is faultless with Orson Welles perfect as the mysterious Harry Lime. The character who may not been be seen for much of the picture but his is presence is strangely felt in every scene. Each piece of Harry's life in Austria is slowly unwrapped by his best friend Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotton. A pulp fiction writer who is invited to Vienna with a promise of work but only to discover that Lime as died. Suspected foul play Martins is torn between loyalty between is friend and the harsh realty that his friend is a crook and he has fallen in love with Harry's girl, Anna (alida Valli). The plot may seem a little dated but it still gives a new audience the opportunity to sit back and watch a well crafted film without graphic violence. In fact the most disturbing images are left instead o the audience's own imagination. A true classic movie."

Halfway through the film I wish there had been a way to shut the music off and keep the dialogue on! The best thing about this is the direction. Director Reed constantly keeps the viewer off balance by shooting numerous scenes at a tilted angle establishing a sense of paronia and uneasiness. Very rarely is something shoot at the correct angle. Also, the set design is stunning. The movie is set in Vienna, but was shot in London. You'd never know it. It looks and FEELS like Vienna. The sets are huge and crumbling (result of WWII) and increase the feeling of dread. Also excellent use of night and shadow. Some of these sequences wouldn't be out of place in a horror film. Hard movie to describe...it has the be viewed. If you get the chance to see it, do so. You won't be disappointed."

The rest of the film has Cotten, together with Vali, Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee trying to solve the mystery of Harry Lime.\n\nIn terms of photography, The Third Man ranks right up there with Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil, both incidentally starring Orson Welles. The lighting and shadows are all there and the chase through the Vienna sewers is a sight to behold. That first shot of Welles standing in the shadows is a cinematic masterpiece.

This isn't true, of course, but Welles did contribute dialogue. Particularly the \"cuckoo clock\" speech, which is possibly the highlight of this amazing film. Classic lines, scenes, performances. It's a fantastic work everybody should see."

But things don't add up right, and Holly suspects murder... and the contradictory answers Lime's friends are giving him don't make this suspicion any less clear.\n\nTo get prepared for this film, I read the book first. Some of the details have been removed from Graham Greene's novella, not surprisingly -- sadly, they very played down the Dexter mix-up, and the Zane Grey incident. Whereas in the book he is mistaken for an author of some fame, in the film he is simply assumed to be knowledgeable on novels as he is an author. It's a much lesser problem, and also much less humorous because of this.\n\nThere are also some name changes: Rollo becomes Holly (and never Buck Dexter), Cooler becomes Pepescu, and Winkler becomes Winkle. There's really no clear indication of why these changes have been made, with the possible exception of making the American a Hungarian. That fits the plot slightly better.\n\nThere is some dispute over whether Carol Reed or Orson Welles directed, what with the weird camera angles that Welles is known for and Reed not. I do not know any more than anyone else on this matter. I can see the stylistic cinematography, and I understand that Welles was blacklisted. But, yet, they denied it to their deaths... and I would assume the truth would leak out over the decades. But, who knows? Much has been made of the cuckoo speech, which is factually empty. I won't touch on that. What I will touch on is the zither... the zither makes this soundtrack probably one of the most unique in film history, and one of the most fitting. As odd as the sounds were, I never felt they were misplaced.\n\nThe British cop, Calloway, was not unlike Mike Myers in \"Inglorious Basterds\"... but I doubt this was any inspiration. Either way, \"The Third Man\" has been far too long overlooked. Sure, it's known in the right circles, but not really so much outside of them... until recently, I had never heard of it. That was a mistake -- one of the finer films I've seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just finished watching the \"Criterion Collection\" DVD of The Third Man, which is a glorious remastered print containing a multitude of extras. This was the first time I had ever seen the Third Man and I can honestly say that I have many conflicting feelings about it. For its cinematic accomplishments, I have to give it an 8/10. Its beautifully haunting scenes of post-war Vienna still remain clear in my mind. It truly does not seem like a film from 1949 in this aspect. However, it is considered to be the greatest \"suspense thriller\" of its kind, and it is this aspect that I highly disagree with. I never felt a sense of suspense or impending danger throughout the movie, and as far as suspense is concerned, it is no match for any of the great Hitchcock gems, or say the Manchurian Candidate. If you are expecting a suspensful thriller, I doubt you will find it here. In my humble opinion, a major reason for the lack of suspense, is the use of the ever present sounds of that damned zither. While it is an interesting choice of instruments to use, I don't feel that it is appropriate or effective. I found it to be hugely annoying and if there was a way to mute it I would have. It did not supplement the mood or action of the story in any way and constantly seemed to be out of place. A major disappointment here. Thank God they chose to leave it out during the final sewer chase, as it would have destroyed this wonderful scene. There are movies that I give 8-10/10 that I absolutely loved and fully enjoyed, and then there are others that I have to give high marks because they are great films, but I did not wholly enjoy. This is the case with The Third Man. Cinematically, it is perfect. However, I don't feel that the whole package was so. I would welcome any or all comments regarding this movie and would love to hear others feelings regarding the zither!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "There's a reason that the only Academy Award won by \"The Third Man\" went to Robert Krasker for cinematography. Of all the film noir I've seen, this night-shrouded mystery is the most visually superb. Forget the crisp dialogue or the magnetizing performance of supporting actor Orson Welles -- the picture quality of Sir Carol Reed's masterpiece is its paramount attribute.\n\nTaking place in Vienna post WWII, \"The Third Man\" follows pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) on a trip to meet his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in Vienna, only Holly soon learns that Harry has died in an accident. Looking for answers, Holly discovers that there's more to it than he realized and that Harry might not have been the person he thought he was. Trevor Howard and Alida Valli co-star as Maj. Calloway, who leads the investigation into the truth of Lime's death and Anna, Harry's former lover whom Holly falls for.\n\nDarkness pervades nearly every scene as Holly inches closer to the truth. Coupled with Reed's keen eye for dramatic camera angles, the film maintains suspense throughout, often times leading us to believe danger lurks at every turn when nothing all that visually exciting is taking place on screen (until the infamous final sewer sequence, where the film makes its biggest visual statement.)\n\nFor 1949, Reed and Krasker capture an indescribable beauty in the shadows of their film, one easily comparable to today's movies despite light years of technological advancements. Without color, film noir has to make a visual statement with vividness of light and it's really just tremendous how successful Krasker is at making that statement.\n\nOrson Welles is the perfect actor in the film's most mysterious role. His Cheshire cat smile and his drastically altered world view make him fit flawlessly into the film's dark universe. His presence sort of wakes you up in a film whose actors are talented but lack a clear signature, one that draws you to them characters. He brings a much needed thrill to the movie.\n\nWhen it comes to shots that stand out in your memory, \"The Third Man\" is loaded with them. Plain and simple, it's why this film is remembered and remembered fondly 60 years later."

        "review_detailed_main": "After watching the film, I looked over its reviews and I was not surprised by the vast divergence of opinion concerning it. It doesn't meet the expectations that many have for a movie. While I side with those that think the movie is great, I think many of the people who loved it praised it for the wrong reasons. This is not a movie with a \"gripping\" plot or characters you will remember for the rest of your life (and yes the zither music would seem out of place if you're seeking pathos). But to criticize the movie for those reasons (as many reviewers did) seems like criticizing \"Ulysses\" for being a little slow-going. Everything in the movie is DESIGNED to create the utmost emotional detachment for the viewer. Examples include the zither music, the dispassionate and unsympathetic characters, the lack of concern demonstrated by the protagonist concerning his danger (denying the viewer real suspense), the absence of \"preaching\" about the horrors of post-War Europe, the refusal to show the film's climax, and shots that make you want to look at the architecture rather than the people. Thus, despite the fact that film's story is depressing in the extreme, the persistent mood of the film is a satisfying mixture of melancholy, amusement, and cheerfulness. The effect, made possible by its detachment, provides a proper emotional seeting to contemplate the aesthetics of the movie's superb cinemeotraphy. In conclusion, if you're looking for thrills or even deep thoughts, don't watch this movie. But if you want a cheerfully detached work of art, this is the movie for you."

While I normally love seeing classic movies, after seeing The third man I felt a nagging sense of disappointment. The cinematography, acting, lighting and music are all brilliant, but we have seen better examples throughout the years. The movie has an original plot when all is revealed, but the first half of the film is simply a traditional mystery story. The final hide-and-seek chase in the end is truly well done, but it's effectiveness is undermined by the fact that Lime is at this stage depicted as a truly unsympathetic character. He is too evil for us to have sympathy with him, and he is too scared to be a frightening villain in the scene. I felt some sense of \"What's the point\" throughout the story. there is a nice story about ethics and duty, but the entire development happens in the last fifteen minutes, and seems rushed. Ultimately therefore, I found the film good, but dated and not timeless as there were few elements in this film that haven't been utilized to greater effect before and since. 8/10"

Concentration is required as the plot twists and turns, cleverly casting the viewer as the slightly desperate but determined Holly Martins as he tries to make sense of what has happened to his friend, Harry Lime. We are craftily led to a number of moral dilemmas as we weigh the value of friendship against the unseen impact of the racketeers.\n\nOn the way we meet a whole string of shady, cynical and world-weary characters, each struggling to maintain a precarious existence amongst penury and shortage. The slow pace picks up noticeably with the justly celebrated appearance of Orson Welles as Lime, all heavy overcoat and louche charm.\n\nAs one might expect from a Grahame Greene story, the subject matter is deadly serious yet laced with mordant humour and penetrating observation. The photography and lighting is pure, unalloyed pleasure, the Viennese Gothic architecture a crenellated marvel of contrasting greys and deep blacks, and shadows receding with to the sound of running footsteps on the wet cobblestones. And the zither music; yes, you will like that.\n\nThe film mostly belongs to Welles and Cotton in the lead roles, though Trevor Howard presents a marvellous study of restrained distaste as Calloway, and Bernard Lee (the future 'M' in the James Bond series) gives an excellent comic turn as his straightforward sergeant. The beautiful but remote Alida Valli is good too as the haunted girlfriend of Lime.\n\nExpect to be rewarded in direct proportion to length of your attention span, and to remember the ending shot for a very long time."

The unique theme climbed the charts worldwide and has become an instant evergreen, common even to those who have never ever seen the film itself. Yet the score is only one among many things that make \"The Third Man\" essential viewing. While the music makes the picture distinctly Austrian, it was also shot entirely on location, complete with land marks, bombed out buildings, the vast Viennese cemetery and its sewer system. Even famous Austrian actors got bits parts and added to the general look and feel. This is what post-war Vienna was all about.\n\nThe screenplay, written superbly by Graham Greene, is pure gold. It entraps the viewer in a web of black-market treachery, intrigue and deception narrated by the traditional film noir voice-over and feels like a detective story that eventually reaches existential depth. The action takes place in a divided country where the future is uncertain and anything goes to make a buck if you just do it right and aren't caught, and that's exactly what happens. The acting by Cotton, Welles, Howard and Valli leaves nothing to be desired, also the picture features one of the most legendary entrances of a character in movie history... The cinematography is a first rate lesson in style with all its tilted angles, beautiful lighting, shadows creeping along the walls, rarely seen in such impeccable mis-en-scene. Just consider the famous last shot of the film showing a character walking out of screen: It lasts nearly one and a half minutes and deftly condenses the whole drama that has taken place until then in a poignant visual convergence, the icing on film noir bliss. Well, and there's always that music. That incomparable, melancholic, bizarre, yet wonderful catchy music that will ring in your ears for quite a while..."

Orson Welles' first appearance and the shot of Orson Welles lit up by the flashlight in the sewer.\n\nI said the score was interesting but I should mention that by the hour mark I was getting a bit annoyed by how repetitive it was, but my first impression was that it was good.\n\nI'm not going to say it's a masterpiece, it very well might be, especially by 1949 standards, but I can't comment on that as I haven't seen a lot of film from that era outside of Chaplin and the three stooges so, yes this was up there in my experience, but whether or not that opinion would differ of I had more viewing of the period under my belt, I cannot say.\n\nWorth a viewing if you're looking for an interesting film of the day to see either way. Based on its own merits, I'd rate it an 8.5, but rounded it to 8 because I felt 9 was a bit too high for my taste of the film."

This is a movie which stood the test of time. Now for a second this movie in term of its narrative, script, writing, acting and directing looked like of felt like it was made back in 1949. All of the above mentioned parts of the film were more then great - they were a head of its time. Now i also loved how somehow darkly funny this movie was and especially the whole story if you think about it - i won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the story about a novelist desperately trying for find out about his closed friends dead and how it all ends its just a funny, darkly funny thing. Music as well cinematography were also great.\n\nOverall, while \"The Third Man\" isn't perfect nor it blew my away like some other films of the period, this is a great film overall, a bit a head of its time."

The prime example of german expressionistic movies. Everything is shot with an insane amount to detail.\n\nThe basic plot is simple. An american, ignorant writer goes to Vienna to find out more about his best friends demise. What are we, as the audience are about to find out?\n\nWell, I personally found out that I hate the soundtrack. That zithermusic almost made my ears bleed and I wondered for years if I would get ear cancer from just watching the movie once 20 years ago. Fortunately I didn't. Furthermore this movie is about... let's say culture shock. Or handling the absolute unknown. This movie does a great job of transporting post war Vienna and its citizens with their habits and so on. But is it something I would get up and saying Yes! Today I'm in the mood for The Third Man! Definitely not!\n\nIt's unique, it's masterful it's great! But it stinks like the perfume Medusa from Ikiryo and simultaneously it's so great!"

Add in superb acting especially by the support cast and we know we are in for a really good film.\n\nSet in Vienna just after the war, Holly Martins comes to town to meet up with an old school buddy, Harry Limes, but finds there has been a traffic accident and Limes is dead. But... the witness accounts seem to suggest that something is amiss, so Martins starts investigating.\n\nVienna is governed in sectors by different military forces. The British sector has Major Calloway, (Trevor Howard) who is just great. Realistic pauses, meaningful glances. A quite young Orson Welles is a bit pedestrian, but good enough. Of course there are twists and turns and a dramatic ending.\n\nAlida Valli as Limes's girlfriend is great too."

Joseph Cotten plays \u0091Holly' Martins, a writer trying to locate his old friend Harry Lime in a corrupt Vienna. But Harry has been killed, or so Martins is told \u0085\n\nNotable for an excellent supporting role from that wonderful character player, Trevor Howard, and for appearances from the likes of Wilfred Hyde-White (in a role merged from two intended for UK film regulars Radford and Wayne), Bernard Lee, and Alida Valli as Lime's girlfriend; it is the moment when Welles steps from the shadowed doorway that lingers in the memory; his speech about the Swiss and cuckoo-clocks (his own moment of inspiration, not Graham Greene's).\n\nGreene's screenplay is sparse and clever. I love the way that when cornered and forced to address a cultural gathering, Martins claims a leading pulp fiction author of westerns as his key influence (while he has never heard of James Joyce). The famous ending is also of note, that long, long walk past the eyes that do not see."

He doesn't show up until 2/3 of the movie is finished, but he gives his second-best performance of all time(Kane being No. 1). The story gives suprising twists in it to keep the viewer interested, but it's the photography and direction that are the stars here. The tilted angles and the rush of the sewer chase climax stand out in the film, and the cinematography is constantly brooding and mysterious, even in the daytime. One drawback is the much ballyhooed zither score, which, for a while, is a brilliant touch, but the theme is repeated to death and the effect is lost, but it won't distract you from everything else going on in this spectacular movie. 1-10 Overall--8.5 Direction--8.5 Story--7.5 Photography--9 Acting--7 Music score--6"

        "review_detailed_main": "A (dull) bloke called Holly! That bleeding zither! German expressionist/propaganda cinematography techniques! A pat and almost meaningless plot! Orson Welles being the biggest name and having the smallest part! What's going on here then?!? And how come it was all so deliciously excellent?\n\nHolly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is a down-on-his-luck writer of b-grade 'Western' novels drawn to post-war Vienna by the promise of paid employment from his old pal, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). But Harry Lime is a disgusting racketeer wanted by the police (so it transpires) and - what's more to the point - he's dead! So, to occupy his time and make the flight out worthwhile, Martin tries to discover more about the circumstances of his friend's fatality - and accidently falls in love with the melancholic actress he left behind (Alida Valli)! Dear, oh dear, oh dear... Things, however, are about to get a lot worse.\n\nThe Third Man shouldn't really be a great movie. It should just be a solid murder mystery and be done with it. Unfortunately though, for fans of mediocrity, the producers of this film conspired to bring together some very fine talent and then (as if that wasn't enough) draw from them the stand-out work of their careers! It is a film bursting with excellence. The camera work is magnificent (borrowed yea - like Citizen Kane has never been near Eisenstein!) as it trawls through the pathetic ruins of the capital of what was once Europe's most architecturally staggering empire. The script brilliantly insidious in it's ammoral view of a post-war world in which the conquerers are symbolised in either the whisky-sodden, shambolic pseudo-literasist or the callous, manipulative entrepreneur. The characters a veritably suicidal mixture of insipid dullard (Cotten - ostensibly the romantic lead!); morose entertainer (Valli - ostensibly the female romantic lead [smiles twice]!); tunnel-visioned cop (Trevor Howard - shows not one emotion throughout); and gung-ho fascist (Welles - spends half his screen time running away) - which somehow comes off because it is all played so wondrously earnestly against a back-drop of such trying hardship and unprecedented circumstance that it makes total, total sense. Welles is particularly excellent and our initial encounter with him is surely STILL one of the joys of classic cinema. And it is all brought together by the disgustingly underrated Carol Reed who grasped the 'joke' right from the start - just as Graham Greene's screenplay must surely have intended. Namely, that this isn't a game murder mystery tied around a leakily, tenuous plot; but, conversely, that it is the study of austerity and what it can do to people: Whoever they are - and wherever they're from."

I took it because I'd heard of it and felt like viewing the was a must. For the most part,I'm glad I did.\n\nThe story of dime novelist Holly Martins(Joseph Cotten,a forgotten matin\u00e9e star of yesteryear,which seems kinda unfair)who comes to Post WWII Vienna looking for work promised him by his longtime friend Harry Lime(Orson Welles,only co-starring here) plays out like a classic Noir. Lime,as it turns out is dead. He decides that the story behind this is hinkey,so he does his own investigating and uncovers some stuff he'd probably rather not have known.\n\nBesides an unique story that reads like something out of a more intelligent pulp detective novel,this is also a bit of a sly social commentary by screenwriter(adapting from his own book)Graham Greene,basically disguising his somewhat dim view of America over the Post War landscape as a whodunit,as the two American characters Martins(the unassuming semi-idealist who doesn't know the culture)and Lime(the cynical opportunist)are paralleled,with the locals being sort of the unwitting victims,among them the trusting actress Anna Schmidt(Valli,sort of a rougher version of Ingrid Bergman)who is running from her past. The British occupational police,personned by the dry and ever-suspicious Calloway(Trevor Howard,very good here,as really everyone is)is watching Martins,both disliking his idealism and sneering at his naivet\u00e9.\n\nA distractingly unbalanced soundtrack and music score coupled with a sadly poorly patched copy of the film somewhat marred my experience of this film(of course,my seeing this in segments probably didn't help either),but the story and the acting is definitely intelligent and worth the time to watch. Definite must-viewing for someone who tires(whether mostly or just sometimes)of more dumbed-down contemporary films."

It is, in my opinion, an almost perfect film and in my reckoning I cannot give higher praise than that for anything. Call me a cynic, but nothing is perfect. Perfection is something to strive for. As I watched it I realised several things. One of them was how perfect, sorry, almost perfect, the casting was for the characters. I cannot imagine any other person to take the part of Holly Martins than Joseph Cotton. Nor can I contemplate Harry Lime to be no one else except Orson Welles. Trevor Howard is wonderful and Bernard Lee is marvellous. But then again is it because I've watched it so many times that it's now a case that Holly Martins is Joseph Cotton and Harry Lime is Orson Welles and so on? Another thing was, and here I am slightly prejudiced as I like B/W photography, is what if this film had been made in colour? How ghastly a thought is that? None of the slippery bleakness of the city, none of the suspicious shadows and none of the bleakness of the night. And the final thing was that I cannot remember a better character introduction into film than Harry Lime. A cat purring around a pair a shiny black shoes of a man in a very dark doorway - suddenly a light switched on from a room in the apartment opposite spills across the road into the doorway and there stands Orson Welles.
