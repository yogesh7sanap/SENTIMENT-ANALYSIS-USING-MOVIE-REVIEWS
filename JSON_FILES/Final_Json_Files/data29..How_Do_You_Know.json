This film cost a shocking $120 million and made very little at the box office, hence becoming one of the biggest bombs of all time. I only checked it out because it was getting popular on Netflix, I somewhat regret my decision. Just as Jack Nicholson likely regrets having this, as of 2020, be his final film."

I liked that everything wasn't black and white in the film. There are many unanswered questions. The characters' intentions and feelings weren't absolutely clear. That's what I loved about it.\n\nIt's sad that so many people disliked this film, but I think it's very courageous of James l. Brooks to write a film that pleased him and not have to pace it like most other \"successful\" Hollywood crap movies. This film makes you think unlike many other huge hit comedies these days."

        "review_detailed_main": "In Arlington, Virginia, the supportive softball player Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) is cut from the national team by the coach since she is thirty-one years old and has lost her speed. She is upset and her friend Riva schedules a blind date for her with the Chief Executive Officer George Madison (Paul Rudd). However, George is committed to his girlfriend and he calls off their date. Out of blue, George receives a subpoena and finds that he is facing a process of security fraud and the company will not give legal support to him. Further, his girlfriend and friends abandon him. Meanwhile Lisa is upset and she dates the successful and womanizer baseball star Matty Reynolds (Owen Wilson) and sooner she moves to his apartment.\n\nWhen Lisa stumbles with George in the elevator, they have a long conversation and Lisa feels divided between Matty and George. The bachelor Matty decides to change his behavior and promises a monogamous relationship with Lisa. George learns that his father Charles (Jack Nicholson) is the responsible for the fraud and he requests his son to assume the responsibility and spends three years in prison to save him. George tells his father that he is in love with Lisa and he will propose her; if she accepts, he will not accept to take the blame for the fraud.\n\n\"How Do You Know\" is one of the most deceptive romantic comedies that I have recently seen, considering the cast with the names of Jack Nicholson, Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson that are wasted in a poor screenplay. The pointless story is illogical and uninteresting, with Paul Rudd performing a naive executive with the behavior of an intern or student; Reese Witherspoon performing a softball player with an erratic behavior that does not justify the profile of her character; and Owen Wilson completely lost in a dull character. The worst, there is no chemistry among these characters. The talented Jack Nicholson performs maybe the most ridiculous role of his successful career. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Como Voc\u00ea Sabe\" (\"How Do You Know\")"

        "review_detailed_main": "From looking at the casting, you would immediately think this to be a romantic comedy, and I guess that's where it starts going wrong.. from people going in to see this movie, expecting a chick flick and being disappointed.\n\nI believe the reason for the poor reviews of this movie are due to the fact that is has been advertised and delivered as a romantic comedy.\n\nTrue, it is fit for the romance genre, comedy.. not so much. But as far as romantic drama's go, this is an excellent picture for the modernized crowd.\n\nThat's because it is so much more. It is ideal for viewing of a well- intended inspiring somewhat-romantic movie. Humour is few and far between for a comedy-seeking crowd, however for those who connect to the characters, the humour is purely intended for those devised from caring for the characters.\n\nReese Witherspoon has perfected the role of Lisa, this is the movie that I would beg girlfriends to watch, due to her total delivery of the character throughout the entire picture, which is something most girls and women can relate to (whether they've reached that hurdle yet or not).\n\nWhich is where I feel the script originated from, life lessons. The script of the movie is all relatable in one aspect or other. It's moving to view a capture of these 'life lessons' within a movie, and I think if a movie can deliver that, then they have succeeded in making a good movie. Although the writing could have been sharper, better presented and wittier, it was decent enough for one to be indulged in the plot.\n\nPaul Rudd, I thought, was a fantastic casting. Again, writing could of been better for a few of his lines where comedy was intended and some of his reactions.. but still I found him to be excellent and I enjoyed watching him.\n\nNice to see Jack Nicholson again, (huge fan of One flew over the cuckoo's nest!), his part was suitable if not a little long winded. I felt (again) wittier writing would have improved his character and performance hugely, however he delivered his part.\n\nAnd Luke Wilson.. okay so we all know what kind of movie's he's known for now, and fair enough, he was a good casting for the part. My only itch is I'd like to see him doing more roles similar to Hutch, ala Starsky&, dry detective types.\n\nMoving on, as said above, this is not a movie to make you lol or rofl, merely a movie to be enjoyed from watching these character's journey of self-revelation's throughout."

Brooks' earlier works such as As Good As It Gets or Terms of Endearment. Mr. Brooks has demonstrated his ability to put together a diverse and talented cast and bring them together focusing on the things that make all of us different. The writing brings everything together where the work stands on it's own and is as strong as the sum of it's parts. So what happened here??? This film is a painful and mind numbing experience in boredom, bad writing, bad chemistry and pure stupidity! I have watched many a film and rarely have trouble sitting through them. I found myself laughing and almost screaming at this movie to go somewhere! Is it deserving of one star? Maybe I am being too harsh? No, how can you take a movie with Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson and basically throw away their talent by wrapping it around insanely boring and random dialog? The first few times the characters think they are saying something witty that makes no sense to where the movie isn't going, it is irritating. To sit through two hours of this torture is enough to drive one to drink! This movie had no exposure for a reason, avoid it! I am sure you have something better to do for two hours even if it is to watch episodes of I Love Lucy you have already seen."

I thought they could have cut some scenes out and not only gotten away with it, but made it a more enjoyable experience. Also, with actors like Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson (plus how it was advertised as a comedy) I was expecting to do a lot more laughing in the movie than I really did. Don't get me wrong, it was funny, but not as much as you'd expect. I think if you go to this movie knowing it's more of a romantic comedy than a typical Owen Wilson/Paul Rudd style comedy then you'll be pleasantly surprised.

        "review_detailed_main": "Tonight it was a rain-soaked, bone-chilling, blustery night and I wanted to find a warm comforting place to spend some enjoyable time. So, I took myself to the local theater. Of the week's new offerings I chose this film to see, I'll admit, based almost solely on my past experiences seeing films with the principal actors we see here. As it turned out, the film warmed me far more than the stingy heat in the theater. It was a very comforting presentation to enjoy on a holiday season night.\n\nOne can't say a great deal about the staging of a contemporary film. After all, it's not much of a challenge to capture the mundane surroundings we see every day. The film, then, needs something a lot more interesting injected into it to make it successful and this one succeeds marvelously. The plot concerning a down-on-his-luck businessman falling head-over-heels for a femjock who's just received the biggest disappointment in her life is just different enough to not be boring and interesting and fun enough to hold our attention. The director, James L. Brooks (who also scripted and co-produced), has an incredible track record for excellence as writer, producer, and director so it creates high expectations in a movie goer. He really delivers here with just the right nuance of sentimental warmth and comedy. Of course, he didn't do it alone, having some tremendous acting talent to lend a most competent hand.\n\nBeing me, I couldn't help but first notice the very talented, captivatingly beautiful Reese Witherspoon as Lisa, the athlete. Yes, I can even buy her as an athlete, something not every actress could carry off. She most ably, and with seeming ease, injected not only an unmistakable air of beautiful professional competence but a degree of class, physical grace and presence that is riveting to watch. It's hard to take your eyes off of her while she's on screen, and she doesn't disappoint for a single moment. Whether she's wearing a baseball uniform or elegant evening wear, she's convincing as whoever she attempts. You just naturally want to like her, to root for her to succeed and find that most elusive of dreams; happiness. Of course, as completely captivating as she is, she's not on screen alone, but surrounded by a lot of other great talents.\n\nEveryone seems to like Paul Rudd; here as George. He's a likable everyman in the same sort of mold as Jimmy Stewart and his presence improves whatever he touches. He creates a character here that just makes you want to like him and hope he succeeds. Here, he's the down-on-his-luck businessman who is set up for a blind date with the effervescent Ms. Witherspoon. I love them as a couple. On screen, they're what a lot of people hope to be; good people who find a way through life with someone else. Of course, as films always do, there are stumbling blocks.\n\nThe first stumble is that Ms. Reese is first hooked up with a real character played by the wonderfully talented Owen Wilson as Matty, the professional baseball player. He is a happy and likable guy with a simple mind and simpler morals who just can't grasp how to treat a lady - or that he really has an incredible lady right there in front of him to lose. Fun ensues and these three, Witherspoon, Rudd and Wilson really do have fun on screen and carry us along for the ride. (NOTE: One can't help but notice the quite accurate depiction of the immense difference in the way the world treats highly successful athletes of both genders. While the males are showered with obscene amounts of cash and attention, the equally great, or even perhaps better, female athletes have to settle for little more than faint praise and a pat on the back.) I was also highly entertained by a wonderful supporting cast, led by none other than the legendary Jack Nicholson as Charlie, Rudd's father and playing as fine a slime-ball as ever graced the silver screen. Thank you, Jack, for giving me a villain worthy of disliking.\n\nNow, add to this already fine mix the talent of Kathryn Hahn as Annie, Rudd's very pregnant assistant. She adds a real element of class to what otherwise may have been a mundane role. She really hits her stride in a scene with the great character actor Lenny Venito, as Al, her baby's co-producer. This pair have one of those screen moments that is so terrific it comes very close to overshadowing the main plot.\n\nOther memorable performances came from Molly Price as Coach Sally (even though her part was small she shone) and a humorous John Tormey as the doorman and, last-but-not-least the always great Tony Shalhoub as a psychiatrist Ms. Reese almost visits. The short exchange between them is very fun to watch.\n\nAll-in-all it's a great film to take someone you love to during this holiday season.\n\nBy Bruce L.

What it is, is a REAL movie, with depth, great characters, smart dialogue, and the complexity of reality, with some jokes and a love story thrown in. Great writing, superb acting. Don't know what else to say. Found it intriguing that on further review, my \"go to\" critics didn't review this one. One of the better films I've seen this year.

I would even go as far as to say that this movie has been wrongly characterized and is more of a romantic movie with a couple of chuckles. While the plot and character development could've used just a little fixing up, I'm glad this movie was made, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it."

It reminded me of a young teenager's type of romance book - one that has little/no plot and is ridiculously lame. They made Reese's character look like a complete idiot with no morals at all. I just find it hard to believe that the seasoned actors/actresses in this movie read the script and actually thought it was going to be a good movie! What were they thinking? The plot was predictable and boring. The acting wasn't much better. The theater was packed and not one person laughed at what were suppose to be the funny parts. In fact, several people got up and walked out half way through it. Do NOT waste your money on this one."

And The Well-Done Performances, only add to its pluses!\n\n'How Do You Know' Synopsis: After being cut from the USA softball team & feeling a bit past her prime, Lisa finds herself evaluating her life & in the middle of a love triangle, as a corporate guy in crisis competes with her current, baseball-playing beau.\n\n'How Do You Know' is mushy, breezy, funny & ultimately, entertaining. Brooks's Screenplay concentrates on troubled people, whom we, the audience, fall in love with. Their journey together, comes across as sweet & humorous. Brooks's Direction, on the other-hand, as always, is pitch-perfect.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Reese Witherspoon looks gorgeous & delivers a lovable performance. Paul Rudd is in terrific form. Owen Wilson leaves a mark, in a surprisingly small role. Jack Nicholson steals every scene he's in. The Legend is top-notch!\n\nOn the whole, 'How Do You Know' is worth your time."

This movie dragged on and on and we were both tempted to just leave because it was so boring. Paul Rudd is one of my most favorite actors and its a shame this movie will be in his record for life. Please save your time and money and rent this movie if you must see it. Otherwise don't see it at all. I have to reach a minimum of 10 lines...I don't know how this is possible. This movie was so dull and poorly written and directed that I am at a loss for words in complaining about it. We go to the movies every week almost and this movie ruined movie night. Please, please, please save yourself time and movie and turn around and go home or see another movie. It was really that bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "The title of this movie really has nothing to do with the story, which is why whenever my mom tries to rope me into watching it with her, she usually just calls it, \"the Owen Wilson movie you don't like.\" The irony is that I don't actually like this movie, but since I love Owen Wilson in it so much, I generally cave and watch it again. He's such a doll - which he usually is in his movies, but he's particularly adorable in this one. For me, there's no contest between him and Paul Rudd. For my mom, there's also no contest: Paul Rudd is the winner in her book. For Reese, she just doesn't know.\n\nReese plays a professional softball player whose just been cut from the team. She's devastated and feels she doesn't have a purpose or identity, and it also adds some competition and friction in her relationship with Owen Wilson, another professional ball player. Owen is pretty superficial and doesn't talk about deep issues with her - but not many boyfriends do like to talk about problems. Chances are, the men who do like to analyze their issues do so because their problems are so massive they'll never stop being at the forefront of the relationship. Enter Paul Rudd.\n\nPaul is a decent, good guy, but he's a mess. He works for his father, Jack Nicholson, and he's in the middle of a business investigation that could result in prison time, even though he did nothing wrong. When he meets Reese, they're both in such a depressed state, they share a meal together without actually talking.\n\nThere are some parts of this movie that are really sweet, like Paul's devoted secretary, Katherine Hahn. If you like Reese Witherspoon in general and feel she's a positive role model for women, you'll love her inspirational quotes posted to her mirror, and her total honesty with the men in her life. Even though I don't like the film, I understand why others do. This is a James L. Brooks film, so expect a certain charm and quirkiness to the romances, and together we can all say a bittersweet farewell to Jack Nicholson in his last screen appearance. Even in this villainous role, he's still charismatic enough to make us root against Paul Rudd. We'll miss you, old friend."

As one who works on Wall Street, I can tell you that people like George actually do exist (promoted to a position of authority due to nepotism, but set up for a fall because he actually has ethics). I thought the way they set things up with the phone call by Reba, the pragmatic selfishness of his current girlfriend, and the non-date date worked well together and was plausible enough within context to be enjoyable. I also thought the relationship between jock-player (Wilson) and over-the-hill jock Witherspoon was sweet and funny in its own way.\n\nHowever, Kathryn Hahn steals every scene she's in as Rudd's personal assistant who hates what's going on and is also a single mom-to-be. And her scene in the hospital alone was worth the price of admission to me. The ending was also well handled. This is the best Paul Rudd performance I have seen since The Shape of Things after many bad ones in-between. Witherspoon was fine even though she didn't seem to have sizzling chemistry with Rudd - she was wonderful with Wilson. The cameo by Shalhoub as a psychiatrist was hilarious. And Mark-Linn Baker was appropriately cowering as the corporate lawyer. Nicholson was fine - he felt the part even though he could have played it in his sleep. Not one of his best, but more than adequate.\n\nSo, is this an original and ground-breaking film? No. Is it a highly enjoyable romantic comedy with good supporting performances and funny scenes? Yes!"

When I came back the movie was still on my mind and it was available online and I watched it. Those are good enough signs to like a movie\n\nWhile Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd might not make to the really A list of stars, its nice to watch them. More on that later The movie is not a typical girl met guy romance. Its nice and like a few reviews here its very underrated. no stereo types either about the girl or guy. Starts with Reese Witherspoon going into a relationship with Owen Wilson, while Paul Rudd is coming out from his. No tragedy here. Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd meet on a blind date. While Reese is into some sports, Rudd is a son of a business tycoon (ever devilish Jack Nicholson). Wilson is an athlete.\n\nThe movie does not have a plot like a Inception but the dialogs are not expected either like 'I love you' and 'I love you too.' There's a very believable character in form of Rudds assistant. She is there as a friend to Rudd, one who is always there to help. At one point of time she is so much annoyed with Jack Nicholson trying to put is son down, she is ready to hit him. Thats more funny than exaggerated.\n\nThe movie itself is nice as said earlier. Don't recollect the music taking precedence over either the characters or the storyline. Production values are neat. Nothing seems out of the place. Cinematography is nice as well.\n\nOf the cast, Reese come out nicely while trying to decide among both the guys. Owen Wilson does his character all the justice. Jack Nicholson comes out with regular intensity to his character. I don't have to mention One flew over cuckoo's nest, departed, batman, As good as it gets. As much as he is believable in Anger Management, he is believable here as well But honestly one person who stands out is Paul Rudd. I have seen him in Friends, I love you man, Anchorman. Its possible for him to convey the most difficult moments with only his eyes. He needs to get his due. Watch it without expectations you will enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"We're all just one small adjustment away from making our lives work,\" says one of Reese Witherspoon's two love interests in her upcoming movie, How Do You Know. And by \"small adjustment\" he meant the addition of Reese's love into his own life - a life which had taken a bit of a wrong turn without any fault of his own but which he knew could be course-corrected with the love of the right woman by his side.\n\nHow Do You Know takes a contemporary and romantic look at the question, \"How do you know (when you are in love?)\" In this movie, Reese has two equally-cute but horribly messed up men vying for her love - played by Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd. Each man would bring unique charm, potential, challenges, compatibility and inherent flaws to the table - and it's up to Reese to realize which one of the two men is the love of her life.\n\nI won't tell you whom she picks or if she picks either at all, but I will tell you to go see this incredibly heart-warming movie. I don't know why movie critics make a habit of slamming one romantic comedy after another, like they have done with this movie. I mean, seriously, we don't go into such films looking for Oscar-worthy moments. Those of us who love light-hearted romances, simply want a break from our every day lives and in that respect, this movie delivers enough charm, laughs and touching moments to qualify as a a great chick flick.\n\nParisa, www.CelebMagnet.com"

We didn't care she was cut from a ball team! We didn't care the male ball player screwed anything that moved. And we didn't care or fully understand the corporation thing and Nickelson's involvement. This pap was nothing more than a mega star, cash cow pay check. $100M to make this!! No wonder the industry has no decent middle ground of movies and is replete with remakes/sequels and very little imagination. BTW, by the time we walked out, the coach who said he was coming over, after saying he only emails the team selections...never did. This movie epitimizes what happens when a movie is heavy loaded with star power with a script written over the weekend by some poor a** clown, born into the business without talent or skill and lends strength to considering the argument: Have we reached the point where we should stop presenting movies in theaters all together? This movie begs that question. Finally, armed with an annual free pass card, my one bit of satisfaction was that I didn't pay for this and help perpetuate star salaries without receiving an expected deliverable in the form of a real movie script."

Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) is a 31-year old tomboyish soft-ball player, cut from the American national team as to input new fresh blood to the squad. Destroyed by the revelation she spirals into an unhealthy relationship with a wittingly charming, but inherently destructive polygamist base-baller Matty (Owen Wilson). Meanwhile George (Paul Rudd), a rare breed of honest financiers, is being monitored for embezzlement and tax evasion, thus being cut from his company and brought on the verge of destitution. All because of his father Charles (Jack Nicholson), the company owner, who thought it best his son takes the fall for him, as not to spend the rest of his life in prison. Both in varying phases of depression, resignation and self-denigration the hopeless duo find an area of bliss happiness in each others company.\n\nHaving little to no knowledge regarding the movie beforehand, apart from a gist of the acting cast, featuring my personal favourites Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon. Overwhelmingly convinced that this would be another meek romantic comedy, it seem became pretty obvious, that it has more in common with \"500 Years of Summer\", hence possibly the body of disappointment surrounding the movie. Obviously \"How Do You Know?\" fails to live up to the same quality, but the general feel and gist is somewhat similar, whilst the humour less pronounced than in a chick flick, although I still found it hilarious. Nonetheless certain clich\u00e9d occurrences, such as 'finding exactly what I needed' by having a dinner in dead silence does pose questions regarding the intellectual integrity. The overall message of getting up and countering the beatings of life does get taken by the undertow of romantic interaction, but does it with enough charm, that I forgot about the lost potential.\n\nThat said both Witherspoon and Rudd bring a charming novelty through their characters, coupled with a surprisingly efficient performance by Owen Wilson as the well-meaning, but mindbogglingly spoilt baseball star, bring a novel feel to the humour, which has awkward sensibility, far from the more up front standard people are used to. Witherspoon especially totals her role, seamlessly taking on the complex guise of a female in inner turmoil."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was shocked to come to the IMDb and find this thing rated under 6/10! When I lived in the States, I had season tickets to one or two live theater venues. If you watch live theater, you become sensitive to a style of live theatrical writing.\n\nI suspect people were put off by the theatrical feel of the piece. I understand that there's an established style for film which is supposed to be different from the stage. But I love the stage, and I look for films that appear to have two feet firmly planted in both worlds. What I like is a film that (naturally) exploits the spacial/temporal flexibility of film, while retaining the intensity of great scene/ensemble writing.\n\nI feel that \"How Do You Know\" has these qualities.\n\nHere's probably another pop culture Achilles's Heel for this flick: The writing is so great that it eclipses the star power. Is that the problem? Solution: Grow up. When acting fails to transcend ego... well, usually such films go straight to DVD and wind up in the bargain bin. And here's the big news: Good writing is supposed to create the characters. All too often, actors wind up getting paid to make sucky scripts work in spite of themselves. In \"How Do You Know\", the writing fully fleshes in those characters, and the acting power in the flick molds itself to those created characters, like hands in gloves.\n\nAnd, furthermore, such writing ennobles actors and actresses, showing them to be great artists (or not). So, for example, Owen Wilson, in many peoples' minds relegated to dependable one-note-johnny status as an actor, actually conforms himself to the spunky charm of the written character and gets to jump up on the mountaintop, alongside Olivier, for a few touching, precious moments.\n\nIn short: This is the real scourge of Hollywood: That the movie-going public has been trained over the years not to expect, let alone demand, good writing. We need to become sensitive to the film Shakespeares out there and attend and support their work. I vote that a vote for \"How Do You Know\" is a vote for a step in the right direction.\n\nWatch it. Listen to the text. Watch the ensemble work. Get hip to the music of good theater writing, and learn to expect nothing less from the movies that you spend your precious life's moments watching."

They aren't interesting.\n\nWitherspoon's character evidently has no self-respect at all - although that issue isn't examined any - as she lets herself be lead around by a mindless boyfriend who is not faithful to her and takes no interest in her life - though, frankly, her life doesn't seem very interesting.\n\nShe is alternately attracted to another boyfriend, Paul Rudd's character, who doesn't seem to have anything to himself either.\n\nWhat, then, was the point of this movie???? Beats me.\n\nAll I can say is, if you're looking for a movie about baseball, as I was, skip this. Whatever it may be about, it's not baseball.\n\nEven chick flicks should be better than this."

I don't fault it for being understated, but it was weird. Poor Reese had to repeatedly use the same bewildered, searching expression over and over to remind the audience that this was the way they expected you to feel. Like what was that..? On the positive side Rudd and Wilson delivered the few clever lines amazingly. Nicholson's last scene in the movie was perfect- no dialogue, all facial expressions. Abrupt end."

I found it difficult to watch, it finally picks up about the time most movies would end.

        "review_detailed_main": "For a James L. Brooks rom com with such sterling cast in both the \"rom\" and \"com\" categories - I was, uh... expecting more from \"How Do You Know?\"\n\nI spent much of this movie trying to find the bead with the protagonist, Paul Rudd's George Madison, a kind of weird ADD case who wants desperately to be more lovable / likable / desirable. I couldn't. Rudd seems to be playing to a type here - kind of a quirky, weird, strange, but oh so eminently likable every man - but the schtick to my mind kind of falls flat. I love Paul Rudd of course but he seems to be missing good direction on how to \"find\" his character throughout the movie.\n\nHe plays the very approximate foil (as in, they seem to share some screen time and space) to Owen Wilson's womanizing professional baseball player who can't seem to commit - but faux-really-really-wants-to (he doesn't, really) to Reese Witherspoon's slightly over-the-hill softball Olympian at the crux of a major life shift. She seems to want to be with Wilson, but doesn't, but does, but doesn't. Wilson seems riddled with a series of flaws common to a highly successful man-child whose ego is constantly catered to and has had innumerable meaningless flings and depthless relationships with women. He's trying and failing to be a serious adult, which irks Witherspoon's character but she can't quite find the resolve to kick the guy to the curb (though she inexplicably moves in then out then in then out of his luxurious millionaire ball player's condo).\n\nBrought into this dynamic is Rudd's George Madison, the more sensitive, intuitively sweet and loving type vs. Owen Wilson's character but even he has immediately just gotten out of a relationship with a woman who seems to want to do the on-again, off-again thing with Wilson when it suits her. George seems rather compliant in this regard but then immediately goes after Witherspoon's character when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nTypically James L. Brooks' romantic comedies like this work incredibly well with the strength of the actors, writing, and direction involved - but everything about \"How Do You Know\" seems to be hitting wide of the mark. Rudd's George isn't as endearing, lovable, quirky, or as interesting as you really want him to be. Same with Witherspoon. I honestly didn't feel grabbed by any serious chemistry. She seems alternately puzzled and charmed by Rudd's weirdness and strange behavior, but even then it's not always believable to me.\n\nDid I mention Jack Nicholson was in this? Go figure. Yes he plays George's morally questionable father who has put the company George has been running - technically his father's company - into dire financial and legal straits. The details aren't particularly important as George seems to be stumbling through role as \"the boss\" anyway and somehow missed all the sketchy stuff going on behind the scenes. It puts George into a bit of a moral dilemma about whether to save his father or save himself but the legal drama that starts the movie off isn't especially important or even all that interesting.\n\nNicholson is great but seems to be huffing-and-puffing his way along. I'm always a little shocked to see Nicholson is still alive after all these years, given what seems to be his steady diet of cheeseburgers. He seems to be taking a sheet from Marlon Brando's playbook: I'm here for a good time not a long time (though I'd say he's lived far longer than what most consider his sell-by date). His doctors are probably marveling that he has not yet keeled over from a heart attack.\n\nYou don't have to wonder why you've almost certainly never heard of this movie. It really is kind of a strange little film that has a decent, respectable premise but ultimately kind of weird execution and direction. There's a few good jokes here and there, some decent acting, but I felt like the protagonist needed better direction to find his center. Rudd may not have been the best casting here but then again maybe he would have done just fine with a different direction."

It's a well written story, portrayed by great artists. There were funny scenes so I don't get why many complained it was not funny. It also had memorable heartwarming moments. But my favorite aspect about this film is how the messages it want to convey are not smacked on the viewers' face. They were subtly delivered, allowing the viewers to relish them and form their own thought. At least that was my experience.\n\nMy real rating is 8. But I think it is unfair that a gem like this is underrated so I'd give it a 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has something that I truly enjoy in the genre: a girl that thinks before making her decisions...the difference with other movies is that this girl thinks things over and over so much not really because she wants to pick the right path for herself but because in the end she is so insecure she doesn't know what she wants! This does not stop her thou since she is tough and impulsive she just goes with the first thing that comes to her mind and regrets it ten seconds later. The magic of this movie is that instead of choosing the typical perfect man movie stereotype as her love interest we find ourselves with much more realistic guys for our main girl: a boyfriend who is not very clever with anything but gives his best at trying to keep up with his girlfriend's constant twist and turns (that end up making him a better person and boyfriend) , and a guy that well...life has forced him to become as insecure and indecisive as our main character. So if you are really not up to seeing the journey of this two very insecure people get back on their feet together, just don't go watch it because you are not going to consider it funny since it is always crucial to understand the concept and like (or love) the characters (or something about them at least) in order to enjoy the jokes...I found it clever different and extremely adorable... Many say the movie is long but in my opinion it was necessary to make the characters stronger and more defined. The acting was fantastic (as it always is for them three) SPECIAL REQUEST TO IMDb USERS: Dig deeper into films go watch them for concept and message instead of just to get a good laugh or see cool 3d effects because if one takes that as the main focus then we miss out on the true essence of movies which I like to call...soul. I'm not asking you to overlook what is usually commented I'm just asking you to look at the whole picture and truly observe."

The only good thing i can say is the directors made Philadelphia look good.\n\nPlease don't waste your money at least wait for on demand or Netflix.\n\nI attended the movie with my mother and sister and we all separately felt the same way about the movie. Reese did do a good job portraying the mentality of an athlete though, as our family has personal experience and can relate to her character."

No comedy, no good lines and a bit of overacting and rambling, or gibberish lines.\n\nI will admit Ms Witherspoon was pretty good, but all she had to do was to react to things and she did that well.\n\nWith the star power in here one would expect something good. Didn't happen. I never had a Worst Movie Listing until now. Even the \"when\" or the \"now\" moment from the question how do you know didn't ignite anything. Sad.\n\nThe only really good acting moment was when Lisa visited her psychiatrist played by a bearded Tony Shalhoub. Mr. Shalhoub (Monk from the TV show: Monk) and Lisa had a good moment. That was it.\n\nOkay, so I thought the two main stars would get together at the end and I would admit to a feel good moment. Didn't happen.

We both stood up and sad to each other \"Wow, that was a really bad movie\" Just didn't flow, you didn't like any of the characters. There was too much going on and not enough focus on one story.

Maybe you won't want to hear the messages, maybe you're not in the mood, but you will accept delivery.\n\nEvery few years, I watch this film and forget the details of the plot. That means there will be fresh tears. Tears of happiness but here comes the waterworks! Paul Rudd is, as usual, the perfect 'chick flick' hero. A little TOO perfect for some. Yet he has the comedic chops to lift a scene that threatens to bog down in sentimentality.\n\nReese Witherspoon does something that must be very challenging: she acts the role of the athlete working on developing her thick skin while also being soft and appealingly feminine. What complicates her character is her tendency to talk through all her feelings while evaluating all her feelings. Too much? Even her character has to stand back now and then and say, 'Enough already...'\n\nI don't understand how this wonderful script with these wonderful actors failed to add up to a huge box office hit.\n\nI've finally come up with this: it's too many smart (even brilliant) ideas in a movie that dating couples are going to wish was just a bit of fluff between dinner and bar-hopping. There's so much to think about from the conflicts presented that it just might happen that the evening ends up being a thoughtful debate about futures and hopes and vulnerabilities. Who wants that on a date? Uh, NO ONE!\n\nAnd there you have it.\n\n(If you are not on a date, see the movie. Have some Kleenex handy for a scene or two.

Most of what is being said makes no sense, and the characters react seemingly at random to the events around them. Anger, happiness, mistrust, trust, love, hate; they're all thrown around as if the director was throwing a dice while writing the script, to determine what would happen next. Since nothing adds up or goes anywhere, the viewer is left trying to piece things together themselves. And I don't mean that in a good way.\n\nThe talented but apparently clueless actors who signed up to film this horror show of a script seem like they've realized their mistake mid-production, and most just phone it in. Wasting Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson like this should be punishable by .... well, something!\n\nOn top of all this, the movie is two whole hours long, for absolutely no reason at all. And despite the length, it ends too sudden and leaves the viewer feeling cheated. One smile (Rudd slams his head against a table in a humorous fashion) is all I mustered.\n\nNot just a waste of talent then, but also of your time. Steer clear."

I had numerous classes with female jocks in college and she really reminded me of them, especially in her reactions to other people. I enjoyed the way the director left enough space in many of the scenes so I could just watch the characters and their subtleties. I think it is hard to appreciate good performances when one is expecting a romantic-comedy so that is why this movie seems to be not quite what is advertised. If you're in the mood for typical fluff, this will seem too slow and slightly off. But, if you want a rom-com with a relatively healthy dose of richness and substance, I recommend this film."

The problem is that neither actor is convincing in making us believe they want to be in love, or are capable of being in love with each other, in particular.\n\nThere are pointless subplots, forgettable and clich\u00e9d secondary characters (Owen Wilson...PLEASE find a decent part, we beg you, or ditch your current agent) and everyone seems to be having as miserable a time as we wind up having. I understand Nicholson being in the movie since he's a Brooks alum but he's beyond phoning his performance here...he looks and acts as if he's on another planet.\n\nBrooks needs to get serious about writing again. This is the genius that brought us \"Terms of Endearment\" and \"Broadcast News\" for God's sake! The man can write conflict, tension, and scads of sympathetic, believable, heart-rending characters. But none of them live in the wasteland that is \"How Do You Know.\" Skip it, you'll miss out on a good two hour slumber only.\n\nThis is Rom-Com by the numbers...the complete opposite of a wittily written gem like \"(500) Days of Summer.\" Can this genre of movie simply be that hard to pen? Apparently, or couples need to find something more original to do on their nights out and put this tired old shtick out of business."

I cannot give every reason why this movie should have never been released, yet I will give a few. I have seen original high school plays with far better writing than the dialog in this film. The voice over dubbing was poorly done and very distracting. I think that due to the dubbing, the actors felt it necessary to over act/react to every situation. Owen Wilson was the only redeeming character in the movie. He played his usual likable carefree guy. The other three main characters should have sued to not let this film be released. Jack Nicholson was awful, (Jack, what the hell were you thinking)? When after an hour my wife asked how much longer, I told her probably another 30 minutes. The film dragged on for about another hour, which seemed like one of the longest hours of my life. All I can say is, do yourself and anyone care about a favor and avoid this film at all costs."

The box office spoke loud and clear; one month after release - during the peak movie-going time of the year, it had recouped only one-quarter of its $120,000,000 budget. This is a fragmented, disjointed film with a horrendous script and barely there performances from Witherspoon, Nicholson and Wilson. I cringed while watching. Apparently, even Oscar winners will prostitute themselves when the price is right."

Brooks is a fantastic sit-com writer as well. Then why did the dialogue continue with inane wording? It needed to be edited in the worse way. I kept waiting for something magnificent to happen, and it droned on like a grammar school play. What a shame; but then again, ya gotta have stinkers if you hope for a few \"roses\".

After her life takes a drastic turn Lisa (Witherspoon) tries to start over with new boyfriend Matty (Wilson). Businessman George's (Paul Rudd) life is also falling apart. A chance meeting between the two has the potential of helping them both through their problems. Although this is a pretty standard chick-flick it's a lot better then most. This is a movie that is 100% depended on the characters, and the casting again makes this movie better then it really could have been. Reese Witherspoon's part at first seems basic, but an actress like her as a way of taking a complex part and making it seem that way. Owen Wilson plays a guy so unlikeable you really hope he suffers. Paul Rudd also plays a complex character that is overly likable. Jack Nicholson plays Rudd's dad, and the biggest complaint I have with the movie is that he's not in it enough. This movie does something that is hard to do, a funny, romantic comedy that is enjoyable for both men and women. I think that a lot of that has to do with the casting.

Definitely should have featured the fact that Reese Witherspoon plays an athlete!! I didn't see it in the theaters because it just seemed like that stock character Reese usually plays. Owen Wilson, Paul Rudd, Jack--great acting!!! Everyone's in limbo and trying to move forward through uncertainty, which many people can relate to. Locations are beautiful.

We don't. The chemistry between the leads is wonderful, and Owen Wilson is very good indeed at pulling of the difficult act of the playboy but does so with such insouciance that you have to just laugh and go with it.

Are these reviewers the same people who flock to Jason Statham movies, Angelina Jolie movies and SAW movies?\n\nOK, it's not the greatest rom-com ever, but it has four superior points going for it, and they more than carry the day.\n\n1. There are dozens of great, even laugh-out-loud lines in it, written by some very smart, funny people. And all the characters get their share, and deliver them perfectly. Great writing like this makes a movie delightful and delicious.\n\n2. This is the best acting by Jack Nicholson in years and years. He's at the top of his form and a pure joy to behold. It's a performance like his in this movie that inspires people to want to become actors, to try to emulate what he can accomplish when he's at his very best. I'll see this movie again just to watch his subtle, emotional, wonderful elevation of his character far beyond the highest expectations and hopes of the writers and director.\n\n3. Owen Wilson. For years he's just cruised through role after role delivering lines, relying on his smirk and physical presence to carry him, and becoming one of the most boring actors in the business. Here he absolutely shines. He acts! He acts the simpleton, but with the simplest of deliveries, and with a control and restraint (that seem new to him) which are perfect for his character. Wilson is challenged to play a purely straightforward, intelligent, friendly, honest, clueless misogynist, and he carries it off like aces. He doesn't go for a laugh once, but is the funniest thing about this whole funny film.\n\n4. Kathryn Hahn. WOW! What a tour de force by an actress who has spent so long delivering straight lines to carry stories along. If Owen Wilson shines, then Kathryn Hahn must be the very sun itself. Her part is limited but she throws off sparks in every scene she's in. There are many highlights in this film, and all her scenes are among them. I quickly found myself waiting and hoping for her next appearance.\n\nAnd frankly, while I'm not giving them their own numbered paragraphs, Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd, who have the workhorse roles and the responsibility for carrying this movie on their shoulders, really come through. She in particular looks great, better than ever, and they both give natural performances with difficult lines. These two are starting to put their contemporaries in the shade, blow their doors off, leave them in the dust, outdistance them by furlongs, etc., etc., etc.\n\nSo let the moron reviewers have their say, but close your ears to their ignorance. This is not the best romantic story since Adam and Eve, but it's good and it's funny and it'll soon be one of the staple features in all the acting schools in America."

        "review_detailed_main": "It starts like a sports movie turns in to a Wall Street thriller and ends like a love story. Little strange for a mundane romantic movie yet it's interesting than it looks.\n\nLisa who is a softball player gets cut from the next year's team which forces a change in her life. Without knowing what to do she finds out that a decent guy from corporate world who is currently being investigated for federal fraud and a millionaire base ball player starts to interest her. Confused enough in the middle of these two who are completely different characters from each other she struggles to find a balance and choose who is correct for her.\n\nThe plot is short and sweet just like in many romantic movies out there and so do the acting and characters themselves. There is nothing special to go crazy about 'How do you know me' but there is something which will make you hang in to it. However when it comes to acting Paul Rudd (Who plays George the corporate guy) is quite remarkable here. It seems like he got the correct role which he surely enjoyed portraying. And the wonderful appearance of Jack Nicolson lights up the story as well.\n\nLisa played by Reese Witherspoon is a strong character which tries to reason with her own self when something goes wrong. Reese pulls it out quite well. And at times she proves that being positive can actually make you though difficult situations in life. (And dating two guys at once helps too!)\n\nYou won't be taking anything away after watching it for a whole two hours which is quite a bit longer than usual for this kind of flick. You can have some good laughs and be light hearted with 'How do you know me'.\n\nMore at flickshout.blogspot.com"

Maybe it is that awful script. Now, it do not matters.\n\nThis movie is just not funny. It is unfunny, the total opposite of to be funny. And another thing, which is also very bad, it is not a romantic movie, no, trust me.\n\nThis is one of two movies I gave 1 out of 10. The second one is Moscow Zero, prototype of very bad movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "James L. Brooks has given us some very fine films (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and some mediocre (at best) ones - like Spanglish, The Simpsons Movie and numerous TV series. The odd thing about this much maligned HOW DO YOU KNOW is that it seems to be searching to find a reason for being mad - often to the point of feeling as though Brooks wrote the script as he went. For this viewer the film is not as bad as the audiences and critics say, but it is definitely one of Brooks' memorable works. The characters he created are for the most part losers who manage to get along in life because of an occult optimism. That part is refreshing.\n\nLisa (Reese Witherspoon) is a much loved Pro Softball player whose ego is badly bruised when she is cut from the new team. She dates Matty (Owen Wilson), a wealthy major league baseball pitcher who is either horrifically naive or completely clueless when it comes to relating to Lisa. Concurrently we meet George (Paul Rudd), a bright but emotionally ill- equipped businessman who has just been indicted in his work for his father Charles's (Jack Nicholson) company - apparently for something he did not do. Just as this vulnerable guy needs support he is dumped by his girlfriend and must move out of his place to lesser digs with the help of his devoted assistant Annie (Kathryn Hahn) who is very pregnant but unwed. Lisa meets George on a date arranged by well-meaning friends, but Lisa is 'committed' to Matty. Some chemistry between Lisa and George develops, Matty makes moves to change and invites Lisa to move in, George and his father duel over the indictment, and finally the 'sort of love' triangle finds a shaky center and Pow! the movie is over.\n\nWitherspoon makes the best of her odd role and Paul Rudd restores some glory to his dwindling cinematic repertoire. Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson, and Jack Nicholson looks like he is one the wrong movie set. Part of this little film is smart, but it just never quite gels. How do we know? Just watch it with low expectations and be surprised here and there.\n\nGrady Harp"

The acting was sub par and I blame this on the director and the script.\n\nTo take Jack Nicholson and screw up a movie is quite a feat. But to take him, and Witherspoon, and Wilson and put Rudd in the same movie and it goes no where is really a leap.\n\nI do have some questions that perhaps someone can answer: 1. What was the whole assistant and her pregnant got to do with the story? 2. Why did he give her the watch and have this big party and then she says she wants to 'hang out' with Rudd? He goes from a strong person to a real wozz in the movie? 3. Witherspoon moves in and out that the door man must have had a time figuring out if she lived there or was visiting. Does she not sit and discuss why Owen made the comment? Is he not allowed to make a mistake as this is what appeared to be his first real live-in relationship so he is new to all of this.\n\nWitherspoon's here comes off like a whinny self-absorbed (rymns with witch) Notice that I did not use the names of the people in the movie, because this was not a movie but a total waste of such great talent. Each could have gotten into phone booths and called in their parts.\n\nThere was no depth and there was no reason to have any feelings for any of the people in the movie. Disjointed, mixed up, went no where and a waste of time.\n\nI only give it 2 stars because of the actors in the movie and it is not their fault.\n\nDUD!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This comedy-drama starring Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, and Owen Wilson directed by James R. Brooks offers up a romantic triangle that at its core is a serious, cerebral look at relationships with strong humorous overtones. Unlike Reese Witherspoon's romantic triangle in This Means War an action, comedy thriller two years later, Witherspoon's character in How Do You Know is much more involved and three-dimensional. This film is for some unsettling with unresolved subplots, especially when it comes to Witherspoon's career. And unlike the more acceptable as well as delightfully twisty romantic comedy triangle of My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010) with Alyssa Milano, How Do You Know presents two credible suitors but whose relationship with Witherspoon's character is both convoluted, quite well executed and realistic yet somewhat unsatisfactorily resolved and off-putting. At the same time, it is just this uneasy sense of denouement that makes this movie critically stronger and more substantive, if not plainly audience pleasing. For those looking for an extended look at romantic relationships involving two credible male characters that may recall one's own relational conflicts and torments, this movie puts you in the middle of it all."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's your usual affair- guy meets girl, guy falls for girl, there are some ups and downs inbetween but eventually guy and girl get together. Now you are wondering why I've spoilt the ending for you? Well I haven't because there are two guys in this movie in a lovely romance triangle.\n\nLisa (Reese Witherspoon) plays our indecisive femme fatale with George (Paul Rudd) and Matty (Owen Wilson) the men doting after her. The movie compromises of 2 separate story lines that eventually merge. In one Lisa is a USA softball player who has just been dropped from the national team and Matty, her current boyfriend, is a major-league baseball star. He is a player both on and off the pitch and doesn't totally understand the workings of a relationship but is trying to for her.\n\nIn the other George, like Lisa is going through his own problems as he is being indited by the government and faces some serious charges if convicted and has also been dumped by his girlfriend. However due to a series of phone calls and chance encounters George keeps meeting Lisa which leads to the 2 men competing for her affection in their own unique ways.\n\nGeorge's father (acted by Jack Nicholson) and Annie, George's secretary (impressively portrayed by Kathryn Hahn) are the outlets from the romantic side of the story and bring with them some of the better moments in the movie from a comic point of view. It seems that this kind of role is starting to become Wilson's mainstay in the movies with the majority of his performances being based around the slightly error prone man (Hall Pass, You Me And Dupree). He never really impresses me and the chemistry is not there from the start unlike with Rudd who puts in a convincing performance with Witherspoon.\n\nI felt that the plot surrounding this is slightly more in-depth than some of the other romcoms out there but by no means that complex that it becomes hard to follow. It just tended to be a bit more detailed than I was expecting before I sat down to watch it. This could be due to it's 2 hour length though which is quite a long time to invest in a romcom that does drag at points.\n\nThis isn't in the same league as the last movie where James L Brooks and Nicholson teamed up (As Good As It Gets) but if you feel slightly brain dead and want to waste a few hours then this might just do the trick. If there had been a bit more comedy then it might have faired slightly better.\n\nFor further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

        "review_title": "Despite a Stellar Trio of Stars, Brooks Sags This Time Around with a Meandering Triangle Yarn",
        "review_detailed_main": "Somewhere hidden in this overlong, often exasperating 2010 comedy is a small-scale independent film about flawed characters trying to take charge of their lives when they really never had the control to begin with. That more intimate movie is the one I wanted to see, but veteran director/screenwriter James L. Brooks (\"Terms of Endearment\") appears focused on showing the messiness of their lives by adding incidental characters and overinvolved subplots that do little to enrich the romantic triangle at the story's heart. This approach could have worked better as a TV series where you would have a reason to come back every episode, but I think Brooks makes a fundamental mistake in thinking that such an approach works over a two-hour running time because the emotional payoff feels marginal. That's not to say the movie isn't smart, insightful, and funny in its scattershot way, but it's just too unwieldy to love.\n\nSimilar to the structure of Brooks' \"Broadcast News\", the meandering plot focuses on 31-year-old Lisa Jorgenson, a popular career softball player who suddenly gets cut from the Team USA roster. Cast adrift from her one passion in life, she starts dating Matty Reynolds, a self-indulgent A-Rod-type pro baseball player with a classic case of Peter Pan Syndrome. In this tenuous situation comes George Madison, a financial executive who first alienates Lisa by giving her a courtesy call just to tell her he is seeing someone else. However, his world comes crashing down when he becomes the target of a criminal investigation for corporate malfeasance at a company run by his conniving tycoon father Charles Madison. George's shallow girlfriend dumps him, so he calls Lisa for what turns out to be a disastrous blind date. At the same time, they haphazardly bond over their respective misfortunes just as Matty tries to acquit himself of his selfish, womanizing ways. The romantic triangle is set up for further complications until the eventual resolution.\n\nThe stars perform admirably under the circumstances. In Lisa, Reese Witherspoon finds a role that accommodates her likable steeliness with a gently probing vulnerability. Playing Matty, Owen Wilson comes across more predictably amusing as the supreme man-boy so proud of his glimmers of maturity that he has to announce them out loud to Lisa. Paul Rudd probably fares the best of the trio as George simply because he has that schlubby everyman demeanor down to an art, and there is a flattering hint of Jack Lemmon circa 1960 in his performance. Jack Nicholson returns in his fourth role in a Brooks film, this time playing the subsidiary role of Charles with his mastery of sleaze intact. Kathryn Hahn portrays George's loyal and very pregnant assistant Annie in a little too broad a manner for the company she keeps here, but my guess is that Brooks encouraged her to play it that way in order to provide a striking contrast with the introspective workings of the principal characters.\n\nConsidering the film's disappointing box office returns, the 2011 DVD offers a surprisingly abundant set of extras - a decent audio commentary by Brooks and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski plus a select scenes commentary with Brooks and Wilson obviously focusing on the actor's scenes as Matty; four deleted scenes; a quick blooper reel; and a fifteen-minute making-of featurette. The Blu-Ray adds an interactive script gallery; a conversation with Brooks and composer Hans Zimmer; more deleted scenes with more Brooks commentary, and another featurette focused on Rudd's character."

Somehow the odd tone was never off-putting, The idea of a love triangle involving both an incredibly immature pro athlete and a beleaguered businessman didn't seem ridiculous or stacked. An overdone family business subplot didn't crash the film. There were enough good laughs to carry the film to its conclusion. From the various reviews, I can tell this film polarizes viewers, with some loving and some hating it, I'm more in the middle, though on the positive side; I liked it just fine."

It covers young people in their early thirties having to make tough choices about their life and career, and does it with way more thought and accuracy than something like \"Morning Glory\"(2010).\n\nThe film begins with some interesting parallels. George (Paul Rudd) and Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) have had some unlucky breaks in their careers and their lives are going straight downhill. George is with an analytically-minded girlfriend but she thinks his troubles would be too much for their relationship, meanwhile Lisa is with Matty (Owen Wilson) but he doesn't have enough brain power to care what she's thinking let alone what that would mean. It ends up playing out like a romantic comedy rather than a drama, but there is still a lot of thought and simple honesty to the whole thing.\n\nThis is the role that I have been waiting for for Paul Rudd. He is still very funny but this is about his character and what he's going to do with the crap that life has handed him. Witherspoon was cute and likable. Sometimes their simple messages were too simple and things got a little too neat, but the actors were all quite funny and I thoroughly enjoyed \"How Do You Know\"."

All headlining actors created likable enough characters and you can't really ask for more in a movie such as this.

The plot, like most \"chick flicks\" is pretty predictable. I found it completely annoying that Witherspoon's character spoke in mostly clich\u00e9s and motivational sayings. I understand that was part of her character's competitive softball playing lifestyle, but I kept waiting for something even remotely genuine to be said. Paul Rudd's character was just odd. He's supposed to be odd, but it just got old after a while. Nickolson's character had a sort of sub-plot going on that I felt should have gotten more detail and focus.

I kept hoping this movie would end (and part of that was due to the fact it was kind of long). I very seldom found it funny, even when you could tell that the writers were trying so hard to be funny. All in all, save your time and money and don't watch this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The core story is fine... the leads are well cast... the acting OK... the direction horrible.\n\nSometimes is it very hard to pinpoint why a movie misses being really good... has really fine little moments but never connects them... in the case of \"How do you Know,\" you can start with the silly tile... what it means even if the line is said in the movie I could not tell you.\n\nThe background music in the first have is completely crossed with the emotions... irritating even. One thinks all the time... why is this director interrupting these fine actors and actresses with incessant cutting during conversations?\n\nBut if I were to really get to why this film almost makes it... but fails in the end...it comes down to the director's misunderstanding of Resses Witherspoon.\n\nResse is a woman now... she needs to be herself... the girl next door that we all love... but has to transition in our minds to the more serious emotionally deep women that we want her to be. And Reese has to realize that the reason people love her in movies is that she is.... joyous inside and empathetic to others... it comes across so easily for her characters.\n\nWhen she brightens up, the movies moves well... when she darkens it loses its way. Nothing wrong with the character... just the mix of emotions seems off and it is not Reese's acting so much as the character is not well drawn.\n\nOwen Wilson is very good with... Reese but is not allowed out of his character's blond arrogant baseball player box.\n\nThere is a scene where Reese and Owen are sitting together in his character's kitchen... you can see their potential as actors together... but the director does not know how to bring it out.\n\nJack Nickelson is wasted in every scene... even disrespected.\n\nAgain the directing but also the writing of his character is a parody of other characters Jack has played...but... without the good writing and truth.\n\nHow you can have him in your movie and not bring him together on scene more with Reese... as the story demanded... but the director for some reason suppressed... is really really... odd.\n\nThere are a few moments that are laugh out loud funny... and several well written... . Paul Rudd... is very good but the strange pacing of the movie which is also a problem throughout... keeps his character from appearing anything more than confused until the very end. We never really feel who he is... Owen comes off a little better if a stereotype for him... Rudd's character's father Nickelson... is a shadow of a on screen person... and Reese struggles throughout the movie with a mostly badly written part, whose actions are shallow in the main.\n\nIt goes to show that... even well cast movies... can not carry an only partially well written scrip and never when badly directed.\n\nStill the movie has moments... deep ones even... and is truthful always... it is just that those touching moments are never connected well... in the dynamic of the movie or in the character's lives."

It has been her lifelong dream and now she is kind of adrift. Meanwhile, George is being investigated by the Feds for something he didn't do...but because of that he is being iced out by both his company and the company CEO...his father, played by Jack Nicholson.\n\nGeorge and Lisa meet...while both are suffering in their lives and it is decidedly awkward and not their best moments. Lisa is also dating a professional baseball player, played by Owen Wilson, who is nothing more than an adult child.\n\nI had several outbursts of laughter...like when George physically runs away from his father and when one baseball player explains to the other that he knows he's in love when he \"wants to wear a condom with the other women\". (So very professional athlete!)\n\nMost of this movie was a pass for me...but the contrast of the gifts for Lisa's birthday along with the story that came with the play dough was the redeeming scene in the film. I'm not sure I would classify this as a romantic rom com...but I think people struggling with their place or \"what to do next\" might appreciate this film."

The Fed's are investigating George for a financial crime that his Dad committed and his Dad (Jack Nicholson) wants his son to do the jail time for him. George meets Lisa in a elevator at the same building where Matty and Charles live. Together they find themselves in a romance that seems to work. Film pace slow, jokes miss-fired, Matty's cluelessness annoying, FBI investigation not needed and George being to dorky, made it a rocky road cookie with no flavor. 2 out of 5 stars."

How Do You Know had its moments, but for me it didn't work. It's redeeming qualities come from some beguiling filming and scenery, a nice soundtrack and two good performances from Paul Rudd and Kathryn Hahn, particularly Rudd. The story for starters is very plodding and predictable, with an ending you can smell a mile off, while neither the comedic and romantic aspects work, few of the comedic moments feel natural and the romantic moments are stilted both in pace and flow of the dialogue. The direction(coming from a director with a hit-and-miss resume) is rather characterless and I could not properly connect to the characters, Witherspoon's especially annoyed me. Aside from Rudd and Hahn, the other acting fails to make an impression. Owen Wilson has some likable moments but overdoes it so he comes across as a jerk too much. Jack Nicholson was disappointing, he is a great actor but he looks tired and seems disengaged. It doesn't help that nothing is done to make his character memorable, performance and script-wise, he feels like he's there for the sake of a plot device. Even with my disappointment with Nicholson, it is very little compared to Reese Witherspoon who never seems comfortable in this movie and the whole performance seems forced. All in all, disappointing. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

Honestly, it was a waste of time and i don't recommend seeing this movie....ever. I'm very confused as to why this movie even made it to the theaters in the first place. There were many scenes in the movie that i didn't perceive the reason why they were even in the movie. Reese Witherspoon is an academy award winning actress and i'm sad to say that i am extremely disappointed with her acting in this movie, however; the role she played was a little unlike her usual bubbly, light-hearted roles. This movie sucked. Hope this helps!"

Where more popular movies have only a few touching moments, this film contained a roller coaster of emotions as exhibited by life itself. It shows how having someone to care about can help you forget about your sorrows. The life lessons taught by this film were resounding. Although the acting wasn't awesome, the characters had very peculiar personalities, and it had a creative flair. It beat the standard Barbie and Ken roles of most romances!"

The roles played by Owen Wilson is also great, he is great at pretending (or so I hope, he does) to be a shallow, no brain stud, he often have this element in his roles and it works great. I had hoped that Jack Nicholson had a larger role then what he had, I simply loved him in As good as it gets, in this he has a smaller role but he is still good, I especially love the last scene with him and the face he makes (that's priceless).\n\nI did like the film, but I could have wanted some more fun and more \"action\" on the way, it takes time in developing and showing us the characters and usually that's not a bad thing, but when you expect comedy all the way, then it takes to long to get acquainted."

Sure, off-screen humping, but no chemistry in any of the pairings. The only relationship even slightly interesting was the father-son relationship. On top of that, the three main characters are beyond a mess, without even the excuse of being very young and inexperienced in relationships. I'm not sure I've ever seen three characters so uncomfortable in their own skin. There IS such a thing as apologizing too much.\n\nThe oddest thing about this film is the delivery of lines. It's clearly deliberate, since all the characters are doing it. By \"it\" I mean they deliver their lines haltingly, as if they're seeing the script for the first time. Or as if the actors can't quite believe what they're being made to say. It reminds me of a stand-up comic who hasn't yet learned the timing of a joke. Or worse, gets the punch line wrong and then tries to fix it. It's embarrassing. Witherspoon and Rudd are so much better than this and were so even 10 years ago when the film came out.\n\nThe clincher is that every moment of the film is predictable. Bleh."

And they worked well together on the screen. Also Owen Wilson (playing Matty) was well cast for that particular role. Most impressively was seeing Jack Nicholson (playing Charles) in this movie, he truly is a diverse actor.\n\nThe story in \"How Do You Know\" is basically right out of the romantic comedy cookbook; two people meet and eventually get to find love, and of course need to get through the obstacles along the way. Pretty textbook material there, so don't expect any major new-thinking in the movie. But still, the story was enjoyable, though at times very slow moving.\n\nThere are other romantic comedies that have more meat on it, so to speak. But for fans of Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd or Owen Wilson, then this movie is a good addition. I didn't mention Jack Nicholson here, because he is better in other types of movies.\n\nI was entertained throughout the movie, despite the long patches of endless dragging on.

If you want to watch something that has a quirky, witty and very unique charm then you can't go wrong with this film."

We really missed out on what's sure to be a gem! How lucky are we?!?\" And then, very slowly, the head scratching begins. \"Wait what? What is happening here? Was that scene supposed to be so cringey? And that one, too? Geez Paul Rudd just has no chemistry with Reese Witherspoon. That's a bummer\" ...but you continue on, because of that GREAT CAST, right? \"Oh OK, I guess Reese is supposed to be with Owen Wilson...nope no, again no chemistry and is Owen's character supposed to be funny? We're used to his charming but flawed routine but he's just repugnant\"... That's how the conversation went for another 15-20 minutes before we gave up. I very rarely bail on a movie 20-25 percent in and I almost never write a review for a movie I didn't (couldn't) finish. But I owe it to the fans of these fine actors and the film watching public in general. Unfortunately I probably won't save very many folks with my review because of that GREAT CAST.

Witherspoon's baseball back story is meaningless, her relationship with Wilson as a completely selfish idiot just doesn't ring true and the legal issue at the heart of the Rudd / Nicholson element just drifts away.

It neglects this little important thing called a script. How Do You Know manages to be dull, boring and unimportant all at once. Bravo team, not only did you make a box office bomb, but a failure of a film as well. Let's all give each other a well deserved pat on the back.\n\nJack Nicholson, looking for a pay check, has a small role as Paul Rudd's father. He tries his best to get Rudd out of some legal problems that he may or may not of had a hand in. Reese Witherspoon is a softball player who gets cut from the team, she cries about it and hooks up with baseball player and all around rich guy, Owen Wilson. They aren't right for each other, but they don't know that yet. You know who's right for her? The down on his luck guy, Paul Rudd.\n\nHow Do You Know manages to go beat for beat what one would expect and never throws any curveballs. It not only tries to be formulaic, but it tries to be boringly formulaic. Witherspoon, as adorable as she is, does nothing for this thankless role and she has no chemistry with her on screen male partners. Either of them. Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd are in sleep mode here. They feel more comfortable doing what they do best. Rudd belongs with Apatow doing R- rated comedy and Wilson belongs with Anderson making a quirky film that some people love and some people hate. Here they seem like fish out of water.\n\nWhat makes the whole thing sting even more is that James L. Brooks is behind the lens. You can skip this so called rom com, because it's missing both of those key ingredients, romance and comedy."

Even though they are, for the most part, encountering the most dramatic moments in their lives, they do not change in any way-shape-form. This might be because they were originally drafted as shapeless and formless. They might as well have no names, just t-shirt pronouncing them: \"Optimistic Guy\", \"Positive Girl\", \"Meglomaniac Manchild\", \"Narcissistic Dad\".\n\nTwo of the characters - Lisa (Witherspoon) and Matty (Wilson) are world-class athletes. This defines them. But we seem them at their games for a total of 4 minutes of screen time. They might as well be Famous Writers or Astronauts (oops, never mind, James L Brooks already used those tags).\n\nThe other thing(s) that made this movie dulllll: our 2 Oscar winners. Yep - Jack and Reese phone this one in. From planet Ambien. Cripes, do they know they are in a movie? What kind of direction did they get? \"Reese - you're sad\", \"Jack, you're mad.\" Wilson and Rudd, a couple of guys with good comic timing, try to bring some energy to their scenes. But Witherspoon doesn't have an improv gene in her entire body, and she thuddily plays of Rudd/Wilson here just like she dry-as-sand played off Vince Vaughn in \"Four Christmases\".\n\nBack to script - you may care how it turns out for nice fella George (Rudd) and be mildly interested in total-stranger Lisa, but you probably won't give a crap how it turns out for the other 2 central characters who are recycled Flap Hortons (Jeff Daniel's character from Brooks' very fine \"Terms of Endearment\").\n\nI won't bother with the worn dialog, the swelling score, and the invasive camera-work."

That Wow moment was brief, unfortunately the movie wasn't. Reese Witherspoon is simply gorgeous and in this she portrays Lisa an out of work baseball player who gets involved within a love triangle between her and the very caring corporate guy George (Paul Rudd) and her on and off professional baseball player boyfriend Matty (Owen Wilson) who seems to only worship himself although never seeming to be wanting to let Lisa go. the bad guy screws up once to many times and the good guy George....It doesn't take a crash course in brain surgery to know the outcome of this flick. this script is not one for surprises or comedy or drama .... Nicholson who portrays George's father in this has worked with director James Brooks a few other times with brilliant results such as As Good As It Gets, Terms Of Endearment all comedies about life but unfortunately this time round they couldn't resurrect the dead!"

        "review_detailed_main": "HOW DO YOU KNOW is a movie with a notorious reputation. After all, is the last movie for both Jack Nicholson and director James L. Brooks, despite in Italy was released in theaters it's never aired on TV, it's considered by box-office numbers and critics a bomb considering the huge budget (earning $48,000,000 against a $120,000,000 budget) and most of the reviews here are scathing. Well, last July I finally saw it and I could see why it has such a reputation. I even regret it to having spent two hours of my life watching it.\n\nLisa Jorgenson (Reese Witherspoon) is a young woman in the local softball team that is living a good life on her own and occasionally dates baseball player Matty Wilson (Owen Wilson). In the meanwhile George Madison (Paul Rudd) is working in his dad Charles's (Nicholson) company dealing with some money flushing. Soon after Lisa loses her position on the team and George is framed by the government without having idea why and on top of that, he is left by his girlfriend and she promises to return to him only after his problems will be resolved. Lisa and George will have some dates and mostly end disastrously and then George makes a deal with his father: if he won't manage to win Lisa's love he'll do jail time for his father but if he'll win Lisa's love Charles has to do jail time for his son. After a discussion, Lisa finally goes with George: Charles smiles but soon the smile fades because jail awaits him.\n\nSo why the movie is terrible? Because it's embarrassing for its stars, full of disconnected moments and just awkward. Probably the stars didn't even tried with the poor material given, they knew they were in a bad movie and just followed the director's instructions. As for Nicholson, he did his best with the poor material and he's the only one who went out unscathed considering the mess.\n\nThe characters don't even look like real people. Since the beginning George is seen like a doofus that has the job only because of his dad, starts to behave whinily when his girlfriend dumps him, it's clueless enough to ruin his first dinner with Lisa and nearly risks to be ran over by a car when he is crossing the street. I mean, can you relate to such a character? Not in the least. In fact, if you run across such a guy on the street you'll likely flee. Matty didn't fared much better because he looked like a slob that loved to talk to Lisa about his many one-night stands and only at half-way in the movie he finally declares his love for Lisa and wanting of settling down with her... it makes you seriously wonder if he was that interested with her in the first place. George's father was probably the only character to which I could remotely relate and when this happens with a supporting character billed as a guest star in the credits, you know you are in trouble. What I liked about Nicholson's character is that he was doing his best for helping his son tho after some time he reveals to having done the dirty work for which George is investigated, and he did some fine metaphores.\n\nOverall, not only one of Jack Nicholson's worst movies but also for the other stars for all the aforementioned reasons. The more it progressed the more I cringed, felt in pain and couldn't wait it was over. My score of 3 is for the nice sets, colorful cinematography and Nicholson's performance because after this bomb he did the best thing to call it quits, it wasn't up to his talents.\n\nJack, thanks for all the great movies you gave us in the past that serve for a reminder of your excellence."

He does nothing wrong with the little he's given, and it's so nice to see him onscreen, but my, what a sorry excuse for a movie. Reese Witherspoon, a pretty lady, spends a lot of her time wearing the ugliest shorts I've ever seen. This is emblematic of the movie - take some good ingredients and make them unappealing.\n\nA story that is barely there, meandering like a confused senior in a department store. Incredibly slack editing - two hours?? Ye Gods, this could have lost 40 minutes and still seemed like a slog. Scenes go on, and on, and on, Rudd and Witherspoon exchanging dialogue that is as sharp and witty as the list of ingredients on a soup packet. Special mention for the obnoxious performance of Owen Wilson - a character that is supposed to be shallow, I get it, but played with smug disdain by an actor who almost seems to have one hand out for his cheque throughout.\n\nSo goodbye Jack, thanks for Chinatown, thanks for Cuckoo's Nest, thanks for all of those great moments. We forgive you the choices you made to bulk out your bank balance so you could afford to make The Crossing Guard and Blood and Wine. We even forgive you for this aberration."

I was really looking forward to a fun romantic comedy based on the trailer but was so let down. You'd think a movie with Jack Nicholson, Owen Wilson, Reese Wetherspoon, and some other well knowns would deliver. Boy, was I wrong. Did these actors make this movie because they needed some extra spending cash. Their own hearts just didn't seem to be in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe it was, as someone pointed out, that the trailers for this movie made it look like it was a hilarious comedy. Maybe I was not in the mood for a romantic comedy that I had to think about. Whatever the reason, the cast alone made me want to enjoy this movie, however, I just could not. The dialog, I thought, was weird. An example of my perception of some of the dialog: He: I need to talk to you. Did you think I thought this? She: No, I thought you were thinking this. He: What? She: What? I've got to go. He: No, I really want to know what you think. She: I don't know. Nevermind. I've got to go, but I do really want to talk to you.\n\nIt just seemed like a lot of babbling all the time. In one of the special features, Brooks says he researched female athletes for a year so that he could make a movie about a female athlete as the main character. Then he admits softball took up about 5 minutes of the movie?!? Of all the characters, I like Owen Wilson's the best. He was kind of a lovable scamp except when he wasn't. Paul Rudd is always great and seemed to make the best of the zany dialog. Reese is just fun to watch but I found myself frustrated that a character that was seemingly as bright as she was supposed to be was constantly speaking drivel. Jack was, well, Jack. I too liked the character of the secretary/assistant and she brought a real down-to-earth feeling to an otherwise other-worldly movie. But even she seemed to be looking on in amazement during some of the scenes as these characters went on about nothing."

The second level of laughs came from the absurdity of the whole movie and that it was clearly planned and executed to be just that. It's a bit on the slapstick side.\n\nThe dialog is so off-normal that it is hard to follow but then I don't think this movie is about a story, just larger-than-life characters.\n\nWe watch an episode of Monk each Friday at our house for our pizza and movie night.

While midlife crisis and divorce themed Endearment, How do You Know reworks it to the point of alzeheimer's disease. It is twice as long as it needs to be with each scene and character exploring two sides of each decision in the story. Will stock broker Nichosen fire son Rudd or won't he? Will Witherspoon marry millionaire Wilson or choose Rudd, who we can see she always likes better from the start? Each small scene the characters ask will I say this or won't I? Will pregnant secretary O'Toole tell Rudd the office secrets or won't she? Will most people want to stick it out until the end of the film? Well, you probably won't. I must add that for such a lengthy romantic comedy, it's strange Witherspoon is not kissed at all except off camera by Owen Wilson."

And not because I found the storyline unusually boring or bad for this type of movie. My problem was with actors and their acting. If it were no A-cast movie, it would be o.k., but I just couldn't believe that I've been watching Reese, Jack and Paul struggle for 2 hours like zombies. Reese, usually very charming and sweet was boring and annoying, not to say more. Jack, usually - we know what's he usually, was sleepwalking (dreaming that he's Al Pacino). Paul was the brightest spot, but waaaaay below his level. Not that I'm a fan of him, but I usually don't have problem with him as I have with Owen Wilson. And I won't comment him... Anyway, they didn't connect for 2 hours and I guess you really need to have talent to do this! As if they all played their roles in front of a mirror, someone taped it and put it together. As if it was their first rehearsal of a play - just sitting and reading the text out loud."

Everything about it draws enormous attention to what you would expect to be happening and not doing it. Trust me, I understand that subversion of expectation is comedy, but there is a rate of diminishing returns on the repetition and duration of the joke, and if you play with that line, then you're writing a comedy for comedy writers because they are the only ones that are going to look at the movie / life as a punchline, and I don't think that is what they were going for.\n\nThere is an underlying theme of patience and adaptability: life will even out even in the roughest of situations, but the movie just sort of stops without even an epilogue, they're just literally and suddenly not there anymore.\n\nI think there is a lot to get out of the movie, if you're strong enough to reach for it: a man who has everything but doesn't give you what you need isn't as good a man who has almost nothing and wants to give you what you need.

I also enjoyed Owen Wilson in his playboy pitcher role, he had some funny lines. It was nice to see Jack Nicholson again too -where the hell has he been lately?\n\nAs the movie progressed though it just seemed to stall out, with Reece sporting a perpetually confused expression as she evaluates her life, moving in with 'Matty' moving out again, then entering into a love triangle of sorts with 'George' a cooperate guy in turmoil who she has zero chemistry with, plus he's acting like a lunatic.\n\nThere were also many scenes involving catching the bus, why was everyone on the bus?

Brooks's Terms of Endearment or Broadcast News or As Good As It Gets, you don't think of anything but the movie... but when a movie completely misses, you have way too much time to think about how/why it got there...\n\nAnd Brooks's infamous misfire How Do You Know is way too long... two hours is the length of a cold war thriller while a comedy needs to be 90 minutes, especially a rom-com, and unlike Brooks's other movies with Jack Nicholson... that are quite long but for good reason... this is not a dramedy... although it's bathed in pretentious melodrama, and takes itself way too seriously...\n\nAs the neurotic characters explain so much, at one point they're explaining explaining, and that includes championship softball player (ever heard of that?) Reese Witherspoon, being her usual adorably cuddly blonde but without a story, as tiresome as Paul Rudd's nervous stammering confused nice guy or Owen Wilson doing his usual, Owen Wilson impression...\n\nHere Owen's a shallow professional baseball player sleeping with good girl Reese while Rudd, an honest (or oblivious) businessman being set up by Nicholson as his crooked businessman father, becomes smitten with the same cute yet burdened girl that Brooks really wants you to care about, like Helen Hunt or Debra Winger or Holly Hunter... but there's simply no story here, just a lot of taking in circles, and circles and circles."

A very colorful poopoo, because whoever edited this movie decided to turn up the saturation 50%. It's almost so bad that it IS funny. The writing and direction is so backwards that I was actually having a good chuckle. Fortunately there are some actors who are so fun to watch they can supersede the massive poop movie they are in. They are like a piece of corn in the poop. Even in the midst of poop they are still pretty sweet, Owen Wilson and (kind of) Paul Rudd are the corn in the poop. Own Wilson makes me laugh.

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: How Do You Know",
        "review_detailed_main": "Written and directed by James L. Brooks, How Do You Know is a romantic comedy that decided to go on a roundabout manner in presenting its many messages about love and life rather than cutting to the chase, having many indecisive characters figuring just what to do at important milestones, and basically having them stuck there to bloat this close to two hours. It's a little frustrating to watch plenty of whining going all round, and I felt that much can be salvaged if the pace was kept snappy and succinct.\n\nTwo narrative threads run through the film, revolving around a growing romantic triangle between the characters of Lisa (Reese Whiterspoon), a baseball player on the national team who discovers that her life thus far has been unceremoniously cut down after it's decided by the head coach that it's time for her to make way for new blood, George (Paul Rudd) the CEO of his father's company who has been charged by the Federal Court for a Sarbanes-Oxley type of fraud that can see him potentially facing jail time, though of no fault of his own other than to assume things are coasting along, and Matty (Owen Wilson) the successful sportsman whom Lisa is dating in an on-off-on manner.\n\nWhile it may seem like a character study of all three, everyone shares a basic characteristic of being excessively whiny, and at times needy, wanting things to go their way, and requiring listening ears to hear them out. I understand that most are at major crossroads - one not knowing what to do coming out of a sports career her whole life to date, the other facing felony charges through no fault of his own, with the suspicion that his dad (Jack Nicholson) may be responsible for the whole shebang and he's the scapegoat being set up for the fall, coupled with being ostracized by the people he knows, and Wilson's Matty deciding to no longer become the playboy Casanova and go monogamous for Lisa - but observing them go through their mood swings sometimes don't always make for a good comedy.\n\nAnd too much of something makes this extremely tired to sit through, and it's a painful endurance to the final act where things get pieced together and a semblance of a certain direction Brooks wants to take with this. DOn't get me wrong, I enjoyed each and every nugget of experience and advice that Brooks wanted to dispense through the characters, especially that between Lisa and George where they ultimately learn and share through their conversations, even though Lisa tries hard to keep things platonic, and we the audience know that George secretly desires more. Moments I thought had plenty of substance belonged to the tale about Playdoh - presents becoming meaningful when they come with a morale lifting story - and that involving shutting up to think rather than to engage in verbal barrage that will probably serve more bad than good.\n\nOwen Wilson may be sleepwalking in this role here since he doesn't offer much as the alpha male jock who's none too bright though possessing enough to surprise sporadically, while Reese Whiterspoon probably needed a meatier role than this one, having to play a character gone neurotic when realizing she's out of her own comfort zone like fish out of water. Paul Rudd though continues to grow from strength to strength, showing he has what it takes to shine in serious dramatic moments, laced with that likability of being an everyday Joe that you'll probably root for. However, all three stars get outshone by the presence of Jack Nicholson each time he comes onto the scene, and frankly his last few scenes opposite Paul Rudd was some of the best this film had to offer.\n\nStill, the performance of the cast failed to steer this film out of its self-indulgence, deciding to run on the spot rather than to move the story along. It's one thing dispensing good advice, but it's another if one likes to listen to one's own voice. I would like to love this film as I did James L. Brooks' Spanglish, but alas it went on aimlessly for far too long and wasn't able to salvage the damage done."

        "review_title": "\"I care about you so much I'm going to TRY cutting out the anonymous sex....\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"How Do You Know\" is a very unromantic romance...and this is probably THE reason why it failed so miserably at the box office. While it may or may not have contributed, director James L. Brooks and Jack Nicholson simply stopped making films after this bomb. And, in terms of bombs...this was a big one...earning back about $48,000,000 with a budget of $120,000,000!\n\nWhen the story begins, Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) is on the US women's softball team, dating a pro baseball player (Owen Wilson), and living a good life. As for George (Paul Rudd), he is making a ton of money, has a pretty long-term girlfriend, and is working for his father (Jack Nicholson). However, over a very short time, Lisa loses her position on the team, George is under indictment by the government and has no idea why, and his 'loving girlfriend' leaves him and promises to return AFTER his problems have resolved themselves...in other words, she dumped him. Can these two hurt people, George and Lisa, find each other and make something out of it?\n\nSo why do I think the movie tanked? Well because although it was a romance, there was a lot of content which was about as romantic as a case of the clap! During most of the film, Lisa was living with and/or dating the ballplayer...a man simply incapable of loving anyone. He appeared to be a sex addict and talked about his many, many, many one-night stands. Then, inexplicably, he says he's interested in settling down with Lisa...and utters the most unromantic line I can recall...and it's in the summary above. Wow...it really makes you wonder about Hollywood and its views on fidelity and relationships...perhaps to these folks that IS being romantic. He just seemed like a pig and she seemed pathetic for staying with him.\n\nAnother problem with the film is that a ton of money was spent on the film...too much. Had it been a movie that was special effects intensive, like a Star Wars movie, you could say \"well, I see why the movie cost so much to make\"...but here you wonder HOW $120,000,000 was spent on the film and why it took five years to complete! I think this insane spending is evident in the script, as so many story elements seem ill-placed...such as the story about George's father (Jack Nicholson) and the ball playing boyfriend. Without this, just Rudd and Witherspoon forming a relationship, it would have worked...as BOTH were very likable and did great work here. But the irrelevant supporting stories often just got in the way. What also got in the way was the very explicit song that Rudd kept singing as well as it playing at the end...a song by Barry White that really ISN'T about romance at all...just screwing!\n\nOverall, a film worth seeing but also a film with many flaws. Not a terrible film but with this cast and crew, it should have been so much better."

Then again they all need money. Watching Reese W. you might wonder why she is considered a good actress. But she is. Just not in this one. The tone is completely wrong, there is almost no comedy, the romantic \"value\" (if you can call it that) is even dismissed by women who watch it and the kitsch factor reaches \"I want to puke\" levels (with both genders).\n\nWith so much talent at hand, you never would have guessed they could've gone completely wrong.

I normally like her performances, but this one was dismal, largely based on her soulless, anaemic, irritating character. Jack Nicholson is secreted in the recesses of the movie, like a slightly infected crevice, festering in the background, his occasional appearances uninspired. Owen Wilson is his typical type-cast self, if less redeemable than usual. Overall, the script will make you want to rip your own ears off rather than suffer through any more of its agonising awkward pauses, acted in strange gestures and facial expressions. The music is what one would expect from a rom-com-esque piece, nothing special. The camera-work was passable by Hollywood standards for almost the entirety, except for a few unnecessary shaky close ups. The story-line was pointless."

Witherspoon is real who used to seemingly light up the room with her mere presence, but is woefully miscast as a female jock. Rudd tries to inject some humor but plays his nice guy act and the material overall isn't funny.\n\nWitherspoon and Rudd deserve to be together in a better movie. Wilson just wants to have fun and could play this role in his sleep. Nicholson acts like he is making a guest appearance on a talk show.\n\nOverall, the dialogue of the film and overall essence somewhat reminds of a soap opera television show or something of a plot wise you would find on Friends.

        "review_detailed_main": "About 10 minutes into the film, I instantly found the wall next to my TV more interesting. With such an all-star cast, and being a fan of Witherspoon and Nicholson, I was really wondering what they could come up with. Basically, a newly- fired softball player tries to figure out her life, which is made more complicated when two guys show interest in her. Although Nicholson is as well in character as always, and Witherspoon still plays complicated Lisa with a certain believability, the movie is too much at times. It's not complicated at all. It just feels like the scriptwriters tried to fit in too many plots all at one time, which tends to make the movie really overwhelming. Not to mention the fact that Wilson becomes sometimes overly annoying. I guess every actor has a bad movie, and, for these 4 stars, let's hope it doesn't get any worse then this."

However, there's plenty of well constructed lines relating to love that will make you think and give you perspective. Owen Wilson is consistently hilarious throughout the film and I haven't enjoyed seeing him on the screen this much since Bottle Rocket. There's a perfect balance of comedy and passion, and this movie works great for both sexes. It's certainly not your typical rom-com, but that's what makes it so brilliant."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a gradually paced dramedy with a woman named Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) at a turning point in her early 30s when she got involved in what she's accustomed to being told is the ideal relationship: good looking partner, who's successful, has the same profession and who could forget is great in the sack. Yet something doesn't feel right, so she still has one foot in one foot out to keep her options open when another man unlike who she's ever been with calls her from an acquaintance for a chance date.\n\nLisa might get cut from the softball team, which turns her normally confident personality into a sentimental yuppie. The newly met guy is a former businessman named George (Paul Rudd) who's unemployed, soon out of money, girlfriend broke up with him and is being investigated with possible prison time in the future. He's normally a stand up guy that got the short end of the stick and is currently looking for a special gal to listen to him and get to know her as well. Currently everything is fun and new with her current boyfriend who has it all but Lisa is looking for someone who treats her as an individual, as her tentative partner--Matty (Owen Wilson) the playboy pro ball player--is giving a serious relationship a try but he has to break his own self-centered and narcissistic habits that are embedded into his suave and charming ways on the surface.\n\n\"How Do You Know\" is an overly simplistic and minimalistic movie which is essentially summed up as people interact and \"things\" happen with a camera to film nearly every minute of it. The TV show \"Seinfeld\" brought about the premise of \"doing nothing\" and somehow made it work, though here there's not a bundle of significant events or rewards occurring during the process till the end, which felt like three hours to get there and obvious from the get-go. This is basically a series of free-floating events that happen in a short amount of time and are filmed tediously to give realistic room for growth, though it comes across like it lacks a central direction as it's to the point of being so loose that it's aimless at times. A thinking person's movie? Hardly, as it's stretched thin enough.\n\nJack Nicholson plays George's (Paul Rudd) manipulative dad with his usual sarcastic self who says exactly what's on his mind. Kathryn Hahn does a charismatic role as Annie: the caring secretary who's full blown pregnant and an emotional volcano ready to erupt. There are funny jokes to lighten the load but some seem out of context as there isn't a grounded focus to place them in. It becomes one giant exercise in indecision between the characters to the point where you want to yell out \"just do something already!\" This isn't going to be rewarding like \"Terms of Endearment,\" \"As Good as It Gets\" or even \"Spanglish\" from James L. Brooks, as those had actual things happening over of a period of reasonable time, with memorable characters doing them and also space to ponder upon in between. \"How Do You Know\" already by the halfway mark makes you want to check your watch and go back to your own life already."

You can feel the James L. Brooks telegraphing everything. He used to pull this stuff off effortlessly early in his career with films like Broadcast News and Terms of Endearment, both of which do flirt with melodrama at times, but lately his work feels tired. He's going for a home run with every speech, sad look, close up of an important prop; it really gets on your nerves. He had all the ingredients here, he just laid them on too thick. Nothing is believable, especially the constantly befuddling on again off again relationship between Reese Witherspoon and Owen Wilson. He's such a cad, I don't know why she'd spend more than 10 minutes with him. And, Paul Rudd's character is such a weak puppy dog, I think she'd feel more pity than charmed. A total mess."

From a director with a mixed CV, you can almost see into the thinking for elements being the way they are (looking at past films) but the Rom-com element here is lacking both romance and comedy.\n\nWitherspoon is annoying, Rudd is a Rom-com whore, Owen Wilson is his usual effortless self, and Nickelson just looks ill. Surely a better script and direction could have made something more bearable than this. The other fact that the lead lady is a retiring baseball player, dating another player, will also be lost on non Americans."

But this time he was just awkward and self depricating but not in the adorable way that he is known for. Owen Wilson was shallow and pretty despicable in his own right. Nicholson is a moral cess pool and but he plays that character as well as anybody. In the end don't waste your time!"

This movie may have worked better if Owen Wilson had played Paul Rudd's character. This movie needed a Steve Martin or a Chevy Chase or maybe a Cary Grant. Dan Ackroyd may have helped. There are so many things wrong with this movie. This could be Reese Witherspoon's worst movie. Maybe it's the insipid script, the uninspiring story, the miscasting, the overall banality of the production. Whatever it was, it all contributed to producing a movie that is flat, dull, pretentious and mediocre. To the movie's credit, the ending is okay but that's not saying much when compared to its utterly innocuous start. The strongest performance is that of Owen Wilson's and even here the performance is uneven as the the character waivers between fits of immaturity and attempts to act like a responsible grown up. That it is Mr. Wilson who is called upon to provide some actual drama exemplifies the triteness of the story and the uninspired quality of the performances. The movie is purportedly a comedy but it generates no laughs. No amount of pouting by Ms. Witherspoon could rescue this movie. Although lovely and charming as usual, she cannot overcome a weak script. The scenes with Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson are devoid of anything that even remotely approaches comedy, or drama for that matter. Interestingly, Jim Bouton has a small role in this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "\u00a8We are all just one small adjustment away from making our lives work.\u00a8 How do you know when you're in love is one of the questions one of the characters asks in this film. Director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good As it Gets) tries to answer that question in this romantic comedy (although I would actually label it as a dramedy) by creating a love triangle, but he fails at really trying to come up with an honest answer. The answer Matty receives to his question is \u00a8I know that I'm in love when I put on condoms when I'm with other girls.\u00a8 A very superficial answer, which actually fits with this superficial movie. Brooks has directed really good films in the past, but he really missed his mark this time around. There were a few funny moments, some memorable quotes here and there, but the script (written by Brooks himself) was just too weak and the pace too slow. The first hour was torturous for me, I absolutely hated every character and every situation, but the second half of the film built up to a somewhat satisfying ending and tolerable characters. I was really disappointed with this movie because I know James L. Brooks is a very talented director and he always tries to make original movies, and I also liked the cast in this film, but the script was just too weak and the performances felt really awkward and out of place at times. I like the cast, just not how they worked together in this movie. The only positive thing I can say is that at least Brooks tries to make a different kind of romantic comedy with less clich\u00e9s than most other romcoms.\n\nThe story actually centers around Lisa (Reese Witherspoon), a star softball player who has recently been cut from the National team because she will turn 31 by the time the next Olympics take place. Her life revolved entirely around the sport and now she's at the point of her life where she doesn't know what step to take next. She has always dated athletes and is currently seeing Matty (Owen Wilson), a professional baseball player both on and off the field. Matty is a star who is used to dating a lot of girls but really doesn't know anything about relationships. He is clueless and really doesn't know how to help Lisa, but he does like her a lot and realizes she is different from what he has felt for other girls. Lisa, although hesitant at first, finds comfort in George (Paul Rudd) who loves listening to her and trying to ease her. At first she thinks he's a weirdo, but later their friendship blossoms. George is going through difficult problems himself, but he puts them aside to try to help Lisa, with whom he's fallen in love. George is a businessman who has just been indicted from his father's company. Charles (Jack Nicholson) actually has set up his son to become the target of a federal investigation by falsifying some corporate financial documents. If George takes the blame he will only have to pay a sentence of 2 to 3 years of jail, while Charles would have to face 25 years if his son doesn't \u00a8help him out\u00a8. Charles is that kind of father who would let his son take the blame, while George is that kind of son who is too nice and honest and way too ethical to belong in the business world.\n\nMy major problem with this movie is that the performances felt too forced at times. I didn't like Reese Witherspoon in this movie, she was selfish and mean, and really didn't deserve someone like George who is just way too much of a nice guy. There wasn't much chemistry between neither of the relationships (Matty-Lisa or Lisa-George). The second half of the film picks up a little and Lisa seems to become nicer, but she really doesn't seem interested in George's problems which are really much larger than hers. All she has to deal with is retirement from softball, but that is really all she cared for anyways. George doesn't seem to mind however, all he likes to do is stare at her. The funniest character in this movie is George's secretary, Annie (played by Kathryn Hahn) and she steals each scene she's in. That is a major problem when you have such talented and funny comedians as Jack Nicholson, Paul Rudd, and Owen Wilson. The scene where Annie is giving birth to her child and her boyfriend is proposing to her is one of the best in the movie and the chemistry those two characters have in those three minutes is much stronger than any other one in the film. This distant romance could have used a lot more comedy coming from Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd who should have been given more opportunities to improvise and loosen up.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Mr Rudd made me laugh once or twice because that's what he does best in any role he is in. The return from the box office is a definite ouch in my opinion!

It isn't slap stick funny like Horrible Bosses. But it is funny. It was a great movie. Very solid. I give it 7 points because it didn't say whatever happened to the dad. All of the performances were believable and excellent. If you are looking for a movie that is different then all the other chic flicks, don't see this movie. But if you are sucker for chic flicks like I am, this movie was great. I loved it. There was just enough depth to make it believable. The character development wasn't the greatest, but there was just enough to satisfy. Overall it was a good movie."

Attempts at humor that fell flat. There are a couple of places that tug at the heart strings, but other places that one just sort of wades through it.\n\nAll three have been involved in far better and much funnier projects. Jack Nicholson's part wasn't so much a character as it was Nicholson being Nicholson. The current 5.6 rating from 276 viewers pretty much says it all. This film by no means deserves either 1 star or 10 star ratings. It's just mediocre fare, take it or leave it."

        "review_detailed_main": "As someone who loves these types of meet-cute love stories, this was just bad. And the bail out of a comedy is just...not really funny. In fact, it's awfully dark in nature. This is strange, considering James L. Brooks is a genius when it comes to regulating \"The Simpsons\" but now...after this abomination, I tend to believe, he's lost complete touch with people (something that made \"Terms...\" so great).\n\nIt could be that it was original material written by him. Maybe he can criticize what makes a great story, but can't hear it from others. First, the characters are bad. Bad in that they are just terrible human beings. Not unlikeable, just dumb plastic idiots, who say things to service the script. Paul Rudd is dumb. He's swinging in every direction and missing every pitch. I'm sure he realizes that his style of comedy doesn't fit every story. It was bad.\n\nOwen Wilson, same as Paul Rudd, it seemed they both didn't understand the type of movie they were in. Grossly mis-casted. He's too dumb looking, and cardboard to be this type of funny. I think with Wes Anderson flicks, it makes sense. Odd-ball and endearing. In this movie, it looks like he stumbled onto a grown-ups table and can't figure his way out.\n\nReese...not sure her facial mannerisms. She has fallen so far from what I remember her searing performance in \"Freeway.\" Yes, she's older now. But her character throws hissy fits like a child, surrounds herself with positive mantras, and is...just really aggravating. Why would any of the two guys want to be around this is beyond me.\n\nIt seems Brooks direction is stilted and hackey. A fall from a stairwell during a phone call is really hackey. Chaplin couldn't even make that bit work.\n\nI am listening to the commentary now...to get some explanation to this pile of thoughts. And it occurred to me that this must be how Brooks sees the modern rom-com society now. A low attention-span idiots movie, done for a money grab. He's not completely wrong (if you've watched recent ones). We only have ourselves to blame."

In fact it was a struggle to find the drama too, but I suppose I might concede that the romance was cute.\n\nI did think that it could have been less obvious how the love triangle would go though. The formula was blatant and there really was no competition between George (Paul Rudd) and Matty (Owen Wilson).\n\nPersonally, although it was a sweet romance, which did have something to it, because it was set alongside George's potential indictment, I thought that it could have been awesome if the acting had all been played completely straight and more realistically.\n\nIt could have gone the other way and been more silly and farcical instead, but more seriously would have been my choice to deliver this particular concept with this script.\n\nAlso, I know that it might have been a bit cliched, but I thought that Jack Nicholson, playing Mr. Madison, could have been a bit more tyrannical as George's father. The actors presence suggested that he would deliver something with an edge, but his character just seemed to fizzle out pathetically.\n\nI think that I just felt a bit let down by this film because it wasn't what I had expected. To make a comparison about similarity, 'The Object Of My Affection' (1998) had better delivery than this and I've seen so many films with these stars that are winners, that it was disappointing to see them signed on to something so weak in this production.\n\n395.39/1000."

That's it. I'm not kidding...\n\nPaul Rudd attempts to be a quirky romancer and hits the mark just a handful of times in this lengthy bore of a film.\n\nDon't waste your time. Nothing happens in this movie. There's absolutely zero character development or backstory. You're thrown into a world of 5 or 6 completely vapid characters who exist in 3 or 4 entirely separate stories.

Nicholson showing is talent of giving great one liners and Rudd setting it up to perfection.\n\nThis could have been a very good movie if it would have the relationship between Rudd and Nicholson'c character and the relationship between Rudd and his secretary, Annie, played by Katherine Hahn.\n\nUsing the relationship of Wilson and Witherspoon as the main plot is the fatal flaw."

That have to dissect everything about a movie and just can't enjoy one.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE i had a physics teacher who hated Jurassic Park because of one technicality in the movie. When the kid is on the huge electric fence that is about to regain power and they tell him to jump and he is to late and gets zapped. Well since he wasn't touching the ground he wouldn't have been electrocuted and he would have been find. Just because of that one thing he absolutely hates it!

        "review_detailed_main": "I read the reviews by several \"well known critics,\" and I sometimes wondered if I had watched the same movie they were writing about. Ok, so they weren't 180 degrees wrong; the Jack Nicholson character did come across as pretty creepy. Perhaps Nicholson is a rare actor who can even get a wry smile from you when the character he's playing in so unlikeable. He does show some \"fatherly emotion\" on his balcony at the end, and Nicholson does it completely with facial expressions. Critics complained about the pace, but I never noticed a problem there. Of course, I've always adored Reese Witherspoon, so my objectivity might be suspect. Her character is interesting, I thought. What do you do after winning an Olympic gold medal, and you're suddenly \"too old\" to continue (at least in the mind of the coach)? It's not like fighting cancer, I agree, but it's not exactly an enviable position either. Call it an \"early life crisis.\" Others here have commented on the movie possibly being advertised as a romantic comedy, leaving room for audience disappointment when what they got was different. Ok. I suppose that might be true. I didn't have any particular expectation, so I had no cause for feeling misled. The big surprise for me was the performance of Owen Wilson, an actor I had never really enjoyed or appreciated previously. His character is sooo insensitive, soooo self-centered, sooo thoroughly lacking in self-awareness. Yet, somehow, Wilson makes him a man we accept, even as we disapprove. I think that Wilson deserves more credit than he likely received for this part. There were several memorable scenes in the movie as well, especially when the Kathryn Hahn is in the hospital after delivering her baby. The scene where Wilson's character tries to \"lift\" Witherspoon's character out of a depressed mood by telling her an outrageous story about a man and a cat is also very funny. I should say something about Paul Rudd as well. His character is very much in keeping with other roles he's played, so he doesn't really get a chance to show us much, but I did see one thing I hadn't noticed about him before. He showed a knack for physical comedy, a skill often seen in actors from the golden years of Hollywood but not practiced so much anymore. In any case, I think you will like this movie quite a bit, unless you're expecting to be laughing for an hour and a half."

The protagonists are both subjected to sudden hardships; the softball player Lisa has just been cut from the team and fired CEO George is facing indictment. Both are trying to redefine their lives and climb out of the hole they have just found themselves in.\n\nThis film is not the kind that constantly has you on the edge of your seat, but it does connect with you both seamlessly and without effort due to Brooks' solid script and the on the mark acting.\n\nKudos to Jack Nicholson as George's moral midget (sic) father and Owen Wilson as the playboy who wants a relationship without necessarily sacrificing anything.\n\nSo if you want a film that rings true and has you smiling an inward smile of recognition throughout I think you will really enjoy this.\n\n8 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "How many movies today actually promote respect?\n\nJames L. Brooks has directed another movie along the lines of As Good as It Gets and Spanglish, which leaves you with that \"good feeling,\" but also a touch of introspection.\n\nThis film is clearly what is commonly known as a rom-com. And despite the fact that I am not easily won over by a genre which is often the least feminist or progressive type of film there is, I was charmed.\n\nI was charmed by the fact that Reese Witherspoon wasn't melodramatic, and I am not typically a fan of this individual...in this case, she was perfect. I was charmed by the overall subtleties of friendship and the cross over of aging with maturity and knowing what you want.\n\nBut the biggest concept in this film that I liked was the idea that a man could find purpose not in trying to seduce a woman, but in respecting her. That he could find joy in treating her the way she genuinely deserved to be treated. Paul Rudd was phenomenal and believable in his role. Those expressions. Beautiful.\n\nAnd the sincerity of Owen Wilson's character as he finally made steps towards caring about someone--finding out that he could do that in a positive, non-sweatshirt giving out sort of way (see the movie to understand). Wonderful. We've all dated this guy. It was great.\n\nI also cannot leave out the stunning performance of the (in my opinion) often underrated Kathryn Hahn, who in many ways steals the show in every movie I've seen her in. She's not afraid to be human, and for that, she may never be the glossy celebrity we are so used to, but she's special. As Annie, she really gave the movie that vulnerability it needed.\n\nThere were so many moments in this movie that just really lit me up and gave me a deeper understanding of what it is to care about someone else, but not in a way which merely benefits oneself--in a way that is necessary and respectful.\n\nWhile there were a few flaws, such as the somewhat loosely tied conclusions in regards to Jack Nicholson's role (seriously?!) or our curiosity in regards to what the main character's employment is other than going on dates and moving in and out of Owen Wilson's apartment, overall, this movie had a streak of feminism and genuine sincerity that I absolutely loved enough to write my first movie review. Well done."

As far as what this movie really is as far as IMBD goes it is a 7. I loved it. It's a great Romantic comedy and I highly recommended it. Great lessons as well."

I also relate to feeling devastated when something happens suddenly that rocks your world and throws you off balance. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as narcissistic, manipulative father. The movie reminded me a little bit of Breakfast at Tiffany's,... Flighty girl flirts then runs away, is chased, runs away again... and the little black dress she wears at the end. Script excellent and many memorable lines. Not the usual crude, low-brow humor like most movies lately. Felt like a classic like Casablanca. Too bad so many people didn't appreciate it."

        "review_detailed_main": "8.5/10.\n\nI watched this based off a review here by sunam007 which got me intrigued.\n\nThis movie gave me a similar feeling of being on acid. Do you ever feel like you're watching the perfect movie to tie into your own life at the perfect time? This was one of those movies/moments for me. It was like being a kid at Sunday morning church & it could have been like you & the preacher were at the service alone and he was talking directly to you.\n\nLife is all about decision makings & seeing how those decisions lead you to where you are today. \"How Do You Know\" captures that as well as I've seen recently in a movie. The characters just seemed to roll with life so well, following a feeling, that ended up leading them to a splendid ending. It was a lesson in intuition, taking chances, going after the girl, wearing your heart on your sleeve, & not being timid.\n\nThis was a perfect movie for a guy like me. I'm relatively young, single, thinking about a woman I'd like to be with, & in a transition in my life. This movie talked to me in a way I can't explain all that well. It was late at night, I had a small edible, put my phone down, & gave it all my attention. It was a special moment & I hope that someone can relate to what I'm trying to say here. Give it a shot. It's better than the reviews. You may just learn something & it may just take something from the screen & connect it into something going on in your life. It sure did to me."

Don't get me wrong I am all for it, but this movie took it to the next level. It made me think, it made me feel.\n\nI hate to see all the low reviews! It definitely deserves better.

It was weirdly deep and witty even through the quirky comedy used through out the film. There seemed to be quite a few scenes that everyone can relate to and laugh about. I can't say that it was predictable which is a nice change from many other romantic comedies. I'm sure many writers will appreciate the witty humor used in the film. I thought James Brooks did a really good job!! It is sad to see these types of films get overall bad reviews but I can somewhat understand why. It's not your common \"feel good all the way through\" type romantic comedy. I can see how this movie might not be for everyone just because the protagonist and antagonist are not so clearly defined until the middle/end but I thought it made it more interesting and kept me watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "Romantic comedies are okay and this one \"How Do You Know\" entertains with it's all star cast and it proves love and relationships are complex, yet still in the end it leaves us asking for answers. Still it was good seeing America's sweetheart the beautiful Resse Witherspoon at work and it was nice to see my favorite actor the man legendary Jack Nicholson back again even though the role was small.\n\nWitherspoon is Lisa a young beautiful girl who's passion is playing softball and even though she fails to make the USA team she still has plenty to live for. As Lisa is making love with a rich stud major league baseball player Mat(Owen Wilson)and she moves in with him still at times she feels that role is a little to demanding.\n\nTo add to the problem is George(Paul Rudd) a guy who has befriended Lisa yet he has a slew of his own problems as he's under federal investigation for money fraud and shady dealings, yet it was all done by his cocky and arrogant father Charles(well done and suited by legendary Jack Nicholson).\n\nThru it all love spats and phone tag is played with tears, and uncertain chats in this romantic comedy. It's something that is entertaining as it proves love and life is complex as we never know our love status day to day? Anyway it was good seeing America's sweetheart beauty Reese Witherspoon and it was nice again seeing the man legendary Jack still this picture though enjoyable from James L. Brooks left to many questions to be answered it left me wondering what if as it never really answered it's title \"How Do You Know\"."

I've been to that tiny corner of the universe shown by this movie and would return there in a flash. I really like this movie. 10 stars and 5 quick reasons none of which really encapsulate my love for the movie.. 1. I can watch it over and over without losing attention... Cause or effect?...?\n\n2. Rudd and Witherspoon do a great job of acting.. 3. Plot is out of the ordinary 4. Love the banter, I need to see that at least 10 more times 5. It shows a disturbing part of human behavior that many will cringe at, i.e. How decisions are really made... in short, \"How do You Know?\" :) I think you will find that people not at ease with their own lives, will find this movie down right mean and irritating. Sorry about that. Show it to me some more :) I positively love it :)\n\nA little addition... The writer made the dialog for the actors pretty much the same, a typical problem with fast writing projects, bit scatological, and with much the same speech patterns, noun-verb order, paragraph continuity, etc. I noticed that some were bothered by this in the reviews but seemed unable to specify the problem. I kind of liked it, it gave the movie some continuity in a world normally without. This sort of thing also happens in communities, speech and thought patterns learned over a lifetime."

        "review_detailed_main": "Terrific great quirky romantic dialogues between Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson are the core of this funny and feel good romantic comedy. The story in short is about Reese Witherspoon being in constant doubt if she has met the right guy. How does she know if the seemingly perfect and succesful Owen Wilson is the right guy for her to be engaged to? That's the cliffhanger with the dorky looser Paul Rudd being the OTHER guy that is vying for her love. Not a difficult choice to make, one might think...?\n\nWhat makes this movie extra special is the terrific supporting role of Jack Nicholson. Jack is still THE man. Only featuring some 15 minutes of screen time, but when he is on, Jack is ON.\n\nDirector James L. Brooks has made some other classic feel good romantic movies: \"Terms of endearment\" and \"As good as it gets\". Anyone familiar with these 2 romantic classics knows this director has got the romantic touch, that will melt everybodies heart. Highly recommended for those who just long to see a quirky feel good romantic comedy. Enjoy!"

Jack Nicholson does an amazing turn as well. Even minor characters like Reese's baseball coach does a great job. I loved her remark about \"smiling at bastards\". Lenny Venito in the hospital scene outshines many great actors. Absolutely brilliant, and so spontaneous. That entire scene is so meaningfully and empathetically shot it is nothing short of a masterstroke. The dialog in that scene had me by the pulse from second-to-second.\n\nAnd Owen Wilson plays his character beautifully as a successful yet self-centered baseball player. His epiphany when Reese is walking away from him to the elevator is beaut of scene and echoes the reality of break-ups from the male perspective meaningfully.\n\nI loved Paul Rudd's vignette scene about playdoh, it still resonates so freshly in my mind even though I saw the movie some years ago. Of course I have by now seen the film at least thrice.\n\nPaul Rudd's and Reese's interactions at his cluttered apartment are a sheer pleasure to watch. I loved the line \"it's the opposite of a bus strike\".\n\nHow Do You Know is an amazing comedy if you know your comedies. Perhaps it's complexity may put some people off but I found it a sheer joy to watch from start to finish. Highly recommended."

It really is just a story, a story that just about anyone can find themselves relating to. That being said, I don't think I've seen a character written quite like Reese's portrayal of Lisa. A character who isn't obsessed on one certain goal in her life (ie finding the \"one\", getting a certain guy's attention, etc). Instead she just goes through life, working through her problems and dealing with them in an honest way. Even when she bumps in to George (paul rudd) she doesn't upheave everything about herself, instead she continues about her life's mess and works with what is given to her. I personally found her thought process, decision making, perspective, and overall character to be refreshingly relatable. Of course, I can't resist the charm and loveliness of Paul Rudd, and playing George Madison is just another role he excels at playing for this movie.\n\nThe rest of the movie I'll save for those who watch it, but just know if you're looking for a feel good movie with some laughs, romantic charm, and a good following of characters while feeling like a fly on the wall to their situation, How Do You Know is a great movie for just that. The writing could be a little sharper, sure. But if you're irritated by the forced emotion in writings of today's movies like I am, this movie will not bother you. Don't let the overall low IMDB rating number fool you."
