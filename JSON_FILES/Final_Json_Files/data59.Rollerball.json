        "review_detailed_main": "Rollerball is a bad movie that pretty much fails on every level. It's the year 2005 and the new sport of Rollerball is very popular. Marcus Ridley {LL Cool J} recruits his friend Jonathan Cross {Chris Klein} into the very dangerous sport which may not be that luxury as it seems. One of the games promoters will do anything to get higher ratings even if that means death. I have seen the original and after watching this I wonder why they took a very good film and just ruined it. Rollerball is a poorly written movie that lacks suspense and good action. The film is just really ridiculous at times that its hard to take serious. The dialog is really lame and the characters aren't very developed . The acting is terrible with the worst probably being Chris Klein who doesn't have enough charisma to be a lead. LL Cool J was alright but he just doesn't seem to be trying. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Jean Reno both do a decent job but like LL Cool J, they just don't seem to really be trying. I can't blame them though as the writing is horrible and they are not given a lot of material to work with. The film is a lot more violent then the original, however, the action is still not very impressive. It also doesn't help matters that the studio got scared and went for the PG-13 rating and so the editing looks very bad. The film is about 95 minutes long but it drags on forever since its just a really boring film. The film is also confusing as some of the events that occur in the film don't really make a lot of sense. At some point during the film you will most likely stop caring. If you have seen the original then you will hate this movie. If you haven't seen it then you might like this but that's not very likely. Its just better to see the original. Rollerball is a loud and terrible film that's worth skipping and its also one of the worst films of 2002. Rating 2/10 avoid this film at all costs."

        "review_detailed_main": "The \"Rollerball\" movie from 1975 was brilliant because although the film was violent, it was much deeper had a lot to say about humanity--our love of violence and how easily we can be led and controlled with sports. The film was brilliant on so many levels. So, some brilliant persons thought it was a great idea to update the film...make a new version which removed all the wonderful social commentary and left us with violence and not much more. Is it any wonder that the film is currently rated #39 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? After all, folks who loved the original were sure to be angry when offered a slick but neutered version of the classic.\n\nEarly into the film, I could see why many viewers disliked this remake. The game was totally changed. Instead of the relatively simple roller derby-style game, this one includes ramps, tunnels and explosions. But the part that got me was how confusing the new game was...and the announcer even said that the game was too complicated to explain!! Didn't this make the filmmakers the least bit concerned?! In addition, the film featured all sorts of eccentric players--with court jester hats, dragon masks and more. Now remember...the original film was AGAINST folks in the game standing out and being unique! To top it off, Jean Reno's character then is heard that he's happy that the integrity of the game has been maintained...unlike in other sports! Huh??\n\nThe bottom line is that if the original film had never been made, \"Rollerball\" (2002) would have still been seen as a poor film. But in light of how many people loved the original and well crafted it was, watching this film is sure to frustrate most viewers....especially since a remake didn't have to be terrible and mindless."

This completely lame remake misfires on every level . Since it's set a couple of years in the future there's no chance it can be called futuristic . It might be described as \" Dark \" but that's because no one seems to have paid the electricity bill during production . But the main failing in this version is the game of Rollerball itself . In the original the game would see matches where several team members would either die or be maimed for life but in this present day version it doesn't seem anymore dangerous than American football or Rugby or any other type of contact sport . hell even bimbos are allowed to take part . in other words this is a game for wimps in comparison and this ruins the movie far more than the oft quoted aspects like the poor acting , camp sound effects and the night vision sequence"

        "review_detailed_main": "Johnathan Cross, a lover of extreme sports, is recruited to star in Rollerball. The players are on Rollerblades, trying to bring a heavy metal ball into a high goal. Also, there are motorcyclists around to bring momentum to the players. Oh yes, and there are no rules in the game. During his skyrocketing career, Johnathan has to experience what Alexi has found out: Blood brings more viewing pleasure to the audience. In a final game, Johnathan and his team have to fight for mere survival.\n\nBack in 1975, James Caan brought us a brutal movie in which you can literally hear every bone in the players body break. Now, John McTieran has brought that film to us again, for a new generation. With stars like LL Cool J, Rebbeca Romijn and Chris Klein you would expect it to be a pretty bad remake, but this is not the case. Rollerball does the unthinkable and gives Psycho a running for it's money as the worst remake ever created by man.\n\nChris Klein in every film he has been in manages to make it look as if he has no range at all. His soft voice and good looks can only go so far, and in a movie where you need to beat the living hell out of another team member, you want someone that can at least yell and make a sound beyond a bird chirp. LL Cool J is only hear to bring the film a \"cool\" hip look, he's suppose to be the I don't give a damn, James Dean character, but it doesn't fly. Rebbeca Romijn, well, she has a nude scene, but when it's covered in the dark, you wonder why she is even in the movie to begin with.\n\nRollerball is suppose to be a bloody entertaining film, but McTeirnan at no point manages to show us anything entertaining. The entire game sequences seem uninspired and drawn out. When it goes for a shock, it misses and misses completely. I'm still wondering if LL Cool J's character is dead or alive, but apparently it's not important to the story. LL Cool J probably knew that this was going to be garbage and left the movie, leaving the film crew to make his character disappear. I don't blame him.\n\nNot even the professional himself, Jean Reno save this film from the ultimate horrible experience that we all will endure from seeing this film. In a film about violence in sports, you would expect to see some, but when you have a PG-13 rating, you know that it was targeted to make money and nothing else.\n\nI can't understand why someone would want to see this film, the final action sequence is yet another let-down in this horrible tripe. The only thing that this film has going for it, is it's 97 minute length, so if you do have the unfortunate experience of sitting through it, it will be over soon enough."

This movie will depress anyone who loves movies. I would hate to encounter anyone who likes this piece of sewage. There is nothing of value on screen: from the horrid acting of LL Cool J to the gratuitous street luge scene. If the director had an ounce of humor he would have used The Trashmen's \"Surfin' Bird\" here. But that would be asking too much. Instead, the film makers get together and trash a classic. When this happens someone must step in and play policeman and arrest the Hollywood perpetrators involved in this criminal mischief. You have the right to remain silent. Anything--Well, forget it. I believe the director lost his mind. The night vision scenes were visual poison. Puke green. Fuzzy. Shockingly enough, an entire reel or two of this utterly useless footage of a chase of some kind made it into the movie. I have this feeling the film was unintentionally overexposed. The Rollerball game cannot be followed by anybody sober. Loud. Noisy. What are the rules? There is not a scintilla of drama anywhere in this motion picture. Take this stinker out to the curb before it contaminates the rest of your dvd collection or damages your player. Wretched. Shame on all who were involved. And a pox on their homes, too."

Rollerball is absolutely dire and truly deserves the lowest rating possible.\n\nA muddled, unexciting piece of drivel from the word go, John McTiernan's lousy remake of Norman Jewison's 70s cult favourite is every inch as bad as you have probably heard. Perpetually-perplexed-looking Chris Klein is unwisely cast as Jonathan (portrayed by James Caan in the original), a thrill junkie who is convinced by good friend Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) to try his hand at Rollerball, a dangerous team sport played in Russia and its neighbouring countries.\n\nThe evil men controlling the sport, led by Alexis Petrovich (Jean Reno), are corrupt gangsters who will trade players lives in order to boost their ratings. But a brave American citizen like Jonathan isn't about to kowtow to the demands of nasty foreigners, and sets about upsetting the applecart.\n\nTo be honest, there are so many reasons to despise this movie, I really do not know where to start. I guess as good a place as any would be with director McTiernan, who seems to have lost all ability to make a decent film. This is the man who redefined the action movie in the 80s with Die Hard. He also proved he could do a decent remake with The Thomas Crown Affair. So what the hell happened here?\n\nHis Rollerball is unexciting, glossy toss that makes the mistake of pandering to the teen crowd. As a result, we get a pretty boy lead 'actor' (Klein makes Keanu Reeves look like Olivier), a rapper playing support, an ex-model (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as the love interest, and even an inexplicable appearance by noise-merchants Slipknot. The script treats the viewer with contempt, making no attempt to explain the titular game, rendering the action scenes meaningless. If we have no idea of the rules of the sport, how the hell can we get excited about it?\n\nVisually the film is even worse: the 'roller dome'\u0097the arena in which Jonathan is king (despite constantly looking as if he is about to wet himself)\u0097resembles a kids activity area rather than a tough battlefield; the players, dressed in shiny PVC, look like they're off to an S&M party; and for some reason an entire chase scene is shot viewed though some kind of night-vision goggles.\n\nThe acting ranges from poor (Reno, Romijn-Stamos) to very poor (Klein, rapidly becoming my most hated actor, and LL Cool J).\n\nGone is the bone-crunching realistic violence of the original film; in McTiernan's version of the sport, it seems that no-one is supposed to get hurt\u0097if they do get injured, it's because of their unscrupulous bosses and their money-grabbing ways. Gone is the futuristic setting\u0097this one is supposed to be in the here and now! And gone is any respect I had for JohnMcTiernan."

But the blood lust of people had to be compensated, so there was this game called Rollerball, which was full of action, thrills and kills. But then one of the players was in the verge of becoming too big. He, Jonathe E. was a threat to the rule.\n\nWe can forget all about that with this remake of that 70's classic. There is no political metaphor, no philosophical questions about humanity, in fact there is no sense at all, if you don't count nonsense, about the movie. John McTiernan, director of such classics as 'The Predator' and 'Die Hard' has managed to make a movie, that is in one word, poor.\n\nWith some idiotic excuse the main protagonist Jonathan (at least the name is same), gets in the hazardous game of Rollerball with his pal Marcus (LL Cool J). Soon he notices, that there is something fishy about the game.\n\nThere isn't anything worthwhile to mention about the film. Tiernan directs like a man, who hasn't directed a single piece of film in his life. The plot is idiotic and the main baddies are pretty much camp material. The action is poorly choreographed and the editing tries so badly to be music video like, that it's flat out funny.\n\nCan't really figure any reason for anyone to see this film.\n\nRating: 1 out of 10\n\nCamp rating: 4 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I suspected 2002 \"Rollerball\" was an ugly movie, but not that ugly! Well, let's get rid of the only merit of the movie: the presence of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, beautiful and tremendously sexy. Indeed, a statuesque female warrior is always sexy, all the more with that alluring scar on her face.\n\nThe tragic fact with \"Rollerball\" is that the story should be good, per se. The authors took the ideas from the original (and true) 1975 \"Rollerball\". They deleted the political and moral messages, which were somewhat a weakness of the 1975 film, and placed the story in some remote countries of a near future, allegedly ruled by violence, greed, abuse. But the way the film is made turns it into a disaster.\n\nThere is an over-long (and boring) preamble, with a race down-hill of some cretinous youngsters, in San Francisco. This is a great narrative mistake. The audience is anxious to know about the Rollerball game, and you excruciate them with idiots, easily found, alas!, in everyday life. In the next scene Jonathan (a remarkably blunt Chris Klein) has become the undisputed superstar of the Rollerball. We don't understand anything of the rules of the game. As a matter of fact, we don't understand anything of the plot! The guys on the screen keep talking about other guys, seemingly killed by the bad ones, or something like that. Who are who? The audience utterly ignores it. The next scene (say: someone escaping from somewhere) has no logical connection with the previous one. I bet that in the final editing of the movie a good 30 minutes were cut, making the story a complete mess. The only thing we get is that the villains deliberately provoke accidents on the field to raise the TV audience of the game. And then there is the lousy greenish nocturnal scene. Up to my knowledge, the worst visual idea in the history of cinema. Some 15 minutes of sufferings for the innocent viewer. The ending is even more ludicrous than expected.\n\nBut what is really incredible, even in a terrible movie, is that, in spite of the enormous technological improvements, the scenes of the game, and related special effects, are by far less spectacular, exciting, violent than those of the 1975 \"Rollerball\". The possibly interesting presence of women playing Rollerball is not exploited at all. The uniforms of the teams are worse than horrible, they are stupid.\n\nThere's nothing to save in \"Rollerball\". Just take Romijn-Stamos and bring her to another movie (keeping the scar on her face, if possible)."

The rollerball sequences however are truly exciting and harrowing, it's thought-provoking and relevant, it's well made and acted it has a powerful ending and it has some of the best use of classical music in film.\n\nWhatever faults the original had, it's a masterpiece compared to this dreadful mess, which makes all the few faults of the original, magnifies them by a thousand and makes a plethora's worth of flaws on top. The remake of 'Rollerball' not only fails spectacularly as a remake, down there as the worst and most pointless ones out there along with 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man' and 'Stepford Wives', but is catastrophically bad film in its own right. It is truly hard to believe that it was directed by the same man responsible for great films like 'The Hunt for Red October', 'Predator' and especially 'Die Hard'. One of the biggest falls in film quality ever and John McTiernan's worst film by a significant degree.\n\nNot even the usually game and more Jean Reno is enough to save it, but actually comes off the least badly. The acting is very poor, and this is at best, especially from a chronically wooden and personality deprived Chris Klein, in a role that even the best of actors working today would struggle to do anything with, and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who doesn't even try to act. Character development may not have been a strong suit in the 1975 film, but at least the two lead characters were interesting. Here there were no interesting characters at all, all of them severely underwritten ciphers.\n\nMcTiernan's direction has no style, personality, tension or energy of any kind, it's uncharacteristically incompetent career-worst and career-killing worthy direction and 'Rollerball' is a strong contender for the worst-directed film of that year. Don't expect good visuals either, 'Rollerball' is cheap, chaotic, too darkly lit and is to me has some of the worst editing for any film not to have SyFy or The Asylum's involvement. Eric Serra's, regular composer for Luc Besson's films, music score is never dynamic, in fact it's discordant and intrusive, and has nothing memorable about it.\n\nSchool sports days are more exciting and suspenseful than the action here, and considering they and bullying were the lowest points of my school life that is not a compliment. No sense of danger, no tension, too darkly lit, chaotically edited and sometimes incoherent as well as too clean and glossy for something actually intended to be very dangerous (when it did try to be more violent it was gratuitously so), a huge problem for a film where it features heavily at the expense of everything else. The ending is as wet as a drip and floppy as badly out of date cabbage.\n\nDialogue is truly risible and should never have approved beyond first draft, and even earlier than that, the pace is so pedestrian the slowest snail moves faster in comparison and the story is redundant in all senses with no thrills or fun, lack of coherence is also an issue as is the jumbled structure.\n\nAltogether, a catastrophically bad mess with no redeeming values (not even Reno). In the top 10 of the worst and most pointless remakes ever and on its own terms as a film it's not much better, even worse actually. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, \"It failed\".\n\nThere was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esquire type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a \"science fiction\" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes \u0085 ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film. Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again, there was no value in this film.\n\nChris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film \u0085 is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using \"night vision\" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film. That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity \u0085 that was all, and LL kept the \"hip-ness\" factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.\n\nRollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, \"This is my best work yet!\" If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking. Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life!\n\nGrade: * out of *****"

Gigli), saying it's the 'Worst movie ever made' etc etc, clearly these people have never seen drek like \"Rollerball Seven' or 'Space Mutiny' or even 'Leprechaun 4', those movies were BAD. Yes this was a remake, and the plot stays pretty much the same as the original, futuristic game played with motorbikes and roller blades, but it does not come close to the James Caan original. It's worth a watch if it's showing late one night on TV, might even be worth a rental on DVD. Watch it and judge for yourself."

Firstly I should say that I am not a huge fan of the original movie, it is a reasonable action film, so my dislike does not stem from a loyalty to the first incarnation of this story. My dislike for the 2002 Rollerball comes from a feeling of being patronized by everyone involved in the making of this movie. How did the producers ever think that this was acceptable on any level?\n\nThe acting is second rate but what is to be expected from one of the worst casts ever assembled? Klein is worthless unless he is making a joke of his own persona (Election), LLcoolJ is one of a string of rappers that should never be given a 'tough guy' role simply because of his real profession and Reno, the one talented actor among them, seems to slip into pantomime dame territory. I will give Paul Heyman praise for his character as the English announcer, he seems to come across as a decent and fairly charasmatic actor but he does little that he doesn't do brilliantly in his day job.\n\nThe attempted satire relating to the commercialisation of sport and its reliance on violence is pathetically toothless. The direction is simply a mess. The attempt to make this non-sensical sport look breathtaking through rapid editing and instant replay is awful. It does nothing but make you realize that restrained directing and editing are a wonderful thing.\n\nRollerball represents everything that is wrong with mainstream Hollywood movies. It shows a lack the of originality, does this version add anything to the original version?, that has dogged film for years. I cannot believe that there are so few new ideas that we have to see cult action movies, cult British crime movies and television shows remade over and over again. This movie should be avoided at all costs."

It's one of the worst films ever made, without a doubt. The plot is some muddled mess about the future in which some insane sport is run, and someone finds out about there being some cheating going on in it... I don't know, I think the biggest problem was that I really didn't give a damn. Some new sport is started, and it's worse than the rest... so? Don't participate in the bloody thing. Some people start cheating in order to win or make it more interesting or whatever... so? Isn't that what all sports are about? To the best of my knowledge, there hasn't been a completely honest type of sports that was completely devoid of cheaters since... well, ever. That's what we do, us humans. We challenge each other to find someone who's better at one particular thing and cheat if we don't think we can win. What else is new? In case you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, no, I don't care for sports. The pacing is awful and tries the viewers patience, whilst the editing does its best to supply him/her with a sturdy migraine, usually successful. The editing, score and dialog clearly does what it can to seem 'hip', cool and fresh, mostly just resulting in more bodily pain(now it's not just your brain that hurts due to it trying hard to understand the pure crap the plot and the film in general is, now your ears will be bleeding from the noise and your eyes will be flinching from the quick, pointless cuts that try far too hard to be stylish). McTiernan, one question. What the hell is wrong with you? OK, maybe you were never *that* talented... but Last Action Hero was at the very least solid and Die Hard was good. How did you slide so low down the talent ladder? One of the steps broke and you didn't grab a hold of it, is that it? The acting is dire. Not that it's any surprise, really... come on, admit it, LL Cool J can't act, we all know it; and apparently, neither can Chris Klein, if his performance in this mess is anything to go by(guess he just got lucky in the American Pie films). The characters are poorly written clich\u00e9s that we don't care even the slightest bit about. The whole film is an unforgivable mess of a somewhat decent idea with absolutely no redeeming qualities. See the first version or just skip this one altogether. I recommend this to mindless sports fans or teenagers who like loud noises and break-neck speed editing. 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The reputation of this film really goes before it. It was of course a remake of the 1975 original and it almost goes without saying that it is also vastly inferior. Most remakes are worse of course but this one really misses the mark quite spectacularly. What is so surprising is that it's the action scenes themselves that are possibly the most poorly executed. Director John McTiernan had been most famous for making classics of the action genre in Predator (1987) and Die Hard (1988), which makes it so doubly surprising that his action scenes in Rollerball are so poor. The game of Rollerball itself should be pretty simple but in this movie it can barely be followed nor understood. For the remake the arena has pointlessly being changed into a figure of eight shaped track that looks less like a place of futuristic violent sports combat and more like the set from the 90's game-show Gladiators. The action is fast, furious, yet incomprehensible, edited together in ways that do not help us know what the hell is going on.\n\nThe story-line underpinning events is broadly similar to the original but with poor performances and a weak script. You never get very involved with the plight of the characters and it's quite difficult believing that this is the number one sport in the world of the future. Unlike the original, the events only occur two or three years in the future, meaning that the dystopian sci-fi of the original is lost and we have a drearier contemporary world in which events unfold. Although it was quite an unusual idea setting the action in Kazakhstan of all places! To be fair to the film, it does move at a decent pace and is entertaining enough if you lower your expectations accordingly. If it wasn't a remake of a cult classic I daresay it would have passed under the radar as a ropey action movie but seeing as it is a new version of an old film and one with quite a considerable budget its flaws become all too apparent."

It all comes down to one scene, a battery of nonsense imagery set to noises that clearly lack any true direction. I seem to remember an alarm clock, a rooster crow, a ninja \"heeee-yaa\" and bowling pins being hit, followed by a reporter asking LL Cool J if his mother was a crack head. I immediately began slapping myself in the face, asking if what I had seen was real, or whether I had eaten the wrong pill and found myself in the 'real' world where God-awful films like this actually get the go ahead and budget to be produced, shot, and released to the public."

I'll get the few good aspects out of the way: the direction and cinematography are decent. John McTiernan makes good use of the camera, camera movement, overhead shots, etc. The infamous \"night vision scene\" is so strange and awful that it comes back around to being awesome - truly bizarre stuff. There's one good song in the movie and some decent stuntwork... that's about it.\n\nThere's too much bad to mention: The actors are all awful. Whoever cast Chris Klein in the lead should be shot by a firing squad. He is particularly horrendous here, acting like he's a badass for no good reason. LL Kool J deserves a mention here, too - he stinks. What little social commentary there is, is hamfisted and given only maybe 5 minutes of screentime. The story serves very little impact and is only there to justify the action scenes. During the action scenes is also where the direction falls apart, you have no idea where characters are in relation to one another, and often it is just a flurry of bodies flying thru the air one after another, like some sort of bizarre kung-fu flick. Except this is technically a sports movie, so there desperately needs to be some coherence to the action so you can know the stakes and who is winning. But instead each rollerball scene is just a mess. There's a bad 90s metal soundtrack that probably sounded dated upon release. Paul Heyman of ECW fame makes a pointless cameo. It's 90 minutes, but feels like 190.\n\nI spent extra time doing the dishes in order to avoid this movie, that's how bad it is. This is hard to watch for all the wrong reasons. Utterly irredeemable."

For instance, during one of the crazy action sequences, where the camera dances around pretending to follow something and just when you think it might settle down, it cuts to some completely different random scene; well, I became extremely nauseous and passed out. The next thing I know, I'm in some hellish-looking rollerball ring surrounded by fire and rollerblading-demons. I can hear the intro to LL Cool J's, \"I'm Gonna Knock You Out\" blasting away on some endless loop and then WHAM!, out of nowhere I get whacked in the back of the head with a rollerball. As I look up dazed, I can make out two of the roller-demons standing over me. The odd thing is that they are spitting images of Chris Klein and LL Cool J....if they were in demon-form. They were laughing maniacally and saying, \"Cha-ching!\", and thats when I noticed that my wallet was missing. I think I only had like 3 bucks in there, but you couldn't tell that by seeing how Chris Klein-demon and LL Cool J-demon were carrying on. At any rate I awoke a few seconds later on my living room floor. The movie had gone off and I seemed to be no worse for wear. So anyway, to make a long story short, I lost 3 bucks and I think that I might be pregnant with Chris Klein's demon-baby? However, I only had to actually watch a few minutes of Rollerball. So technically, I won."

Somehow John McTiernan takes both of these themes and totally butchers them into something that does not remotely do justice to the original, or to anything else for that matter.\n\nThe premise of 'accidents' being staged to pump up international ratings (on what medium?), and concurrent gambling on games, instantaneously, is stretching credibility. Having co-ed teams is almost believable but those stupid masks that the players all wear? And placing it all in Central Asia is bizarre.\n\nThe game itself has been changed from the original circular 1/8 mile track into a nightmare collection of props that only an X-Games inline skater could love. A demolition derby-style course, with jumping ramps where the paths cross, would already make for a hazardous game IMO. Motorcycles dragging players off the steeply banked turns and up onto the clear viewing panels? Guess it had to be Central Asia since this would never fly in the US with OSHA around. Staging accidents in this version simply wouldn't be necessary.\n\nThe parallels to the original with the rules changes to the game (not that there was much in the rules brought out in the plot) is the product of a premise by the director without the slightest idea of how to advance a story. There just isn't any there there, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein.\n\nWatch the original, and especially the final scenes, with the silent crowd, the dead players on the track, the game reduced to Jonathon E stumbling around the track to score the only, meaningless goal, that is film-making. The amateurish ending of this namesake says 'so what?'\n\nIt is a sad waste of a tremendous idea."

        "review_title": "This movie is the first disaster of 2002.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Rollerball is one long smorgasbord of smash-ups, crashes and body blows. It's a big mess of a movie that fails to establish strong characters or to set up a logical design of the dangerous sport the characters participate in. The guilty party for this disaster is director John McTiernan, who previously has been reliable with such strong and intelligent action-adventure movies like Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and The Thomas Crown Affair. What was he thinking?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the 1975 version of Rollerball with James Caan, this film will be especially difficult to follow. Watching the original film before seeing this remake is essential because the old version plays like Cliff Notes in order to follow the action. The original movie wasn't a great film but at least it established interesting ideas about corporation rule in a futuristic society which operated in totalitarian rule under CEO's. This film attempts to satirize the extent producers will go for television ratings. In the original film, the game of rollerball was a fusion of hockey, football and motocross with gladiator brutality. This time the game is interrupted by constant cutting with complete absence of clarity and the arena is so small that it's claustrophobic mayhem instead of having a big arena with competitive design like in Norman Jewison's original film.\n\nWhat's worse is that the casting is all wrong. Chris Klein is too baby-faced and non-threatening to play Jonathan Cross, the athlete that becomes a hero for the masses while challenging the integrity of the game. LL Cool J is his teammate Marcus Ridley that wants to help Cross get out of the game once it starts getting deadly in the arena. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the love interest to Jonathan and scarred teammate in this unisex sport. Jean Reno plays the evil executive owner of this dangerous sport league, doing little but snicker from his owner's box seat or shouting incomprehensibly at his lackies.\n\nThe history behind this troubled production is revealing. Director John McTiernan in the spring of 2001 invited online critic Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News to take a look at an early screening. Despite being an admirer of the modern action film, he simply stated it sucked and bad buzz leaked everywhere. The film was pushed from an August release so the filmmakers could work on its problems. The studio was concerned with its length of two hours and about the incoherence of the action. McTiernan returned behind the camera in the fall to shoot additional scenes for two weeks. What is evident is that additional photography could not clear anything up, not with the mess of earlier footage that could be assimilated in the editing. The running time was cut, and with a reported $60 million running tag, the film's blood and gore was cut to insure a PG-13 rating. Luring young teenagers into this fiasco was the studio's only chance to make their money back. The final edit remains a muddled, and discreetly tame, work of shame.\n\nThere is constant noise on the soundtrack, the pacing is as reckless and frenetic as a bad video game and with constant attention to overlong action scenes, this lends to little character development. The game itself is so burdened by the suffocated design of the arena, so incoherent and undefined in athletic contest that it would more logically crumble faster than the XFL."

Moreover, the action is presented in incomprehensible cutscenes. You could take the entire movie reel, chop it up, throw all the pieces in a hat and then pick them out at random and splice them together and it would make just as much sense. Heck, it might even be better.\n\nAnd the best part is that this movie is about this sport called Rollerball. The movie spends exactly 10 seconds explaining how the game is played and nobody I've talked to really understood it. It involves some bladin', some jumpin' and some punchin' and that's all that McTiernan thought you needed to know. Oh, and there are motorcycles that zoom around for some unexplained reason.\n\nThis movie is worth owning if you're a lover of bad cinema, but beware if you live in close quarters with other people - it's bad enough that they'll likely become physically violent if you watch it in their presence."

The acting was non-existent (Chris Klein is Keanu Reeves doppelganger), the script - someone is still looking for it! The first 40 minutes of the film were completely without narrative. I was utterly confused by what was going on. The remaining 50 minutes were part escape part revenge plot wise - I think?

What the remake has going for it is that John McTiernan is directing it and it stars Jean Reno. It should be good, right? Wrong.\n\nWhat Rollerball is; is an absolute mess of colour, visuals, loud unnecessary rock music and atrocious plot devices. The bulk of these things are on show in the opening half an hour but first, the film hangs around a risky sport involving skateboarding down the sloped roads of San Francisco, risking life and limb for no apparent reason. Jonathan (Klein) likes his kicks and is convinced by a mentor/future team mate to travel to Kazakhstan to take up 'Rollerball'. Then we get to the conventions mentioned earlier. Up until the first Rollerball game starts, I was intrigued but then; any hopes of a film with half a brain cell completely evaporates when the mess that is the actual sport the film revolves around is introduced. Rollerball is, to me, a mix of Wrestling WWE style and Ice Hockey as the point is to score goals but to give the opposition team members a bit of a kick and a punch, pointlessly, along the way. Oh, by the way: for some reason motorbikes are allowed as well. Don't ask.\n\nThere is a brief 'attempt' at the rules being explained but the American commentator does his best in screaming the point of the whole thing down a microphone in a fashion that is both quick and confusing. The bottom line is that even the writers, I don't think, knew what the rules were. What constitutes as a foul? Why don't the other team members attempt to block the goal attempts? And why the hell are motorbikes involved!? In fact, most things the players shout during the matches are quick and inaudible anyway.\n\nThis brings me onto the players/actors. Reno's accent goes from Eastern European to French and then back again a few times and the lead shares some kind of relationship with a character named Aurora that has absolutely no build up what-so-ever. It's funny, because you don't see the love interest coming but at the same time: you do, if you know what I mean.\n\nTowards the end, the television ratings soar due to controversy and planned violence in the sport. The feeling of greed from the characters whom may as well hold up signs saying: 'we are bad guys' as they sit in their V.I.P. boxes dressed in suits and ties, is forced down our throats through the images in insanely narrow minded fashion. This is bad enough but then the players start having second thoughts and make plans of their own. What follows is, arguably, the most ridiculous idea for film content ever conceived: a ten minute chase sequence shot in night vision(!) Was there any need? Couldn't they be bothered to set up the lights since it was at night? Probably.\n\nWith other laughable things Rollerball contains such as random cutaways to musical performances from rock bands as well as needless jump cuts and cheesy looking Eastern European TV footage; all of which are utterly pointless and given how long the film is, are probably just in there to bulk up the time. How sad.\n\nRollerball is not worth the time but if you are going to watch it I can only recommend you do so just to see how bad it is."

McTiernan, who made good action movies once (Die Hard and Die Hard 3 come to mind), took too many people's opinions in mind in the process of test screening this, I suppose, and the final product after it's original date being pushed is not pretty. Even the most strident of action film fans who admire the worst trash will have to admit there is just something wrong with this picture. Wrong casting (why put Klein, who looks like he hasn't shaved his entire life and has that stupid romance novel face that only really worked for him in American Pie, in a film such as this? Plus, Paul Heyman is pretty much history as far as wrestling TV is concerned and this isn't about to resurrect his career much at all), wrong camera work, and a really wrong script make a wrong movie. Period. Only thing not making it a complete failure is a few funny lines (not intentionally) provided by Reno. D-"

It had a stronger plot and the action sequences were great. Sure the acting wasn't Oscar material, but hey it's Rollerball. You're not renting it for the acting!\n\nI'm sure back in the day the original was great, but in modern times....skip the original and watch this one."

The actionscenes in and out of the stadium are very exciting and never dull. There is some background information on how everything came to be but you have to pay attention or you miss it.\n\nI also loved the references to the world of professional wrestling.\n\nI give this movie a 7.5, it's not a 'great' movie but if you are willing to be entertained you'll be entertained by it..."

Although at first i was a bit shocked by the flagrant differences with the original, i've then decided to let that fact go and just let the movie drive me, and you know what, it did his job, which is to entertain me.\n\nYes, the plot, if we can called it that, is somewhat nonexistent, and the script doesn't deliver any memorable moments, because it was intended that way, its typical with all action flicks. I was happy i give this movie a chance with an open mind(keep in mind its an action flick though). Considering all the facts, my final note: 6.5\n\nIn conclusion, i hope you'll give this movie a chance, just forget about the original, watch it purely for the action and you won't regret it."

First the action of the game is cool and probably harder then anything most people can do. Second it still shows the typical elements you look for in a sports/action movie and wasn't so dreadful like some people make it out to be. My final reason is a personal preference. The American broadcaster was played by Paul Heyman. For you non-wrestling fans he use to run a company that many say is one of the greatest of all time and that is ECW. He used his famous manager character and made me enjoy the movie when I first saw it and hated it like many others. It takes more then one viewing before I got a good feeling about the movie. Thats just my 2 cents."

I popped it in my VCR at home, and sure enough, I was right: after watching ROLLERBALL, movies that used to seem bad to me were suddenly tolerable. To further test myself, I put in my favorite film of all time, PULP FICTION. No cinema-going experience in my life has ever matched that viewing of PULP FICTION. It was alive and beautiful. I had tears in my eyes.\n\nI used to condemn ROLLERBALL as a pointless movie, but now I see that this film serves a very real purpose. It's like that poor, fat, ugly guy you pass on the street. When you see him, you feel bad for him, but better about yourself. You say, \"I may not be perfect, but I least I don't look like THAT guy.\" Hence, ROLLERBALL.

This disgusting remake disgraces its original more than The Avengers, more than Godzilla, and yes, even more than Batman & Robin. Beyond the initial corruption of the classic 1975 Rollerball, this remake is a disgrace to Jean Reno. Seriously, this man needs to do more research before choosing a movie. We know he can act well, we just know he can do it. Look at Leon (The Professional). This is yet another crapball to tarnish his record. The worst disgrace this movie is guilty of, however, is its absolute ineptitude. This film fails in its basic charge as a motion picture. This movie is unforgiving. If it's not hurting your brain with idiotic lesbian jokes, or attempting to titilate you with frontal nude shots, it's forcing you to observe brainless, pointless eXtreme!! sports, like death-luging or an action favorite, driving like an idiot. And don't forget the thirty-minute scene filmed with a green filter lens, to simulate night-vision. I have a camcorder, too, guys, and turning that little green thing on in the dark does not make your movie clever, edgy, interesting, or even watchable. I'd hoped I could forget this terrible film, but I've taking it upon myself to dredge up the awful memories of it once again, to warn others. DO NOT see this movie. It is not so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's painful. And if you've ever see the original Rollerball, just ignore this awful remake.

It's been a while since John McTiernan has directed a film. His last ones were the remade THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and 13th WARRIOR. Here, it's thought that John has returned to what he does best, and it was nice to see a film that was surprisingly good. At first glance ROLLERBALL looks like it's going for the \"MATRIX effects\" that so many movies, shows, and commercials have been using too much, but John has stuck to his own methods of film making, and hasn't \"sold out.\" Every action scene was not filmed in any over- outlandish style, and that was a star swinging high point. Chris Klien seems more accustomed to comedy, but here, he's starting to learn the ropes as a man of action. Though his youth is apparent within his role, he makes it through as a hero. LL Cool J has proven himself to be a compotent actor long ago, and he still has his own brand of charisma. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos also commands the screen as a tough Rollerball player who happens to have a romantic relationship with Klien's character. Another nice touch was the international casting and locations through the whole film. It gave a great mix. Especially with the great Jean Reno as the villain who always does good in the movies he's in. The rest of the villains are also great. They're cruel and it's a relief when they get what they deserve. For a PG-13 rated film, it was surprisingly violent. It's hard to believe that the theatrical version was edited from the original which supposedly has more violence.\n\nBut if the MPAA is getting lax, so what? One less movie getting too much hasslement. The action is brutal and pounding. When one concentrates fully on the film, it's like actually being in the arena with all the fierce action going on all around. When someone gets struck, it's felt by the viewer. But the standout action scene is a chase through darkness where it's totally pitch black and scene through nightvision lenses. This was a great method, because the atmosphere would be ruined by Hollywood lighting effects. This added on to wondering if Chris Klien and LL Cool J are gonna get away from the bas guys. The small roles were also cool. Like seeing WWE's Vince's son, Shane McMahon for one full second. (Blink and he'll be gone.) And surprisingly, former wrestling commentator Paul Heyman had a bigger role that thought, and has some funny lines. All in all, this is John McTiernan's best film in a long time. ROLLERBALL is not something that should be thought too hard about, but should be taken with consideration and excitement.\n\n8 out of 10"

Whether you just hold the original film in high regards (Chris Klein cannot hold a candle against James Caan) or you just find the way this was made quite lunatic. I understand that it just isn't something you can or feel entertained by.\n\nIf you can overlook certain flaws though, there is a movie that can and is fun to watch though. This is a movie best watched with a certain degree of ... not caring for certain things. There is an overlaying theme here, that does critisize the media and the general blood lust. Now it is quite on the nose and there is not real subtext here. But again, the movie does not pretend to be a high quality film. Except when it comes to the \"game\" scenes. I like the update to the stadium they did.\n\nGenerally speaking, I almost feel sorry for the movie, because there have way worse movies in general, that are not even entertaining. But one final time: I understand"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is a shame. The original movie wasn't so bad, although it now shows its age. The 2002 version is some pimplish over-testosteroned x-gamer's fantasy.\n\nThe acting is hilarious.... Jean Reno is making his mark as Hollywood's token-frenchy. Casting him as a Russian is a complete joke. HE overacts so much, he looks like he's auditioning to replace Captain Kirk... Chris Klein is sadly miscast; the part was made for a James Caan tough looking s.o.b., not for some 19 y.o. teen magazine front page model. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is cute, a real nice woman, but her accent sounds ridiculous and phony. I can hear the casting meeting: \"hey, who do we pick for the babe? Hummm... What's the name of the babe who showed her b***s in X-Men? Yeah, get her! Call her agent!!\"\n\nNow the direction... This is a shame. I am no armchair director but the direction sucked. McTiernan can make great movies, he really can, but everything sucks in this flick. I had to rewind 20 times to understand the action scenes. The camera work is jerky, the editing is painfully fast.\n\nThe script... What script? How can grown-ups come up with such a load of crap? The story looks straight out of a 15 y.o. undersexed mind. Hey, let's give them nice cars! Hey, why not have them street luge? Let's show the girl's boobs! The character's motivations make no sense... The chin strap part is hilarious in itself.\n\nSet-design and costumes... Shamefully unrealistic. This movie makes the XFL look intelligent. The track set is so visually confusing that i could not follow the action at all. The costumes are a perfect demonstration of what happens when a designer is set loose. The helmets are accidents waiting to happen. Trust me, if i was playing Rollerball, i'd wear a helmet that actually protects me, not one that increases the risk of injury.\n\nThis movie is an example of what happens when the producers don't follow a production. Of course the direction sucked, but it seems obvious to me that the whole production got out of control. It's like nobody checked what the various departments were doing...\n\nThe only reason this movie is not worse than Battlefield Earth is the basis of the story line. This one vaguely makes sense, BE was pure bulls***t. Minus 10 stars out of 10."

(And apparently, so did a lot of other people - as certain reviews have made mention of Heyman's exciting performance as a Rollerball announcer.) When two then-sports entertainers show more impressive acting ability than the actual Hollywood actors cast in the picture, you've got problems.\n\nPlot - Lacking. It's an EXTREME sports movie... which already disinterests me from the get-go. And yet as I watch it, I can somehow feel my soul wither away as I attempt to follow the excruciatingly awful storyline. Terrible.\n\nVisuals - Holy crap on a stick, this movie looks appalling. Absolutely terrible. There's nothing visually appealing here - even the token post- apocalyptic features have some reasonable visuals. This is just really ugly. An eyesore to say the least... especially in regards to those HORRENDOUS night vision sequences.\n\nSound - My ears bleed listening to this noise. It's just awful.\n\nDirection - Lacking. Just... no.\n\nEditing - Bad. More emphasis is spent on close-ups and horrible acting than on the sport itself. In fact, the pacing is so bad that I often lose track of what's going on, but I'm too scared to go back and rewatch because that means subjecting myself to this horrible mess.\n\nOverall - Pure crap movie. Just pathetic.\n\nYou want a better quality movie? Go watch Battlefield Earth... sure, it's bad too, but it's better than this..."

The story there was the world was now controlled by corporations and in order to keep the populace appeased they created a violent deathsport known as \"Rollerball\". The reasons for this were two fold. The first, and most obvious one, was that it was like the old gladiator fights of Ancient Rome. So long as the people had food and entertainment they were appeased. But the second, and most insidious reason, was that it showed individuality wasn't something to strive for. They created a brutal game in which the only way to succeed was teamwork but they didn't count on one man becoming a legend and possibly ruining their plans in the process by showing people that one man could make a difference.\n\nThis movie seems to have ignored all that in favor of action. The basic plot is the same but it's now more about the actual sport which is now about blood and the more of it the higher the ratings. Gone is the social commentary and it's replaced with lots of fast cuts and really nifty stunts. It's like only half the movie the original was.\n\nThe dialogue is pretty bad, the actors look way too pretty for the dangerous sport they're playing and most of the time the actors don't feel like they're giving it their all. Jean Reno feels like he's sleepwalking through the role and maybe he is. He's done great work in the past but this is not one of those movies.\n\nWatch the original and give this one a pass."

So where was all the violence and blood and gore, surely this film would have succeeded if Tarantino would have directed it. At least the premis of the film would not be misleading. OK, so there is some shooting and a few killings near the end, but really this film had so much more potential in it.\n\nKlein although good as the sensitive Keanu Reeves clone from American Pie does not suit this role well, but he is not the main reason for hating this film, (he doesn't really help save it either). His range is constantly stuck between brooding and setting up to brood. Not a good characteristic if you're supposed to be an intense rollerball athlete really. Someone with more intensity or charisma would probably have made this film entertaining at least.\n\nPoor L.L.Cool.J, I feel sorry for this guy, here is a man, who clearly wants to make the serious leap from rap star to movie star and you thought he actually had a chance after watching him in Deep Blue Sea, which has been very successful, and justly so, really good film that.

Parallels can also be drawn to professional sports, which are becoming more and more dangerous (who can forget Todd Bertuzzi's life threatening attack Steve More).\n\nAs you can see it is better than what it has gotten credit for but still I would mostly recommend this film to fans of this genre."

I can see what the director was attempting to achieve and there's some merit in his attempt \u0096 a remake of a very good 1975 film with updated politics. Unfortunately the updated politics are too shallow to take seriously.\n\nOne central trouble is there's too much frenetically paced action and not enough time spent on explaining the story or the society in which Rollerball is set. The original Rollerball by comparison is a very intelligent piece of speculative fiction which films its \u0091Rollerball' sequences expertly and a lot more cohesively than the updated version.\n\nA specific annoyance for me was an extended scene shot at night which uses military night view technology. Suddenly the picture on my TV went monotone and grainy. I thought my trusty 1983 Sony was finally giving up the ghost. I smacked it's side repeatedly until I realised it wasn't my dear TV's fault, it was bloody Rollerballs!\n\nTowards the end, the film becomes disgustingly violent. I was going to give Rollerball 4/10 but the ridiculously overt violence makes me subtract a point.\n\nDespite my harsh words, I will say that I enjoyed Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (what a mouth full!) declading out of her robust costume to reveal two of the most formidable and juicy looking breasts I've ever seen. If only she had spent more screen time naked, I'd raise my score a couple of notches.\n\n3/10"

Do NOT see it. I was optimistic going into the theater, I came out with a grin wide enough to fit all the talent involved in the flick. The grin was not from me loving the movie, but a certain scene so badly produced that I could not help but to smile the rest of the movie. The rundown: first, it starts with a cheap camera and/or film shooting everything. Add a sort of a night-vision effect. Then, terrible acting by Klein and Cool J. To add to my amusement, a terrible 30 second car chase that ends with them on a motorcycle. While hitting 110 mph (since when does a motorcycle NOT flip when it is being jerked around at 110?), a car/plane comes in flying very low to try and capture the two fugitives. The fugitives go through a barbed-wire fence (notice the VERY cheesy Saturday morning cartoon sound when they go through). The plane follows (ANOTHER cheep noise). It ends with a death and more bad acting.\n\nYes, this is the worst scene I have ever seen. It tops all of the scenes from Supernova! Just don't watch it. Don't associate yourself with anyone even remotely involved with the film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've watched both the 1975 and the 2002 remake versions of \"Rollerball\", a story set in a future where the number one form of entertainment is a barbaric sport in which the players roller blade or motorbike around a small court and chase after a silver ball and put it inside a goal. In both versions, the star player of Rollerball is a character named Jonathan (Chris Klein here, James Caan in the original) who after a series of near-death accidents occurs, decides to revolt against the bloodthirsty and corrupt business officials who may have something to do with the accidents.\n\nIt's obvious why the release date for this film was pushed back so many times. The reason is because people just didn't like it. For me, this is one of the first cases where I actually prefer the original to a remake. One thing I really like about the original is that even though there is very little action, it still had a running theme throughout the movie. \"Rollerball\" is supposed to be talking about the corruption of human beings by an oppressive government. That message is lost here in the remake largely because of mindless dialogue between the characters and pointless action sequences outside of the sport. The remake is slow, loud, and kind of boring (though not on the sleep level of boring). Of course, John McTiernan, who directed \"Die Hard\", directs this movie. So you know that at least the action sequences will be good.\n\nThis film bares almost no resemblance to the original except for the names of the movie and the lead character. In both versions, we see a total of three games, so it's best to assume that there's only three games in a season. Also in both versions, the producers change the rules so that in the final game there are no penalties or fouls to be called, which leads to the total annihilation of the players of both teams. Predictably, by the time the bloodshed of the final game is over, only the lead character is left standing to make the winning shot and then leads the revolt against the evil controllers of the sport.\n\nP.S.: The only really good thing about this movie is the performance by heavy metal band Slipknot."

Why did they have to butcher it???\" The previews looked really cool. And the previews...are the movie! Aside from the spectacular opening skateboarding sequence, all the coolness the movie has to offer was given in the previews, and as an added bonus set to the jamming sounds of Limp Bizkit. And for those renting the DVD, it's not a total loss. Hell, I least I got to see some bare boobs. The uncut, R-rated version is available on DVD. So for those thinking of renting this flick--only rent it if you're absolutely desperate to see some bare boobs. I feel even sorrier for those who had to watch this crap in theaters WITHOUT the nudity!\n\nI just found out that the movie was re-edited countless times because of disastrous preview screenings. That alone hints that it's gonna be a crappy movie. I could be wrong, but so far I don't recall seeing a good movie that got its release date pushed and pushed and pushed. The same thing happened with that horrible movie, \"Soul Survivors.\" And I should've gotten a clue when a big, over-hyped action movie like this bombed, even in the first week. Even some of the crappy action movies do wonders at the box office.\n\nJohn McTiernan, director of \"Die Hard\" and \"Die Hard with a Venegance,\" does the best he can, and even overdoes it. Some shots seem flashy for the sake of being flashy. A few of the flashy images are fetching, but most of them just look gratuitous. But McTiernan was working with such a shallow, meaningless script that he tried hard to keep this clunker afloat. So I appreciate the effort. But I gotta say, that green-light chase scene--What the hell was that about?\n\nEvery square inch of this movie spells \"forgettable.\" Take away big stars like Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Jean Reno, along with the huge production values, and you got yourself direct-to-video filler. Why did French character actor Jean Reno degrade himself in such a one-note role? How many zeros were in that paycheck? It's tragic to experience such a fine actor like him laugh maniacally and spurt out horrible lines of dialogue. As for Klein and LL--they'd jump off a 100-story building for a film if it promised a huge paycheck. Let them degrade themselves. At least I get to see the beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. She's no actress, but in such an utterly trash flick like this I wasn't a stickler for acting. Topless Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is pretty much the highlight of \"Rollerball.\"\n\nThis is an example of art imitating life. Extreme sports didn't prove successful with the XFL, and people didn't have to pay to see that! That just proves how successful extreme sports will fare in cinema.\n\nMy score: 3 (out of 10)"

Plus, as every reviewer previous to me has pointer out, that STUPID night vision scene. Maybe would have been interesting for a minute, but not 15. I remember people walking out of the theatre at this point. After this disaster of a movie was over, everybody was saying to the people they came with \"what the hell was that?\". I admit that I will sit down and watch films others describe as camp or cheesy, but I think even if I was watching this on tape, I would have turned it off. There is something seriously flawed with this film. Many have pointed out that it is the editing and I am inclined to agree. So the bottom line is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Rebecca Romijn looks good as the lead female, sadly the same can't be said for Chris Klein, he looks completely lame in the lead male role. There's plenty of violent action but it gets pretty messy and boring, Slipknot performing on stage at one of the venues did briefly stimulate my interest. Waste of time, watch the original instead."

Each edition would conclude with a feature known as \"Dog of the Week\", introduced by a single bark from the resident canine. (I recall the first one being a charming terrier named Spot.)\n\nThe re-make of the classic \"Rollberball\" would definitely qualify as a DOTW. The only things it has in common with the 1975 original is the name and the first name of the main character.\n\n\"Rollerball\" 2002 is a mess. It starts with a game of an apparently illicit skateboarding down the streets of San Francisco, which has absolutely no connection to the main plot. As for the game of RB itself, it seems to be a combination of \"American Gladiators\" and roller derby with some elements of mixed martial arts.\n\nThere isn't much of a plot so it's hard to figure out just what the purpose of the game is, let alone its rules, aside from being a gimmick by which certain people can become rich. At least in the film directed by Norman Jewison, RB serves as a substitute for war in the society that exists.\n\nOn the whole, the acting is awful. Chris Klein was no James Caan and the female lead, Rebecca Romijn, made Raquel Welch's performance in \"Kansas City Bomber\" look Shakespearean.\n\nI used to work in industry, and we used to have a saying: \"If it works, don't fix it,\" something that Hollywood habitually ignores. A re-make should be an improvement on the original. This version of \"Rollerball\" fails in this regard."

Rollerball was not a complete failure, however. It succeeded at being terrible.\n\nI wonder what Hollywood was thinking when they created this movie.

I probably would have rented it even if I had read the comments here first, but at least I would have expected (expectorated) excrement. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen. It wasn't truly sick, and the idea of the whole thing taking place in the \"'Stans\" (as in As;ugousdrhstan) was kind of cool. I thought maybe it was a prequel, until they started with the Jon A Ton chant (four months into it and he's the greatest player ever.) When he throws his hat to the crowd, I knew for sure it was just a pathetic remake. And while James Caan went with his helmet unbuckeled for much of the movie, he was too cool to touch. Our (hero?) must glue his helmet (or maybe nails it on) to his head, because he keeps it on until the near end. I have a generally low taste threshold in movies. I like a good flic, but I can tolerate nearly anything and find some enjoyment. The only redeeming social value I can place on this is to see the original with all its textures and the Albionini music, and then see this to compare just how bad and wrong a remake can possibly be. I thought \"The Last Castle\" was pitiful as a remake of \"The Hill,\" but it had enjoyment value. This has nothing. Nothing. Not even half way decent gratuitous violence. Nothing. Pathetic."

Now I've had experiences with poor editing in movie, but what I saw in \"Rollerball\" was ridiculous. Sometimes, it's literally impossible to understand what's going on. And the camerawork isn't much help, either.\n\nThere are two kinds of bad movies: The kind so bad, it's hilarious, and the other kind is just plain bad. Unfortunately, \"Rollerball\" would have to fall into the second category. Believe me when I say I've never seen anything as bad as \"Rollerball.\" Luckily, I only rented it on DVD after seeing so many negative reviews. And that was one of the biggest mistakes I'd ever made.\n\nNot many movies get to be as bad as \"Rollerball.\" I still can't understand why a whole action sequence was shot with an infrared camera, and why a motorcycle crashing through the gate makes a Looney Tunes cartoon sound. The film doesn't even pretend to be serious, and still, it's not even worth watching; it had no business being at the movie theaters and has no business being sold in video stores.\n\nI don't think many movies will ever get to be as bad as \"Rollerball.\" It seems the stunt people are the only ones actually doing their job, the rest of the characters just seem to be little more than elements of second unit. Avoid \"Rollerball\" at all costs. F- (This is a little too kind.)"

And it's the only humorous line in the film too.\n\nThe only good performance is that of Naveen Andrews, who plays Jean Reno's sidekick/assistant. His is the only character who has any sort of personality, and you will find yourself waiting for him to appear on the screen. Not so much because his character is essential to the story, but because the rest of the film is so horribly bad. His character brings us the only human being in the film. The rest of the actors are just cartoon characters of themselves.\n\nThis film has nothing to recommend it other than the action scenes. The problem there is that the action scenes are shot too close to the action, and quick cut to the point where you can't actually see the action. If they had used a shorter lens and not been so eager to change cameras every 2 seconds, this could have been a much better film. It would at least have been watchable."

Actually aside from Chris Klein I thought the actors did a rather decent job given the inherently weak character developement allowed by the script.\n\nThe thing that really stuck out for me though was the very basic differences between the original and this incarnation. The original movie was a typical mid 70's near future movie. Rollerball being a game that was so brutal that there was never a \"star\" until James Kaan that is. The purpose being to strip the common man of yearning for individuality. Since individuals who stick out during the game get taken out. The new version is a typical turn of the millenium movie about greed. The movie feeds money to the evil producers of the show. In both cases the point was delivered a bit heavy handed, and very heavily doused with cliches of the time.\n\nThings to watch for: Oleg Taktarov (of ultimate fighting championship fame), Paul Heyman (prowrestling producer/commentator), and a cameo by Shane McMahon (Son of WWF owner Vince)."

With this, McTiernan takes the action film to an extreme that I can't recall in any other film, certainly in no American film. It's no wonder it flopped, and it's no wonder preview audiences hated it. Regular blockbuster audiences like their action to be slick. They don't like to be made to feel its consequences. And in this, McTiernan makes us conscious of the pain, and more importantly of our prosaic enjoyment of this pain, as attested by the recurring images of the roaring spectators in the arena and by the rise in TV ratings whenever there is some extra violence on the field."

The team with the most points wins.\n\nThis sounds cool, right? Well, it is infinitley cooler in writing then it is on the big screen.\n\nChris Klien plays the role of Jonathon Cross, a rookie at the sport that the masses just love to shower with affection. I don't see why, but they do. He comes from AMERICA and to the Russians he plays for, he seems to be a miracle boy.\n\nJonathon Cross is supposed to be the hero, but to me, he just comes off as a big slow guy. There was no reason for me to like him, except that I am told he is good at the sport, and that I should love him.\n\nLL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley, the man who gets Klien into the sport. LL goes through the role with typical LL ease that we seem to love ans respect.\n\nJean Reno plays Petrovich, which is not at all a stereotypical russian name. He owns the sport, or the team, or some part of the sport/team. He is just there, and I never really felt anything twords him.\n\nThe rest of the cast is just there, and we seem to care very little about them. They are just there to make Cross and Ridle look good.\n\nThe acting is subpar, with the exception of LL. No one seems to care about what they are doing, and it shows. Reno could have made a better movie in his sleep. He was my favorite part of Godzilla! But he just couldn't do the same for this movie.\n\nThe story is weak, at best. It is all anti-establishment, media is the devil bull-hockey. Without giving too much away, all I can say is the people like the sport, the people like the hero, and I hate the movie.\n\nThe directing style also irked me to no end. It was all close ups, and shakey camera. It made the sport very hard to follow, and gave me a headache. One scene was filmed entirely in Night-Vision... Very poorley.\n\nThis movie tries to preach that the media is bad, and that random violence is worse. All the media cares about is the ratings. This has to be one of the most hypocrtical morals I have ever heard.\n\nA movie trying to preach against the evils of the media, and the evils of sensless violence... I can see at what they are getting at, and it seems to me that they tried to add the moral for a good reason. They tried. I can tell, but... The movie starts with senseless violence, ends with MAJOR SENSELESS VIOLENCE, and I am pretty sure there is sensless violence in the middle, too.\n\nThere were some parts I did enjoy. No wait... I really didn't enjoy this mush at all...\n\nAll in all, I give RollerBall a heartfelt\n\n*1/2 out of *****.\n\nBecause they tried."

Let alone the plot, which seems to be a collection of random 'cool' situations added together, what a stinker!\n\nI hate it not to watch to the end of a movie, but Rollerball gave me itchy fingers.

I have enough trouble figuring out what is happening half the time. The green stuff? That must have been the dust. Needless to say the only enjoyable part was Jean Reno. While incapable of playing a weak character, this was just not his movie.\n\nIn terms of the actual sport, how could that be pleasant?

        "review_detailed_main": "To all of the reviewers who think this movie is the worst thing ever, allow me to refer you to Mr. Godfrey Ho...\n\nNo matter how bad a movie is, it always seems to have defenders. I was astonished to discover, after rating Bio-dome and Who's that Girl a two, that many people were jumping in to claim that I was overly harsh. But here I go with a review of the much hated Rollerball remake on the other side for once. By this I only mean that I hated it less than movies I gave a two. The thing is still pretty awful, but I would watch it again before Glitter.\n\nTo address the obvious point first, this is not your daddy's Rollerball. The 1975 version was a minor classic, thanks to its complex thematic landscape. There, sport was social hypnotic to keep the class distinctions in place, an intention which found itself clashing with one man's view of sport as masculine imperative. Nice. The creators seem here to have gone back no further than The Running Man for thematic inspiration. Sport is once again just more entertainment junk food for an audience too numbed by mediocrity to put up a fight. It's an equally cynical viewpoint, just a less sophisticated one. There is thematic synergy in the fact that the movie itself is as cynical, derivative, unimaginative and lowbrow as the thing it is portraying. Points for that, if unintended.\n\nThe directorial choices by John McTiernan, as pointed out by other reviewers, are indeed unfortunate. The overuse of night goggle POV is just one example. Note however that in the early 2000s, tech-eye viewpoint shots were being overused everywhere. I objected to this particular cinematographic gimmick less than I did the inescapable Dutch angle shots in Battlefield Earth. This is hardly a ringing endorsement, but we are grading on a curve here.\n\nThe failure to inspire a sense of threat during the matches is also a clear weakness. Minor league hockey in Slap Shot comes off as more violent, and that was played for laughs! That Rollerball's appeal is founded on bloodlust is hard to sell when the hitting in the game is at the level of senior league flag football.\n\nOf most interest in this movie is the amazing Chris Klein. Like donut hole, he is defined only by what is around him, as has no substance of his own. In a two-shot with a sock puppet, a viewer's eye would be drawn inevitably to the latter. I know this from The Election, when I honestly could not keep my eyes on him, even when the only other thing to look at was the utterly colourless Matthew Broderick. The fact that Hollywood had enough roles for vapid pretty boys lying around to provide Chris with even a brief career is curious and perhaps a little terrifying. Here, of course, he is woefully miscast as a human with a personality - a thrill-a-minute thrill-seeker just looking for a few thrills. (He reminded me of Jimmy Stewart in his Oscar winning role in The Philadelphia Story, in that they are of similar height.) If his character has a setting beyond this default, I must have blinked and missed it. Chris Klein is, in short, a major drag on an otherwise capable cast phoning in performances that they would be keeping off their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nAs bad as the Rollerball remake is, I cannot bring myself to hate on it as much as Jaws the Revenge, Ghostbusters 2016, European Vacation, or some of the thousands of other remakes, reboots and sequels nobody wanted or requested. It's a lame cash grab to be sure. At least there was no role for Rob Schneider."

It's filled with jump cuts, Dutch angles, camera flips, and a bunch of baffling edits to the point that you can't see what's happening. The action sequences and direction are shockingly terrible. It's puzzling to me that John McTiernan, who directed Die Hard (and the underrated Die Hard: With a Vengeance), Predator, and The Hunt for Red October, can direct action sequences (and this film in general) so horribly. Also, if he didn't go to federal prison, I wouldn't believe it was him in the director's chair and not someone else. The acting is abysmal, especially Chris Klein, who has the charisma of molded bread. At least Jean Reno was having fun though. The soundtrack...you know it's going to be bad when Godsmack is going to be on there. If you're a fan of the original, just watch that instead. This is unwatchable on every level. You can tell no one cared when making this especially when involved filmmakers who couldn't trust each other to the point that they started to wiretap each other over a disagreement.

This movie made no sense at all and the direction was all messed up. The camera wouldn't stop moving in 80 different directions and it made me sick. I hope this wins every Razzie award in 2003. PLEASE!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! and do not rent it. Not even an appearance from one of my favorite bands (slipknot) could save this horrible disgrace. For those who bought it I hope you know that you have bought an expensive coaster. FINAL VERDICT: 0/10"

Chris Klein and LL Cool J both find themselves stuck in another loser of a movie where they both try their best to make something out of their parts that seem wholly miscast. Stamos, however, has the thankless job of being saddled with a love interest role that any actress should be embarrassed to portray. Fault of this movie sould not lie solely with director John McTirenan as he isn't working from the greatest source material in the world. Hey, look at Rob Reiner. He had \"North\" that he had to bounce back from."

It's a good debate. I don't have a problem with Roger Ebert. Sure he's a critic. I usually agree with him when he gives em thumbs up. But not thumbs down. Leonard Malten (sp??) I do happen to have a problem with. He's rather stuck up in my opinion. But indeed. I can't get angry with people I disagree with. I'm still reeling from the cancelation of Politically Incorrect. I was usually in disagreement with Bill, but he created a great debate.\n\nSo onto this movie. I didn't think a movie could be this bad considering it's a remake. Oh but it isn't. It ripped the name off. The Get Carter movies are more comparable than this.\n\nLet's get started: 1. The ring is too small. 2. oops it wasn't a ring. 3. there is no direction in this movie. 4. Jean Reno made a fool of himself in the movie. 5. Topless women doesn't prove anything. 6. this was no vision. 7. the rules are confusing. 8. hell the movie is confusing. 9. Where's my mommy? 10. there's not a single character that was in the original. Jonathon E. Became Jonathon Cross. 11. The gloves aren't deadly. 12. There's no character development. and finally 13. The story has nothing to do with the game. o_O\n\nWith the original... it was the future. 2018. The lead star Johnny E was in the game for what? 10 years. This Cross idiot was here for 4 months. That and it's 2005. Indiana Jones 4 will be out by then.\n\nThe original movie has great design. Was more arena like. And didn't look like WWE style. The original had to do with a corporate world with no wars. People couldn't remember the past. They had no books.\n\nThis movie is about what happens with that very corporate world gets there hands on creating another Rollerball. And utterly destroys the very meaning of the first movie.\n\nSo if your pro Microsoft. Pro biz. Pro violence. Yahoo for you. But if you loved the original because it was anti violence. Stay the hell away.\n\n3/10\n\nQuality: 1/10 Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 0.1/10"

Don't go view one of those crappy war movies like Black Hawk Down, you should go see a movie of originality and quality plot. Yes my friends I am talking about the one and only, Rollerball. If you like action and retards whizzing by on their rollerblades dressed like Mardi Gras circus goblins, then go see this movie! Ah yes it too has a great story line behind all of the great acting and stunts. Although the plot is hidden beneath a mesh woven skating parade of s***heads, it is quite an elaborate one. It starts off in a random point in time, with people street luging and some on motorcycles presumably in San Francisco. Why San Francisco you ask? Just think about what SF is best known for! Anyways, then it progresses to unknown countries and places with the starts of the team \"red horsemen,\" despite having women on the team. Nothing really exciting happens but the tricky camera angles and techniques like \"night mode\" make this film outstanding in boldness and visual majesty. Watch out! You could be hit with the \"Rollerball,\" or pushed over, or hit with a motorcycle in a very small arena painted like an elementary school mural. But I give this movie some credit; there are some major actors in this fecally produced movie, also some all right action scenes. There is only one thing that saved this movie from me burning the theatre down, and that was Paul Heyman. Commenting in the movie with numerous brilliant lines like, \"was that supposed to happen?\" and \"that was a hit!\" As you can see from these high quality and very intelligent words from his mouth, Paul Heyman is the savior and best actor in the thriller, \"Rollerball.\""

The \"owner\" who has much, much financial incentive to keep this game going turns unexpicably maniacal in the climactic scene. He didn't get to be who he was by being that nuts, such that he gloats over the killing of the goose (the game) who would otherwise be dropping golden eggs for him. Small things: two people, travelling together from point A to point B. How do they get there? one drives a car, the other a motorcycle. Why did they not go together in one vehicle? So the car can be torched by an angry mob at point B. So they brought the motorcycle to get back to point A, I guess. Other small thing: High Greek Orthodox priest happily arrives in what is WWF type entertainment, and acts pleased to be in owner's box? Why? So he could walk out in disgust as things fall apart, to show us that what the owner staged is a bad thing.\n\nFilm assumes audience is very, very dumb.\n\nJust looked at grosses. The original (made 25 years before the remake) outgrossed the remake, with 1975 dollars. I guess the audiences weren't so dumb to attend this bad film."

Having just viewed the R-rated DVD I can honestly say there is no aspect of this film that is not stunningly bad.\n\nMcTiernan seems to be attempting some sort of convoluted style that actively gets in the way of storytelling. Don't get me wrong here - there really isn't a story to get in the way of (Rollerball being the worst excuse of a film to merely be a few big action sequences spliced together since Mission Impossible). The camera work and editing are the worst elements of the film. The cameras in the rollerball arena are very static and never really draw the viewer into the action. Every dialog scene has some distracting jump cut within it. It's highly distracting and does more to bring the viewer out of the film rather than draw him in. McTiernan also uses footage of semi-dressed athletes that looks like stock footage from deodorant commercials to transition between scenes. Very few elements of the film don't beg the question \"what were they thinking?\" Perhaps the greatest beggar of them all is the scene presented entirely with a green night-vision effect. The effect isn't used because the scene is from the perspective of a character wearing night-vision goggles. It really just brings up more questions for which there are no answers. Am I in the scene? Did I just put on night-vision goggles? Why wasn't I wearing sunglasses during the opening sequence? Or a helmet? If the film hadn't been so bad up until this point, I would have checked the settings on my television to see what had gone wrong. All that had gone wrong was that I had rented this terrible movie.\n\nEven the stars have nothing good to say about the film. The audio commentary on the DVD provided by Chris Klein, LL Cool J and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is frequently silent. I'm sure they're invoking the \"If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\" rule from childhood. The only time they can muster much excitement is in regard to driving the Shelby Cobra and other vehicles used in the film.\n\nThe film purports to be a cautionary tale about violent entertainment and the greedy global corporations who put their profit ahead of their employee's well being, but the extremely violent ending of this film released by multinational MGM in which many stars risked injury doing their stunts (\"I had a stunt where I had to jump a ramp and save a young lady whose motorcycle was on fire,\" says LL Cool J, \"I pulled her off her bike, but when she let go, the handlebars hooked onto the spur of my boot. So here I am riding with a burning motorcycle hanging off my leg. It was crazy.\") renders the message moot. This may be the greatest on-screen irony since Kenneth Branagh delivered Hamlet's advice to the players sawing the air with his hand and splitting the ears of groundlings.\n\nMy advice to those interested in seeing this film: move along, there's nothing to see here."

But...well to start with, Chris Kline is a laughable Keannu Reeves wannabe. The movie itself is a Fast and the Furious wannabe. While I thought the latter was great, this movie...well, err...is not. As the movie progressed my patience slowly regressed, and I was happy when it was over. So, this kid Kline is a street luger (is that spelled right?), a potential hockey superstar, the greatest rollerballer ever, and a natural jackass. what can't he do??? Well, act is one thing. Quite funny how he seems like he never knows what's going on. And the ending is very bad. If you've seen it, than you can understand that by doing what he did, he lowered his standards to the \"tyrant's\" level, and is no better than the rich owners that controlled him. He went out to stop the violence, and caused an extremely violent, bloody riot in the process complete with fighting audience members, overturned cars, and setting fires. The only thing this movie had going for it was the previews, which offered Resident Evil and The Time Machine. Stay away, from this one, it is poorly made, strayes in all kinds of directions, and is hard to watch. 2/10 stars."

        "review_detailed_main": "To preface this, I am a huge John McTiernan fan. Predator ranks right behind Aliens, in my opinion as the best Sci-Fi action movie ever. Die Hard invented a whole genre of film unto itself. Remember Die Hard on a plane? Passenger 57. Die Hard on a boat? Under Siege.\n\nHunt for Red October was hailed as the best sub movie since Das Boot. Still is in my opinion. Thomas Crown Affair was better then the original. I hear the first cut of 13th Warrior was outstanding (Michael Crichton re-shot and re-edited much of McTiernan's original film). Die Hard: With a Vengeance was a masterful sequel.\n\nPersonally, I like Medicine Man, but I can see why a lot of people did not. The Last Action Hero had a horrible story, but it was well directed.\n\nRollerball, much like Last Action Hero, was also a horrible story. The difference was McTiernan's direction was absolutely rancid. The editing was amateurish. The music was mundane. And the direction was awful, oh wait, I already said that.\n\nThe plot involves a wayward amateur athlete in the 'States hoping to get his break. He does in the form of a childish sport involving roller blades, motorcycles, steel balls and viewer ratings. For some reason he gets paid lots of money, but when a dimwitted teammate gets creamed upside the head with one of the afore mentioned steel balls, he suddenly develops a conscious, after all he's only making \"100 times more\" than his teammates. Why would he care if one gets knocked off?\n\nWhat follows is a terrible story that tries to involve the audience on some pseudo-political level, but never even gets close. Jean Reno plays the owner of, apparently, not only the central team, but the league as a whole. LL Cool J plays a throw away part as Chris Klein's best friend. And Rebecca Romjin Stamos plays Chris' teammate/love interest. We don't care about any of the characters, they're never fleshed out. And they're doing something so childish, that even if they were, we still wouldn't care.\n\nThe direction is so terrible, that it looks like it was edited on someone's home computer by an inept amateur. There are silly things like an entire night scene that is shot with a green tint. I assume that this is supposed to give me the feeling that I'm watching this through night vision goggles. Basically it made me want to fall asleep. Later on in the same scene two vehicles bust through a wire fence and there is a, I'm not kidding here, \"sproing\" sound. Much like the sound one would hear in a Wiley Coyote cartoon. Both vehicles make this sound. That basically describes the whole movie. You sit back, scratch your head and say, \"did I just see that? And if I did, that was terrible.\"\n\nI can't say the entire movie was awful, the opening race through San Francisco had McTiernan's usual flare and panache. An ensuing car chase scene through some dirt roads in the Ukraine wasn't bad either. But the rest can be flushed right down the commode.\n\n3 out of 10 stars. D+"

Other than the great Jean Reno, (whom I now pity for being in this movie) I was left wondering where the hell the actors and actresses were. I couldn't find any. Did anyone else? The editing was terrible and the \"Blair Witch\" cameraman did a better job showing us what was going on. The supposed \"action\" scenes were extremely tough to follow and frustrating. Four minutes of night vision didn't help either. The cartoony BOING! of going through a fence got me laughing, as did the supposed speed of 120 MPH as we see the road passing underneath them at about 30. And how about that fight at the end? Wow... that was about as exciting as watching grass grow. When it was all over, I was amazed that it was only an hour and a half long. The ever so slight glimmer of hope of Slipknot's performance was quickly dashed by more bad acting and editing. I'm tempted to take the DVD back to the rental store and demand a refund. If nothing else, tell them to pull the copies of this abomination from their shelves to save business. giving myself a root canal while being held over hot coals with gremlins twisting corkscrews into my feet would have been more entertaining.

I don't think I have to touch on the specifics of Rollerball being awful. I think Ebert said it best when he called Rollerball \"...an incoherent mess...\" So I guess what boggles me, because bad movies are inevidable, is why actors choose such horrid roles. It makes we wonder what kind of dirt MGM has on Chris Klein that they would have the means to force him into this movie. I am by no means defending Klein as an actor, he makes me want to punch myself in the face with a brick. My question is, why make bad movies when there are so many good movies to be made? Why remake a movie that wasn't that good to begin with? Might as well just remake \"Solarbabies\", it had skating in it, but for some reason it was much better."

        "review_title": "John McTiernan faceplants hard",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm not sure I've ever seen a talented director faceplant as hard as John McTiernan does here. This goes beyond bad story choices, performances, and unfortunate effects. There's an amateurishness pervasive through this film that makes it feel like the first film of a film student given too much money rather than the tenth film in a career that includes The Hunt for Red October. This is an embarrassment. McTiernan should have removed his name from the movie and attributed it to Alan Smithee.\n\nReading a bit about the film afterwards, I found information that the original script of this remake was actually really well received. It was sometimes called superior to the script to the original Norman Jewison film. However, McTiernan didn't like the social commentary aspects of the script and completely rewrote it with an emphasis on action. Well, that was certainly a mistake. He most assuredly did get rid of the social commentary with any potency, but the fact remains that the shell of the movie that remains feels like it requires social commentary. It doesn't surprise me that McTiernan would be uninterested in social commentary considering his filmography. The only movie that came close was Medicine Man, and that was mostly a selection of a topic rather than a serious attempt at digging into a topical issue.\n\nWhat was left is, well, awful. Starting with the action, the supposed raison-de-etre of the film, it's pretty much incomprehensible. I think the problem may have been the set itself. There's a rink of a sort where the titular sport is played. From afar it looks big, but when you start picking out the details you realize that there's shockingly little room for a camera rig to move, especially with the two small towers at the center. It's an extreme limitation on the ability of the cameraman to actually capture action, preventing him from pulling back to film the movement of the sport in any sort of exciting way. The sport itself is supposed to be some kind of hard hitting action slugfest, but that sort of thing is hard to film from far away and sell convincingly to the camera without actually hurting someone. So, in order to convince the audience that the hits are hard, you have to go in close to do some in camera trickery that makes it look like the hits are hard, and the set is really small and has a lot going on (about ten people on rollerblades with at least two motorcycles at one time). I imagine they thought the set was big enough until they actually got onto it with a camera. I can imagine the panic that must have set in as everyone realized that the reason this movie existed wasn't going to deliver well.\n\nUsually, though, it's not just action scenes that drive movies, it's the drama as well. What about that? I mean, there are actors spouting dialogue that seems to have something to do with each successive scene. I guess. Jonathan Cross is a guy who races down hills in San Francisco in grungy outfits, gets picked up by his friend in a Porsche in the middle of a race, and told that he can make big money playing in the Rollerball league. Except that the movie makes a point later to say that nobodies make no money and only a couple of marquee names make money. So...how is this grungy guy racing down hills the marquee name? I mean, I guess there's someone filming him as he does it, but it's never shown that the handheld video that gets destroyed in the chase is making him a name in the world of extreme sports.\n\nAnyway, we skip ahead a bunch of time and we're in the middle of the season, and the league has finally decided that it's going to jack its ratings up by causing bodily harm to its players...in a game that includes metal balls flying at dangerous speeds and motorcycles driving amidst people on rollerblades. I mean...I guess? That's supposed to be the moral quandary of the film, but the characters are all so thin, poorly written, and barely sentient that when they start making the connection, we're wondering why it took them so long to figure it out.\n\nThe absolute nadir of the film, though, is the green sequence. Rollerball, much like The 13th Warrior, had a disastrous test screening and went through massive reshoots, except that McTiernan actually helmed them this time. One of the scenes they had to reshoot completely was a nighttime chase through the Arabian desert on a motorcycle. They filmed it too dark originally, and then they screwed up the reshoots by not allocating enough money to do nightshoots right. So, they tinted everything green like it's night vision or a silent movie from the 1920s. It also looks like it was filmed on video instead of actual film. It looks really cheap, and, to make matters worse, there are random cartoon sound effects peppered throughout as though the sound editor had simply given up and was trying to screw with the production.\n\nThe plot resolves with violence and no one cares because it's all stupid. Hell, the very last moments of the film feel like the editor joined the sound guy in giving up and just stopped the movie.\n\nI'll say it again, but Rollerball is an embarrassment. John McTiernan should feel bad for loosing this upon the world. It's flatly acted (except by Jean Reno as the owner who's just having a ball), flatly filmed (when it's not embarrassingly filmed), confusingly told (no except, it's always confusing), and rather painful to sit through. I hated this movie."

But this film is a complete disaster! The so called story involves the cruel gladiator-like sport of the original film, but fails to even begin to hint at the multi-layered social commentary of its predecessor. Instead you get loads of rah-rah-machismo and an uninspired, humorless and boring storyboard that makes the 90 minutes of the film feel like an eternity. The camera work is a major embarrassment too: fervent cutting doesn't allow you to actually see anything and the whole thing plays like an MTV-clip from hell. Oh yeah, and star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos runs around topless a lot, but without a proper context \"it didn't get me excited, it just made me feel mean\", as the song goes..."

They took the elements of the origional rollerball and rather then updating the special effects and cinematography and making the story more relevent to the world today (rather then the 70's) they choose to make it a showcase of everything that is bad with modern films.\n\nThe changes in the story from the origional were terrible, especially replacing the end with this considerably more tacky one. The special effects were highly poor, and the cinematography was a joke with little of the action being able to be made out. The film became a band wagon for any \"actor\" that wanted to boost their waining career and there were far too many attepts at being \"clever\" and \"arty\" that simply back fired and made the production into more of a joke. The idea to shoot a scene in night vision was just painful, and the final action sequence was so terrible (including a scene where a small stool is used to block the blast from a shotgun and ultimately defeat the big baddie) you just keep hoping the film will end quicker. It is impossible to care what happens to any of the characters in the film because they are so shallow and lifeless and the plot itself in it's entire depth could be summed up on the back of a relatively small stamp.\n\nThere is not much else that can be said, the user ratings speak for themselves and I'm not sure I've ever seen a film (with this many votes) with such a low weighted average rating. Really in most cases if someone says a film is bad and your tempted to watch it your best off making your own mind up, but with this, well, you can trust the (when I last checked) 1337 people that gave this film a \"1\" vote. It's also ranked, on last check, as IMDB's 39th worst movie of all time and only a handful of the films considered worse have more user votes then this (Battlefield Earth being the most notable, lol).\n\nSo really, just don't bother. If you haven't seen the origional cult classic, watch that instead, because that is a good film and this really isn't. You can follow the action in that, the characters draw you in and the ending is great. This film is a pale shadow of the 70's classic. If you have seen the origional, then trust me when I say you'll be even more disapointed with this remake."

On the whole a visual nightmare. A far cry from the McTiernan of the late '80s who we came to trust for a decent action flick. But, no point in drudging up the past or the plot for that matter...was there one? Still, in all fairness a solid believable story is not what we want from a movie like this, but at least give us something coherent.

        "review_detailed_main": "Set in the near future (possibly the early 2000s lol), our film begins with Jonathan (Chris Klein) accepting a dangerous dare which leads to him being hunted by police within the city. While on the run from the police Jonathan bumps into an old friend who just happens to be in the right place at the right time. His friend Marcus (Played by LL Cool J) suggests now is the time to do something better in life and suggests Jonathan joins him by his side on the \"Rollerball \"team. Naturally with the police trying to hunt Jonathan down he decides to escape the city and run away from the police by accepting his friend's offer, becoming a professional player in \"Rollerball\". While participating in the world's most watched and dangerous game, Jonathan suspects foul play from the hierarchy above. He believes that someone is setting up players in his team to get injured, or, worse, die which would result in boosting both television ratings and larger bets from people among the crowd.\n\nOne of my biggest surprises while watching the start of this film was that there was no character setup (seriously none). From the get go all the introduction (Jonathan accepting a bet and suddenly bumping into his old friend at just the right time) is so far fetched and along with that, there is zero reason to care for any leading character because of the lack of setup. After the introduction, the film continues to ignore any element of character development and jumps straight into a round of Rollerball with our leading cast.\n\nLet's talk about Rollerball as a game. There are two teams in which the players are all on rollerblades. A metal ball drops and the teams are required to collect the ball, go around a specific path and then dunk the ball into a goal. The arena for Rollerball is also filled with Rock N' Roll music and an audience making large bets. It's boring. While the film is able to explain the workings and rules of Rollerball, when it's actually game time in the movie... as a viewer it is truly impossible to follow. When a game of Rollerball is in motion the filming style is full of close ups. The Rollerball sequences in the film also go for a lengthy duration. When the viewer can't follow what's going on it's a painful experience to watch lengthy sequences and uninteresting. Not to mention the spoon-feeding of information by the commentators that's also over used here.\n\nAs a plot, it's incredibly thin, but it also takes a long time to get going. It takes at least 30 mins until any type of developed plot surfaces. The outcomes are predictable and the plot speaks down to its audience as if we will never guess who the bad guy is. Villains are also childish and silly.\n\nTo give the film some credit I actually liked the way Rollerball looks. The arena itself and some of the costume design work is probably the one and only major element I find enjoyable within this remake. Nudity in certain scenes is unnecessary and one scene in particular chooses to use a \"Night Vision effect\" which doesn't hold up on the Blu-ray.\n\nSupporting actors such as Jean Reno & LL Cool J are incredibly way over the top and give a confident yet dissatisfying performance. Actress Rebecca Romijn is flat and serves no real purpose to the film other than to give our leading man a love interest and a purpose to fight on.\n\nOverall, I'm shocked. Quite possibly one of the worst remakes I have ever seen in film history. With uninteresting characters and a thin (yet predictable) plot, Rollerball's excitement fizzles rather quickly. The game itself is hard to follow due to excessive close ups. And to think, this film was directed by John McTiernan. He's the man and legend who gave us the greatest Christmas film ever made: Die Hard (1988). In the end, we're all human and make mistakes in life. If you decide to watch this film you just made one of them.\n\n1.1/10 Walkden Entertainment"

The cast look confused as to where their coming from, rightfully so as we are never really told as the audience either. The editing style doesn't suit the film. The uneven cuts are (I assume) meant to add an element of speed/intensity, instead they just look like dodgy editing.

And this is possibly the only movie I've ever seen where I actually heard comments on how bad the editing was, during the movie. `Oh that was bad.' `Who edited this?' `Can you believe how jumpy that was?'\n\nOn the positive side: The movie did point out that the driving force for almost everyone involved with the `game' was the love of money. That was a believable motive for most of the characters. Also not take place in the US or Canada, made a little easier to swallow the idea of how popular this game was suppose to be.\n\nThe actual game: Think WWF meets hockey with a motorcycle and roller blades."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is difficult to write this review, as the experience of viewing \"Rollerball\" has destroyed my ability to form complete thoughts and express myself using words and sentences. Perhaps this should be a warning to anyone that is thinking of going out and seeing this film, but I would have to say that this moviegoing experience has given me more respect for the craft of filmmaking. No matter how bad I thought any movie I had ever seen in the past was at the time, I now realize that the film projected onto the screen during those viewings could have been replaced by the film under the heading \"Rollerball\". I now have more respect for anyone who did not, in anyway, participate in the making of this film. I also have more respect for films that did not fail in the ways\n\nWatching this movie approximates doing acid. If you have never done acid, and do not wish to try, you can watch this movie to assimilate the effects that the substance does to the human brain.\n\nRollerBall is a game that takes place in the future...way, way in the future...all the way in the year 2005. Chris Klein plays Jonathan Cross, or, as his many fans in Southeast Asia would refer to him, \"Jon-a-ton\". Jonathan was at one time considered to be the \"Next Wayne Gretsky\", which I find to be quite incredible since he had refused to play professional hockey LL Cool J plays Marcus Ridley Jean Reno plays the villain, Petrovich Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays the part of Aurora, or as the fans know her, the \"Black Widow\" Half the time, there was never a ball in place. Another amazing fact is that there never was a score shown.\n\nI think this movie has the greatest example of unintentional Dadaist scriptwriting that has ever been done. This film was a fantastic combination of nonsensical dialogue, pl\n\nI think everyone that has any respect for the craft of filmmaking should go see this movie as soon as possible. Note that, only two weeks after the film was originally released wide into several thousand theaters, it is nearly impossible to find a theater that is still showing this film. I found that there were only two showings of this film in the entire city of Indianapolis that could be viewed. At one theater, it only played at 4 o'clock, while we see it at a different theater, where there was only one 9 o'clock showing. If you don't see this film now, you may have to wait until the film comes out on video, which would be a complete travesty. The full experience of realizing the horror of this travesty can only truly come to life on the big screen, and any disgust this movie would cause watched in the context of a 20-odd inch screen would be filtered. You owe it to yourself to see how corrupt and ill-managed the Hollywood system truly is, and you must realize that a film this horrendous was made to go on the big screen. This garbage was made with the idea that it would gross more than it cost to make, which was, quite embarassingly, an excess of 80 million dollars. Think about it. 80 million dollars. An amount of money that could have been used to build a much larger studio at MGM. An amount of money that could have been used to finance 80 small 1-million dollar budget films based on good independently written screenplays. Heck, an amount that would be much better given to charities to feed hungry people. Do you have any idea how many people 80 million dollars could feed? The fact that this mass of money, the majority of which will never be made back and is simply gone forever, was used for the soul purpose to create \"Rollerball\" sets a new low for the studio system. The very fact that producers at MGM thought that mainstream audiences would go for this trash makes me pessimistic in the Hollywood system, while the fact that audiences were smart enough to stay away from it gives me optimistic for the integrity of humanity. There is no reason for this film to exist. The fact that a major film studio would spend so much money on a film this bad shows that there is something wrong with the way the system works now. Wake up, Hollywood, wake up. 1/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "ROLLERBALL / (2002) F\n\nBy Wes Alexander\n\nROLLERBALL is a laughably awful film. It is filled with ridiculous dialogue, ludicrous situations, and some of the worst acting this side of Keanu Reeves.\n\nIn case you were wondering, Rollerball is a sport. A stupid sport at that. It is where the players all skate (or motorcycle) around a giant figure eight that has ramps and obstacles in the way. The point of the game is to through a small, metal ball up against a gong to score a point. When you hit the gong sparks fly out like it was the Forth of July or something. Chris Klein stars as Jonathon Cross. He's a risk taker. In the opening scene we see him loge-ing down a city street for fun. He dodges cars and truck, but the only real thing you can see are quick glimpses and loud horn honking. The camera shots are so difficult to see, that all we get are glimpses and loud noises throughout the entire movie. His best friend Marcus Ripley (LL Cool J) informs him about Rollerball. Jonathon says that is not interested, but inevitably, four months later, joins the team and becomes the most popular player. Along with his on and off again girlfriend Aurora (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), him and Marcus become the best at the sport. The owner of Rollerball, Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno) doesn't care about the safety of the players, but about the ratings. Thus, we get a sinister plot to kill the members of the Rollerball team and get high ratings so he can have a cable show.\n\nI mean, this is this guy's motive? High ratings? Jeez, come on. How pathetic is this? This plot had me rolling in the aisles. In fact, every stupid line of dialogue had me break out in hysterics. As I said, it's laughably awful. But nothing comes close to beating the nighttime scene shot in night vision. I guess this was added to create an effect. All it creates is the sense that they shot it on someone's personal camera. And a cheap one at that. The green tint of the screen is not only distracting, it's annoying.\n\nAnd the acting! Whew! Chris Klein says his dialogue like he's reading the script for the very first time. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's character is from another country (I didn't care to find out which one) and her accent comes and goes. She sounds American one minute, then is completely not understandable the next. LL Cool J plays the ultra-cool guy who gets all the money and the girls. Now, normally I like LL, but his performance feels plastic and forced. Jean Reno must have gotten conned into this. I know he can act. I've seen him act. But in ROLLERBALL, he obviously isn't trying. It was probably just a favor he owed somebody.\n\nWhen we actually get to see the Rollerball being played it arrives with aggressiveness and is marked by boldness. The speakers roar and the theater shakes. And then everyone in the audience gets a headache. Do you think they could have toned it down about one or seven notches?\n\nROLLERBALL may not be as bad as this year's other early \"Worst Movie of Year\" contender, KUNG POW, but it's pretty darn close. And that's too close for comfort."

It's depicted like a rough Ice Hockey game gone too far. It also addresses some serious social issues. I like the combination of music with action too.\n\nIt's certainly no blockbuster, but if these elements appeal to you, give it a shot. I think I own one of the 65 DVDs that were purchased nationally and it was worth it to me. :-)"

Hollywood's system of rehashing every book, movie and TV show they can think of continues with Rollerball, a remake of the 1975 James Caan film. Of course, what the fairly good original had in a well-scripted plot and interesting allegory to corporate power and American bloodlust, the remake tries to make up for in bombastic music, lots o' blood, and MTV-style editing. My biggest gripe with this film, though, is the way they diced up the scenes of the Rollerball tracks to the point where you can't tell what the hell is going on; the original, at least, made the game and its rules clear. I wasn't expecting much when I went to see this mess, so I was shocked when it went below my expectations. I didn't even feel any testosterone-fueled adrenaline at the finale.\n\nOkay, I'm spending way too much time on this review. Just do yourself a favor and rent the original.

Literally the one positive thing I can think to say is that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos takes her clothes off once or twice. I'm not joking. That is as good as this movie gets.\n\nWhile there are dozens of things wrong with Rollerball, it's the editing that sinks it. The movie seems edited in an amphetamine-induced haze without regard to performance, plot or coherence. It is very hard to tell what is going on from one-second to the next.\n\nAnother problem is the leading man. The hero is a young American hockey player. He is an extreme sports fanatic who journeys to Russia and becomes a star player in the brutal new sport of \"rollerball.\" He soon finds out that \"All Is Not What It Seems\u0099\" and has to fight for his life. The rollerball league functions like a futuristic French Foreign Legion so the hero becomes first among a brutal, subhuman pack of desperate characters. The character has to be tough, dripping with testosterone. Vin Diesel should have been a shoe-in. Instead they cast Chris Klein. Sweet, young, apple-cheeked Chris Klein. Young Chris doesn't look rough enough to watch the sport without his mommy much head the league in broken limbs. This is not a question of acting talent. This is a question of sheer physical believability. You wouldn't cast Michael Jordan as a jockey. Seeing the other actors relate to the affable Klein as if he were a berserk Klingon pushes the movie towards parody.\n\nThe other actors seem to be doing what they can but it's really very hard to tell what they are up to because of the terrible editing. There are times when the actors are cut off in mid-word! \"Hacked up\" doesn't begin to cover the effect. The person who bears the brunt of the editor's depravations is that most French of actors Jean Reno. Here he plays a Russian and between the editing and accent, his part is all but unintelligible\n\nSometimes cinematography can save a movie. Not Rollerball, however. When the images aren't pumped up and jarring they are dark and dreary. An entire sequence is shot in the grainy-green style of night-vision goggles. As nobody in the film is wearing goggles at this point one would assume that the director just liked the style. It may be cool but it's exceedingly hard to take for any length of time. Here you have around four minutes during which you witness major events through a muddy green fog.\n\nSuffice it to say Rollerball should never have been released, not even direct-to-video. Honestly, you wander away from the experience wondering what caused the disaster. Quite a bit of thought and money obviously went into the film and John McTiernan is an action director of considerable talent. It should at least been an enjoyable time-waster. Instead it fails at every level. Recommend Rollerball to your worst enemy. You'll be glad you did."

In my opinion I think hes a good actor and played the part very well. The Other Roleplayers such as LL,Reno and Stamos did a fine job as well. Movie was weird @ times and not great especially when their getting chased trying 2 leave the country, but it still thought was good and the ending was great with Kleins fight scene when they tried 2 have him killed.

The film is no longer about the future, but about extreme sports, and that's where it got lost in the depths. And if at least it turned out to be a solid action movie, but unfortunately it's not even that. Which is actually a big mystery because the director is John McTiernan, one of the greatest action directors in history. The film has a very bad edit, conversations, characters, plot, the point itself is not clear to me either. As if it was made by amateurs and some beginners. He would not even mention the actors. There are some controversies surrounding the film, but I don't want to waste time on that at all. Bypass viewing in a wide arc.

The plot is given no date, one could assume it happened 20 years ago, and it appears the old Soviet Union is still alive and kicking although the movie is supposed to be set in the future. The whole point of the movie (or at least the original) is supposed to be about individuality, happiness, and control. Forget about any of that because it's not in the movie. In fact, the entire movie would seem to suggest \"if it feels good, do it\" and \"follow the crowd and you get these nice cars and women\". The movie even ends on a ridiculous quote about having sex - it seems the writers didn't care about a moral or even writing a story.\n\nOne might assume that since there is no plot it must be all action? Yes, it is action and No, it's not good. You know the action is going to be poor when the players come out in ridiculous costumes and helmets that look like bears or cats - at least the original version took itself seriously. Don't try to keep track of the action either - the track is so badly put together it is impossible. With the original version you could keep track of the action, but with this version all you see it motorcycles and people flying and hitting each other.\n\nIts a real shame what this remake did to the name of Rollerball. I highly recommend you see the original if you want to know what the plot and action is really supposed to be like. One might note that the very thing this movie is SUPPOSED to go against is the very thing it relies on for its success."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rollerball was a classic film from 1975 that has its fair share of good and bad reviews, but what set it apart was its social commentary, which showed a dystopian future where corporations take over everything, with one trying to get the main hero killed because his refusal to retire threatens the purpose of the sport according to one businessman. This remake basically removes it because the director thought it would be boring, changed the setting to present day, and focused more on action, which ends up being its main flaw. Not even Paul Heyman as one of the announcers and cameos from Shane McMahon and the band Slipknot can save this mess. The only reason I give this two stars is for the soundtrack (with awesome bands like P.O.D. and Godsmack), but the acting is bad, the action is too much the focus, and you know it's bad when the director of this garbage remake is sent to prison for a year for making false statements to FBI investigators about his role in the Anthony Pellicano wiretapping scandal (where he hired the detective to wiretap the producer due to disagreements), and this remake is one to avoid in favor of the original."

This and the horrible actor choices. Chris Klein?? Really?? WHY the American Pie actor??\n\nHave these people ever even seen the 1975 masterpiece? I don't think so. The budget on 1975 Rollerball was 5-6M$ which would be about 33M$ today.\n\nThe 2002 Rollerball budget was 70M$ more that twice that of the 1975 film (in 2002 dollars) They completely missed the mark. The raw brutality and corporate world domination and futuristic dystopia turned into pointless drivel. Someone should have been fired and the direction of this film corrected. Sometimes a film is plagued with bad luck. I'm wondering if this was the case here. Exorcist II: The Heretic was one of those films. I've talked to people that worked on that film and asked them if they couldn't see how badly this film was going as they were making it. They said that there were so many s storms (like locusts getting loose and dying) and also that when following a great film, people think that they don't have to try as hard because of the previous film, but that was a sequel. This film is 27 years later, basically a clean slate. The people going to see this film have either never seen the 1975 version or they are part of the small cult following that loved it. In 2002 (Lord of the Rings Two Towers, Chicago, The Pianist) Some amazing films were being made. Why did they go thriller instead of edgy? This was a HUGE gamble that was horribly conceived and horribly executed and they paid big time with losses at the box office.\n\nHow did they not see this coming? With a 70M$ budget, sometimes you're just happy to be working. I'm sure everyone took home a HUGE paycheck, they haphazardly threw the spaghetti on the wall and it didn't stick. No one wants to have their name on a horrible film but like I said sometimes you're just happy to be working."

        "review_detailed_main": "Rollerball is without any doubt a bad movie. Especially getting through the first 30 - 45 minutes will strain ones patience (and taste). It gets somewhat better when Jonathan tries to escape - here (or rather in the aftermath of the attempt) at least some effort is made to give the audience a little inside into the characters.\n\nJean Reno is the only actor in this movie who can really act. Unfortunately he is not given much chance to do so - the only time he can really do something is once again the aftermath of the escape.\n\nEric Serra usually is a good sign (some people would disagree, but IMHO he has never turned out a bad score while composing several exceptionally good ones), but here it takes him a long time, to find the mood. The music in the first 30 minutes consists solely of rock music; only in the end one gets to hear the classic Serra drums and synths.\n\nAll in all I was expecting much worse after reading all the reviews - but nonetheless, all the time invested in making this film would have been better put somewhere else. (4/10)"

The performances were good enough. The action and sport sequences were top of the line, which gave some points to the movie. The scenes are pretty brutal and violent, and the ending is good. Take that Jean Reno and that guy who did that thing that I don't know his name of!\n\nOverall the movie was good, yet stupid. Rating 7 out of 10."

Actually it's one of the best movies from 2002.\n\nRight now it's one of IMDb.com 100 worst movies ever. After seeing it would you really say it belongs to the 100 worst movies ever made?

It is bloody and brutal. The costumes of the sports teams are cheesy and weird. The plot is good. The soundtrack is heavy metal rock that is good. If your looking for a mindless action movie.
