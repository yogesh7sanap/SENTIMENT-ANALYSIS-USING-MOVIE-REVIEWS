It would have been more interesting if they showed more of how the legend started, but they had a good idea to go with. What really didn't work for this movie was showing La Llorona too many times, to the point that she wasn't scary. What's always creepy in movies like this is not being able to see their face until the very end, which they had a perfect scene to show her, but by then it was too late.\n\nIf you like the Conjuring universe/horror movies, it's a fun watch, just don't expect anything special."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Bad Spell of My Sharona\". \"What's the Capital of Arizona?\". \"I'd Rather Be in Barcelona!\". The metaphysical entity that has now manifested into \"The Conjuring Universe\" has certainly had its highs, mostly with James Wan involved, and lows. \"The Benefits of Swedish Krona\" may just be the lowest point that this franchise has dipped to. It's rare, especially for me, for a horror film to be completely ineffective yet director Chaves (his debut!) releases a relentless amount of jump scares that were both predictable and tamer than a domestic cat. A case worker uncovers a dark secret involving a weeping ghost known as La Llorona who haunts families and takes children. It comes as no surprise that she starts experiencing her curse.\n\n\"The Woman from Oklahoma\" is frustratingly poor, mostly stemming down from the atrocious writing. The expositional script is nearly absent of any character depth for both the titular ghoul and Velma (forgive me, but Cardellini will always be my Velma). The loose connection with \"The Conjuring Universe\" is that the father, who explains the entire motives of La La Loner, is the same character from the original 'Annabelle'. That's it. The amount of exposition, for a plot that really doesn't need any whatsoever, is atrocious. And yet, somehow, we practically have no idea why La Macarena is stealing children and how she came about doing this!? All these pathetic explanations and no frickin' depth.\n\nCardellini was sensationally good. Seriously she saves the film from being the worst of the year (thus far...). Displaying a range of emotions for her children and a ridiculously commanding presence. Sweet lord, I love her. But Velma clearly needed the rest of Mystery Inc. to satisfyingly unmask La Diploma. When Chaves decides to unveil the ghost in the opening sequence in her full form, it leaves little to the imagination. This therefore results in every jump scare (and there are many...) and suspense-driven camera movements to be ineffective.\n\nThere is some ingenuity used in various scenes, the umbrella scare was minimally chilling and the long take following Velma throughout her house was well executed. But it's not enough to differentiate itself against every other generic horror film one could easily find on Netflix. The quality and effectiveness that mostly exists in this cinematic universe is not present at all! Predictable right from the bloody start. Velma's children make so many stupid choices that she should've just given them to La Lymphoma. Do not get me started on that doll sequence as the girl reaches out for it on their porch. There's plenty of choking. Eggs explode blood!? Lord, take me now!\n\nCardellini deserved better. Way better. It started off with an interesting approach on child abuse, but no. Should've known it would throw that out of the window. What should've been a decent mainstream horror turns out to be a supernatural disaster. \"I'll See You in Roma\" wept its last tear."

        "review_detailed_main": "The story sounded really fascinating and do have an appreciation for horror. The cover looked creepy and the film did look pretty good. 'The Curse of La Llorona' has also been compared to 'The Conjuring' films/universe (with it having the same producers), and being somebody who really liked 'The Conjuring' and its sequel that immediately was enough to get me stoked in seeing it. So was expecting quite a bit in a way, and really did want to like it regardless of its polarising reception.\n\nSadly, am going to have to agree with those that didn't care for 'The Curse of La Llorona', emphasis on didn't care for, that doesn't mean outright hate. It is not as bad as has been said by others or a disgrace to film-making, it has its moments/good things. However, it should have been much better and really goes downhill after a promising start. Of 'The Conjuring' universe films, for me only 'The Nun' is worse but only consider this marginally better rather than infinitely so.\n\nAs said, there are good things. The photography is pleasing to look at and has an atmospheric look that one wishes was reflected in the rest of the film, 'The Curse of La Llorona' is not a cheap-looking film and the location is both beautiful and eerie. Also felt that Linda Cardellini and the children acquitted themselves very well here, Cardellini especially is very committed in a role that is far removed from Velma Dinkley and doesn't overact or underplay it (instead she is just right).\n\nIt started off very promisingly, with it being genuinely creepy and suspenseful with a set up that draws one in and intrigues. A few creepy scares early on, and sadly there is quite a big emphasis on moments.\n\nBecause 'The Curse of La Llorona' falls downhill quite badly too early and not only never recovers it also gets progressively worse. There are often complaints regarding horror films of not being enough jump scares or scares in general, there is also such thing as too much of them. The latter is the case here and too many of them are ruined by too obvious build ups to them thanks to very predictably placed, overused and too loud sound effects. There is very little new here either in the scares, there is a seen it all before and much better feel throughout. The dull pacing, especially in the middle, and the overuse of La Llorona herself (looking quite freaky but the characterisation had too much trying-too-hard) kill the suspense and any kind of atmosphere for that matter.\n\nMorever, 'The Curse of La Llorona' can get very silly in the latter stages, with some truly baffling character behaviours that are facepalm-inducing and an ending that is not just ridiculous and rushed but can be seen from a long way off. The general predictability of most of the film is a big problem here. The rest of the acting is lacking, with Raymond Cruz giving a performance devoid of charisma or energy which gives the impression that he is not lead actor material. The pacing when it all goes downhill is all over the place and goes dead in the too many uneventful stretches in the middle. The dialogue is banal and can sound very awkward, while there is an inexperienced quality to the direction, not the visuals but in generating suspense and atmosphere and making the drama interesting.\n\nAltogether, promising start but descends into well filmed mediocrity. 4/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "If I were a schoolteacher grading 'The Curse of La Llorona' I would pass it, but absolutely minimally (I believe in America they call that a C-). It did just enough to keep me from hating it and nothing more. The film started off with a semi-decent opening scene. It wasn't overly long but it did enough to set the tone for the movie. Then the tone drastically changes in the next scene, then goes back to trying to be scary in the next, then everything is back to normal, then scary again. This continues for quite a lot of the movie and it really made it hard to stay in the suspenseful mood the film was trying to achieve.\n\nThe problems with the spirit were very distracting by the end of the film. Very rarely in films like this does anything make a lot of sense, but at least they're not usually as in your face as they are in this film. A spirit that can seemingly do anything, can also only walk through one door to enter a house? An embarrassingly bad piece of writing there. The rules just seemed to be made up as they went along to fit the story.\n\nThe film's biggest strength is, as you might imagine, 'La Llorona' herself. She is suitably creepy. She was also used a lot which I liked. Often in these Conjuring universe movies the title character goes missing for large parts of the movie. That can't be said here. The film relies on a lot of jump-scares, some of them are actually done very well and caught me off guard. 'The Curse of La Llorona' does just enough to get by, but there are worse things you could do than going out to see it."

But for all that it is fun.\n\nIt is fun because it leans into being horror movie schlock and doesn't get bogged down with unnecessary filler.

For yours truly, the jump scares don't quite get me, but instead the creepy atmosphere is there to settle into the crevices of your mind. La Llorona is all about utilizing the shadows to stoke the embers of your imagination to craft unspeakable horrors. It's those slight sounds and eerie music that were the scariest components for me and it worked well. I'll hand it to the cast in this film, for they sold the terror of the movie, as if they were being haunted. From the kids to the adults, each one did a wonderful job with the limited roles they had in this film. My favorite was Raymond Cruz, not because he was the star of the film but more so the comedic relief used in his role. Despite all the bone chilling screams, and various telekinetic pulls, the rogue priest makes for some laughs without it being too forced. Finally, in regards to haunted make ups, La Llorona does a nice job of the pale pallor, dark lipstick, and gory liquids to satisfy most make up fans. Nice execution, with some haunting special effects makes for an interesting antagonist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nSimplistic Story Is Okay Jump Scares not So much Flat Characters Trailers Revealed Much Unoriginal Makeup Not The Best Connection To The Universe\n\nSUMMARY: While scaring is the name of the game in these types of movies, the fact they are pumped out rapidly leads to some quality drops for this reviewer. The simplistic nature of this film is a limitation for me, the potential decreased by just the simple presentation that they pulled out. No twists, no original edge, and a story that held a lot of promise were all just mediocre for me and led to a story that was hard to grip onto for me. Even the characters were only semi-there, flat one-dimensional people that weren't the most engaging for me to hook onto. Perhaps the scares would get you, but seasoned horror people like me won't find much in originality from scares, nor the most suspenseful climax. Now part of this was due to me finding tricks of avoiding jumping, and others due to the trailers showing much of these scenes in their brief life on the television. Yes, La Llorona falls victim to the trailer revealing too much, giving you much of the premise in the short two-minute commercials. And while I said the makeup was executed well, this universe is having trouble coming up with unique make ups that don't follow the same template. Because of this, the weeping woman may look good, but she's another pale figure with black lines to emphasize death. And finally, the connection to the Conjuring Universe is like a derivative line touching the main curve. A brief exchange from a shared character it the only opening to the universe and without a teaser or much else to connect, the story telling continues to be lackluster at best.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nIn truth, the movie about the legendary figure is okay for me. It fills the void of a scary movie for the month, and has some of the traditional means to generate a few jumps. Your best source of entertainment will be to bring those who scare easily to the film and watching them react. Yet in terms of the movie, it's just not the same dark magic that the Conjuring wielded a long time ago. It's got the superficial \"charm\" to it, and uses shadows well to terrorize the actors they have casted/ Fortunately, despite the limitations, the movie has a low run time, meaning you won't be in the theater that long in case it's not your particular cup of tea. Worth a trip to the theater? Kind of, but I'd say this one leans more towards the home viewing in this reviewer's opinion. My scores are:\n\nHorror/Mystery/Thriller: 6.5 Movie Overall 6.0"

There are worse tragedies in life to bring someone back or keeps them in purgatory. And the constant screaming scares, oh goodness gracious, enough already.

The negatives: Let's start with how they didn't take advantage of the amazing story basically they told the story in about two minutes and that's it,they did mention it once or twice afterward but it didn't do justice to the story. Second thing to talk about is the jump scares, the movie consisted of jump scares (With the examination of the first of thirty minutes) after that it was either a jump scare or the music leading to a jump scare. Third thing is that the movie is a clich\u00e9, you have your clich\u00e9 kids that will get everyone killed to get their toy and your clich\u00e9 church that will tell you that they can't help you but they'll send you to normally a ghost investigator but this time it was a shaman and many more. That's all i have to say if the movie did anything good it was that it made us laugh."

        "review_title": "Jump-scaring a grieving family is so wrong, but try to explain that to a ghost who drowned her own children..",
        "review_detailed_main": "La Llorona is a very well known tale in Latin American folklore. It's the story of a woman who, after her husband left, drowned her kids in a fit of rage, realised what she had done and took her own life. The legend goes that now she kidnaps children and drowns them, mistaking them for her own. Urban legends and ghost stories are always a good formula for a horror movie, so the ever expanding Conjuring Universe is cashing in on this and making it one of the best chapters we've seen so far.\n\nIt's a very impressive and frightening film I must say. Having watched all the other Conjuring Universe-films (Annabelle and her sequel, The Nun and The Conjuring 1 & 2), The Curse of La Llorona or its Australian title The Curse of The Weeping Woman is the best chapter after the very first Conjuring. The cheap scares were more effective, mostly because there's more build-up and atmosphere, and the scares feels more deserved.\n\nThe film starts in the 1600s with Maria (Marisol Ramirez), later known as our titular ghost, taking her children to the lake. We jump to the 1970s, and meet Anna (Linda Cardellini) - a freshly widowed social worker providing for her two children (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou) - who discovers that one of her clients, Patricia (Patricia Valesquez), has her two boys locked up in a closet. The boys are quickly taken out of her custody and La Llorona strikes, passing on the curse to Anna's children. Desperate for a solution, she turns to an eccentric priest (Raymond Cruz) to rid their house of its newly acquainted curse.\n\nThe Weeping Woman mostly takes place inside Anna's house, but there's more layers to the story. Personal grief while trying to take care of children who are also in mourning, the whole stigma around a single mother working, mixed-race kids, and why this Latin American curse hits them. They're all part of the story and blend pretty well to make it one cohesive tale. Cardellini shows us a side of her acting chops we haven't seen before, and sells it very well. After her last big film Green Book, where her part was almost non-existent, its nice to see a woman of this calibre lead a horror film and isn't afraid to take on a different challenge. The genuine fear, but taking charge of her role as a protective mother, always feels and looks real.\n\nAs far as the rest of the cast, there's not much to talk about. Cruz as a priest is a little bit fascinating, but doesn't have a big enough role to get excited about or to leave a lasting impression. The children are mostly screaming or thrown across rooms like dolls, by La Llorona.\n\nIt might feel a little bit repetitive at times and plays out like a short film stretched out to a feature length film (best comparison I can give you is Lights Out, directed by David F. Sandberg - Shazam!). The best bits of the film definitely include Cardellini and some incredible imagery. But only being 93 minutes long, is more than enough for the story to be told. Director Michael Chaves is also taking over from James Wan to direct The Conjuring 3 (he's still producing and writing the screenplay), so I guess this director is just getting started and will grow to a larger scale in his next feature. The only advice I could give to new director Chavez is to not rely too much on what other horror masters have done in the past, create your own urban legends and voice."

Story is so predictable. Acting is very poor by everyone. The priest is totally like a robot behaving like human but overall it was flat, boring and filled with clich\u00e9s. Honestly I'm surprised with all the good scores in the user reviews. I'm surprised as this was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was subpar, the plot was so incredibly flat and easy to guess beforehand, the dialogue was futile and almost like something a writer threw together in a day or two. If it wasn't for the decent effects, the mostly atmospherical suspense and the children's surprisingly decent acting I'd give this an even lower score. It's that bad.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, but it was easily the weakest film in The Conjuring universe, and that includes the first Annabelle! Convoluted, predictable , and just a woefully weak script! The acting wasn't bad, but you cannot ask actors to create miracles! I honestly felt like breaking out my phone to find anything more entertaining! Michael Chaves should started directing Marvel, we would of have better adaptations."

I've seen a lot of comments going on about them being so disappointed they can't sleep and that they've lost their faith in Wan. Cool your pits people. James Was was not the director, nor the writer on this one. He was 1 out of 9 producers. Michael Chaves was the director, and is also going to direct the Conjuring 3 that comes out in 2020."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the horror/supernatural genre, there are some movies that were filmed just to appeal to the masses. These cheap, disposable scaries usually do well at the box office from a profitability standpoint, but they are not long for remembering. 'The Curse of la Llorona' falls into this category.\n\nSure, 'la Llorona' has a number of elements that have the potential to make a good horror film. From a single mother (Linda Cardellini) who is just trying to do the best for her kids (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou) to a centuries old ghost with an axe to grind and, of course, the Catholic Church. But in this instance, the fright factor just isn't high, and the actual scares are few and far between.\n\nThe best moments of 'la Llorona' are when the haunting presence is not visible (the pool scene comes to mind), but there are too many times where the overly CGI'd la Llorona causes things to fall flat. The highlight of the film is surely when Cardellini's social worker heroine character detects a presence in the house and pursues to investigate. If 'la Llorona' was built around these kinds of moments, it would be a much higher quality product. But, it's not.\n\nOne redeeming aspect of 'The Curse of la Llorona' is the incorporation of Mexican culture, which sets it apart from many others. But a masterpiece this does not make."

I remember a particular episode based on the famous Mexican folklore of La Llorona, the weeping woman who tries to take the children of other people. I was sort of excited for this until..... I found out it was part of the Conjuring Universe. That's where the hope died. I think the Conjuring Universe gets even worse with each entry and it wasn't anything special to begin with. I thought La Llorona was just okay but its about as cliche and predictable as you would expect.\n\nThe film is about a child protective services worker who stumbles upon the legend of La Llorona when investigating a family. Soon the ghostly weeping woman starts terrorizing her kids. Now she must try to protect her children from this mysterious and terrifying force that becomes ever present. The film stars Linda Cardellini, who I just found out was Velma in the Scooby Doo films. The film is a stand alone feature but has ties to the Conjuring Universe. I don't know why, but it is so.\n\nThe film relies on the newer age of jump scares. They are all set up exactly when you would expect the scares to come. Sometimes the weeping woman looks cool, other times she looks like shes an overabundance of computer effects. I think the film is well acted by the kids (which is a surprise) and Cardellini and is funny in some aspects. I liked the fact that the ghost hunter/preacher was unconventional as he had a sense of humor and brings some laugh to a film that goes through the motions and doesn't surprise.\n\nI'm happy that as a horror film this was at least more entertaining than the utter disappointment that was Pet Sematary. Still, this is a forgettable affair. Its a cool idea and has interesting mythos but doesn't capitalize to set itself apart. I hope that this film doesn't get a sequel, seeing as everything in the god forsaken Conjuring Universe seems to be getting one. I saw a trailer for Annabelle 3 today, why in the world is that something that exists?\n\n6/10"

The maincharacters play very well, and you do actually care about them, something a sadly couldn't say about it's counterpart, the nun.

The director sets up a nice creepy buildup, only to have it end with a jump scare instead of something truly remarkable and innovative. While the film has some awesome atmosphere, the director seems to forget his own setup and doesn't know how to utilize it. One of the more spine-chilling moments is when the family surrounds themselves with candles and you can see a shadow in the darkness, and can't quite see the full apparition- this is true suspense and mystery, when not all is revealed; director please take notes from Hitchcock and his use of shadows in Vertigo. CGI hurts the film as well- instead of a creepy looking La Llorona, we get a CGI ghost face that doesn't look much better than something from Stay Alive (2006). There is also a severe lack of character development, absent from most horror films in general. The only character the audience possibly cares about is Linda Cardellini's Anna Tate-Garcia; the kids might garner some emotion from the audience. Raymond Cruz's Rafael Olvera is just a cool fun character, and honestly could have used more screen time. Had the writers developed these characters more, the more the audience cares what is happening to them, and become increasingly more worried for their well-being. Overall the film suffers from many maladies, not being able to follow through with the setup. The director does an excellent job with the setup, not necessarily the execution. Still, the film does deliver some creepy scares and is worth a watch if already invested in the Conjuring universe. Otherwise, check out the new Pet Sematary, it is more effective as a horror movie overall."

The movie drops a lot of the most representative aspects we all remember about La Llorona which made her, well, her, like her most representative cry \"Ay mis hijos\" (oh, my children) which is in almost every version of the legend (at least in all the versions I've heard) and the fact that they turned her into a constant screamer made me very disappointed because eventos the name of the movie becomes kind of a lie. I must say at the start the movie catched my attention with the origin of the legend but the turned into a generic American horror movie. I honestly would not be able to distinguish this movie from any other one, which is kind of sad as this movie had the opportunity to be unique."

The Curse of La Llorona is not a masterpiece in the horror genre but neither is it such garbage as people here claim. Feels a little bit like many jumped on the bandwagon and trashed it which is just as generic and boring as they claim this film is.\n\nI quite enjoyed this film. It passed the time and I jumped a few times. And I found a few scenes quite disturbing. Did it drag slightly? Yes a tad. But it is still an OK addition to the Conjuring universe with a fun cameo by Annabelle. Don't expect too much and just go along with it. The director might be trying a little bit too hard to scare us. But it's his first to give the lad a break."

        "review_title": "Interesting Addition to The Conjuring Universe",
        "review_detailed_main": "This was a film that I first heard about at the Nightmare Film Festival. I've enjoyed most of The Conjuring universe to this point and was interested to see how this film played out. The synopsis is ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother suspected of child endangerment, a social worker and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm.\n\nWe kick this one off in Mexico back in 1671. We see a mother, Marisol Ramirez, with her two sons. They are playing a game and one of them closes their eyes. Once he opens them, his brother and mother are gone. He finds them in a local creek, with his mother drowning his brother. He is then next.\n\nIt then shifts to 1971 in Los Angeles. We see a single mother, Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardellini), as she is trying to get her children ready for school. Her son is Chris (Roman Christou) and daughter Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). Their father was a police officer and was killed in the line of duty, so they are struggling to get by without him. The kids miss the school bus and she has to drive them. Anna is a social worker and she is typing up reports. Her boss tells her co-worker to take over one of her cases for a Hispanic woman. Anna fights with him to let her go, as the woman is suspicious and won't speak with the other woman.\n\nAnna and a police officer go to the apartment. It belongs to Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez). Her sons have been missing school. They are found locked in a closet. They are taken into protective custody and Patricia is arrested.\n\nThat night things take a turn. Anna is woken up by a phone call. She goes to a river where both of the boys were drowned. We saw an entity, La Llorona, took them from the facility, but the mother is suspected. Anna has to bring her kids to the crime scene and tells Chris to stay in the car. He doesn't listen and encounters the entity as well.\n\nThe family is then haunted by this spirit and it starts to break their already shaky lifestyle. It gets to the point where Anna's work makes a visit, thinking she is abusing her children. She has to find help from her local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola). He believes her as he encountered the entity possessing the Annabelle doll. He tells her it will take time for the church to get involved and directs her to a former priest who does more folk healing, Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz).\n\nNow I want to lead off stating, what I was really interested in this film was the lore of La Llorona. I didn't know much about the history of this, but I'm always up to learn more about an entity I don't know much about. This one is interesting as when I heard about this film coming out that there are many films about this spirit. From posts on my social media, it seems that this film takes some liberties with it and that it has changed quite a bit. I think I might search out some of these films to see what is different and look more into this legend.\n\nThis film has an interesting concept in the job that Anna has. She is a social worker that deals with children that are in houses that could be high risk. I like the idea that the ghost is making those at her work question if she is abusing her own children. Being that she is a single mother, it could be that things have gotten to be too much. There is also an aspect of racism here. Anna was married to a man of Hispanic descent. She states she has built a rapport with them and the other worker is of Asian descent. I found this intriguing though, because Anna is Caucasian. She claims it is because she is a mother and not the ethic background. During this time period of enlightenment, it is good that it was pointed out.\n\nI found this film to keep my attention throughout. It doesn't waste any time getting into the haunting and I feel that the film continues to build tension. The stakes continue to heighten as the spirit becomes stronger and stronger. It is actually an interesting curse that those that come in contact with it then have to deal. The climax of the film was pretty solid and Rafael is pretty funny in some of the things he says. Also the ending was pretty fitting for what the film was building toward as well.\n\nThe acting was also pretty solid as well. Cardellini is an actress that I grew up watching on the television show ER. I thought her as a mother in this film was good and it was a good choice to show her as she is trying to keep her family together with the death of her husband. She is also still quite attractive. I thought both Christou and Kinchen did a solid job. Children are really hit or miss for me; with these two I would say definitely the former. Cruz was good in this film as was Velasquez. I also liked Sean Patrick Thomas who was a detective who knew Anna's husband and Amendola was solid as the priest as well. I couldn't finish this section, without talking about Ramirez and her performance. I think she did a fine job and she had good look as the entity. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.\n\nThe effects I was pleasantly surprised with how well they were done. There was quite a bit of CGI, but it looked pretty solid. They enhanced La Llorona with them and some of the things that she did. This film did rely a lot on jump-scares, which I'm not the biggest fan of. I do think they were some pretty effective ones in this. It was also shot very well. I was a big fan of the mirrors that were used to show some things. It is a motif it goes back to a few times. Not knowing the back-story might hurt me here, but she looks into them quite a bit and they crack. This is something I'll definitely look into and update accordingly.\n\nNow with that said, this film I thought was pretty solid. It is about an entity I don't know much about and I think I will definitely look into, as it is an interesting concept. I have heard there were some liberties taken, which I'm actually interested in learning more about as well. It really needed to mesh into The Conjuring universe which is also part of it and I think it did well there. I thought the acting was good and the editing of the film was well. The effects were CGI heavy, but I didn't have any issues there. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt the film. I do think this is one of the better films in this universe and I found it to be above average overall. It is really a ghostly, but I don't think it is cheesy like many in this genre."

Sadly the foreboding atmosphere that is seen in the early sections of the film are never built upon and instead the film descends into a cliched jump scare fest that has been done countless times before. Now there's nothing wrong with jump scares when used sparingly but when they are pretty much the sole source of horror, the impact quickly fades. That's exactly what happened with this film with the second half becoming tedious and predictable that has been done countless times before.\n\nI don't think it's unfair to say that The Conjouring Universe has had more misses than hits with this being the biggest miss yet."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Curse of La Llorona (3 out of 5 stars).\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona is a decent supernatural horror film that does bring some suspense and thrills with the concept idea but kind of a long haul of waiting for something to happen with the movie. Based on a Mexican folklore story, Llorona who is a lady in a white gown and weeping by the river after she murdered her two children. She haunts anyone she can attach herself too and tries to kidnap their children to murder them. The film is decent. It has a decent amount of scares and thrills. But it is definitely clich\u00e9. Having scenes set up for a predictable jump scare which doesn't make it jump scare when you notice it coming. The film does drag for the first half hour of the movie which can be a little boring.\n\nThe plot follows Anna (Linda Cardellini) a social worker who is a widow and raising her two children alone in 1973 in Los Angeles. After she came across a case were Patricia (Patricia Velasquez) locked her kids in a closet. With mysterious symbols on the closet door. Then, Anna's own children are next on Llorona path. Her two children are being haunted by Llorona. Anna seeks out from a priest, which she gets Rafael (Raymond Cruz) who is an unorthodox priest that can try to stop Llorona.\n\nIt is a decent plot. Yes, the folklore and concept idea can be creepy and scary. The idea of a weeping lady dressed all in a white gown and veil lurking by the river or in the shadows. And the idea of hearing her cry which if you get close and she marks you to be the next victim is scary. The film's direction does lack in trying to be creepy and scary. It is not as scary as I thought it was going to be. The first half hour of the film is slow and boring. It follows the same clich\u00e9 in almost every supernatural horror movie. Characters walking through the house, hearing creaking noise or something blowing at the curtains. And being haunted by this supernatural force while no one believes them until they see it for themselves. The climax of the film does make up for the lack of intensity and suspense. Anna and her two children and Rafael are trying to stop Llorona from haunting the family. Lots of lights flickering, characters being thrown into walls, furniture moving, and people being separated in a house.\n\nLinda Cardellini was good playing Anna, a widowed mother who is trying hard to be a good mother to her children. Raymond Cruz was good playing Rafael, a former priest who is doing his own thing to help free people from negative energy or evil spirits. Patricia Velasquez was also good playing a character who is haunted by Llorona and will do whatever it takes to save her children.\n\nOverall, The Curse of La Llorona is a fair film. The concept and folklore is creepy and scary. The film does lack in trying to be scary with a direction that is clich\u00e9 like any other supernatural horror film. And kind of boring. It does make up for it with a dark thrilling climax."

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the sins of low-imagination horror films is that the protagonists seldom learn their lesson. Because of this, they act in ways no real human would act.\n\nThe moment that I could not take any more of this formulaic jump-scare tripe was the scene in which they are calmly having dinner in the house where, the previous night, a nameless weeping evil spirit had just terrorized them.\n\nThere was already sufficient information to know that something supernatural and unfightable was going on. What would be the rational human reaction?\n\n1. Go someplace else.\n\n2. Be around other human beings who might be able to confirm the supernatural occurance.\n\n3. Tell someone else, even if they don't believe you, so that when the supernatural thing that is attacking you wins, at least there is an evidence trail.\n\nBut, of course, in these stoooopid movies, people do irrational things to serve the script. The whole purpose is to have the helpless protagonist alone with the unameable so that the music can blat while the audience receives a brief tingle.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that jump scares are like a drug. After 40 years, or so, of constant use, we are virtually immune. Face in the mirror? Check Rocking door? Check. This is a by-the-numbers affair, with little real drama.\n\nWhy do they continue to make this same movie, over and over?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was very excited about this movie going in. The legend of La Llorona is unique and hauntingly creepy. I was looking forward to a mainstream movie coming out for it. Boy was I disappointed.\n\nThe story is very predictable after the initial sequences. You can see the ending coming from a mile away. The characters are mostly bland and there is little to no depth to them. The actors tried hard with what they were given, and they were given very little.\n\nThe movie follows the classic horror movie formula and while that can work sometimes, as in The Conjuring, this movie failed in doing so. I don't like that this movie is in the Conjuring universe because it nowhere near the ballpark of what The Conjuring was. It is not memorable by any means nor rewatchable. The main antagonist/la Llorona becomes less scary due to her overexposure. We almost get used to her and her creepy shenanigans.\n\nI will say the film is shot very well and has good atmosphere at times. Set design is great, costume is great as is usual with the conjuring universe films. It just has no real substance. So production and others, great job. Directors and writers, try harder. Give it a watch if you want, but it won't be a good use of your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Curse Of La Llorona (2019)' is the latest entry in the ever-growing 'Conjuring' franchise. It was clumsily amalgamated at the last minute, seemingly because it shares a single cast member with 'Annabelle (2014)'. The result is somewhat strange. It doesn't really feel like a 'Conjuring' film, mainly because there are no real links to the main entries in the series, aside from an oblique reference, and the connections to the series' spin-offs, essentially, start and end with the aforementioned cast member, who basically only has a cameo in both pieces. There's also a brief, entirely unnecessary flashback to explain these arbitrary connections to uninitiated audience members that's so ham-fisted, it's probably the most entertaining moment of the flick. That's only possible because the movie is, by and large, an utter bore. It has a really strange pace to it and just keeps going. I mean, it has about five different endings and actually finishes on what's probably the worst one. It's actually quite difficult to get through, in a way; you just want it to be over. It doesn't help that it isn't scary in the slightest, either. There are several long shots which are meant to build tension but just end up being dull. The jump-scares are quite obnoxious and extremely obvious: the sound drains from the scene, a few moments pass and then there's a loud scream and musical sting. Repeat this, with some crying thrown in for added 'tension', over and over again and you'll get an understanding of the sort of 'horror' that this feature goes for. It's not that inspired and it just doesn't work. There isn't really a logic to the eponymous ghost; it seems as though it can do anything. This 'freedom' isn't used to good effect, though. The few more interesting gags are squandered by subsequent screams or the odd pacing (which I think is a failed attempt at creating 'ever-escalating tension'). On top of all this, there aren't really any characters. No-one has an arc - apart from, I suppose, the side-character of Patricia Alvarez - and they all seem like the most basic version of themselves possible. Therefore, you only care about the central characters as much as you would any random human. It makes the scares even less effective then they would be otherwise and makes for an experience that's less than engaging, to put it mildly. The main issue is that it's boring, though. That's, essentially, the worst sin a picture can commit. 3/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Curse of La Llorona is the sixth installment of the Conjuring Universe taking place in the 1970s sometime around the time of the main Conjuring films. This movie involves one of my favorite urban legends that being a Mexican tale of La Llorona. According to legend, La Llorona (Weeping Woman in Spanish) was once a beautiful woman who drowned her children in a blind rage after she discovered that her husband had found another woman to replace her. Realizing her mistake, she tossed herself into the river to join her sons in death. However, this was not the end for her. Because of her committing two of the most ultimate of sins, she was forever barred from the afterlife, unable to pass off the earthly plain of existence until she found her children. Her story was told as a way of teaching children to behave lest La Llorona would get them and drown them if she realizes they weren't hers.\n\nSo you have an interesting premise of the ghostly lady haunting a family. My only real problem is that whenever it comes to spinoff films in the Conjuring series or prequels, they tend to fail at being truly original with their scares. La Llorona looks no different than any other horror monsters wearing a dress and being a tall and lanky figure much like some examples such as The Ring. It's as though the producers of the film were afraid to branch out from the Conjuring movies by sticking to one house becoming haunted. It's not even getting into how the film's plot can be predictable at times.\n\nThe children in the film also consistently made stupid decisions that impeded on their chances at surviving their experience with La Llorona unscathed. It all hinges on copying the basic horror formula down beat by beat.\n\nWith that, the actress that plays the social worker having to do with a vengeful spirit does a good job with what she had to work with. Other than that, there is actually an allusion in the film that shows how it's connected to the rest of the series, but it was otherwise an average film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, I entered this movie with a somewhat indifferent mindset, because most of the movies set in \"The Conjuring\" universe haven't exactly been cinematic masterpieces, ranging in at mediocre horror more or less.\n\nHowever, I will say that this 2019 \"The Curse of La Llorona\" by director Michael Chaves was actually one of the more interesting and entertaining movies to color this shared universe of horror movies.\n\nWhile the storyline and script wasn't exactly groundbreaking or innovative, it was still thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining, especially because it had that archetypical horror style and formula to it. And it actually worked out well enough at the hands of writers Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis.\n\nThe movie does, however, stoop to cheap jump scares a bit too often. But it would work much better if it wasn't so predictable that you see it coming a mile away. But I guess that is the backside to being a life-long seasoned veteran of the horror genre.\n\n\"The Curse of La Llorona\" had some nice acting performances to carry it along the way. And I will say that Linda Cardellini actually carried the movie a great long way with her performance. However, I was most impressed with Raymond Cruz, just a shame that he didn't have a much bigger role in the movie. It should also be said that the performances by the youngsters Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen and Roman Christou also really added a lot to the movie.\n\nThe characters in the movie were nicely fleshed out and this helped the acting performers to really delve into their characters and put in additional effort to the characters to bring them to life on the screen.\n\nNow, this being a horror movie, of course there is going to be a force of evil - of some kind. And yes, that was here too; enter La Llorona - portrayed by Marisol Ramirez. The concept of the entity was nice and the backstory was good, however, the entity just wasn't particularly scary for me. It felt like the make-up and special effects for her were just too mundane and generic.\n\nHowever, all in all, then \"The Curse of La Llorona\" was enjoyable and entertaining. Just don't expect a horror movie that will blow you away with creative thinking. Nor should you expect to be scared to the point of fainting."

Also I'm going on record to say this isn't apart of the Conjuring Universe, the only thing connected this movie to the conjuring is a throw away scene where the priest talks about Annabelle, which makes this more of a movie that happens to have a pointless advertisement for the Conjuring movie"

There are just so many ways that a demon can appear. I think this was very well done. There's a good and believable mix of Catholicism and occult intervention. There's a good mix of character development. The right mix. Enough so the audience is invested in the outcome for the \"victims\" but not so much that a negation resolution would cause the audience to downplay the film. As a result any outcome is possible down to the finale. I think that is a required element in a good horror. It is missing a ubiquitous trope in the end, but it would be a spoiler to reveal it and others might not miss it. It's a very good 90 minutes. I argue with some of the negative comments that the \" final\" stand is predictable and perhaps has 2 or 3 minutes of repetition. But the takeaway is if enjoy horror movies, I think you'll be glad you didn't skip this because of some negative reviews regarding the obvious."

        "review_detailed_main": "La Llorona is an entity known throughout much of Latin America and it was inevitable that Hollywood would bring her to the big screen. It's quite controversial that they included her in The Conjuring universe whose films are based on real paranormal cases, but she is not crazy at all. Even though La Llorona is considered a legend, the possibility that she is a real entity is not ruled out at all due to the statements of people who claim to have seen or heard her, without forgetting to mention the recordings that could capture her crying or even La Llorona itrself wandering in different territories. So making a movie from the Warren universe about La Llorona as a being that can exist in real life is a success.\n\nThe film has a good prologue and the way it materializes La Llorona is quite good. They give him a scary look and maintain some basic elements of the character. Turning her into a malevolent spirit was not a bad idea, since some versions of the legend in some Latin countries dictate that La Llorona is a dangerous being and hearing her cry is a warning of danger. The problem is that since it is the Mexican version that has great cultural value, the film errs on the side of lowering itself to a simple and basic horror film to maintain the tone of the other The Conjuring films. There's more potential with La Llorona that could have been used to its full potential and that's something the film doesn't do. It focuses a lot on just being a regular supernatural horror story, without any background, easy to digest and with a couple of jumpscares that are okay. The script is not really very good, it just has simple writing like the other films in this franchise.\n\nAs another common horror film it complies, but being a film based on La Llorona, there was clearly much more that should have been explored about this entity. Even the Curandero who helps the protagonist mother could have participated more and contributed a lot to the film. The truth is that more presence of Mexican culture was required due to its strong connection with La Llorona. Not having that, it is not strange that there are people who feel that this film fails for having brought La Llorona to the big screen without giving much priority to her roots and focusing only on the basics.\n\nIn conclusion, The Curse Of La Llorona is a common horror film that offers a simple story without much to decipher and fulfills its purpose of offering a moment of tension with a couple of scares, but as it is something related to a legend that has a great cultural value in Mexico, it becomes controversial. The world of The Warren is full of interesting paranormal anecdotes to explore, but La Llorona is a chapter in this saga that falls somewhat short. My final rating for this movie is a 7/10."

But for the most part, it's annoying. It's not a good bad movie.\n\nThe children are not well-written or well-acted. Their performances are wooden and their actions don't make sense. The lead actress is doing her best in my opinion, but she has to react to a really poorly directed monster, and it's sad how ridiculous these scenes can get.\n\nThe conjuring reference really sticks out like a sore thumb. The film has a shot of Annabelle for no goddamn reason except to maybe flaunt its lineage.\n\nThis does not belong on the big screen. It just makes all the flaws more apparent."

        "review_detailed_main": "A well made and lovingly crafted piece, largely for genre enthusiasts. The setup itself is a bit of a reach, a single mother who is also a case worker happens to stir the wrath of the title character by rising the ire of another single mother who is accused of child endangerment. Huh? This aside, we have a fascinating, moody piece anchored by solid performances and a truly creepy mystical being. Plucky children play well to the many jump scares - the best involving a runaway umbrella. Set in the seventies, this allows plenty of time to pay homage to classic horror films and tropes from the past. This reviewer caught direct reference to IT and Evil Dead, but suspect there are more. The first half is a pretty excellent setup, while the second reminds us why this will never be a genre classic. Absolutely well worth it for horror fanatics of all stripes, while most others will find it routine and unexceptional. The filmmakers know their audience. For the craft and care 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Curse of La LLorona is a new horror film directed by Michael Chaves, the director of the short films Billie Eilish: Bury a Friend and The Maiden.\n\nThe film is about mother Anna Tate-Garcia (Linda Cardelini). Her husband was a cop, but died, so now she only has to take care of her two children. She also works at child protection. Here she is involved in a conflict between a mother and her children, who claims that an evil spirit by the name of La Llorona tried to take her children from her and kill her. Anna does not believe the mother, but later learns that the mother might be right about the evil spirit. In her own household, she notices that her children are starting to behave differently. To protect herself and her children, she seeks help from a priest who can help her fight against the evil of La Llorona.\n\nThey have based this film on an existing Mexican myth, but have adapted the film too much apart from the idea. For example, they have just turned an interesting idea into a standard horror film. This way the film also comes across as predictable, because you have seen most of the situations in the film better in other horror films. The film is also supposed to be part of the Conjuring horror film series, but there is little to be seen. Only a character from another horror film of this series makes an appearance in the film, but the scenes of the Conjuring films make the timeline somewhat confused.\n\nFor the script writers, this is also their second script they have written. This can be seen in the many unclear situations that happen in the film. In addition, in all these different situations, the evil spirit always seems to have the right powers to get hold of its victims, which often also simply ends with a predictable jump scare. La Llorona also looks a lot like other evil demonic spirits such as the Nun of the Woman in Black.\n\nThe acting is done nicely in the film, but because of the stupidly written script, the characters make stupid decisions. The characters come across as stupid, which means that as a viewer you don't really care about them anymore after the umpteenth stupid mistake they make."

They weren't amazing but they had good acting, good jump scares and tried to be as original as films like that can be. Annabelle was a poorer film and I actually preferred the sequel to the original. The Nun was diabolical and yet - I lasted an hour of that film before giving up. I literally walked out of this mess after 24 minutes.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nThe CGI - rubbish now so imagine it in a few years when technology goes even further.\n\nThe plot - *spoiler warning* The Weeping Woman is the ghost of a woman who killed her children to teach her cheating husband a lesson. She then killed herself and now walks the earth looking for children to take away to replace the ones she had originally killed. Been there, done that, seen it in better films... But then, it is based on lore so originality can be excused but I'm sure they could have found a more original way to tell the story.\n\nThe atmosphere was lacking, the jump scares failed to hit the spot and I wonder what film people watched who rated this as a ten out of ten? God knows what would happen to them if they saw an actual scary film.\n\nThis film is everything that is wrong with horror films at the moment."

Plus...I really don't get why people criticized this movie so heavily...I mean...it was a pretty decent movie for all I care (and most importantly for it's genre and for what it is supposed to be)!!!The visual effects were very nice,the acting (of all!!adults and young ones) was most of the times good,ambience was immersive,and there was a number of chills one can get!! predictable??probably!!!so what??I bet you would consider a lot of different twists and endings predictable as well...what I would have really liked,would be a bit more emphasis on the actual legend,and the song playing in the background...this was definitely missing!!!"

When the children are removed from their home, La Llorona is accidentally released and sets out to terrorize and steal children in the community. Anna discovers the origin of the curse and sets out to vanquish La Llorona before it takes her own children.\n\nWhen I watched this film, I found myself thinking that it looked a little too similar to another film called \"The Woman in Black\" which starred Daniel Radcliffe. Nonetheless, this wasn't bad in terms of horror. I was surprised, however, that it was part of the Conjuring series. I haven't seen much press indicating it to be so. Upon viewing the film there are only one or two very brief string connections to the greater series which you will surely miss if you haven't already seen the Conjuring films and are knowledgeable about their events and characters. I suspect that this was tacked on a last minute decision. Without the Conjuring imprint, it would have just been another ghost film that would have entered and exited under the radar. However, the Director of The Curse of la Llorona (Michael Chaves) is slated to direct the next Conjuring film, taking over from James Wan, so we might be seeing more cross-over connections in the future."

There remains boredom, linked to the widely used theme, with the usual clich\u00e9s that follow one another over and over again in the vain attempt to give an authentic scare.\n\nHowever, the good interpretations remain, provided by a very respectable cast; even the retro setting appears well taken care of. Perhaps a slightly more detailed study on the origin of the entity that gives the name to the film would have benefited the story."

A ghost who drowns little children is after two boys whose mama is a caseworker, Anna. Her client lost her two boys to La Llorona only because Anna disregarded them when they told her they needed to remain in the room she found them in order to be safe. Anna moves the boys to child-services and voila, they are found dead. Now their distraught mama is hellbent on giving Anna's boys to La Llorona."

We are a family lover big on horror films and everyone loved it. This is BEST by far, beating the Conjuring, Annabelle, Insidious, the Nun etc...Most horror films feature their scary parts during the night time but La Llorona is day and night settings. This is a MUST SEE!!"

It starts with newlyweds being told the legend and flashes back to the origin of the story, where a woman is spurned by her husband who betrays her with a lover . She then kills their children before being put to death. Ignoring the eerie warning of a troubled mother (Patricia Velasquez) suspected of child endangerment, the social worker (Linda Cardellini) and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening supernatural realm , taking place at their house a series of strange and scary incidents . All of them are traumatized for the rare discovery and their only hope to survive La Llorona's deadly wrath may be a disillusioned priest (Raymond Cruz) and the mysticism he practices to keep evil at bay, on the fringes where fear and faith collide. Pretty soon, the terrible ghost appears again and everything then changes in eerie way and things go wrong.\n\nA creepy and thrilling film about a Mexican woman finds herself reincarnated centuries later by a scary woman killing children , while a good mummy and her own small kids are soon drawn into a frightening horrible realm . It packs inexplicable disturbing occurrences , shocks, thrills, suspense , chills , hair-rising events and surprising final twist . A sinister and unsettling flick that goes on growing more and more and developing little by little until the unexpected conclusion. As ending is filled with some genuine fright , horror and doom. The main and support cast are pretty well, giving attractive performances as Linda Cardellini , Raymond Cruz , Patricia Velasquez , Sean Patrick Thomas , Tony Amendola ; however , the two children protagonists don't give credibilty to their roles . There are other versions about La LLorona or The Weeping Woman : Rene Cardona directed the first take on the Crying Woman of Mexican legend in 1960 with Mar\u00eda Elena Marqu\u00e9s , Eduardo Fajardo ; The Weeping Woman 2019 by Jayro Bustamante with Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy , Sabrina De La Hoz and The Legend of La Llorona 2021 with Danny Trejo , Autumn Reeser , Antonio Cupo\n\nThe pic contains an adequate and dark cinematography with plenty of lights and shades by cameraman Michael Burgess . Equally, a mysterious and suspenseful musical score by Joseph Bisara , an expert on composing eerie atmospheres as proved in The Conjuring , Annabelle , Insidious 1, 2, 3, Grace , Lullaby , Maligno , Dreamkatcher , 2014V/H/S Viral , Autopsy , The Vatican Tapes , among others . The motion picture was competently directed by horror expert Michael Chaves . He has previously made a few short films , all of them limited to terror genre, being The Curse of La Llorona his film debut , followed by the newly released The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do (2021) . Rating 6/10. Acceptable and decent terror movie. Well worth watching."

It is a very generic cut and dry, predictable horror film. Also, La Llorona's makeup and appearance is super over dramatized to the point of being comical. They gave her yellow eyes for some reason and it just looks ridiculous to me. And the movie is so predictable that none of the scares are actually scary. And it quickly goes into a tight pattern of the same thing over and over again. So I give this one a 3 since I didn't finish it and maybe it had a good ending that I don't know about."

They were so lame, like the same old tricks we've seen a million times. Jump scares, creepy noises, you name it. It felt like they were trying way too hard to be spooky, but it just fell flat. And let's not forget the characters. Ugh! They were so one-dimensional, I couldn't care less if they got scared or not. And what's the deal with tying it to 'The Conjuring' universe? It felt so forced, like they were just trying to cash in on its success. Overall, it was a major disappointment. I'd rather watch a YouTube video of cats doing funny things. At least that would be more entertaining and less of a waste of my time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Saw this pop up on Netflix and thought I'd give it a go. And to be honest I found the whole film just a bit dull. It does keep suspense well, the acting is neither here or there and it does have some jump scares if you're into that. But, overall it never really fished me in and by the end I was just glad it was all over and done with.\n\nSo why was it bland? Well, to start I found the plot quite basic. Never goes out of its way to challenge you and it's all quite predictable. The plot had absolutely zero depth to it and I think this has to be my biggest annoyance with this film, they could have fleshed out the characters, the curse and just the plot generally so much more. But they didn't, and because of this it all feels very flat and basic. This is illustrated in the ending, it kind of just ends. No depth, no nothing.\n\nJust another thing I want to mention. The film is set in the 70s and no joke, there was not one thing that seemed 70s, if I was told this was set in modern day I wouldn't have noticed any issues.\n\nFinally just on all things negative. The movie is FILLED with cliches. You want to see a horror cliche, this film will have it. Slow turning of heads, mirrors, slow and loud doors, candles and so on and so on. It's all here and very frustrating. And worst of all dumb character mistakes. There is one towards the end (I won't say what exactly, as I don't want to ruin anything), but what the daughter did made me almost scream at my TV in annoyance. All that move did was add 15 mins to the plot, nothing else.\n\nSo yeah that's my take on this one. It's bang average, slap down the middle 5/10. It's definitely not the worst and I could name several horror films much worse. But it's very forgettable and had too many annoyances to be higher than midway."

That night the children are drowned by La Llorona and the social worker's own children attract the attention of the malevolent ghost.

Some good scary scenes which will make you jump and also drawn out horror. La Llorona appearing in and breaking mirrors, throwing people across rooms, dragging children into swimming pools and shoving them down in baths, windows of a car winding down when nobody seems to be there. Nothing particularly new in this film and the pacing was off at ties but it's a good Evil Ghost film. Directed by Michael Chavez who is due to direct The Conjuring 3 in 2020. 7/10."

Tuko (from breaking bad) plays a priest, and while it made for some good laughs, I just couldn't see him as any other character other than Tuko, which just made him unbearable.

I seriously predicted almost every scare that would happen in this movie. La Llorona was never scary or intimidating once to me & there isn't much meat to her besides a short backstory and becoming a spirit that does evil spirit things like we've seen a hundred other times \ud83d\ude44. It doesn't help either that the story is pretty bland & basic. Why wasn't this movie set in Mexico? There couldve been some beautiful visuals & themes to explore. Instead we got boring 1970s Los Angeles that's just beyond overdone. Linda Cardellini & the kids do a fine job acting but there wasn't much to their characters and I didn't feel bad for them as much as I wanted to.\n\nThis is the only film in The Conjuring Universe I didn't watch till now, I'm so glad I waited too."

        "review_title": "Completely generic, The Curse of La Llorona goes little more than a combination of horror scenes and sudden scares",
        "review_detailed_main": "With the success of The Conjuring, Warner Bros. Had the idea of creating a horror franchise exploring secondary characters from the main franchise (cases of Annabelle and The Nun) or using other myths and urban legends for this universe. In the latter case fits The Curse of La Llorona. Even though the release of the film does not assume that the plot takes place in the same universe as the couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, the film is set in Los Angeles in 1973 and puts a family in the path of the haunting of the title, a woman who chases children after having drowned his own children. The creature comes from a Mexican urban legend, but the script isn't too concerned with honoring those roots, just pulling the central figure and putting him in a film with formula and no identity.\n\nLa Llorona is a mother who killed her own children, in symbolic revenge against her adulterous husband, and now, maddened, seeks to appropriate the children of others. The mother, the ultimate symbol of care and protection for most societies, becomes a danger to the little ones. This Mexican Medea's cry of pain is real, not just a trap to seduce little children. Likewise, people's compassion in the face of distant crying - that is, what makes us human capable of empathy - is the same element that puts us at risk. In other words, our humanity and our family love pose the real threat in this horror movie.\n\nWith an uncreative text in character construction and plot development, \"The Curse of the La Llorona\" takes some time to find an interesting rhythm. And among the horror sequences, the problems of the script are evident, which uses shallow or questionable arguments to connect the scenes. This can be felt in the way that much of what is presented in character development is of no use to the story - apart from giving one or another punctual detail. The absence of the father figure, for example, is shown with some emphasis in the opening scenes, only to be brushed aside afterwards. Perhaps this is why the family nucleus has a function of serving as an object for fear. Linda Cardellini (\"Green Book: The Guide\") plays the role she's been given well, and you can feel her dread as she gradually discovers what's going on. The actress is committed, but can do little in the face of a script that shows no interest in the role. The goal here is fear for fear, no attachment to the characters. And in this sense, the horror scenes are conducted with care, which results in great moments where the tension is maintained and, mainly, having the final scare as a reward for fans of the genre. Llorona's first appearance is a good example of this. With an intelligent assembly and using the corridors and photography very well, the result is satisfactory. In the same way as happens in the sequence of the swimming pool - which is beautiful in construction -, punctuating the terror and the scare very well.\n\nHowever, while the execution is intelligent and satisfying, on the other hand there is little connection between what we see and how the spirit manifests itself. Naturally, as is common in the genre, it is necessary to have the suspension of disbelief activated. And in this, those who are more attached to details may feel uncomfortable with some events, generating even ridiculous scenes, including. The impression is that we are facing several horror shorts (some of these sequences are relatively long by the standards of the genre), forcibly interconnected by an uninteresting script.\n\nHowever, it is in the last act that the main problem of the film lies. The villain's exposure significantly reduces her fear, and her appearances have less impact. The exaggerations committed by the narrative also call for improbable situations to be disregarded and the problems of how Llorona manifests itself are even more inconsistent. And finally, there is a terrible attempt (here in the bad sense of the term) to create moments of comic relief that are unjustified, disrupt the rhythm, and are ineffective.\n\nLa Llorona is a weak antagonist: little about her story is explained beyond the basic premise, which results in uninteresting and impersonal ways to fight her. She also doesn't have the same presence as Valak, the demonic nun, which in itself greatly alleviates the film's visual impact. What really complicates it is how director Michael Chaves, in his first feature, fails to create tension in an original way and compensates with cheap scares. Among the Evil Summon derivatives, this one is easily the most appealing - and also the least effective. Thus, what could be a bolder movie for the studio and more in tune with the more profitable market ends up not daring and bringing a small and unnecessary connection with the franchise to which it belongs and would not need to belong. With five works already released, and at least two more in production, it was to be expected a more interesting link than simply confirming that the events belong to the same reality. Therefore, their intention to show themselves present in an already existing universe is frustrating or, at the most, dispensable.\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona goes little more than a combination of horror scenes and sudden scares, those very predictable and that smack of the aforementioned formula of the Evil Summoning franchise. The entire intermediate act serves as a collage of situations for the long and final combat. Relatively interesting, but also with its feet rooted in the sameness that pervades mainstream horror cinema today. There are moments of breath, as clear references to other horror classics and, especially, the children's performance. The two are no longer just victims of a curse to become direct agents in the last act of the film, either in favor of the solution or as another element of horror. Both Samantha and Chris draw attention for different reasons and bring some differentiation in relation to other productions, especially when La Llorona takes Anna and healer Rafael (Raymond Cruz) out of the equation. Still, however, there is little that represents an escape from the curve or an actually scary element here. It is possible to mention, perhaps, an unpredictable factor related to La Llorona herself (Marisol Ramirez), which sometimes appears with ferocity and, in others, appears in a sneaky way. The problem, however, is that the spectator always knows when she's going to show up, only being surprised by her way of acting.\n\nOne of the positive points of the film is certainly in terms of acting, with emphasis on Linda Cardellini who, increasingly familiar to the public's eyes, shows that she can hold the prominence of a film of this size without needing other stars to brighten up the supporting roles. When there's a problem with your character, it should be attributed to the film's poor dialogue work. In some moments, the scenes are even confused and, in a few others, maybe even nonsensical. It must also be said that the choice of how to conduct the story with Cardellini's character is somewhat flawed, and the spectator may end up questioning her attitudes and actions, which is an evil for most of the protagonists of the genre. Another role that can be awkward within the plot is the one played by Raymond Cruz. Within what the film proposes, his character clashes with his recurrent catchphrases and all his appearance as the protagonist of action films from the 1980s.\n\nThe technical and creative team of The Curse of La Llorona does a great job of nuances - something very important in horror, a genre so fond of manichaeism. The house is neither too sloppy nor too cared for; the lighting is dim, as would be befitting a mother who spends little time there, and barely opens the windows. Actors are not ugly, nor are they overly beautified. In particular, the camera work is needed, from the long sequence shot at the beginning, with the children running inside the house, to a scary scene with children in a greenish corridor, very well set up, through the irruption of a scary figure in dark and muted flashes.\n\nThe director Michael Chaves even ventures into a subjective plan of La Llorona, observing the house from the outside, and another image that starts as a point of view of Anna (Cardellini), until the character appears inside the frame. Some risky scenes in terms of direction become as beautiful as they are frightening, because they mix affection and danger - see the hair washed in the bathtub, or the children trapped in the closet. This becomes a war between mothers, or even the symbolic battle of a mother who, in order to be good at her job, needs to harm the family of others. The problem is that Chaves does not bring anything new to the formula created by James Wan. Not that he's the only one - all the directors in the franchise try to follow that, but each one adds something of their own, no matter how small - but he's certainly the one who least experiences the scary moments. It's a film that looks more like a compilation of Wan's techniques, such as the sequence shot to introduce the environment at the beginning, or playing with threats coming from various directions, such as the scene where the main children take refuge in the car and have to stop their children from doing the windows to open one at a time.\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona represents the big problem of this expansion of The Conjuring: producing a saga of movies on an assembly line. All come out with the same structure, but seeing it repeated with less and less experimentation in the plots, scares and tension leaves a truly bitter feeling - something intensified in a feature film with shallow characters and situations. Completely generic, filmmaker Michael Chaves does what he can, adds shots that reference Evil Dead and other horror movies, achieves an average result and proves that James Wan's base franchise derivatives still have many curses and entities evil to behold."

Here they take a Latino tradition and transfer it to a more box-office environment, they present a story that has little substance but has a rather favorable aspect: it does not have an open ending. Despite the obvious greed of the producers to get money from us through this kind of work, it offers light entertainment with aspirations for more. It is a mediocre film."

The camerawork is pretty good in there. Almost thought the movie would be great by those two scenarios.\n\nNothing else is impressive. Cannot stand how they have made 'La Llorona' too visible all through the movie. At the end, she is not scary at all. There is a similar ghostly character in 'The Woman in Black' movies.

Also this movie use too much cheap jump scares in it and none of them are that effective. And some of the plot points never gets resolved. The characters aren't really hateable or intolerable, but they lack development to root for them throughout the movie. La Llorona designed looks ok like the makeup effects on her looks pretty good, but there's no build up towards it. I do like the story of La Llorona in the movie and interesting.

Technically it's a horror film so if you have average scary parts then that's a big knock on this film. I could only picture this film scaring children or tweens since this movie's story is based around children. At the end of the day i wouldn't recommend this movie, even though the story is original, the movie as a whole is very flawed.

The long-awaited ambush of Avengers: Endgame turns ALL theaters in my town into their screenings and leaves no mercy for other movies. Some of them are too bad to end early, but La Llorona probably is going for good.\n\nAs the newest installment of Conjuring Universe, La Llorona follows a single mother with her kids that terrorized by murderous spirit La Llorona or the Weeping Woman. The titular character comes from Latin folktale that delightful to dig it in terms of her background and terror mechanism. Unluckily, this movie only offers jumpscares.\n\nJumpscare is the main selling point for me when talking about Conjuring Universe. Their jumpscares are innovative and unique on their own, unlike the story which always felt super thin, which unlike the other horror movies, able to justify much weakness of the film. La Llorona seemingly drives from that thought and develop all the way to become a whole movie.\n\nLa Llorona feels so ambitious to make all scenes horrifying, the grey dominated sets, the raining-cloudy days, dark halls in the house, just hoping that the formula will attract audiences. However, the lack of logic in/and the story, distaste me for liking this movie further. Cringe comedic-like acting, big background story with no significance to the climax/whole plot, and the mechanism of La Llorona in haunting, confusing me while been scared by many one-shot jumpscares that unable to increase the horror.\n\nAlthough I like the movie to be fast-paced and the jumpscares are innovative, this movie gives a warning to the producers/directors that this pattern starts to be stale. How if they rely on the jumpscares too much? How if they forget to write the plot? I think it's a curse to limit your horror creativity into one big picture of disturbing images throughout your filmography. I hope the next Annabelle movie will be smarter because it's a pity that all jumpscare workshops the director probably had only to be damaged by a weak plot."

The movie is far from slow, which is ok, but it doesn't really go anywhere. And as a bonus, you get the free annoying moments, such as kids walking into rooms where they shouldn't, or the mother leaving her children alone at the most asinine of moments.\n\nAll forgivable as this is a slightly entertaining horror movie, but at the same time generic and forgettable. No wish list material here."

The jump scares are fun, though predictable, but I love a good jump scare, as long as the film keeps me interested. La Carumba has a very murky, dim aesthetic, most scenes have flat lighting and very dark interiors, and to be honest, it works, it adds to the atmosphere and gives the film a very bleak outlook.\n\nThe characters are fairly one dimensional, and stands as one of the weaker entries to the Conjuring series, but it's better than The Nun, and if it had better direction and stronger writing, then this Curse would certainly be one that sticks around."

        "review_title": "Poorly written, poorly directed",
        "review_detailed_main": "Poor directing accentuates the script weaknesses in this terrible movie.\n\nThe script is illogical and predictable. The movie opens with a brief sequence essentially showing the origins of the ghost in Mexico. Then, for no reason that's ever explained, the ghost decides to immigrate to the United States. For reasons also left unexplained she begins to haunt first one family and then, inexplicably, the family of our main protagonists. There is literally no explanation ever offered as to why she chooses certain people. And when, naturally, stuff begins to happen to our protagonist's children, what do they say when she asks them what happened? \"I fell,\" and \"Nothing.\" Why don't they just tell her what happened? Who knows. It's a random plot point which is probably supposed to enhance suspense somehow. This kind of writing is so amateurish. Anyone who has seen the few decent ghost story movies and appreciates them could have improved this script with just a few hours work.\n\nThe haphazard storytelling and lack of logic continues through the rest of the movie. At one point a house is deemed protected from the ghost as long as such and such doesn't happen. Again without explanation, literally 15 seconds later, the protection plot point is tossed aside and the ghost is again breaking into the house. I kid you not, the solution proposed is a hammer and nails to secure the door. You know, like in Night of the Living Dead. It is so ridiculous and ham-handed that as events unfold in the foreground, in the background you can actually hear a character yelling \"Just a few more nails!\" Idiotic. Heck, we even have a moment where a flashlight begins to blink and then goes out, because, ya know, that's not a cliche.\n\nThe latter point underscores another core element the film does not successfully pull off. The ghost is not the least bit creepy, and really functions as a physical monster more than a spirit. This has been done in many movies and sometimes it works (Darkness Dalls is a somewhat underrated example). It doesn't work in this movie for a number of reasons, not the least of which is an over-reliance on cheap, predictable jumpscares - the kind that are accompanied by and obnoxious momentary increase in volume. Completely unimaginative.\n\nThe script is so bad that 10 minutes into the movie I predicted that about halfway through a certain plot development would occur, and lo and behold 47 minutes into the movie there it is. Tedious."

        "review_detailed_main": "This horror film opens in Mexico in 1673 where a mother drowns her two children. The action then moves forward three hundred years to Los Angeles in 1973. Anna Tate-Garcia, a child welfare officer is sent to discover why Patricia Alvarez's two sons have been failing to go to school. She finds them locked in a cupboard so takes them into social care. That night one of the boys sleepwalks, the other follows; they meet a woman in white. Soon afterwards they are found drowned in a nearby river. Patricia blames Anna; claiming she had failed to protect her boys from 'La Llorona' (The Weeping Woman). Shortly afterwards Anna's own children start being attacked by the ghostly woman; she seeks help from a priest but he suggests somebody else to help her. Escaping La Llorona's clutches won't be easy.\n\nThis film is okay; it had elements that I liked but overall was over reliant on the use of jump scares and creepy noises. The good elements were the use of a character from Mexican folklore; I'd not heard the story of La Llorona so felt I'd learnt something about another culture... although more from the relevant Wikipedia article I read after watching than the film, which modifies the myth somewhat. It is a story that was ripe for use in a horror movie. The film got off to a good start and La Llorona was suitably creepy, even if we did see her a little too early and often. Instead of settling for nicely creepy the makers added far too many jump scares; one or two are good but an excess just gets irritating. The effects are pretty good although the sight of items, and people, being moved by an invisible force is hardly new. The cast is solid enough. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see; it is however a decent enough way to pass an hour and a half if you enjoy the genre."

It wasn't scary - and that pretty much says everything you want to know about horror movie. The flick also did not had any sense of humor - its not that is necessary, but for this particular movie it could have helped at least. Acting wasn't anything special to say the least, yet i liked Linda Cardellini's performance - she is the best thing about this boring and not scary flick.\n\nOverall, \"The Curse of La Llorona\" (what a name!) is not scary, not thrilling and not involving movie.

Michael Chaves has interesting ways of making a story line more enjoyable to watch with its constant thrilling and addition to the story however the jump scares are absolutely disappointing and predictable except for a few but for its budget is a fun, scary, thrilling and good film with a good cast."

        "review_detailed_main": "Personally I was expecting this movie to be in the 6-8/10 range so it was a bit underwhelming for me. The film felt much longer than it was and looking at the clock after leaving and it was fairly short at around 90 minutes. I felt as though I was sitting there for about 2 hours and half of that time I was fairly bored. There were only perhaps one or two moments where I felt scared and even then it was only very mild and for a few seconds when a jump scare had occurred. It's worth noting that I am not familiar with the source material / urban legend so it's not a story that has any personal meaning to me. I found the setting of 1970s LA quite bland even though it shouldn't have been and the characters generally uninteresting including the monster. I don't mind the idea of the monster's origin story but it's still not really interesting enough to carry a whole film in my opinion, unless it was done really really well. I think had the film been set somewhere more isolated it would have helped a lot. There is not a whole lot to like about the film for me apart from a few decent scenes and the stereotypical horror film moments of stupidity are there for a few unintentional laughs along the way. I'd say the film is worth a watch for horror fans but I'm not sure it's really worth the price of entry so see if you can watch it another way at some point in the future."

So MAYBE ... if it is a real urban legend ... the emotional suspense is much better than in countries where this entire culture (like Latin American culture) is just non existent.\n\nBecause of that .. the \"evil thing\" that was haunting the characters was just that .. some generic \"evil thing\". Character reactions, decisions and motivations were also fully predictable and never surprised.\n\nI would rate this movie 5/10 because it is not particularly \"bad\". It is competent in what it shows .. but never surprises. All characters, the good and evil .. are 100% replaceable by other movies characters."

The tension is at the top. The places are good. Ending is beautiful and it makes you think haha.\n\nAnyways, rewatching matters guys! And I can't wait to see the director's next film!!"

(I'm sorry for my English, I'm trying:)) My nephew and I have seen a lot of horror movies over the last few years. Every clich\u00e9 we have seen in all those films were combined in La Llorona. A big house, a mother alone with there children, a demon who is entering there house, a scream for help at the church and a big CGI ending which one was way too much. The idea of the story has its potentials. But the plot is an easy, predictable play with some cheapass jumpscares.\n\nWhat makes a good horror movie? If you ask me, its very simple. I think a good or great horror needs to hide his demon, pain or whatever the horror makes, to the end. Like when the ending is bad, you just had a good time finding out what was standing in the dark. (Like 'It Comes at Night'). Give the audience time to think what is really happening. La Llorona was easy to play, like a fifa game against a 6 years old boy. After 5 minutes you were done.\n\nI'm not asking too much of horror annymore. I'm happy with a simple script. I know the director and the executive producers wants to attract a big public to earn there investment back or even make some profit. But please, don't treat us like children. I'm only asking for a film that don't tell there entire plot after ten minutes."

It created a tense situation and the story too had some layers which made it better than The Nun. The thing where this one falls back is too much use of jump-scares and I also the movie was very loud. Being a hardcore horror fan these was ok to me but loud music became irritating at times. Also I think the ending was dragged for too long. It was literally a 30 minutes long ending scene.\n\nThis one is impressive than The Nun but still had flaws."

La Llorona is more annoying than scary, letting lose the usual horror scream that has graced every ghostly horror chicks mouth since the woman in black founded it (that however is a great movie).. It has extremely tenuous links to the conjuring series in the form of Father Perez, who randomly blags about his run in with Annabelle then he disappears only to be replaced by an equally if not less useless character in the form of Raymond Cruz. His character has to be the most pointless character I've ever seen on film, he actually just walks off at one point during the final 'terrifying act', probably to phone his agent or the dole office as that's were he'll be headed after that performance. The kids were the best actors in this film, they did a great job pretending to be scared of a really not scary antagonist in the form of La Llorona. In summary, even if someone offers you money to go watch this don't bother. You'd have more fun having a colonic irrigation.."

The Curse of La Llorona is the most recent Conjuring spin off and it's a mostly mixed bag of jump scares, some cringe-worthy dialogue, and even a few fun moments.\n\nAt its heart, La Llorona is a classic ghost story. It centers around a widowed single mother whose job in Child Protective Services leads her to investigate the case of two murdered children. It seems like their mother might have done it, but she tells a very different story - La Llorona did it. Pretty soon after, the caseworker and her children are haunted by the title character who plans to murder the children.\n\nIt's not a bad concept for a film and there are some moments that really elicit some chills. For some reason, the filmmakers have decided to bring the title character out of the shadows far too often which really minimizes her scare factor, especially when seen in bright lights. I find it hard to believe they were so enamored with the makeup design (which looks a bit like a white faced version of the wrestler Sting) that they felt it needed to be seen in such elaborate detail. A few more shadows here and there could have made her much more frightening.\n\nThe finale isn't quite as exciting as it should be, but it's not a complete waste of time."

The storyline was very well written and everything was well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters weren't very interesting, nor well-developed (except, La Llorona), but they were kinda likeable. I have to admit, it was a kinda scary movie and there were too many jumpscares, but most of them were definitely predictable. The opening scene was definitely unexpected, it was very intense and definitely promising. Gladly, it was a fast-paced movie and each scene was very intense and creepy. The ending scene was definitely predictable, but the 3rd act was absolutely enjoyable. In my opinion, La Llorona's appearance was very spooky, however I expected something way darker and sinister. Overall, it was a nice movie, very intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, that movie definitely deserves a sequel and I would definitely watch it!"

That's how dumb they are.\n\nThis movie had a promising start but unfortunately it ends up feeling more like a parody.\n\nYou are better of watching Mama (2013) instead."

The horror elements were only the jump scares and you will enjoy those jump scares.

Yes, it's a part of the Conjuring universe. It's the Conjurverse. It's a functional ghost story. There are horror moves but few actual scares. It really needs to be from the kids' point of view. After the success of It, one would expect a studio would be happy to do some copying. It shouldn't be about Anna even if she's the bigger actress. It's also annoying to have the little girl do stupid things. That doll scene is not scary. It's frustrating. Otherwise, the kids are fine. They just need a scene to develop their personalities beyond running from evil. As for the style, the movie needs more 70's. There is a general grimness and various period touches but it needs more. It needs more pop music than Superfly despite the costs. It needs to add exterior scenes of the era even if it's news footage. It needs to get more of the feel of 1973. Overall, this is just good enough for a pass but nothing more."

The producers had in their hands a legend, you can create such good scares with ambiance and just story telling putting the audience on the edge of his seat to see who that widow is, but no, we see her face in the first 5 minutes. Thirdly and lastly, towards the end, they did a weird choice of cut scenes with actions happening for 2 seconds then dark screen for 2 seconds and again in a loop for one good minute. I had to stop the movie to see if I was watching a trailer by mistake. That destroyed all the stressed built until that very moment. They also added weird comical noises of objects falling and stuff in the last scenes destroying every scary moments you could have for a wtf moment.\n\nTo conclude, not a bad movie, but so many mistakes and poor choices that made me laugh more then be freaked."

Most of the jump scares are predictable and without much style, except for the cleverly depicted umbrella sequence, however brief it was. Acting is solid all around, from the adults to the kids. Movies seldom actually scare me these days, so I don't rate a horror flick based on fear, more rather creepiness and atmosphere. This one had both, though the reliance on bland jump scares and average cosmetic effects robbed it of potential.

Bur clearly this is working, because \"The Curse of la Llorona\" was in fact a commercial success.\n\nThe movie was clearly not directed by James Wan, which is one of few directors that managed to master the horror genre and was able to bring it to a larger audience in recent years. Even if The Conjuring 2, was not at the same level of the first one, it managed to really scare the viewer, by bringing somewhat something fresh.

There is no structure, there is no character development whatsoever, therefore you don't care about any of them and you hope that la LLarona kills them instantly, so the pain will be finally over. A lot of choices that characters take, does not make any sense and you really wonder how it is even possible that they manage to survive every time. They must be very lucky.\n\nI feel really sorry for Linda Cardellini, that took part to amazing productions such as \"Mad Men\" and \"The Founder\", being part of such an awful project. I don't even know how this could have been approved by WB. Well, I guess that people buy everything that these big enterprises throw at them."

Two of the main cast members are very talented children. You believe they're terrified.\n\nThe story, of course, is based on the Mexican legend, and the writers and director did a great job of creating a modern tale, based on the legend. This is a big accomplishment. Many times, a tale based on legend does not play well on the big screen. This one stands out, and I feel confident in saying it will be a Halloween favorite for generations to come.\n\nThe characters in peril are all more than likeable. They're either lovable, solicit your empathy, or have a perfect horror film presence.\n\nIr al cine. \u00a1La Llorona te espera!"

You can tell these spinoffs are just cash grabs without much substance at this point other than the excellent Annabelle 2 imo. This film follows every predictable horror formula imaginable and had one of the bare bones plots. There are some effective scenes that work though seem by the numbers and lacking originality. Most of this is just darkly lit cheesy jump scares with horrendous screams and ridiculous acting across the board. By the time the finale comes you're ready for it to be over. Michael Chaves will also be directing Conjuring 3 and that does not sit well with me after seeing this mediocre product. Hopefully Wan will oversee a bit more with that film. As it stands this is the worst offering in the Conjuring universe behind Annabelle 1 and the Nun."

Perhaps Cruz reading the story by firelight would be more entertaining.\n\nAs it is, there are some jump scares that came as a surprise but none were classified as eerie or creepy scary. The evil looked like The Nun, and the Nun at least had context but still wasn't very scary. Hoe can James Wan, producer of Saw Insdious and Conjuring 2 keep financing these un-scary films?\n\nIN conclusion,, this looks like a cash grab, feeding on the hispanic ticket buyer. The saddest thing about that is they never fleshed out the actual legend which is much scarier than the contrived story in this film. Horror fans should miss this one."

The ghost is quite good, the background story for the ghost is decent and most of the acting in this is pretty good too.\n\nIt seems this is ostensibly part of a horror \"universe\" with the annabelle movies which is fine, perhaps they will build it into a full set of movies. it would be nice to see more horror movies in the cinema.\n\nOverall I would say if you are a fan of horror movies this is worth seeing. You wont see anything you havent seen before but this is done better than the average in its sub genre."

The ghost is well done, and I liked the variety of its manifestations through mirrors and puddles, and even an umbrella. And I did get caught by a jump scare at 40 mins, but I'm a sucker.\n\nThe problems then come shuffling out of the shadows. Thin plotting and plain characters soon drain the story of its energy, while a few episodes of clunky procedurals crank us along, with two priest characters who surely should have been rolled into one. There's little suspense, and by 60 mins the ghost has revealed as much as it can of its threat. That leaves us with an exhausting thousand metre sprint for the finish line, a full half hour punctuated with \"I love yous\" and aw shucks humour, before all the usual tricks are pulled from James Wan's top hat. I only realised it was part of the Conjuring rigmarole by a clumsy Annabelle insert, but whatever.\n\nThe performances are fine. Music nothing special.\n\nOverall: Scooby Don't."

The plot is archetypal of a James Wann horror movie. Thanks to Jame's obsession with this sub-genre, the viewers are now starting to see Nuns in a whole new way. The problem being, viewers grow quick resistance to such sequels or prequels or spin-offs and most importantly studio-executives are not the only audience. I feel a gradual shift in the horror palette - first there were graveyards and churches, then came secluded cabins, pharaohs and mummies, urban legends of all sorts, creature monsters of all shapes and sizes, aliens, supernatural flicks, Japanese and Korean horrors and then came the Spanish horrors. Someone's surely been doing market research on this.\n\nBe ensured that this movie does not meet any gold-standard in the realms of Conjuring universe, but then it's not expected to be. Spin-offs and their installments like this have happened before and nothing sort of new goes on here. You have already been spooked before with similar wights and you are au courant with most of the scenes, color tones, ominous music and above all, the plotline. But then it happens with almost all horror movies! If there is only one horror flick playing at a multiplex and you need to feel the jolt of fear, then it's a no brainer.\n\nNevertheless, it's enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Curse of La Llorona is another spin-off of the Conjuring Universe franchise (the sixth if I'm not mistaken).\n\nIt's an interesting film based on the Mexican folklore of la llorona, the weeping woman. The legend tells of a woman who was abandoned by her husband and out of grief and anger drowned their two young boys in a river. As a result of her actions the woman is condemned to wander for all eternity searching for her lost children. She is always heard weeping for her children, earning her the name \"La Llorona\". It is said that she kidnaps wandering children at night, mistaking them for her own.\n\nIt's a decent horror movie, spooky with lots of jump scares. If you're looking for \"the next big thing\", this movie is not for you but as a spin-off it's pretty good. Personally, I liked it way better than \"The Nun\" (it made more sense to me than that story)."

Now, after watching this, I have a similar kind of a feeling. The acting was good in this movie, but there's just nothing new. Children doing whatever they're told not to do, the holy cross scaring away the ghost. I mean, it's so cliched that i dozed off half an hour into the movie. One other thing that bothered me was, the lengths that they wuld go to earn some extra bucks! This had no business being in the Conjuring Universe, still WB puts that tag to put extra asses in the seat. As if they knew that this isn't upto the mark, so we'll add that tag. I think it is evident that, unless James Wan( or Sandberg) directs the movie, it won't be satisfying."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nIt's not as bad as The Nun, let me write this straight away. If there's one thing that this movie proves is Michael Chavestalented filmmaking skills, which offers hope for The Conjuring 3. Contrary to the other spin-off of the universe, The Curse of La Llorona toned down on the lazy exposition and elevated its scary sequences, simply by having a more capable director. Beautiful one-take scenes are spread throughout the runtime, which not only increase the suspense but prove that Chaves actually works hard to provide a terrifying environment.\n\nHe also delivers some effective and innovative jump scares, even though most of them still follow an annoyingly predictable timing. These are still heavy on the cliche of \"character turning her head, big ugly monster face screams and the score goes from silence to screeching volume.\" Scenes like these aren't scary anymore and they feel dated, as well as the typical origin story. There's nothing new or exciting in an \"urban legend turned true.\" Fortunately, the backstory is simple, it isn't filled with explicit exposition every two minutes, and the short runtime helps the film to develop through a fast pacing. Sadly, it's just another common horror screenplay that the writers took from the scripts cabinet.\n\nLinda Cardellini gives a strong performance as the protagonist. Even though every character in this movie makes questionable decisions that lead to avoidable events (something inevitable in horror films), Anna is a compelling and courageous woman, who only wants to do what's best for any children, not only their own. Raymond Cruz portrays Rafael, a priest who sort of almost is a deus ex machina. He barely has any kind of decent character development, but he works well enough as comic relief to lighten up an otherwise too dark tone. The kids are good, but Patricia Velasquez (Patricia Alvarez) is way over-the-top, which doesn't help her already not-so-good script.\n\nAll in all, The Curse of La Llorona is ... okay. It's not near as horrible as The Nun, and honestly, that's a good compliment for such a typical and cliche horror flick. Michael Chaves truly saves what could have been a disaster with another director. Wonderfully handled one-take sequences, which elevate the suspense levels, and he also produced some imaginative jump scares, even if most of them still lack actual scariness. Linda Cardellini is great as the lead, but every character is compelled to make dumb decisions to move the plot forward. Some characters needed more care in their scripts, and more focus on the story to tell instead of just creating scares after scares.\n\nClose, but not close enough ..."

But that whole premise is ruined with cheap jump scares, these demon movie cliches, and just bad writing. I would say this film is pretty fast paced, but that's because once it hits its third act, it drags on forever. And once the third act starts, they decided to add comedy into it. There was literally no comedy in it before. So once they start getting down with all the \"La Llorona\" stuff, they start making jokes out of nowhere. What the hell?! WHO WROTE THIS?\n\nA good thing about this movie? The child actors aren't that bad. Linda Cardellini's on screen for the most part. And the sound designs honestly really good. So if you were to watch this, spend those extra bucks for IMAX.\n\nI was about to give up on James Wan, but then I realised that although his name is literally plastered everywhere, he's just the producer. Not the writer or director. But you know who is the director? The guy who is about to direct The Conjuring 3. So I guess the curse is on us?\n\nIf they had gotten Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n to write and direct this, then I bet that would have made me crap my pants. The Prisoner of Azkaban still creeps me the hell out to this day. What better than a native who's most likely heard of this folklore and actually has decent movies on his resume."

When there's a quiet, slow-panning camera, you just know something will happen, and then it just does. There's not much plot build up and tension inbetween the surprise appearances.\n\nThe child actors don't even do much, and considering this is about a ghost stealing away children this is a disappointment. They barely talk and interact with each other. The bathtub scene was a touching scene but the ghost appearance ends up disappointing. I only ended up caring about the mom, but felt her husband's death didn't serve much of a purpose at all.\n\nIt's a bit scary and was entertaining, but forgettable. No haunting themes to dwell on or bring home with you. Maybe the only memorable scene for me was the candles scene."

        "review_detailed_main": "Where to begin with The Curse of La Llorona. Well let's start here: it's awful. It's really, really, really awful. It's not so much that everything in the film is bad, but more so that certain parts of it are so offensively lazy, so aggressively cliche-ridden, that it completely eviscerates any potential the movie might've once had. There were a total of three things in this movie that weren't terrible. The design of La Llorona, the diversity, and the acting. But most of these are so minor that they barely are worth a mention. The one thing that is big (the acting) isn't good enough to salvage the train wreck that are the characters in this movie. Oh, and don't get me started on the story. The writers were so lazy they didn't bother to explore anything about... actually, no. They were lazy enough to not explore anything, period. If you sit down and try to predict the plot of this movie, you could probably do just that exactly. The story is so, so, SO predictable, to the point if you wonder if this was written by some sort of AI purely relying on past haunted house movies. No moment of this movie felt memorable, scary, unique, or even noteworthy in any way imaginable. The few times the film actually does introduce an interesting idea, it is either immediately forgotten or completely wasted. There's no reason to watch this movie unless you want to watch all f the Conjuring universe films. Otherwise, stay far, far away from The Curse of La Llorona.\n\nFinal Score: 26/100."

This movie is literally like re-watching The nun or the Annabelle (which were terrible as well). The monster is just pathetic (looks like a cousin of nun), and is just not scarry.

While the Nun at least had very cool visuals and Annabelle 3 knew it's lack of seriousness this movie offers neither of it.\n\nAs I said. There are some tensions moments but the negative points overshine that. The Creature and the actual folklore provide so much more potential then what was delivered. You get a generic Horror Movie full of cliches without anything that really stands out.\n\nIt hurts my heart that the Conjuring franchise just keeps getting worse. (even tho it feels like the references have just been added to make more money because the whole movie could easily stand for its self). Maybe I should simply refuse to see The Curse of la Llorona as an actual part of the universe that I've started to love."

        "review_detailed_main": "The curse of La Llorona, also known as the curse of the weeping woman's biggest flaw is its unoriginal story. The movie looks and feels like an old foreign movie that was filmed on an extremely low budget in the 90s.\n\nThe visual effects of La Llorona were just ok but far from terrifying. The film starts somewhat interesting where it is set in Mexico in 1673 and we witness a mother violently drowning two young brothers.\n\nThen the movie carries on a tedious trajectory by moving to 1973 in Los Angeles which feels quite uninspiring and dull. About halfway through the film, you start holding out for a big reveal or the climax hoping that something would get you a little animated. However, the ending of this film was also very ordinary and cliche.\n\nI had no idea it was supposedly linked to the conjuring universe considering the fleeting appearance of the Annabelle doll which was probably the one true surprise and also the major highlight of the movie.\n\nThe cast was modest but to be completely honest they didn't have any memorable parts that you are going to want to remember.\n\nI won't go on too much here. The curse of La Llorona was a bit of a letdown and overall a very sub-par film at best. It didn't leave you hooked with a gripping story but instead, it made me keep checking the timer to see how long the film remained.\n\nI don't like to be overly harsh and negative on films without good points of evidence, and my own opinions. But there was just not enough tension and excitement to keep you interested for the full 90 minutes of runtime.\n\nI like to say there was a moment or two like many films that keep you intrigued and involved in the story but for me, it didn't get out of first gear, the lack of suspense and the absence of plot twists made this a film that I'll happily only watch once.\n\nI could only recommend this film if it were on Netflix and you had exhausted your film library or it was in the bargain bin at your local DVD store otherwise don't hold your breath for an original horror masterclass. To finish on a positive note, however, this movie is slightly better than 'don't knock twice' but only just.\n\n5/10."

There was a couple of creepy scenes if you wanna call them that but there was nothing scary and there was a few bits of humour thrown in near the end for good measure. It seemed like they were trying from the jump scares too often and they showed too much of the ghost instead leaving the darkness and the imagination to scare the audience in my opinion.\n\nI can say is worth a rental and a one-time watch.\n\nIf you want to see a good horror film worthy about La Llorona: The Wailer 2 (2007)"

It is not easy to make moments like this work and to do it consistently well should be applauded. I screamed out loud twice and I don't usually do that kind of thing.\n\nThis might be a good chance to remind people who have rated this film extremely low that the best way to watch a horror thriller is not on a laptop in bright daylight. It is either in a cinema/movie theatre or in a dark room - watching a sharp legal print - with the sound turned up.

There isn't one single original idea in this film, the acting is god awful, the characters are complete and utter morons and the ghost isn't even slightly scary. I managed to guess almost every thing that happened because it was all just so formulaic. I was watching this with my girl on movie night so we saw it through to the end incase it had any redeeming qualities but it didn't and even she thought it was a steaming pile of excrement.

        "review_detailed_main": "LA LLORONA is another Horror film set in the excellent Conjuring Universe & it's a well made & decent little Horror movie. The reason i say \"little\" is the movie is very low-key, it's got a small bunch of characters & it's really all set in one place which is a big house, it's all small scale but made well with some exciting scares. I liked the spooky atmosphere & look of the film, the 1970's Los Angeles looked cool with a smoggy haze over the city, it's well photographed & the music is well suited but there's nothing Big about the film but i liked that. The cast is pretty good & that's because we get the always great but underrated RAYMOND CRUZ, I've always liked this dude since he popped up in everything during the 90's & onwards with films like, The Rock, The Substitute, Under Seige, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, Clear & Present Danger, Alien: Resurrection, Training Day & many more. Here we get the older rugged Raymond Cruz as a once \"man of god\" but has left the church & does his own thing now & tackles evil Supernatural forces his own way & he's easily the best part of the whole movie, he plays Rafael & is the man a family goes to for help against an evil Mexican legend that has attached herself to the family, she is La Llorona, the weeping woman, a terrifying evil spirit who likes to kill children!!! She's a very scary creation here & does some scary stuff. The film is a very basic haunted house story & one that does feel very familiar but it's still a good watch & a decent spook fest. The mum of the family is Linda Cardellini who starred as Velma from the live-action Scooby-Doo films from the early 2000's & there's a nice little wink that role when she arrives home from work & her kids are sat watching Scooby-Doo the cartoon on t.v & i love little bits like that. All in all this is a fun little Spooky Horror with a nice gothic atmosphere & a good looking 70's style look to everything & a very creepy evil spirit & a good role for the veteran Raymond Cruz, so yeah a good movie"

But some of the jump scare scenes were original and I pretty much have seen them all. My biggest problem is that the story takes place in the early 1970s, but I didn't think the director paid enough attention to details to pull off that era. It just didn't feel like a 1970s story. Another thing that bothered me was the skimpy backstory and logic behind the film. Also, why were they all trying to keep a secret of how they gotten their burn marks on their arm?. I think Anna Tate-Garcia should move down to Arizona with her kids to avoid La Llorona from trying to drown her kids. lol. I just don't think there was a sincere effort at creating a convincing story. So I give it a 5/10. It feels like the folks behind the Conjuring universe is getting sloppy with their stories."

Unless this is the first horror movie you've ever watched, you'll know what's about to happen for the next hour and a half of your life, and it won't be terror - just a bit of surprise and anger as you watch the characters stumble around aimlessly and keep vital information from each other to progress the plot, which all inevitably ends in a jumpscare.\n\nDon't watch this to be scared. Don't even watch it to watch all the movies in the Conjuring universe, as it's standalone. Watch it with a friend and laugh at its feeble attempts to scare you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was curious about this movie because I've heard about the Mexican legend of La Llorona. I'm not too familar with the story but my hunch is that you could also make a better movie out of it...\n\nWhat you have here is your very typical horror film where a demonic spirit is attached to a family and then some spiritual guy comes to to help them get rid of the monster. That's it.\n\nIn the beginning there is a very short prologue that is set in the 1600's. Then it switches to present time (or 70's or whatever) and I was a bit disappointed. I thought this mythical monster would have suited better in a more distant historical setting. Well, 70's is a good place in time for a horror movie but then it's also more likely to feel like every other horror film. And instead of Mexico they also decided to place it in Los Angeles. Great... you had this intersting folklore character but you decided to strip it from all of its unique quality and make it like every other monsters. That's the biggest issue. There is very little feeling of Mexican folklore, but it's more like every other demon/ghost movie with just some scary woman as a monster.\n\nEven though the movie was totally unoriginal I can't give bottom points because I wasn't bored either. I liked the visual style and quite slow haunting mood which was similar to other films in The Conjuring franchise (though lacking the visual period piece setting.) The monster effects weren't as good as the buildup. The first glimpses of the monster were creepy but when she started having more screentime it became cheesy.\n\nConclusion: If you expect something new, don't watch. But if you're a fan of demonic curse movies, then you might want to check out this basic genre flick."

However, as the narrative passes through its predestined path; things started to get muzzy. And by the third act, I was literally rolling my eyeballs.\n\nThe key issues materialize within the aspects of its Writing & Screenplay! The scenes that are supposed to be frightening, merely deliver on coveted frights; not to say the lack of urgency left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nDo they ever realize that immoderate repetitions of the same tropes over and over again make it all the more predictable and wearisome? And please refrain from putting redundant 'witticism' where it's not at all needed! I despise that.\n\nLuckily, on technical terms; things aren't that grim. The Cinematography is decent enough and so is the Score in the background. Both being very much generic; still, they get the job done! Performances aren't worthy of any special mention; but again, it would suffice I guess!\n\nThis movie is a prime example of speculative execution and wasted opportunities. The premise itself isn't half bad! Pertaining to a Mexican folktale that speaks of a Weeping Woman who preys upon children; it doesn't sound too bad. Does it?"

Well I like the horror when a bunch of kids go out to a cabin in the woods and stuff happens. This is more like The Ring or that ilk, Japanese style, you get me now. So IF you like that sort of movie this is not too bad until you get to act 3 when the ex-priest enters the picture. From that point you may as well just skip to the last minute as nothing happens during this time. You're just just waiting for it to end and it's become a giant sleeping pill by that time. It doesn't have the payoff twist or resolution of bad guy type ending it should have. It's just a let down. You may enjoy it all, it depends on the viewer. Certainly not a bad movie and my opinion is just another opinion. Ultimately this was what I thought of the film and there's nothing wrong with the movie just I felt a little uninterested by it in the final act. Enjoy."

Could probably be someone's comfort movie if your mentally unstable. It says they it's 16+ but I strongly believe that someone around 13 could watch it without any problem.

It also doesn't help that the monster at the centre of the maelstrom is such an over the top, schlocky CGI cliche that it's hard to take seriously. It's ironic that the Conjuring movies made such a big impact on mainstream horror by championing a return to minimal creaks and shadows style spookiness, but have recently devolved into the \"run from the giant scary monster\" movies they helped usher out."

The atmosphere of the shots here, from the afflicted kids wandering through the hallways in the asylum where the flickering lights hide the spirit, the confrontation at the crime scene of the children where her kids find the ghostly figure waiting for them or the spirit arriving at her house and toying with her and her kids throughout the night manage to be appropriately chilling and full of high-budget studio gloss. As these scenes then allow the continuous reliance on jump scares featuring the ghost to pop-up out of the shadows, from behind billowing curtains or reflected in wafer have a greater impact due to the thrilling atmosphere. With that atmosphere in place, the second half of the film concentrates on chilling supernatural scenes of the spirit targeting the family. As the attacks get more personal and dangerous, there's plenty of back-and-forth encounters here as the religious undertones and black magic they turn to in order to stop her gives this one some frantic, hard-hitting encounters. As the action here picks up around the house and it gets even tenser as the kids get into more danger as well, this picks up nicely even though this section tends to highlight some generic sequence. Showing them being dragged along the ground by invisible forces, thrown with supernatural force into walls or being so overwhelmed in the use of CGI for the demon manipulating the environment that most of these genre efforts feature. The other great aspect of this one is the fantastic storyline here merging together into a chilling whole. That the initial introduction to the spirit through her work causes the torment o the abduction and outcome of the family which gives the spirit a new target in the kids follows a predictable and worthwhile setup. That the spirits targets begin to affect not only the family but her as well, as the spirit also being a mother looking for her own children thinking hers are the next target adds a wholly impressive backdrop for the finale. The idea of a mother fighting to save her kids from a spirit trying to kill her to take away her children is a powerful theme that runs through the final confrontations, and when added to the influence of Mexican folklore and culture raises the film significantly and giving this one a lot to like overall.\n\nRated R: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy."

        "review_title": "A standard horror film without too many terrifying moments.",
        "review_detailed_main": "You used him as bait? No. I used you all as bait.\n\nWhen I visited Eurodisney near Paris for the first time years ago (it seems like centuries ago), I was so overwhelmed and enchanted by the atmosphere and everything there was to admire. I literally hovered through this park for three days and had the time of my life. At the beginning of this year, I visited the park again (this time with my two young kids) and it was 3 days of fun again. However, it was far from the same as that first time. If you have been somewhere six times you know what to expect and you are no longer so impressed by it. The same applies to this film \"The curse of La Llorona\". A horror movie that is part of the \"The Conjuring\" universe.\n\nThe entity La Llorona in itself is fairly well developed. But you could also say that about the evil nun that scared you in \"The Nun\". I saw the latter at the beginning of this year and to be honest I found it rather disappointing. After two \"The Conjuring\" films, several \"Annabelle\" films and \"The Nun\" it starts to look like mass production. Now, it's a golden rule that globally well-known brands always do the same thing. And that's not to deviate from its formula for success. It ensures that people aren't disappointed because they know the product very well. But with a product such as horror films, this can also lead to a worn-out formula. A worn off formula in such a way that it becomes boring and far from scary. And that's exactly what you need in a horror. Creepy moments so that fear grabs you by the throat.\n\nNot that I've ever experienced a feeling of fear while watching a horror. But this looked weak. I was looking at it as if I was watching the umpteenth repeat of \"America got Talent\". Uninterested and numb. The La Llorona phenomenon isn't remarkable. After a while, you come to know that it's about a woman who drowned her children in a moment of madness and afterward killed herself. The legend grew into a sort of parenting trick that was used to teach children some discipline. I can already imagine how old grandmothers admonish their grandchildren with a standard sentence such as \"If you don't behave, La Llorona comes to get you.\" Terrifying for the children. Not so impressive for an adult.\n\n\"The Curse of La Llorona\" is full of jumpscares. That in itself isn't a problem. At least when they are presented decently and preferably also in an original way. The jumpscares here, however, are so clich\u00e9d that you already know in advance where they will be used. The most intense and successful scene is the bathtub scene. Claustrophobic and effectively put together. It reminded me of \"The Drownsman\" (even though you can't call that movie excellent). And maybe the involvement of Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz) can be called original. He's not an average exorcist like the Warren couple in \"The Conjuring\". I tend to think of him as more of a medicine man who performs voodoo-like rituals and lavishly sprinkles tree seeds and puts down a whole bunch of candles, just to stop La Llorona. To be honest I thought it was pretty funny. The moment when Olvera picks up his samba balls. And certainly his bone-dry reply in the end.\n\nNo, you can't call this film successful. \"The Nun\" wasn't that great, but I still place it above this film if I had to arrange them in a list. Perhaps it's an interesting film for newbies to start with the horror genre. As a warm-up to discover the better stuff, as it were. For the seasoned horror film fan, it's more likely to be a disappointment. So, I kinda have my doubts about the upcoming episodes from the \"The Conjuring\" Universum.\n\nMore reviews here: movie-freak.be"

        "review_detailed_main": "Disappointing, cliche, and deeply unoriginal, The Curse of La Llorona has the potential to take the Conjuring franchise to so many new opportunities but succeeded on almost none of them. The film seems more like a Conjuring wannabe than an actual film itself, and yet almost nothing about the film seems to be nearly as scary or well made as it thinks it is. The film starts entertaining enough, with a decent premise, and a family to care about at the center as always, but the film goes dangerously downhill from there. Besides the obvious pacing issue, which slows down to a crawl as it goes on, the film's script seems incredibly generic. The acting has its ups and downs, with the script's dialogue not helping with any of it. Raymond Cruz as the film's paranormal investigator, Rafael, is the films weakest acting point with his performance and character feeling mundane at every chance he appears on screen. The worst part of La Llorona however, is that it simply plays it to safe, and is incredibly held back from the potential unique horror film it could have been. The film can be dull, boring, and at times plain embarrassing, though at times it does prove to be somewhat interesting, and also provides some wonderful shots and an adoring look- though that's hardly much compared to other films in the series all pf which are much better than this one. My Rating: 3.75/10"

I think I might have enjoyed it more if I had watched it as a standalone.\n\nSo I would say don't watch it as a part of a Conjuring/Annabelle/Warrens franchise movie marathon. I'm sure the movie itself is pretty good as a standalone but i didn't watch it like that. I think it could have been better if they had played more into the psychological aspects.

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Curse Of La Llorona' is about as bland and generic as a horror flick gets. There's absolutely zero character work here, so there's no reason to care about any of them, which obviously makes things a lot less scary in the first place. It would help if the scares weren't as cut-and-paste and predictable as they are though. There's little to no attempt to create tension or an atmosphere, and instead we're just left with the most unremarkable of jump scares to 'frighten' us. If they were actually effective it would be slightly less of a problem, but since it can't even manage to make you jump with a loud noise, you know there's something wrong. The entire film consists of characters looking in one direction as the music drains out and things go quiet, then turning around and being screamed at by the eponymous 'La Llorona'. That's not scary, it's just annoying. The narrative is very thin, too, and what's there is as formulaic as a picture like this gets. You don't even need to see it if you want to be all caught up on the events of 'The Conjuring Universe' either because its links to that are tenuous at best. It does lead to a hilariously bad attempt at tying the film to said universe, though, which is one of its more memorable moments thanks to how badly it's done. It's a shame that Michael Chaves has been chosen to direct 'The Conjuring 3' as well because there are far better directors that have worked inside of this franchise. 3/10"

The kids react unexplicably to the first encounters, not entering in shock and running to mom, instead they hide from her and conseal evidence when any normal kid would run crying to their mother and tell her what they experienced. Predictable scare scenes, the stupid action the kid does to mess it up, the curandero that fights the ghost outside the church. The writer lacks of imagination to set believable scenes, instead factories scenes and behaviors only to produce the situation he wants even though some times are not convinsing. The acting seemed ok, not bad at all actually, sadly the plot had little to nothing to offer. Watch in in DVD, rent it or watch it in any other mean, then watch \"the ring\" and then watch \"la gritona\" sorry, \"la llorona\" again and you will see for yourself how poor this movie is. My girlfriend loves horror movies, she's a jumper, once this finished she laughed and said she never seen a horror movie she didn't got scared once."

Yet I bet a majority won't wake up at night and pray to la llorona or go to the local store and buy a Ouija board, because your afraid. If these supposed scares are overdone and overrated then I call the curse of la llorona to haunt you in your dreams and see who runs and hide like the intense scenes in this film.\n\nThe film is overall a good Saturday night movie filled with some dramatic and horror scenes. The only issue I did have with the film is that they tied it in with the conjuring/Annabelle films in attempt to heighten its appeal. The mood of the transitions to the horror parts are quick enough to keep you engaged. I personally thought the antagonist was terrifying.

I got bored nearly 25 minutes into it and remained unvested the entire rest of the film. Go watch Annabelle Comes Home, that was way better than this one (but still not a good film).\n\nRIP to The Conjuring name. It is basically a bad imitation of itself. I just want The Conjuring 3 to be good.... and directed by James Wan, the man, himself.\n\nGG guys."

It's fun horror, popcorn movies, like it's more comforting than scary.\n\nUnfortunately they ran out of all the make-up and special effects making the Nun II and all that was left for poor La Llorna was black and gray grease paint like amateurs use for Halloween party costumes. If that weren't ridiculous enough, the witch doctor they hire is the New Age version of Jim and Tammy Baker. Everything he does is over the top, like he's putting on a show. I mean he is of course, it's a movie, but it shouldn't be so obscenely obvious that the actor feels silly saying his lines."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, let me state that the connection to the conjuring franchise is hardly visible, even with a microscope. It is so loosely connected that if you blink at the moment the connection is explained you might miss it. It's a shame the ever expanding conjuring universe is being diminished to an ordinary cash grab, when once it was a such a gem in a failing, hardly original industry. The movie itself, when viewed independently of aforementioned rant, is poor in it's own way. The movie is, quite frankly, just not scary. The pacing is off in so many scenes it's just painful to watch. The intention of long following shots is to induce tension, but it ultimately creates boredom. The decision making of the main characters, the jump scares, even the 'presence' itself are laughably bad. While watching the movie unfold, it feels like viewing a movie you've already seen ten, perhaps hundred times before because of it's unoriginality. The plot isn't any good while the direction is poorly executed. I'm at a loss trying to come up with reasons for James Wan to produce a movie like this, other than cashing in on some easy money. I hope in the future Wan will take up direction and story writing for one of the upcoming conjuring universe movies, but I'm afraid that's never going to happen."

A woman drowns her own children at water because husband found another woman to interest and leaved her alone. Then she became children hunter ghost! Our leading actress ( Linda Cardellini) fighting to save her children from La LLorona with the help of a banned ex priest. As said story nothing new and interesting only jump scares is much effective. Acting side in null. No one did impressive acting. Little siblings give some relief between such rough plotted movies. If you wish to experience some good jump scares then you can watch, but you expecting more than this you will be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Curse of La Llorona,\" directed by Michael Chaves, is part of the Conjuring Universe but falls short of its predecessors. The film centers around the Mexican folklore of La Llorona, a ghostly figure who preys on children. The story follows social worker Anna Tate-Garcia, played by Linda Cardellini, who finds her family targeted by the malevolent spirit.\n\nWhile the premise holds promise, the execution leaves much to be desired. The film relies heavily on predictable jump scares and clich\u00e9d horror tropes, which can feel more tiresome than terrifying. The atmosphere is suitably eerie, and the performances, particularly from Cardellini, are commendable, but they cannot fully elevate the material.\n\nOverall, \"The Curse of La Llorona\" offers some moments of genuine suspense and chills, but it largely lacks the originality and depth found in other entries of the Conjuring Universe. It's a decent watch for horror enthusiasts, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half was boring, but in the second half it really picked up some pace. I think Linda's acting was one of the few good features of the movie. The main character used emotional leverage which was the primary drive for the stories of most of the movie's contemporaries. It follows a conventional storyline for horror movies, but it ultimately fails to stand out, though there were some good jumpscares. Also, the film relied heavily on dark cinematography."

A social worker (Linda Cardellini) comes the case of a woman in LA who is accused of child abuse, but soon finds that her own children are being haunted by La Llorona.\n\nA routine if fairly well imagined haunting story from producer James Wan. The plot is fairly simple, but still manages to make many of the situations convincing, even for a ghost story. It does have a couple of effective moments, but these type of ghost stories are all too much of a muchness."

        "review_detailed_main": "AMAZING FILM!! BEST HORROR MOVIE I SEE LONG TIME!!\n\nUnfortunately this type of review permeates IMDB a lot these days, they are very obviously fake and presumably paid for en masse by people linked to the promotion of the movie. The easiest way to spot a fake review of this type: 1. 10 Stars - how many films are genuinely 10 Stars? 2. Very short reviews with no real analysis of the film just generic comments about how great it is. 3.Bad grammar, the spelling is often ok but the nuances of how to construct a proper sentence in English are lacking and although the mistakes are small they are often there.\n\nA combination of these three markers almost always means it's a fake review and IMDB should be developing a way to root them out and delete them as it is damaging their reputation."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Curse of La Llorona is a guilty pleasure kind of movie. It's cliched beyond belief, the writing isn't all that great and it definitely had some odd creative decisions (the ending showdown with La Llorona, for instance, being rather abrupt) but, for all its faults, La Llorona was an extremely satisfying movie, and a welcome change for a follow-up to the horrendous The Nun.\n\nThe acting in this movie is great. Everybody loves to attack an actor's abilities in a film but few know how difficult it is to translate the emotions in a film like this onto the screen believably, and two standouts for me in this movie were Linda Cardellini (AKA Velma, of course) as Anna, the mother, and Roman Christou as Chris, one of Anna's two children, who gave a fantastic performance and, despite this being his first major film, has shown himself to be talented in the field and has the potential to make a successful and prolific career out of it. They really helped elevate the average script to the next level.\n\nIn most every way, this film doesn't feel like a member of The Conjuring Universe. Sure they manage to give it a brief initiation (not discussed here due to spoilers), but it really does feel like the stand-alone work that it is. It raises the question, however, whether this was ever intended to be a Conjuring Universe film or if it was a film Warner Bros. was unsure how to handle so they slapped the Conjuring label on it knowing the horror fans would support it in massive quantities.\n\nEither way, despite being warned of what an awful movie this was, I walked away pleased and excited to see where the universe goes with other \"stand-alone\" films in the future."

This was not a good product.\n\nIf you find yourself rooting for the creature, and it's not the intention of the script, then it should be scrapped.\n\nThis script belonged in the garbage can, not the film can.
