The motives and background were definitely not in sync with the plot it meant to give.\n\nThe acting was not helping either.

Once you can figure at what those 3 stories are then you may have a better understanding of what is going on in this movie.\n\nEven until the very last 30seconds of the movie, if you have followed it, thought about it, and haven't dismissed it as a boring piece of randomness because your brain switched off an hour ago because of the complexity of the plot, then you should be asking yourself the question...

So these are my thoughts. I don't think any of the savagery took place except in the author's imagination. Or the sex scenes between the two women. Speaking of sex, what I found alarmingly amusing was Dermot Mulroney diving under the sheets like a seal or a porpoise without one flicker of any kind of sexual excitement. Even the ending, which I won't get into here surely was in her imagination? This was telegraphed way back at the beginning when she talked about the \"episodes\" she has when she is writing her series of bestellers..\n\nAnd the acting was pitiful and the whole thing was very rushed. And the twins were so unequal in size as to lift the eyebrows a lot. Defo one of the worst of 2021 so far. Shame on you Netflix for throwing this garbage on our screens."

I've seen disabled slugs move at a quicker rate than this. The film had no direction either, because literally nothing was happening you didn't know/ or care what was to happen next.\n\nThe \"twist\" was just pointless. You knew it was coming and it was so cliche. Really wasn't inventive whatsoever and really did sum up this entire movie.\n\nSince this doesn't spoil anything I can say this. So a big part of this film is the fact she is writing a book and it really zones in on that aspect at times. Several scenes of her writing etc. DOESNT MEAN A DAMN THING. It doesn't change the plot or outcome, it serves absolutely no purpose. Why bother???\n\nGenuinely this is just awful. I honestly can't think of a single positive and I'm angry at myself that I watched this. If you are debating it, don't."

This movie is stupid I almost broke the tv when the husband said \"there are only your fingerprints on the knife used on the bike\" Does he have a fingerprint analyst at home because how does he know? Why did he test that knife? When? So man questions. Once again netflix top ranking sets me up. But this time I created my account here just to save other people. Actually ... the movie will be great if it was described as a COMEDY. Everything was ridiculous from the acting to the plot . And even if she was just crazy and grace never existed it is still very poorly expressed in the movie, and it will be more like you are forcing yourself to believe that to somehow give a little sense to the movie because never, you have a hint that she is grace. Let's suppose (again) that Grace was never there, Elaine was her psy ok but why Elaine will ask her to be careful because grace will steal her husband if she was grace? Is it not more important for her psy to focus on her not losing herself than an affair between her second personality and her husband? And why is she not in prison then one year later for killing Elaine? I mean this is what happen when you overthink on a bad and stupid movie. I wish I never watched it"

It really makes you guess and wonder about things and also makes you go \"wth did i just watch?\". That does not make it a bad movie... however i do agree with people saying that some of the acting was bad especially Kristin's (Mary). The plot though was quite interesting; personally i think that its either all in Mary's head and both Mary and Grace are her (which is supported by some scenes where Mary does some stuff, for example slushes the bikes' tires, and then we see Grace do the exact same things) or it's the plot of the book sequel she's trying to write because many of the situations in the movie are shown in her board with the book plans. Also, when it shows Grace interviewing for a job, at first she shows off a bad attitude and then the scene replays with Grace's behaviour being the quite opposite indicating that Mary rewrote the scene (if it really is the plot to her book). On the other hand, it could all be real. Thats because if im right and Grace isn't real then how can Elaine and Tom talk about her?anyway the moment where i got confused was the ending. The woman exiting the hospital according to the theories above is either Mary (who could have been in jail -because who the hell leaves the station that easily? Its provably in her head- and afterwards sent to a clinic and found a way to escape), or Grace (who might killed/knicked out Mary and dressed up like her to get out of there) or both in case Grace isn't real and its all in her mind -that also explains why she is in the clinic in the first place-. I know its way too confusing but thats not something negative... i don't get why people are giving it a 1/10 or a 2/10...."

        "review_title": "A Truly Dreadful Film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Another day in Lockdown and another film to watch, this time it is Deadly Illusions and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an author hire a young babysitter to watch her children, when the two of them start to build a friendship and connection.\n\nMain Character Kristin Davis of Sex and The City fame plays the lead character here and she is just not very good. Her character is really bland and uninteresting with Davis delivering some really cringe worthy dialogue that made her a character that never connected in any way shape or form.\n\nSupporting Characters Greer Grammer plays the young girl that joins as the babysitter and she is also really bad here. She delivers line after line of awful dialogue and she just has some truly bad scenes that makes it hard for you to by anything in the film and the supposed chemistry between her and Davis which is never there. Dermot Mulroney plays Davis' husband in the film and he is literally just phoning it in and just playing the same character he does in every other project he is in. The rest of the cast offer nothing as well and the acting is just really bad.\n\nStory Ever since Fatal Attraction was released, Hollywood has believed they can just churn out similar films for cheap with nothing unique and they are pretty much all bad and this one is no different. This film is laughably bad and throughout it does nothing interesting and then the last act happens and it is is just hilariously ridiculous and makes no sense.\n\nScript The script is terrible, the dialogue is as mentioned above cringe. With drama, humour and romantic dialogue that are all terrible and the actors deliver it in such ways to make it seem even worse. Then someone wrote the ending of the film and they just had no clue what they were doing and maybe they should move into comedy.\n\nStyle The style of the film is awful, the pacing is so slow and literally nothing happens for ages and even when it does it is terrible. Plus this film is way too long, a film like this in 2021 should never be 2 hours long and it just keeps on going.\n\nOverall Overall, this is a truly awful film. Deadly Illusions is one of the worst films of the year so far and is one that should never be seen by anybody.\n\nRating - 1/10."

It has one of those forced endings that come out of nowhere, don't really make sense and seem detached from the beginning. A good movie builds things up over time, but somehow they couldn't manage to do that over 2 hours worth of content? Also it kind of stigmatizes mental health. Think of it as an erotic lesbian thriller turned murder mystery turned regular thriller? But none of it is good?"

The second storyline is a Fight Club ripoff where the mother develops a side personality, the babysitter, because of stress and surpressed emotions. Third is just a story where they hire a babysitter who turns out to be nuts, maybe making it a murder mystery / slasher movie\n\nInstead of picking one storyline they decided to combine them all, because what could go wrong? The end result is an utter mess and one of the most frustrating movies I've ever seen. The plot and storytelling make absolutely no sense. Acting is weak but there is no one who could have saved this script. Just terrible all around."

With two young children distracting Kristen from her work, she decides to hire a nanny and this is where I'll leave the story as to not give anything away. Is this story real? Is it all just part of a book? Is the nanny real? Is the nanny crazy? Is Kristen crazy or is her husband out to get her? There are a lot of ways this film could have gone. Ultimately, it's an OK thriller similar to those 90's thrillers like Basic Instinct, Sliver, etc. Not great, though certainly not bad. A middle of the road effort."

There were very few scenes in which anyone acted appropriately to the situation. The dialog went from mediocre to atrocious scene to scene.\n\nThis was recommended on Netflix and my wife and I thought we would give it a go.

A story is about a best-selling author, Mary who does not want to write another story as there's a tendency that she needs to have an influence on the current situation (I assumed a dark story) to have a good book. She ended up writing again on the grounds that the monetary offer was good, she got influenced by others to write a follow-up novel, and their financial situation was not that good for her to just be at home with the family. For her to continue, someone has to help look after her juvenile twins while she pens another story. Grace, the baby sitter entered the picture. As the story developed, we wanted to find out what the ending looked like. It ends up that more thinking needs to be done. I will not say that this is a bad film because it gives me and my wife time to discuss what happened. If wether the scene is real or just Mary's imagination on what's going on. There are no conclusions about who among Grace and Mary wore the killer outfit on two scenes . Maybe others can find out themselves. I can still recommend this film if anyone wants to watch a psychological thriller."

I was wrong.\n\nWhere Kristin Davies' role as a hysterical uptight flower pattern wearing rich housewife is very funny in SatC, it was just plain agony in this god awful flick. Furthermore, the storyline is a mess, the characters are completely unbelievable and the 'erotic' scenes were just cringe as f. As you come towards the end of the movie you just start wondering if the whole production team was on acid or something because it just loses all grip to reality.\n\nI wish their was a law against movies like this.

It feels as if those involved just went along with the flow, perhaps too naive or too scared of the director to speak up about the bizarre script and poor editing. Inconsistent pacing, curious but incomplete interludes and the laughable plot, combined with unconvincing acting and a pathetically weak ending, result in an altogether unsatisfactory performance. If this was produced as a showcase or proposal for a film to be made by a major studio, it would not have sold without significant improvements. As it is, it falls almost completely flat. The one bright spot (sufficient for a second star) is Greer Grammer's vindictive persona that finally emerges after far too much of her vacant sicophantic drivel in the first three-quarters. That at least was convincing and heart-felt, whereas the rest were merely coasting along."

I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but do yourself a favor, like I wish I did, and just pass this one by. I would've rather watched a family of turtles race around Daytona. Ugh."

Much of the movie makes you question the characters themselves, their nature. You live their desires, their pain, their fear, their joy throughout the entire movie. Kudos to the directors, the cast and the storyline is absolutely mind-blowing and yet still leaves you with a questionmark in the end. Maybe I'm just over thinking it, but I thought it was absolutely brilliant!"

The end product is abysmal. The writing is lazy and uninspired. For one, Dermot Mulroney's character is an underdeveloped and two-dimensional place-holder in the \"insert male here\" slot. The directing, editing, acting...all very sub-par. It amazes me that with viewing audiences being as sophisticated as they are today, this product can be heralded as \"No.1 in the U. S.\" on Netflix!

So are we supposed to believe that she's imagining the events that follow? That would make more sense than accepting the preposterous behavior of the characters. Then in the climax everything is retrofitted to try to justify the ludicrous preceding 90 minutes but still doesn't make sense. Also did Kristin Davis chip a tooth? She has a terrible lisp throughout, probably exaggerated by the poor sound quality."

She hires Grace (Greer Grammer) from a high-end nanny service. She starts having erotic dreams about the nubile hire.\n\nThis is one of those movies that used to be a mid-level theatrical release. It's a bit trashy. It has a few name actors. There is no room for these anymore. It's not good enough to be wanted by anybody. It's getting thrown into the streaming VOD vortex and be lost forever. It tries to be a bit of erotic trash, but it's not. There are no thrills except for an action scene after two hours. It has some potential drama with the cops which is quickly thrown away. These actors are not drawing anybody to this film. This is falling into the mid-level nothingness in today's cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm really in no position to review this movie, as I still haven't seen the last 15 minutes. But, if that doesn't tell you all you need to know, then you need educating about film reviews... For now, I'm going to assume the ending is predictable and lame. The first 1 hour and 45 minutes is, so I don't see why that would suddenly change. In summary it's essentially a modern day remake of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, an early 90's film that was good for its time. They've altered some aspects to modernise it, like make the live-in babysitters obsession with the mother become sexual, in addition to it being sexual with the husband. But otherwise it wanders no further from the hackneyed plot of \"obsessed outsider infiltrates and ruins family\". It's one of those films that I think people in the industry still think they're right when they have meetings around tables and say things to each other like \"We're gonna show people how wealthy this family is because people love seeing opulence!\" When in actual fact that approach is dated and considered very unrelatable these days. It kind of attempts to make you wonder whether the main female character or the babysitter character is the one causing the problems. But it just comes across as muddled and unclear. You get what might be flashbacks, might be memories, or visions from the main character of both herself and the babysitter doing terrible things, because apparently she \"gets very dark\" when she's writing... yawn. She gets so dark she randomly goes completely mental, dropping the f-bomb at the dining room table in front of her kids, after no hint whatsoever that she was about to lose the plot. And everyone reacts... as if it's fairly normal. Sadly this film suffers far too much from those annoying experiences viewers have, such as saying to him/herself \"You wouldn't do that / say that.\" Or \"Why did she do / say that?\" many times throughout the film. Ultimately, it bears little resemblance to normal people and normal everyday life, which is a shame because it's a straight up drama based on earth in 2021..."

The only reason I spent two hours of my life on this loophole laden and at times, utterly predictable erotic thriller was only for my fave 'Sex and The City' star Kristin Davis. She plays a middle age novelist going through a writers block and to devote more time on work, hires a young nanny (Greer Grammer) to look after the kids. Not long before she starts sexually fantasizing about her sweet new employee and worse, unable to differentiate if this lesbian liaison is indeed her dream or the real world. Intense, eh?!!..you may ask.\n\nNah, on the contrary, Deadly Illusions is like those typical B movies of Hollywood watched largely for guilt pleasure than anything else. The plot is unreal, the twists are laden with glaring loopholes and the climax (or anti-climax if you could call it that) is a huge let down with some unanswered questions. To put it bluntly, the film just crumbles in the last fifteen minutes. Sad to say this as there was a good concept here which got mauled and killed by inept execution.\n\nAs for the ever charming Kristin, her performance is the best of the lot and you will actually sit through this muddle of a movie only if you love her. Others can skip it safely!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

        "review_title": "So disappointing",
        "review_detailed_main": "IN A NUTSHELL: I was intrigued to watch this movie because I'm an author and author coach. The film's description says: After a bestselling novelist suffering from writer's block hires a new nanny for her children, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur. It's a psychological, erotic thriller that is so badly executed that I'm giving you fair warning here.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED: Fans of Sex and the City will be excited to see Kristin Davis starring in a feature film. Unfortunately, she's not a strong enough actress to save this film. Her character is conflicted in many ways. I thought it was sweet that, as a mom, she had different handshakes to say goodbye to each of her kids when she dropped them off at school.\n\nGreer Grammer stars in the movie and also produces it.\n\nI liked the original musical soundtrack by Drum & Lace.\n\nEvery author's writing process is different. In the movie, we see Kristen Davis' character writing her book with pen and paper, rather than on a computer. I have some author clients who do that. We also see her create a storyboard on a big board, a technique I recommend to my clients because it really helps you \"see\" the story develop and allows you to be very intentional where you place certain scenes.\n\nHusbands and wives need to be extremely careful in order to protect their marriage from external relationships and impropriety. For example, my husband NEVER drove home our female babysitters. It wasn't that I didn't trust him or our sweet babysitters. Too many crazy things can happen based on what other people think could have happened, you know? It's just not worth it. No, people shouldn't assume or judge, yet they do.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Even the title isn't original. So many books have been written with the same name.\n\nI'm surprised that Dermot Mulroney went for this script.\n\nWeird and creepy. I mean who takes a complete stranger bra shopping? That's the first scene when you realize the movie is ridiculous and it just gets worse.\n\nIt's often hard to know what's really happening and what's fantasy. Of course, that's the point because the protagonist can't either. Then again, the execution and writing are so bad that it makes you wonder if the writer and director even knew.\n\nThere are some really terrible acting moments.\n\nThere's a terribly cliched flower moment.\n\nLots of exposition.\n\nThere are twists but they're ridiculous with so many details that don't make sense. We're left with more questions because Act 3 is a complete mess.\n\nThere were some \"Gollum\" moments that made me laugh out loud. (The psycho hobbit in the Lord of the Rings)\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS: This movie is NOT appropriate for children. Plus, they'll be bored anyway.\n\nYou see a married couple rolling around under the sheets. Then later, they do it in a kitchen closet.\n\nYou see some skin when two best friends are in a spa sauna & shower.\n\nA pretty girl wears an immodest bathing suit. You see her in a bra many times.\n\nThe mom smokes cigars as a symbol of her warped and developing manly obsessions of a young girl.\n\nA woman goes skinny dipping in the pool. Later, you see part of her naked chest in a bathtub.\n\nTons of inappropriate sexual illusions.\n\nTwo women kiss.\n\nYou see some blood in a murder scene.\n\nSome profanity, crude language, and an F-bomb You see the naked backside of a man in a shower Violence.\n\nl!"

While I was writing that I was thinking: \"I haven't seen Music or Deadly Illusions, so maybe it's not the worst?\" So, I gave one of these a try and immediately regretted it. This is far below a bad movie. This is an awful movie. The story has no clue what it wants to be. The acting is below mediocre. I laughed out loud multiple times about how bad the performances are. The dialog is not good. Its clich\u00e9 stuff and so on the nose that it hurts. Also, the technical aspects are so annoying. Why are there so many cross-fades? And was the audio doing to this poor actress voice in the end? The only reasons I'm not going below a one star, is because it kept me mildly intrigued. It kept me interested enough to not turn it off. But that third act oh my god. The ending is so badly executed that I wanted to get drunk, so I could forget it as fast as possible. I still have so many questions. It's very hard not to spoil the ending, but why did this person go through all the trouble to get there? There is no reasoning at all. I'm going to watch Ted now just so I can wash away this mess of a movie."

This movie was downright boring, slow, and felt like I was putting together the smallest yet most confusing puzzle together. And not an interesting one. This movie barely if at all let who you know the characters which I understand isn't really developed fully in a movie, but this just barely scrapped the surface of anything that would want to keep you engaged. You don't even have to focus on this movie, more like slow background noise where half the movie was kind of silent. This is actually a reason I never got into watching movies, it's 1 1/2 - 3 hours of a forced plot, sometimes okay or even good, but there most the time seems as if writing these plot lines, even the writer would be best to serve his time doing something else. The acting was cringe worthy, awkward, and the part that bothered me the most was when they were having dinner, random scene again, and she told Grace basically I thought you said you didn't intrude on family time, but then Starr's screaming about her husband and Grace sleeping together, but yet the husband sat there as if he were gaslighting her as well. I mean so your telling me a couple who has a good marriage, has a nanny show up and she is sleeping with husband and wife for them to never know. And yet she got the nanny to cook, clean, and watch the kids but yet the nanny is hardly ever with them, she's what, giving massages by the pool or in the bath, and creeping about in a very drifting away movie. I just don't get it. I actually feel pity this movie ever even made it on screen."

While the idea could've been unique had it been executed properly, it was more disappointing and confusing than anything. Also, let's put things in perspective, how is she the number 1, best selling novelist?? Wouldn't everyone know about her if she was? Including the nanny that came over who had no idea who she was (mind you, the young nanny reads novels for fun and they bonded over that) it's a bit of a stretch to make her that successful and renowned, and then we never get to see her write until halfway through the movie. I'm surprised this film has Dermot Mulroney!\n\nThe villain's goals are unclear and unmotivated and nonsensical. This couldve been a good psychological thriller but it was just lost about what story it was trying to tell. Also, the bits that were used as foreshadowing pieces we see in the beginning of the movie don't pay off or work later. The fantasy wasnt really fantasy like since it just made no sense (even for fantasy) and in the end, everything is blamed on mental illnesses, of course. But that also means both of them were crazy? The ending was one of those confusing endings were nothing is explained merely because the writer/director doesn't have a clear vision either and just wants you to wonder what the answer could be. I don't recommend this."

Did the agency not check in or Mary not expect to pay for services? It was quite predictable that Grace would be a villain of sorts in the end. The way they explained it did not add up. They didn't explain her condition well enough and her erratic behaviour was never really explained, it felt like a rushed and poorly developed plot point. Also the icing on the top of this bad film is the bad acting which poorly sells this film."

It was so boring that me and my wife ended up fingering instead , batter than the brown lady got in the film in that bath with the milk. An incandescent light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe is an electric light with a filament that is heated until it glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections."

        "review_detailed_main": "Creepy, suspenseful, entertaining and keeps you on your toes. Everything you'd want in a bog-standard, decently watchable psychological thriller - until the last 15 minutes when they gratuitously throw it all out the window in something like a bad parody of the worst M Night Shyamalan movie.\n\nI have never seen a movie go so downhill so quickly in such a poor attempt to deliver a twist ending. What's utterly ridiculous is that up until this point, it does a really good job of hinting at a plot resolution and ending which would have been much, much better.\n\nIt's like they switched writers for the last 10 pages of script."
