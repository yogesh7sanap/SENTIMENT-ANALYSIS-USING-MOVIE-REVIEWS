At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.\n\nAfter nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed.\n\nTo me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it's certainly as relevant as it was then.\n\nThe tramp still rules.

Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin's unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love."

However, some of the set pieces in this are hilarious, most notably the scene where Chaplin finds himself strapped into an automatic feeding machine that goes berserk; and a nimble scene on roller skates that showcases his athleticism.\n\nSadly, \"Modern Times\" was an all too applicable metaphor for Chaplin's place in the film industry. New technologies were beginning to make his artistry obsolete, and the sadness of that is palpable in the film's final shot.\n\nI'm recommending \"Modern Times\" because it's a very good movie. I just didn't think it was as good as some of Chaplin's other well-known projects.\n\nGrade: B+"

        "review_detailed_main": "We like to think that comedy has evolved since the time of silent film. We like to think that with the advent of sound and the injection of modern technology in all aspects of film production has made just about everything better. Indeed, it's hard to argue that so much of today's fun and farce just can't exist without a sound mixer and a few boom mics laying around. Ask yourself, if you put The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) or The Hangover (2009) on mute, would you really get anything out of it?\n\nBy 1936, sound had long taken the film industry by storm. In fact, if you listen closely to the moment Al Jolson uttered \"You ain't heard nothing' yet,\" in The Jazz Singer (1927), you may have heard the careers of many shattering in earnest. Never has there been a piece of technology so seamlessly adapted to an industry before or since. To name the number of noteworthy films made after 1929 that were silent would be to name perhaps a dozen.\n\nYet with this adoption came growing pains. The cumbersome size of the Photokinema sound-on-disc machines and their components meant cameras had to stay bolted down. Actors had to not wonder too far from the mic or worse still, find a way to wear several pounds of bulky microphones under their garments. What once were dreams, stitched together by editing cuts became pale imitations of stage plays. The grammar of film essentially took two steps back.\n\nSeeing this, silent era superstar Charlie Chaplin decided to stem the tide. In 1931, he directed, produced and starred in City Lights, a romantic masterpiece of stagecraft and pantomime that to this day is one of the best examples of the beauty we lost. Seeing the writing on the wall by 1936, Chaplin decided to give the Tramp one last hurrah before retiring the character. One last bow before the tendrils of technology transforms his career into a shadow of its former self.\n\nModern Times is at once one last bow, one last look at innocence lost and one glorious masterpiece of cinema. In it, Charlie's lovable Tramp struggles to adapt to a modern technological age while causing light-hearted mayhem everywhere he goes. Throughout the film he tries to conform to working as a security guard, a longshoreman, a factory worker, a mechanic etc. yet his peculiarity prevents him from being at a work site for too long. During his struggles he befriends an woman named Ellen (Goddard) who aids him in his quest for fulfilling work. They of course, fall in love in the chaste innocent way that couples did in the films of the time.\n\nModern Times is infamous, for among other things, a soundtrack that includes the earworm \"Smile\" composed by Chaplin himself. The most famous cover was crooned by Nat King Cole whose astringent voice had the poorly covered scars of a life harshly lived. \"Smile\" to Modern Times is perfect; both as a bittersweet anthem and as addition to the American songbook. It perfectly captures the Tramp's uneasy monachopsis while hanging onto a buoyant hope of finding purpose. It's at times sad, at times triumphant but always life-affirming.\n\nModern Times is also known for large, unique and detail filled comic set-pieces that despite being around for eighty years still coaxes laughter. One after another, these moments capture the absurdities of industrial life no other film does. Whether it be Chaplin toiling over a conveyor belt of widgets or literally being engulfed by a mechanical do-dad, He always has the perfect expression to reaffirm his humanity in the most inhuman of situations. It's pitch-perfect pantomime done by a true master of the craft.\n\nOf course, being the film advertised as \"the one where The Tramp speaks,\" Modern Times does succumb to the encroachment of sound. And unlike in City Lights, Chaplin decides to inject it as part of a large theme as opposed to a target of mockery. The film is book- ended by two moments of sound, the first of which is his factory boss yelling at him through a large projected screen. \"Get back to work!\" he yells while the Tramp struggles to find a moment of respite. The inclusion of sound as an oppressor, even a personified one is an effective means of identification. Those who have heard the phrase \"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean,\" will no doubt sympathize with Chaplin's character in that particular moment in time.\n\nThe second time sound is used, is to affirm Chaplin's Tramp as a unique individual amid a crowd of onlookers. Late in the film, Ellen finds a job for the Tramp at a restaurant as a singing waiter. Right before his debut, he struggles to remember the words of the song he's to sing. He decides to put the lyrics on his detachable cuffs. Invariably, he looses the cuffs and, thinking quickly, begins to sing in gibberish. It's a prank pulled on audiences clamoring for the Tramp to finally speak on screen, yet it's one that's so incongruously Chaplin that one can't help but admire it.\n\nWith Chaplin having a hand in every aspect of the film's production, one can write an entire book fawning over the exploits of a genius so ahead of his time, we still feel his influence. Modern Times showcases that genius, filling the celluloid with beauty, pathos, humor and humanity. Years after most of today's contemporary comedies fade into obscurity, those centuries from now will still fondly remember Charlie and his lovable Tramp. I guarantee it."

        "review_title": "The Farewell Performance of The Tramp",
        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.\n\nStill, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for \"Talking pictures! Talking pictures!\" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.\n\nModern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.\n\nDespite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.\n\nAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).\n\nHe takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.\n\nThis is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.\n\nIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.\n\nThen there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with \"nose-powder\", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.\n\nIn my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).\n\nThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).\n\nAs Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of \"One last time\u0085\" A\n\nnd Chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire. Modern Times is quite plainly a blast at many aspects of industrialised living, especially unemployment and Fordist production management. However the picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself. From the beginning, sound is associated with the mechanical, the authoritative, and the austere, with the few bits of spoken dialogue being via some piece of technology such as a radio or the boss's speaking tube. Sound effects too are reserved for nasty clanking and scraping sounds of machinery and things breaking apart. Finally there is Paulette Godard's pronouncement that \"The words don't matter\" as Charlie forgets the lyrics for his singing waiter act. Chaplin was of course very good at nonsense voices, as this and his Adenoid Hynkel act in The Great Dictator demonstrate, whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his Achilles Heel.\n\nDespite all this vehemence, Chaplin is making one or two concessions to contemporary cinema. Modern Times features a lot more camera movement and close-ups than we see in his previous pictures, where he tended to stick to static long shots to preserve the best flow of physical comedy. The more technical approach here is always done for a reason \u2013 for example whip-panned close-ups are used for emphasis, and there is often a change of angle to punctuate a gag such as the half-built ship slipping out of dock. While they do draw attention to the funniest moments they disrupt the purity of the routine and are most likely concessions made by Chaplin for an audience not used to silent comedy. Modern Times is also much more variable and fast-paced than previous Chaplin features, skipping from factory to prison to department store and so on.\n\nAnd yet, of all his feature films, Modern Times includes perhaps the most protracted bouts of silent comedy, far more than the story-driven City Lights. Despite its linking plot, the various settings in which the little tramp finds himself each provide fully-fledged slapstick routines, and there are very few moments in which point or poignancy are allowed to overrule the comedy. The picture is in some ways like a compendium of the non-stop gagging two-reelers he was making in the 1910s. Modern Times may not be quite the tearjerker that The Kid or City Lights were, but it is the master's final great showcase of his primary talent."

Saw it first time in 2015, but nevertheless it's a great movie. Comedy here is truly funny, and it's not just a comedy. It tells a story, with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day \u2013 technology is changing, evolving, and if you are not keeping pace with it, you will have some hard times like our hero of this movie.\n\nActing here is very solid, actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was \u2013 no one overreacted. Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced \u2013 at running time 1 h 27 min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finish.\n\nOverall, \"Modern Times\" is a black and white silent movie (there are some sounds actually) which safely can be viewed for the first time even in 2015 \u2013 79 years after it's original release. It has some truly genuine comedic situations, it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid. Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because it's very old, but great movies are great movies \u2013 they can be viewed no matter what."

Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary film-Chaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own, with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove. Though their reality-a depilated shack \"Is no Buckingham Palace\" the two are able to sustain themselves on the \"American Dream\" of a more secure, fruitful life.\n\nSeveral aspects of the film called to mind a 1984-type reality (Though 1984 was written in 1949, 13 years after the birth of Modern Times) including the large two way screen in the factory, allowing the owner to be \"Big Brother\" to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machine.\n\nThe film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit, hardship and hunger, Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset, convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the sun's return; a hope shared by many in America's Modern Times"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Modern Times\" is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. \"Modern Times\" passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the \"automatic worker-feeding machine\"; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.\n\nThe storyline in \"Modern Times\" is purposefully naive, a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films. Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros. cartoon, which coming from me is a sincere compliment. The level of physical comedy in \"Modern Times\" is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and others.\n\nFinally, as was the case with most of his later films, \"Modern Times\" is a serious social commentary. Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released. In fact, it is arguably even more relevant today, and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be. \"Modern Times\" is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society. The opening scene, which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep, is Chaplin's warning against standardization, mechanization, and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality. Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden, because despite his enormous success and wealth, he never forgot where he came from. In the end, \"Modern Times\" is a reminder that no matter how bad things are, you can still smile. Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other, and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films. Its up to us to keep his legacy alive."

        "review_detailed_main": "It seems the people who read my reviews always give the positive \"helpful\" votes for those films I praise, while they punish my comments for the films I don't like. I guess the same will happen now since \"Modern Times\" is the highest praised Chaplin film on IMDb.com and I'm giving it only a 7 out of 10. It's a very good film, a brave and interesting satire on the great depression in USA, but Chaplin's other films like \"City Lights\", \"The Gold Rush\" and \"The Great Dictator\" were in my opinion superior and much more enjoyable.\n\n\"Modern Times\" starts with a frame of a herd of sheep, then cutting right into a mob of nervous factory workers, pointing out how the capitalism and the industrialization are treating people like a bunch of slaves. Chaplin's Tramp is one of those workers who looses his sanity from non stop work and gets fired. He then meets a poor girl, lands in prison, gets bailed out for helping stop a jail break and starts finding new jobs, just to get fired again. The story doesn't flow as smooth as some other silent classics from the famous actor/director and is made out of little bits and events which aren't connected. Apparently Chaplin made this without any script, and it shows. Also, some of his Tramp's goofy jokes today seem a little outdated and childish.\n\n------------\n\nStill, putting the flaws aside, this is a quality film with human message. In today's mechanical age it even seems somewhat visionary since the poor, jobless couple back then can easily be found even today on the streets. But not to say the film is without humor, like when the Tramp picks up a red flag on the street that fell from a truck and gets mixed up with a communist leader or when the feeding machine proves to be a real useless disaster, something the machine haters will love to hate.\n\nGrade: 7/10"

I am not a film student and so I can only guess that the film is taught to gullible undergraduates as an all-time masterpiece containing multiple levels of deep meaning concerning the loss of human identity in modern industrial society. It is nothing of the sort. It is a rather tedious mix of sentimentality and slapstick, and was anachronistic even when it was made in 1936 in that it pretends to be from the silent era, which had ended in 1927.\n\nTo be fair, there are a few funny scenes, all of which take place in the factory. The ones involving food are the best. All the scenes outside the factory are boring and many of them are hopelessly sentimental. The music, composed by Chaplin, is horrendous. Chaplin's wife is pretty, but can't act.\n\nIf the film had had a proper story developing the factory theme it could have been better. As it is, it is a typical collection of music hall / vaudeville set pieces which are only loosely connected. Many of these scenes do not advance the plot and aren't funny. The scene where Chaplin sings is also not at all funny.\n\nIn my view Chaplin was a one-trick pony with one character and a silly walk. What he does, he does well, but there is really no range in it, and those who claim there is are deceiving themselves.\n\nIn short - there is no deep meaning to the film at all - don't believe those who say there is."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous \"Modern times\" - we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much, much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga. Another example of things I just assumed I know. It charmed me instantly, of course, because Chaplin was a true genius and magician - his creation, \"Little Tramp\" is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly, for all his sweetness, clumsiness and old heart. This story apparently happens in Metropolis-like factory where work, machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we (audience) roar with laughter - I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny. Basically, everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed, until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again. What a genius!\n\nOnce Little Tramp looses his job - there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness, poverty and depression around - he quickly ends up in a prison, from which he doesn't even want to leave. However, he gets Cocaine in his salt, (Charlie Chaplin on a Coke!), saves policemen from escaped criminals, meets minister's wife (very funny scene) and gets release from the prison, with job recommendation letter. And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much, much more coming up later - it really goes on forever but its wonderful, heart-warming and joyous to watch. I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece. Film is so immensely rich with characters, stories, little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen."

        "review_detailed_main": "This mostly silent movie deals with a little man , a disgraced factory worker who goes insane from his repetitious job at an assembly l\u00edne . At the same time the exigent boss demands him for greatest efficiency and speed at work . As the unfortunate man moving from hapless factory worker to singing waiter and ultimately triumphing along the way .\n\nAn interesting and thought-provoking Chaplin film encompassing the tyranny of Machine over man, this great film has more relevance nowadays than ever. The pic contains a sour denounce on capitalism , industrialization and human explotiation . This is a vintage flick much in the fashion that sound films offended his pantomimist's sensibilities . This is a silent movie , being the only dialogue a song sung by Chaplin in gibberish Italian .Chaplin gives an awesome and sympathetic performance as a labourer who goes crazy and triumphs over adversity , just as Charles the film director proved victorious over sound . Chaplin also composed the score which incorporates the charming tune : Smile. His spouse to be Paulette Goddard is attractive in the femenine lead , playing a poor orphan. Look for a young Gloria de Haven , as one of Paulette Goddard's Sisters . She is the real-life daughter of Chaplin's assistant director .\n\nThe motion picture was masterfully directed by Charles Chaplin .This was one of the longest ones to that date . Chaplin previously directed 2 or 3 reel short movies, such as : Our hero, The fireman, Night at the show , The adventurer, The floorwalker, The cure , The inmigrant , The circus , Burlesque on Carmen , among others . After that , he made long feature films such as : The gold Rush , The kid , City lights , The great dictator , Monseur Verdoux , Limelight, A king of New York and his last one : A countess from Hong Kong . Rating 8/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching ."

        "review_title": "Charlie Chaplin's own deeply impoverished past plays an extensive role in the theme of his film Modern Times, which is probably the most potent of his dozens of films that deal with the difficult lives of th",
        "review_detailed_main": "It is a testament to Chaplin's filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot. Indeed, the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable, but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong, time-transcending message about poverty stricken populations.\n\nIt is no secret that Charlie Chaplin was more or less dragged into the sound era against his will. In the early part of the 20th century, he had built a tremendous career as a silent film actor, and had created a character, the Tramp, that was purely a silent film character who could not be transported into the sound era. Charlie had built his career and his popularity with the Tramp, and the coming of sound to the cinema meant the end of that character (as illustrated by Robert Downey Jr.'s Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film Chaplin, `The Tram CAN'T talk. The minute he talks, he's dead.'). Chaplin delivers to the world a cynical satire about modern technology as well as his own ode to the silent film with Modern Times.\n\nCharlie plays the part of a man who works a dehumanizing position in a factory in which he is little more than a component of a machine, and he is controlled like a pawn by the menacing boss, who we see mostly as a looming face on a tremendous television screen. Clearly, the most memorable scenes in the film involve something to do with the factory, such as Charlie's brief trip into the innards of the machine, as well as his warm-hearted efforts to feed lunch to a man who has inadvertently become lodged in a machine, with only his head free. However, there is a very noteworthy but fairly subtle subplot that quietly reveals Chaplin's fondness for the silent film.\n\nThe first and most obvious thing is that for the most part, this is a silent film. There are intertitles, there is precious little dialogue, and the film's main character doesn't utter a sound until near the end of the film. But there are also a lot of other things that more subtly hint that silent films are better than sound films. For one thing, the only intelligible words spoken in the film are done so through some sort of barrier. There is the factory boss speaking demandingly through the television screen, and the feeding machine company speaking through the radio as they try to sell the feeding machine to the factory boss. This becomes the most obvious by the fact that anyone speaking on screen - such as the factory boss as he tells the men that the feeding machine is not practical - only does so in intertitles. We know that dialogue can be put in the film, but Chaplin chooses only to do this in a detached and mechanized way.\n\nThere is also a very strong example of Chaplin's endless sympathy for poor people at several points in this film. The most significant example of this is his interactions with the Gamin, played by Paulette Goddard, as well as his nearly constant contempt toward the police. After the scene where he gorges himself at a small diner (note that the window said `Cafeteria: Tables For Ladies'), he casually calls an officer into the diner and tells him to pay the tab, unable to pay it himself. As he is handcuffed to the officer, he gets a cigar from a nearby vendor and hands some large candy bars to a couple of small children nearby, who look to be the type of children who are never sure where their next meal is going to come from.\n\nCharlie plays a hard working, lower class man in Modern Times, and no matter how badly he just wants to get some good work and earn a living so that he can buy a house for himself and Paulette, things constantly seem to go wrong for him. It seems that this bad luck is used to suggest that poor people are not poor as a result of their own shortcomings, but because they just can't seem to work their way up to a better life, no matter how hard they try. This social commentary is intertwined with such skillful intricacy with the story about Chaplin's love of silent film that there is really no switching back and forth between the two. Modern Times strikes me as especially memorable because it is a very simple story that is punctuated by a series of comedy skits, yet it also delivers several different messages that are important to society as well as to the filmmaker himself. In this way, the movie almost seems to deliver these strong messages without the audience even being aware that they are being presented with these issues. It is a great way to mix entertainment with important societal topics, and Charlie's decision to finally have the Tramp utter vocalized speech is done so in an endlessly watch-able song and dance scene, adding to the immeasurable number of film skits for which Charlie Chaplin will be remembered and loved."

        "review_detailed_main": "By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism \u0096 albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the \"talkie\" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical \"barrier,\" such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism.\n\nThe title 'Modern Times' is used to deliberate ironic effect. Traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in Man's noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment; in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. Yet Chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. Even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. The dehumanisation caused by the workers' monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with Chaplin's Tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by Frederick Taylor's apathetic brand of scientific management. In these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. In a scene predating Orwell's \"Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949),\" Chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of Big Brother.\n\nChaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assembly-line approach to film-making. Chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his co-ownership of United Artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. Truth be told, there's nothing particularly distinguished about Chaplin's direction \u0096 despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of Murnau or Lang, for example. However, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in Chaplin's characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. For all the director's criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit.\n\nWhen Chaplin came under fire for alleged \"communist sympathies\" in the late 1940s, the content of 'Modern Times' was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. Certainly, within the director's distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but Chaplin was definitely not a communist; after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreign-language markets \u0096 that's the capitalist spirit! Nevertheless, Chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his Tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his US re-entry visa. Though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as Chaplin's political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. For that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in Europe."

I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air. The whole film is absurd and brilliant, crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God. Seeing the 'feeding machine' again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter. To eat is to live, it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as 'they' regulate our speech, our food, our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of 'nice'. Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities."

Being a silent film, all of the humour comes from physical comedy and slapstick which is where Chaplin shines. The technical skill that went into getting certain shots and sequences was just incredible, especially the sequence where Chaplin is sucked into the factory machine and has to navigate his way around all of the different cogs.\n\nThis notwithstanding the film isn't perfect.

And by all means he does a magnificent job.

The Tramp, is not a tramp in the beginning. He has a real job in a modern factory, that almost kills him, as the factory becomes more and more modern. He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job. Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police, who are there to serve and protect the rich. An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this. Even a new job. But honesty is not really enough. Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesn't permit you to make a new start easily.\n\nLove gives you wings, or at list hope and the power to continue. A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary. Even put his safety in danger to take care of her. And she, appreciates this. In the end, when everything is lost once again, all they are left with, is each other and that's all they really need.\n\nFor the first time is his cinema career, our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him. (Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didn't feel for his earlier women, and I don't blame him).\n\nAnd this story of modern times, like all of Chaplin's films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end. Never is everything lost.\n\nWith obvious inspiration from Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" and maybe Ren\u00e9 Clair's \"\u00c0 nous la libert\u00e9\", it made the strongest point about THE where we 're going, in all the cinema of the 30's (I think) 8) and with only Marx bros' \"Duck soup\" being able to stand anywhere close to it. Maybe the most complete, funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art, with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer. If made without a single joke, this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times."

You can see this especially in the first half, with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory, as well as the two-way TV intercom the boss uses to give orders.\n\nAlthough there is a lot of serious content - strikes, riots, poverty, police killings - the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly. You never get the feeling you're being lectured about anything, you're laughing too much.\n\nThe element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger. When Paulette Godard comes into the picture, the tone changes from industrial to romantic. And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film, more surprising since it's a farce. I'd go so far as to say that Godard out-performs Chaplin in this picture, even if her later career was less notable.\n\nYou have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is just a cog in the modern machinery. He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts. The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine. By late afternoon, he gets lost in the machinery. He can't stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital. He gets out but he doesn't have a job anymore. A red flag falls off the back of a truck. He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it. The police grabs him thinking that he's the leader. In prison, he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released. A Gamin (Paulette Goddard) is stealing food for the children. Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage. She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp. He tries to take the blame but she's caught anyways. He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing. They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out together.\n\nThis has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on. The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream. The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next. He's the cog that never really fits in the machinery. This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways. The Tramp is actually singing but it's a lot of non-sense. This definitely has a social commentary but it's still funny message movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everywhere people look, there is someone staring at a machine. Computers have become more popular than they were ten years ago. Gameboys and iPods are constantly used by young people the world over. Even \"mom and pop\" stores rely on machines. Who predicted that all this was going to happen? One person did in 1936 and his name was Charles Chaplin. The world's greatest director said all this in his best film Modern Times. Obviously predicting the future wasn't Chaplin's only intention. He also wanted to take his beloved Tramp character to bigger and more exciting settings. The gags are important for all of Chaplin's comedic pictures and Modern Times is no exception. Finally, the Tramp was given a real love interest and one who the viewers want Chaplin to get together with. Modern Times stands as not only one of the funniest, but also one of the most important movies of all-time.\n\nOne of the most famous images from Modern Times is one showing the Tramp in the middle of a group of cogs. What most people don't know is what occurs after, which involves the Tramp becoming crazy and being sent to a mental asylum. This represents something that was happening to factory workers at the time. Chaplin understood the workers' problems and was able to show what was happening to them on screen in a comedic, but respective manner. However, the main reason that Modern Times has become timeless is because it is still relevant in today's society. Technology can be found everywhere nowadays, so much so that people are now obsessed with getting the newest game system or portable video device. Chaplin feared that that would happen and he used his film to show the future decay of society. About a decade before the publication of George Orwell's 1984, Modern Times featured a factory president barking orders and spying at everyone using a television. What is even more impressive is that the television did not enter the world until the 1950's. Now, while Modern Times is a silent film, people are heard speaking, but only from electronic devices showing Chaplin's opinion on the \"talkie\" revolution. However, since this would be the Little Tramp's final appearance, it was time to give more space for more gags.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's short films concerned mostly simple gags repeated throughout its short course. When he made the large leap to feature-length films, he allowed the Tramp character to grow far from what he considered a comedy to be. He had said to Mack Sennett while leaving Keystone Films that all you need to make a comedy is \"a policeman, a park and a pretty girl.\" Yes, Modern Times does have various policemen as well as a pretty girl, but it has moved far beyond the park. Chaplin's wonderful idea to lampoon Henry Ford's assembly line involved him moving the Tramp from the park into the factory. He also renamed him the \"factory worker.\" People are so enthralled by the factory worker's actions due to how well constructed the story is. Chaplin's screenplay is so entertaining and thrilling. This is a story that makes one think and laugh at the same time. Only the Tramp could go through each job and fail miserably, but already be ready for a new adventure involving a new girl.\n\nIn Chaplin's previous works, the Tramp is mostly seen going after a girl and trying to win her heart. However, there is always an obstacle in the way, whether it be a big bully also fighting for her affection or blindness. In the end, he never does get the girl and walks off into the sunset. For Modern Times, the Tramp and the gamin are a team ready for new adventures. With Chaplin not trying to get together with her, it actually works out better for him. Paulette Goddard's performance is very nuanced and she is a girl the audience likes and was probably the smartest female character in Chaplin's film. The Tramp and the gamin's combined knowledge of hard-knocked life make them fight the oppression of the world. Even when they're down on their luck near the end of the film, the Tramp gives this important piece of information: \"Buck up - Never say die. We'll get along!\" The Tramp was always not only raising the viewer's spirits, but the characters in his films as well. The gamin was the last character he'd give his advice to and it was probably his best. Anyone down on their luck should have a positive outlook on life, because it won't get better if someone mopes all day long. For those with negative minds will lead a horrible and unhappy life. These are the ideas that people should carry with them everyday.\n\nWhile one of Charlie Chaplin's main intention was to make people laugh, he also wanted to educate viewers about the problems facing people in America. Modern Times is a masterpiece where the Tramp fights depression, gets the girl and makes people have a jolly good time."

I do not know how to find a flaw in this movie or in anything I have ever seen that was acted and/or made by Charles 'Charlie' Chaplin. Thus I cannot give it anything but a 10 out of 10. There is a consensus about numbers in reviews being abstract and arbitrary and not being necessarily able to back up the words, feelings and emotions of the review as it might be too mathematical, and in turn, ironically, way too inaccurate. Luckily, a 100% percent in math and in encompassing every other thing means just one thing - Perfection.\n\nI have recently started watching a continuous series of Chaplin material which do include his best works, agreed upon by a general consensus. I will try to write reviews but they won't inform you too much beyond how much I enjoyed those movies and how essential it is for you to include those memories in your life, possibly ;p.\n\nAs far Modern Times is concerned, my opinion as is similarly reflected by rating that it may very well a timeless masterpiece. It immortalizes the story of the times of industrial progress and how it affected the various people, even though only two characters (It is enough considering their talent). Chaplin and Pauline Goddard don't utter a noise, as was necessitated by the genre of the film and the choice made by Chaplin, and yet tell a story so profound that it might bring tears to the corner of eyes in reaction to the clog in your throat as you subconsciously contemplate if this is just one of the greatest films in the comedy genre.\n\nLastly, thanks to the people at United Artists and everybody who made the re-release possible. It shows the appreciation and love you felt to bring to every who couldn't witness it beforehand; it may or may not changer their lives but it will leave with a precious laughs and a better picture of what movies can be at their best."

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times is a hilarious, and equally brilliant Formalist Film about the rise of technology in the world, and the American dream. Directed, written by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. The film boldly made statements that at the time would have been, very controversial, and remain relevant today. However, the film is at its most impressive when one considers the care, and shear brilliance that went into the making of this film.\n\nIt seems straightforward to call Modern Times a Formalist Film, the ideas take clear precedence, while the narrative is very character driven. To further that, it would seem the main purpose of this film is to make a statement, technology and the business like approach of filmmaking are ruining the art form, however it's ingeniously hidden behind hilarious humor. The fact that the statement is so well hidden makes it all the more powerful when you realize what it is. For instance people who staunchly disagree with that opinion could laugh at, and enjoy this film without even knowing the film is making this statement.\n\nThe motifs are ones that don't age poorly as some may. Chaplin chose such vague areas, that we can watch today and relate many arguments to modern day film issues. For instance the technology argument is still present today in the form of \"Digital Filming v. Film Reels\", or \"Computer Generated Images v. Practical Effects.\", etc., both modern arguments hold similar issues with the \"Talkie v. Silent\" argument of the 1930's. Chaplin consistently shows motifs such as the outcast being exiled for a more uniform approach (the black sheep imagery helps parallel this), the overly complicated, often dysfunctional way Chaplin sees technology , or his pessimism towards society, through a showing of eternal optimism. It's similar to when a filmmaker makes you empathize with a character you've grown to hate. All of these motifs are subtly hidden under hilarious gags, so they don't feel preachy, or heavy handed. This approach requires care, and talent, some of the best directors today can't even send a message as subtly as Chaplin did. Part of the reason Chaplin did so well hiding his views was his ability to, for the most part argue his point objectively. By that time colors were being used to influence audience opinions, red made audiences feel uncomfortable, while blue emphasized happiness, Chaplin avoided any colors. Not only did Chaplin avoid coloring his film, he showed the contrasting views, something most filmmakers wouldn't do. It's the brilliant subtlety, and balance that makes Modern Times such a great piece of art. Chaplin carefully crafted a film with a message, but made his film enjoyable for all, which is a true accomplishment. It's truly amazing to see a film that can send a message through the opposite viewpoint, and I can't stress how truly brilliant it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Tramp must face up against the industrial revolution in this Charlie Chaplin film that marks his first foray into political commentary. The film was made to comment on the Great Depression and the effect automation and industry had in making it happen. At least according to Chaplin himself.\n\nBeyond that the film is your typical Charlie Chaplin film. The Tramp is introduced, the Tramp faces difficulties, physical comedy segments, the Tramp meets a girl, the Tramp does something funny to impress the girl, difficulties, physical comedy, and it all ends in a funny, bittersweet yet uplifting way. If you've seen Chaplin's other films, you've seen this for the most part.\n\nThat being said, the sets in this one are some of the best I've seen. Modern Times has some of the most iconic comedy scenes in cinema history for a reason. I also really like the heroine played by Paulette Goddard. A girl of spunk, character and resources, who takes care of the Tramp more than he takes care of her, which is a refreshing turnabout. Especially for a film this old.\n\nModern Times is a fine film. Personally I do find it a bit too segmented to be a great film, and Chaplin's style of humour has never been my forte. But it's a fine film, no doubt about it."

It's a difficult job to foreshadow 21th century in 1936 but Chaplin did it with a perfect way that's why I adore him and his movies.\n\nFurthermore, it represents many features of capitalism -today's economical and social model- with a satirical way of point. You may watch very \"direct\" political movies but don't like them because they focus on a specific kind of audience. However, Chaplin directed/wrote his movies for all sort of audiences in a very repressive time. He risked many things to make us watch these masterpieces."

Being 21 years old I may have a different view on comedy and older films but I failed to see the deep emotional side of this film.\n\nThe ending is emotional, thought out and very touching, but I personally felt that the simple plot consisted largely of slapstick comedy (which I have never been fond of) performed by a protagonist who could not function as a normal human being in modern society. Because of this, I found myself unable to relate to the film. I believe that a more 'normal' protagonist could have given this film much more meaning... saying this, if we had a 'normal' protagonist then this would not be a Charlie Chaplin comedy film.\n\nTo summarise, my relatively low score out of 10 comes down to my age, my lack of understanding of Chaplin's history and my dislike of slapstick comedy. The reason the score isn't lower is due to my respect for Chaplin, silent films and old cinema as well as finding some of the moments in this film both amusing and touching."

She is made up, beautiful, dressed nicely enough, and has a face full of laughter and charisma - impossible to believe the circumstances of her life have been too difficult, as the film wishes us too.\n\nThe apparent confusion on whether it ought to be a silent or sound film adds to the problems, sometimes giving title cards and sometimes spoken word, and to top it all off, even Charlie's performance is not at his usual high standard - tending to overplay things.\n\nThematically it is splitting. On the one hand it may be an argument for creativity and individuality amongst a rigid, soul-sucking, mechanical world - and this is a fine message - but on the other hand it glorifies thieves.\n\nAll things considered, I would say modernization did not suit Charlie very well."

The story was creative and fascinating, with imaginative concepts and energetic cinematography. It was a fun watch for sure. Delightfully absurd, yet it did give voice to the woes of unemployment and the voracious appetite of capitalism at the price of some disposable human equipment. Silliness with a sting.

        "review_detailed_main": "Could any other actor recycle the same character so many times and make it fresh and insightful each time? I think not. The Tramp (Chaplin) does what most people would really like to do to the assembly line that underpins modern industry that we love for its bounty and hate for its dehumanizing characteristics; he thumbs his nose at it. For that his character pays the price. And, yes, he pays the price for some of the usual perils of 1930s life -- its poverty and its desperation. He takes the blame for stealing a loaf of bread that a damsel in distress has stolen so that she could sate her hunger. Picking up a red flag that has fallen from a lumber truck, he becomes by accident a communist agitator who ends up in jail for what was then a serious crime. He keeps his humanity in a world that punishes assertions of humanity with hunger and humiliation.\n\nTo put it simply, Charlie Chaplin masters, as no comedian since has, the art of saying as much with the fewest words; insteadhe expresses himself physical comedy that nobody since can imitate. He demonstrates as nobody else could the absurdity of the harsh realities of the assembly line that dwarfed persons in his time -- and that there was still some life to the esthetic of the silent movie. He offers double-barrel laughter: we laugh at the circumstances, but laugh with him, with a twinkle and a trace of a tear. Nobody else has succeeded at that since.\n\nToday we see more talking heads, more people resorting to body functions, more self-pity, and lots of four-letter words and blasphemy. Yet it is Chaplin who puts humanity into humor as few others before (Mark Twain? Will Rogers?) and few since could. We laugh with him, and laugh at the things at which he pokes fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "A timeless classic, just as relevant today as in 1936.\n\nYou have the usual Charlie Chaplin ingredients. First you have the incredibly funny and creative visual comedy. Pure creative genius. Plus you have the usual emotional content.\n\nChaplin's previous classics - The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus, City Lights - all had these and are fantastic movies.\n\nHowever, Modern Times trumps all those. Not only is it hilariously funny and bitter-sweet but it has social commentary too. Chaplin takes aim at the dehumanizing effect of factory work, and the general way workers are treated. While the picture he paints makes us laugh, rather than make us angry, behind the comedy there is a lot of truth. This satire is still relevant today. It doesn't have to be factories, it could be any workplace.\n\nSuperb direction by Chaplin. He is more known for his acting antics and creative scripts but the camera-work here is fantastic.\n\nOther than the all-round Chaplin brilliance, the other standout in the movie is Paulette Goddard, who plays his love interest. Beautiful with an endearing waifishness, impishness and sense of humour, she matches Chaplin step for step. (She was to become Chaplin's third wife shortly after the movie was released).\n\nAn all-time classic."

As a boy, I didn't much care for the Charlie Chaplin shorts that were shown on TV - not even after I'd had an encounter with him as a schoolboy in Switzerland. He walked past me and said \"Bonjour\" as I was returning from the village bakery in Glion with some bread and milk for my school colleagues. I preferred Laurel & Hardy. However, the position has now reversed.\n\nThe film is a series of segments all of which contain amusing sections whether Chaplin is taking coke in prison, roller-skating blindfold in a department store or dancing at a night-club. There was a section that didn't need to be included - the 2nd time the machinery gag was used and the boss's head gets stuck. Paulette Goddard had some good moments, eg, she knows how to get by on the street and it's quite satisfying to see her going to bed in the department store, but I felt that she was too old for the character that she was playing. No way was she a teenager!\n\nI found the film funny. It's a love story with hope and it gives us the great message that you can have absolutely nothing and still be happy. Chaplin has converted me. I wish I'd said \"Bonjour\" back to him all those years ago."

When the tramp gets arrested for the 3rd time I realized this boring repetitive movie for what it is. There is no way it's better than apocalypse now, 2001 a space Odyssey, reservoir dogs, and so much more even for it to be on the same list as them is a joke a pathetic joke the great dictator was good at best city lights was also good out of dated but good I liked this movie then I quickly hated it boring would not recommend."

        "review_title": "amusing semi-socialist picture",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is an interesting historical film. When it came out in 1936, the Depression was at its height and unemployment was rampant. Because of this, Socialism, Communism and unions were all on the rise. Considering how poor everyone was, these seemed like pretty attractive alternatives. This film was actually a radical political/social message wrapped up in comedy set in the very near future--if it had been presented as a drama, there's a good chance Hollywood would not have made the film. It's about the dehumanization of the worker and this movie as well as Chaplin's political leanings would later come back to haunt him during the Red Scare.\n\nBut, back to the movie. This film is essentially a series of vignettes all strung together with a schmaltzy plot. It's a shame really, as all the vignettes are good but the plot that connects them is by far the weakest part of the film--partly because Paulette Goddard was NOT a teenager (she was just way too old to play the part) and partly because the moments between her and Chaplin tended to be the slowest and most saccharine in the film. Now I am not saying it's a bad film--far from it. It's just that this element is not the best aspect of the film. Chaplin's timing and athleticism is actually the star of the movie. The film is incredible to watch as he roller skates, glides through AMAZING looking machinery and almost dances through the film. It's a wonderful film technically and fun to watch.\n\nPPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies. After each one, my appreciation for his talents increased. In hindsight, I think a score of 9 is more in order. While it's true I'm not much for pathos, I must acknowledge his amazing talents."

        "review_title": "maybe not as entirely, artistically fulfilling as City Lights, but it might just be funnier",
        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin is a true master of at least a few things, and all within a specific world that he's created and fully culminates in City Lights and, even more notably in Modern Times: he has running gags all over the place (his 'Tramp' character getting involved in that is), including always being an unintentional klutz by way of too many people or too much to get acclimated to with the machines and other little things in the world, and somehow getting into trouble and being thrown into jail. But there's also a lyricism to it too, a sense of pure whimsy that while it has been aspired to by the likes of De Sica and even Benigni (the former has probably gotten the closest and topped Chaplin's style), has rarely been matched. Modern Times is a very fine example of Chaplin's world, and when I wasn't laughing myself silly, aside from a couple of notable moments with the Gamin, I had a big goofy smile on my face, which in the end is Chaplin's main message (his final words, unspoken of course, are 'come on, smile). No matter what happens, there's always a good heart somewhere in Chaplin's work, probably one of the purest too.\n\nWhile I could argue about which one of Chaplin's great films, this and City Lights, triumphs more on the basis of being more memorable or not in terms of showing the sense of prevailing loneliness and despair, Modern Times ends up working so wonderfully in its comedy and absurdism that I would at least be more inclined to say this film is funnier. Sometimes I couldn't believe how ingenious the touches got, and it often was accompanied with a precursor- I often said a 'oh no, here we go again' before a gag I knew was coming, like when the tramp is eating a meal in prison and puts too much \"salt\" on his food (really a secret nose powder, a hilarious allusion to cocaine), or when he gets sprayed by the alcohol barrels (while still wearing roller skates he found in the toy story). I also couldn't get enough of the moment when working as the assistant in the steel mill he gets his supervisor stuck in the gears of the machine, only to break for lunch and though not getting him out right away, does do his best to keep the man sated with food. Or a little mishap that sends an unfinished boat sailing off, or getting a chicken stuck in a lamp in the buzz of a restaurant...\n\nAnd so and so forth. Chaplin puts his character- and his lady in the form of a 'Gamin' played brilliantly and charmingly by Paulette Goddard- in the time frame of the title. Not just with what happens at work with the introduction of new technology, and the insanity of the industrial age (another tiny running gag- the tramp can't stop moving his body even after he stops turning the screws), but the social side as well. It's sad that the United States immediately called Chaplin a communist, because for all of Chaplin's sympathies and depictions of the working class in the film, he's always playful in mocking the wealthy and considering the time frame (it was the depression after all, I'm sure more than few could relate to having a shabby house like the tramp and gamin get). There's the sense in the film too of how modern something like a union march or a strike are, and in general I got the sense that Chaplin was out to mock the dangers of going too far with the processes of industrial age and all, and of the added authorities that goes with it, not capitalism itself.\n\nBesides, Chaplin's sense of morality is meant to be a given- if one's seen City Lights one can see it even clearer and stronger there. The same poetry of that film might only come out in spurts here, like when the tramp has to sing for the restaurant crowd, or the last scene. But it's really how Chaplin pushes the boundaries of the absurd in a manner that's never meant to be too mean or cruel (even with the police he gets his jabs at them in a playful manner). The use of sound and music are also extraordinary here, as the only time we hear voices, aside from the singing, are through mediums, and also the sounds of gun-shots. There aren't any gray areas in Chaplin's black & white world, but then there isn't any need for them, if anything it would shatter the atmosphere and innocence of the main characters. And even set in the 30s, it hasn't aged much at all; it's very likely one of the great comedies of its time, or any time."

        "review_title": "Buck up - never say die. We'll get along",
        "review_detailed_main": "Although \"Modern Times\" was made as late as 1936, nearly a decade after the coming of sound to the cinema, Charlie Chaplin decided to make it a \"silent\" as he had done with his previous film, \"City Lights\" from five years earlier. I place the word \"silent\" in inverted commas because both films make some use of sound; both, for example, have a recorded musical soundtrack. (Chaplin, a gifted musician as well as a comedian, composed this himself, as he did in a number of his films). \"Modern Times\" also has sound effects and a limited amount of spoken dialogue. Chaplin himself does not speak, but does sing a nonsense comic song.\n\nThere were two reasons for Chaplin's reluctance to embrace the sound revolution. Firstly, he had grown up during the silent era and had become a master of the art of silent comedy, which was very different to verbal comedy. Secondly, he wanted to make films for the whole world, not just for English-speaking ones. \"Modern Times\", however, was to be his last \"silent\"; his next film, \"The Great Dictator\" from 1940, was a fully-fledged talkie.\n\nIn \"Modern Times\" Chaplin plays his iconic Little Tramp character, now a factory worker on an assembly line. Unable to cope with the work, he suffers a nervous breakdown, and the film then chronicles a further series of misadventures. These are too many and varied for me to write a full synopsis, but the themes which run throughout the film are the Tramp's essential innocence, his inability to cope with the stresses and complexities of life in 1930s America and his love for a girl whom he meets in the course of his adventures. This girl, played by Chaplin's wife Paulette Goddard, is sometimes referred to as \"Ellen\", although in the cast list she is simply referred to as \"a gamin\". (This surprised me. I always thought that \"gamin/gamine\", like \"blond/blonde\" and \"fiance/fiancee\", was one of those French loan-words which always take an extra \"e\" in the feminine, even in English).\n\nThe most famous scenes in the film are those set in the factory, in which Chaplin satirises the production-line techniques of modern industry. On one level these scenes are highly comic, but they are also serious in that they highlight the way in which each worker's role is reduced to that of repeatedly performing a single unskilled task all day long. Management even begrudged their workforce taking time off for meals; at one point the Tramp is subjected to an experimental \"automatic feeding machine\", designed to do away with the need to lunch breaks by allowing workers to be fed at their posts.\n\nChaplin's critique of the soul-destroying effects of industrialisation led to him being attacked as a \"Communist\", although he was defended by Graham Greene, who stated \"Chaplin presents, he doesn't offer political solutions\".\n\nChaplin was certainly on the Left, but it is important to note that his satire was directed at the modern world in general, not just America. This was, after all, the period when many Leftists were praising Stalin for industrialising the Soviet Union, using production and management techniques borrowed from Western capitalism. Yet, although factory work may have been dehumanising, during the Great Depression people considered themselves lucky to have work of any kind, something emphasised in the film when we see a demonstration by unemployed workers. (The Tramp inadvertently gets caught up in it and is mistakenly arrested).\n\n\"Modern Times\" is a difficult film to categorise. It has been described as a black comedy, a description which is apt if one takes that phrase to mean comedy with a serious edge, less so if one understands it as an attempt to get humour from cynical bad taste. It is certainly a comedy, a film in which Chaplin was able to use his finely honed silent comic skills to great effect. (Apart from the factory scenes, I loved the scene where the Tramp roller-skates on the edge of a steep drop without ever falling off, an effect achieved by the use of trompe l'oeil painting). It is also, undoubtedly, a political and social satire. Yet the Tramp is more than just a figure of fun, more than just a political symbol. He is also a recognisable human being and a symbol of our common humanity, the little man who always manages to find hope even in seemingly desperate situations. As he says at the very end of the film: \"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along\". 9/10."

Later, moreover, Chaplin will be heavily attacked by the government on charges of being a communist sympathizer.\n\nI liked the film, and its story full of hope and good humor, but also full of sharp criticisms of the labor system, unbridled capitalism and the lack of social support for those in need. Chaplin is excellent, but Paulette Goddard is not. In addition to looking old for the role, she doesn't fit well with Chaplin. But he easily overcomes that and completely dominates the film, to the point of overshadowing the actress and everything else with her antics and acrobatics.\n\nTechnically, the film is very well done and very elegant. It is probably one of the last classic silent films, since when it came out the spoken cinema was about ten years old and silent cinema was clearly doomed to disappear."

Maybe working a somewhat tedious job and having to survive by myself out in the world makes it more relatable, emotional, and cathartic.\n\nI also think having seen a few more silent films since 2011 helps (yes I know this isn't 100% silent, but it's close). Chaplin was one of the first silent filmmakers I watched, and maybe I therefore took for granted just how good he was at the craft. His performance is great, the scenarios he crafts are great, and it's even really well shot to boot.\n\nWhile the aforementioned City Lights may have a more coherent and emotional story, Modern Times has the set pieces, and surely features the highest number of memorable stand-alone sequences of any Chaplin movie.\n\nIt's wrapped up with a somewhat sudden but still very touching final scene that I think must have been intended to give the Depression-era audience hope in their own lives. On that note, I genuinely believe this is both one of the best movies about the Great Depression, and one of the best movies made during the Great Depression.\n\nEssential Chaplin, essential viewing, and essentially almost perfect.\n\nDefinitely a must-watch."

In this way, his comedy films can strike a chord with the majority of the audience and arouse their kindness and compassion. As a result, his films were not only popular with the audience at that time, but are still loved by the vast majority of fans until nearly a century later."

        "review_detailed_main": "I can't even count how many times I have watched that initial factory scene on classes that I have being to, but this was the first time that I actually saw the whole movie, and man, it's clear that is prety damn important for cinema.\n\nFor me, what builds a real masterpiece is the fact that it is timeless, no matter how old the movie is, I still can what and enjoy it (not only with laughs, but also analysing it, or even being thrill by it). And Modern Times is definitely a masterpiece.\n\nFor my surprise I didn't find the movie that funny, it's for a good part \"cute\", like, I can't be sad watching some scenes, but you not necessarily are laughing too. But, the topics it approaches are incredible important, and relevant even nowadays. If the whole \"captalism destruction\" back then was something, imagine how it is today. I love everything with Paulette Goddard in this movie, she delivers a such powerful performance, she is charming, funny, but also can provide a raw and brutal sadness, you just fell for her.\n\nEven though at some point they just forgot about her sisters fate, the themes her family's plot talks about are real, and make us think about our own lives, and how we're blessed to have what we have.\n\nAnd again, Chaplin is amazing, you can almost see his dedication to the role, and everything else surrounding the movie. The guy was a genius, and even thoug Silient Movie was in a way \"dying\" in 1936, he still made a 90% Silent Movie, with writting words and stuff, and it was great.\n\nIn fact (didn't know that, I was reading the trivia section here on IMBd and saw this) this is the last American movie with that style, and, the last dialogue title card of the film, and in a certain way, the entire silent era, is from The Tramp, who says \"Buck up - never say die! We'll get along.\", coincidence?\n\nAnyways, the movie is just cinema history being written on screen. I've said that in other silent movies I've reviewed before, I really don't know for sure how am I supposed to grade a movie like this, if I had to say on issue that I had with the movie it would probably be that some comediac scenes seems \"too long\", as I said, I didn't find the movie that funny, so for those scenes were just trying to get more laughs from me, when they actually hadn't even got the first one. But anyways, it could probably be the \"common style\" of the time.\n\nTo wrap up, Modern Times is an amazingly important movie, that has some prety serious and dense subjects, but is done in a subtle way with a cleaver and lightful approach.\n\n9,5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "MODERN TIMES is Chaplin's greatest film. In fact, it is one of the greatest films ever made! It stars the great Charlie Chaplin, who also (as usual) wrote, produced, and directed! His leading lady is Paulette Goddard, as the gamin. Henry Bergman is the cafe manager at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, and Chester Conklin is the mechanic caught in the machinery. Stanley Sandford is Chaplin's partner on the assembly line in the factory. Chaplin tells the story of a man who tries to succeed in these modern times. His opening title tells us \"Modern Times-a story of individual enterprise, of humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.\" This sets the stage for a realistic yet hilarious film about a homeless man who has lost his job at a factory. He meets up with a gamin of the streets. He is convinced to help them get a nice home in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Along the way on the streets, he is put in jail. Then he foils a jailbreak. Then he is set free. Then he is put back in jail. Then he escapes and meets the gamin. Then he gets a job as the night watchman in a department store and is sent back to jail for helping in a robbery during the night. He then meets up with the gamin, who has found a shack on the waterfront for them to live in. Next, the tramp gets a job in a local factory, but only succeeds in creating some havoc. Afterward, he gets into a fight with a policeman and is jailed. Upon release, he finds the gamin working at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, where he gets a job as a singing waiter. He proves a success at singing an impromtu song and dance number, but then the authorities arrive. They have come for the gamin. She has run away from juvenile officers after the death of her father! Together, Charlie and the gamin make an escape. The next morning, they decide to take life as it comes, and they set out down the open road, hand-in-hand. This is a touching finale to this story of technology. It is a classic and should be seen by everyone; not just as entertainment but as an eye-opener about today's modern times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin is certainly funny enough. In this movie he shows off his talents in slapstick and acrobatic humour as well as the masterful use of irony for shock value.\n\nUnfortunately, the stoccatto changes in plot and setting didn't help it much and it feels like a collection of shorts featuring this \"tramp\" character strung together.\n\nAt first he's a factory worker where automatisation goes awry, then he's a jailbird, then some sort of burglar, and, most significantly throughout the second half of a movie, a romantic character.\n\nHe's not a stable character, either. At one funny juncture in the movie, he threatens to acquire a house by \"any means necessary, even if I have to work!\" which would be funnier if he'd been established as a lazy slacker, but let us not forget the movie opens with him hard at work in full factory worker's habit in the first vignette. Really the only trait that accompanies him throughout is his tendency to get swept into situations against his will.\n\nIt's also very difficult to make constant slapstick funny, especially in a live action movie. And this style of humour comes to have a necessarily patchy laugh factor when it's strongly relied upon in a film.\n\nI understand some attributed communist leanings to the film. A stretch of the imagination indeed. I wouldn't try to draw much deep sociopolitical commentary from this one. Nor do I agree that it deserves to be placed amongst the greats. It's a light entertainment piece that features a respectable comedic performance from Chaplin, namore, naless.\n\nHonourable Mentions: The Hour of the Pig (1993). A scathing critique of medieval society as judicially inefficient, irrationally superstitious, and corrupt. And it just so happens that this is also a valid critique of modern times."

Yeah call me what you want, but I do not like them. I think they are boring and have no place in today's modern times. Modern Times, get it? This will be the last silent film I will review for a while, not even giving City Lights a shot. I will, however watch the Artist and another Chaplin \"classic\": The Great Dictator. Let's see how those do, since this movie is not funny in almost any way."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Modern Times (1936)' is considered to be the last American 'Silent Film', made long after the era had essentially come to a close. It's fitting, then, that some use of sound seeps into the piece and usually signifies the modernisation of society, machines replacing man and bringing audio with them. It also gives us the first taste of The Tramp's voice, as he is forced into an uncomfortable situation simply to find work - though the song he sings is gibberish to keep the scene universally understandable. This picture is perhaps Chaplin's finest silent work because it not only has a message, taking a stance against the industrialisation of the workforce and its replacement by unthinking machines, but is also riotously entertaining throughout. It puts a smile on your face in the first scene and keeps it there until the last. Each slapstick set-piece comes incredibly close to brilliance, with a few easily crossing that threshold, and the feature is funny in the way only a film of this kind could be. It really is effortlessly entertaining and endlessly enjoyable, remaining a purely visual treat from beginning to end with some fantastic themes and inventive scenes. There isn't really a moment that doesn't work and the Tramp remains as endearing as ever. It's made even better because of its underlying point, one that is all the more relevant today and was actually somewhat clairvoyant, and is certainly one of the most purely cinematic pictures I've ever seen. It's a proper Chaplin classic. 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A TIMELESS story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the most timeless theme in any Charles Chaplin movie - a man's struggle inside the insanity of the modern world. Technology is technology, no matter how advanced and small. And novel technology, no matter how good it might look on the paper, doesn't usually work as it's supposed to (the magnificent scene with the automatic feeder). Already in that era, Chaplin compared the people rushing to work with the herd of sheep, a metaphor that is widely overused nowadays.\n\n'Modern Times' is a pure lighthearted comedy, with slight tragic undertones, but in this case, they are so brief that barely the audience has the time to shed a tear when another fantastic burst of humor wipes the drama out of our minds. Yet, this is not a simple comedy. Lighthearted, I said, yes, but the movie carries a heavy message.\n\nChaplin performs some of his better-known stunts - rollerskating in the department store and swimming through the heavy machinery and of course the unforgettable singing scene at the end. I'm sure that people at that time were quite surprised by how good a singer Chaplin was. And how anyone can forget Paulette Goddard as a fiery-eyed Gamin. That performance is the epitome of a self-reliant strong woman who can handle any situation. Real badass woman.\n\nChaplin has created a movie that offers us joy even nearly ninety years after its release. And with the final uplifting line from the movie I end this review - Buck up - never say die! We'll get along."

        "review_detailed_main": "Soon after the release of \"City lights\" Charles met a young actress who was destined to become his next and second best (in my opinion) leading lady Ms Paulette Goddard whom he later married. As Chaplin was nearing 50 and the silent movies were gone for good by the mid-1930s he had to make some changes in his familiar image of Tramp, the way he was presented and the circumstances he could be under at the time being.\n\n\"Modern times\" was a transition point for Charles being a partially sound feature movie with synchronized sound effects and a song at the end sung by the master himself. The movie is a great satire on the post-Depression period in the United States' history when a little Tramp having had a nervous breakdown at the factory he was working at (greatest opening sequence ever and the most hilarious scene of all is when a self-feeding machine beats the Tramp with a mouth-wiper), went to jail and after being released from it had to go through hell to get a job and make a living.\n\nBut Tramp quickly loses interest in trying to get a job as he is no good at anything and he wants to return to jail, the only place where he was happy and didn't need to worry about the future. That's when he meets a girl who is as lost as he is and together they must find a way, an open road for the two of them, to survive in this rapidly changing modern world.\n\nChaplin always spoke loudly about poverty and people living from day to day without hope but this time he also touched upon changes that came with the Great Depression into the country: incapability of rehabilitation for ex-convicts and ordinary people in order to get a job, manpower for machinery substitution and even the drug trafficking. Charles himself changed a lot: he wasn't a young man anymore, he had become bitter about life and the times that were a-changing so fast and he felt the urge to speak his mind about it in his own manner, the one that anyone can understand, relate to and sympathize with; but no matter how difficult the modern times are we should never forget how to smile and keep going forward."

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times is funny movie about a factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) who always tries to do the right thing in work and life, but he always gets a negative result and gets fired. The movie is also about a homeless woman (Paulette Goddard) who steals food for her family to survive. The factory worker and the homeless woman meet each other when the homeless woman steals a loaf of bread, and the factory worker tries to help her when she gets in trouble with the police. Throughout the rest of the movie, the Chaplin character helps the woman and she helps him until they are both successful workers in the end.\n\nAlthough the movie was a comedy, it communicated some ideas about society and workers. The theme was focused on the factory worker and his as well as others' struggle for dignity. He always tried to do the right things, even if it meant going to jail for someone else. Both the factory worker and the woman wanted to have a good life, but they often made bad choices (stealing food). This movie reminds me of Housefull, a movie from Bollywood in India. The character Aarush is like the factory worker in Modern Times. In the first part of the movie, it shows that wherever he goes and whatever he does, he has bad luck. For example, he works in a casino and one scene everyone was winning, but when he walked into the casino, everyone started to lose; that was good for the casino but not for the customers. His life changes when he meets his true love.\n\nThe movie was filmed in black and white and there wasn't much difference throughout the movie in the lighting. It is a comedy movie and shows some scenes that would normally be something impossible to happen and a person survive. For example, when Chaplin's suitcase gets stuck in the machinery and they try to get the equipment out. This part of the movie was very funny, but a person would never survive if it would happen in real life. The Modern Times film was a silent movie but some dialogue was dubbed in later. The mouth movement and words were not synchronized. Sometimes someone was speaking but no one's mouth was moving.\n\nI really enjoyed the movie, and it was interesting how I could understand what was going on just by the way they were acting; there was very little speaking. The movie did a good job of showing the struggles of the factory worker in funny way."

The film Modern Times ( Dir: Chalie Chaplin , one of the all time best directors in history of film ) starts the first scene with a good montage and this is what he continued through out the film by elaborating the meaning , the expression that he wanted to deliver to the audience. A group of sheep was walking in one shot and then in the next shot the workers going to the industry to work like everyday . A good use of montage to show the workers as brainless,robotic character who works as an industry tool only and never treated as human being. 2. Story depicted the life of the working class and in one scene Chaplin was arrested also for raising voice for workers , although he not have done it intentionally. The situation of the job crisis gives him the idea that Jail was much more peaceful and better for him, even when he was released. Even when in the Jail he fought against some troublemakers , he was not in proper state of mind , which is a good humorous way to depict that peoples actually are not with the police or the administration. But the depiction was so beautifully done that decoding is also easier for the audience 3. The main female character also here a part of the suffering society which sensitively affected by job crisis and overwork issue. And that pushed her to steal food for her motherless sisters. Depicting the poverty and this crisis situation is not regular or normal for western society film, most of the time they try to depict it with some larger than life characters, super heroes or war etc kind of subject with glamour , violence , colorful content in their films, with entertaining music etc. to focus mainly on business but Modern Times , in a humorous way brought the shortcomings, inequalities, discrepancies in the society , in a manner that it will keep on bouncing from laughter, enjoyment to sadness , melancholy mood. This film take audience to a proper emotional journey to make them understand their real situation around 4. Modern Times is a story for all time.. Even today this film can be aligned with present condition of workers and the society in most of the cities. A must watch for all."

From his work in a factory to his stint as a night watchman, the Tramp is constantly faced with new challenges and obstacles that threaten to break his spirit.\n\nThroughout the film, Chaplin expertly blends physical comedy with poignant social commentary, highlighting the absurdities of modern society while also drawing attention to its injustices. The famous scene in which the Tramp is fed through a machine, for example, is both hilarious and deeply unsettling, perfectly capturing the film's themes of dehumanization and mechanization."

I believe this movie must have been fantastic in the 1930s, but today it just doesn't live up to the ratings. Mostly the film is pretty boring and moderately entertaining as best. Though it has some rather funny, more entertaining and touching parts, but seeing as this is and almost one and a half hour movie, those parts takes up a small percentage of the movie, and most of it is found in the end. Being a silent movie is something that doesn't help either. Seeing as we have had 70 years of good movies with actual voices in them just helps to make silent movies more dull, no matter how good they once were. Though as this being a silent movie, it is beyond expectation.\n\nSo this is a movie with lot's of boring, but not necessarily bad, parts and a few better parts. it's not badly made, it's just not exciting, funny or entertaining enough. Though it is good for a silent movie, and the film is overall and OK film. But there is lots and lots of other ones in the world of film that one rather spends one and a half hour on.\n\n5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The fear of Chaplin and his tramp Carlitos is the fear of the common man. The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.\n\n\"Modern Times\" uses the facet of satire and at certain times of the parody to result in a critical and conscious comedy. It promotes a laughter contained in a world where the population is comparable to a flock grazed by large corporations and corporations, and even being a film scripted and directed by Charlie Chaplin in 1936, has a strong prophetic or futuristic character, timeless and certainly helplessness, when we reflect In the position of the contemporary world.\n\nChaplin in \"Modern Times\" already philosophized on so many important issues that when reviewing his films, we were amazed by his futuristic vision in terms of technology with surveillance systems monitored by cameras, a mix of reality show with face time, (Such as Skype), voice messaging (WhatsApp), digital recording, and the interference of man's banal activities, such as having lunch, being interfered with by machines and everything to ensure more work efficiency, Wasted time with human activities.\n\nIn addition to the technological advances, there is in the film, or at least in its first part, an analysis of the effects and reflexes of modernity on man and the world, expressed by relations of subordination and power, by the totalitarianism of business groups and by the inexpressiveness of trade union movements Which result in meager advances and are brutally repressed by the police force. A well-presented paradox in the film is how man has managed to advance in technological modernities that, on the other hand, only increase the differences of social classes, generating groups concentrated by industrial power and a whole mass that is at the mercy of a great employment opportunity Part exploratory and enslaved. Living in miserable conditions, in a daily struggle for survival and without the prospect of a better future, there is nothing left but a passive position of the people, who fulfills their expectations with dreams and fantasies of consumption and a life less unworthy.\n\nThe critical character of \"Modern Times\" knows how to measure well the moments of comedy, in fact, they mix in a homogeneous mass so well structured that allows the public, if it so wishes, to stick only to moments of comedy, but if you want, Just look more closely and we can see and see our world through a critical humor perspective. Perhaps the fear of Chaplin and his tramp Carlitos is the fear of the common man. The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.\n\nParticularly, I believe in an attempt by Chaplin to soften his critical stance, for, in structuring the script of \"Modern Times,\" the story is divided into chapters that resemble chapters, and which can, as a filmmaking feature, be relocated without Major implications, since the dependence of one chapter does not strongly interfere with another. This structure that border the sketch or \"sketch\", are, in my opinion, a weak and harmful feature to the film. So much that the resolution for this is a passage of days, there are no missing cards that inform the next action (chapter), it occurs ten, seven, five, two days later or within weeks. This division is so explicit that we can structure the film in the following way:\n\nChapter I - Factory; Chapter II - The Prisoner of the Tramp Chapter III - The Life of the Poor Girl;\n\nJust in the middle of the movie, we have an unfolding of this critical and political comedy for a romantic comedy that nothing resembles the initial idea proposed to the film. The only vestige that remains of this trait is in the labor relations, the search for a job and a change of life.\n\nWith the proviso to the slip of his narrative structure, you had a great work, and one more impeccable work of Chaplin. When \"Modern Times\" was made, cinema already had the sound feature, but Chaplin, mainly for his ideologies of creating a universal art cinema, which was not hampered by differences of languages and other motives, remained faithful to the comic of mimicry , Which made him deservedly famous and admired all over the world.\n\nConversely to those who say of their fear of using the soundtrack, we have in this film a Chaplin conscious of the advances of the sound and that knows to take advantage of that, the sound is presented as a technology that allows the sending of recorded messages, in the sound games like beats In the door that serve to confuse the actions, in the use of a radio to inhibit the sound of the gastritis and where the radio announcer remembers exactly to take the medicine to heal this evil and especially the sound, like match point of the history. If the hobo can not get a joint job, how about trying life as an artist? But for this it is necessary to sing, therefore he who never speaks. The result"

The distinction may be subtle, but 'Modern Times' is not so much a silent film as it is a sound film without sound, and Chaplin's tramp is all too clearly an anachronism among the humming dynamos and labor unrest of the 1930s (he might have called the film 'Changing Times'). Enough echoes of the old days remain to qualify it as a classic (including the mad dance through the factory and another great roller skating routine), but after his earlier 'City Lights' his sense of humor would never again measure up to his social conscience, and the hope with which the Little Tramp faces the future at the end of the film is not nearly so clear as Chaplin's regret at leaving silent film behind."

        "review_detailed_main": "1936's Modern Times is my first look at Charlie Chaplin. Despite everyone raving about his work, I never felt particularly attracted to his films because silent films were never my jam. Lucky for ever-changing tastes! This particular film is often considered one of Chaplin's best so why not use this film to enter his filmography. I loved this film! During it's breezy 1 hour and 27-minute length, I was enthralled with what this legend brought to the screen. This film, which was seen as far-sighted when initially released, is a politically relevant film even here in the 21st century. The film is also beautiful, romantic, hilarious, well-acted, well-directed, and just a wonderful film in general.\n\nThe film was released in 1936, when talky films were in full force. Chaplin's main appeal was silence and his famed character \"The Tramp\" was based on actions, not words. He felt sound would alienate many of his fans, which is why he retired the character after this film. He did incorporate sound and a romantic score into his movie. For the first ever, Chaplin's voice can also be heard as his character sings a gibberish (perhaps, Italian?) song. His later works would be full dialogue, but none would hit the soaring heights of his silent films or so am I led to believe.\n\nChaplin has always been a political guy, but he generally kept politics away from his films. Not this time. After touring Europe and seeing the ravaging effects of the Great Depression, he felt depressed by what he saw. He also had a discussion with Gandhi about the advent of technology. While Chaplin may not have agreed with everything Gandhi said, he did say he saw exactly what he meant. Essentially, this is a movie about trying to keep our humanity in world with technology that gets better and better. Technology that is used for profit. This theme is why this film is hits hard in today's extremely modern world.\n\nChaplin returns to play \"The Tramp\" one more time here. I don't know if there is much of a plot as this film plays out like a series of sketches. The first part is Chaplin on an assembly line trying to keep up with the line. Then, Chaplin is chosen to try out a new automatic feeding machine. That is followed by Chaplin being accused of being mentally ill and being a communist. He also falls in love with a beautiful, homeless orphan played by the stunning Paulette Goddard.\n\nThe film is all about Chaplin, and Goddard to an extent. This is my first time seeing him in action, and I instantly understood why everyone loved this guy. He does not need to use words to be funny. His slapstick is excellent, and it worked very well with the political themes. My favorite scenes are the assembly line and the singing scenes. The dude pays excellent attention to even the smallest details. The eyebrows, the hand movements, just everything is part of the act. Goddard is a lovely pick by Chaplin and she just has to be about the most beautiful orphan ever seen on film!\n\nChaplin is associated with just about everything when it comes to producing his films. He directs them, stars in them, and even composes the music. This film is almost perfection when it comes to those aspects of this film. The music, which he originally composed with Alfred Newman, is one of the best scores out there. The score is one of those scores that would reduce you to tears every time you listen to it. It also works very well with the film.\n\nI cannot recommend Modern Times enough. It's a sharp, relevant film that is absolutely hilarious at times. For a film that came out when silent films were no longer popular, Chaplin had his work cut out for him. The result was one of the greatest films that he ever made, and apparently he made lots of them! I am definitely excited to see more of his works, especially those involving \"The Tramp.\" What a beautiful movie!\n\nMy Grade: A"

I love how Chaplin combines slapstick humor with a deeper message about the working class and the struggles of everyday life.

In my opinion this balance worked where his later efforts to include the slapstick and cutesieness in his talkies didn't.\n\nThe Tramp being shy and almost mute was one of his endearing qualities.\n\nAs the story developed and The Tramp moved on to other jobs, met a girl (Paulette Goddard) and went roller skating, there was plenty of fun to be had.\n\nI didn't know why Sammy Stein as the Turbine Operator at the first factory was topless all the time though, but I enjoyed it and I also liked the clever effects that, for the time were very well done and some of the mechanisms were very interesting too.\n\nIt wasn't the best of his silent movies - I still giggle at the boxing scene in my favourite of his films 'City Lights' (1931) as and when it strays back in to my thoughts - but this was definitely a valiant effort and one to be enjoyed again and again.

It's not romantic, it's just a really beautiful friendship and it's great."

        "review_title": "Chaplin making a silent movie in a talkies world",
        "review_detailed_main": "With \"Modern times\" (1936) Charlie Chaplin took a considerable risk. During his previous film \"City lights\" (1931) talkies were on the rise, but in 1936 talkies were very much the standard. Silent movies were dead. Chaplin however believed in the strength of pantomime and had the opinion that dialogue would weaken this strength. For \"Modern times\" he made the decision to incorporate sound effects but not dialogue (but intertitles!). This is most manifest in the end when the little tramp (in his last film) sings a song in a sort of esperanto language. For Chaplin the tramp was an international figure and he hated to destroy that image by making the tramp talking English. His next film (\"The great dictator\", 1940) contained dialogue but did not cantain the little tramp anymore.\n\nNot only with respect to sound but also with respect to his political engagement took Chaplin a mixed decision in \"Modern times\". It is clear that Chaplin is critical about mechanisation and subordinating men to machine. This message is however wrapped up in a film full of slapstick moments. In \"The great dictator\" Chaplins political views became more prominent and his leftist image would cause him problems in the USA.\n\n\"Modern times\" is often compared to \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" (1931, Rene Clair). Some people were of the opinion that \"Modern times\" was on the verge of plagiarism. It is undeniable that there are similarities (for example assembly lines going too fast, lunch hour in the factory getting out of hand). In \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" Rene Clair compares factory workers with inmates. In \"Modern times\" Chaplin compares them with a flock of sheep.\n\nThere are however also differences. \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" is during the whole film faithfulll to his theme that liberty is incompatible with the way labour is organised in a modern economy. In \"Modern times\" this theme is mostly visible in the beginning of the film. Thereafter the film is a series of loose slapsticks according to the principle of 12 jobs, 13 accidents. Maybe Chaplin didn't want to make the film too political. Maybe this latter part of the film reflects the economic crisis after the stockmarket crash of 1929 and the massive unemployment that came with this crisis. According to the last hypothesis we should not compare the second part of \"Modern times\" with \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" but see it as a comical version of \"The grapes of wrath\" (940, John Ford).\n\n\"A nous la libert\u00e9\" ends with two friends walking a lonely country road. \"Modern times\" ends with the little tramp walking on such a road. He walks away from the movieviewers, never to come back again. Fortunately he doesn't walk alone, but with the love of his live (the gamin played by Paulette Goddard)."

        "review_detailed_main": "In \"Modern Times\", Charlie Chaplin brings his class analysis to the Industrial Revolution. The opening scene shows sheep, to portray how the working class was being turned into such. Then, we see Chaplin in the factory, where he has the most mind-numbing job in the world: tightening two screws together as the products run by on a conveyor belt. To make matters worse, the boss speeds up the machine, and it gets harder and harder to keep up. This regimen eventually causes him to have a breakdown. Meanwhile, a young woman (Paulette Goddard) is forced into homelessness due to some tragic events. After their lives cross paths, they try to help each other through the hard times.\n\nIt all may sound pretty grim from that description, but it wouldn't be a Charlie Chaplin movie without some humor: he gets cranked through a machine in the factory, he gets mistaken for a march leader when trying to give a truck back its flag, and he accidentally swallows \"nose powder\", to name a few. It's probably his second best movie behind \"The Great Dictator\"."

It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.\n\nModern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most.\n\nOverall, wonderful, another one of Chaplin's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I wanted to, at the very least, have a good, solid experience with a Chaplin film for once. The Great Dictator was cute, City Lights was mediocre for me. How would his so called masterpiece be?\n\nWell, Modern Times follows the classic Chaplin character, the tramp, as he tries to earn some money without losing his mind in modern society - and during the great depression, no less! As you might imagine, the cartoonish tramp has a hard time doing so, and the cold industrial world is cruel and unforgiving to him.\n\nI'll be honest here: I had such a hard time focusing on this movie. It has a couple of fun moments (the nose-powder scene is the best moment in the whole movie imo, and the fantasy home is quite funny as well), but most of it falls flat for me. It's like watching an old Disney cartoon without much of a plot or charm for about 90 minutes - it gets old really, really quickly. And cinema elitists truly be like \"dude, bro put social commentary in a film in the frickin' 1930s! What a genius fr fr\". Astonishing to me.\n\nBut in all seriousness, yeah, I think it's kinda boring. It has some scenes with visual symbolism and it's not done that badly, some scenes here are considered iconic for a reason, but I just feel almost nothing watching this film. The gamin is boring, the main plot feels like stitched-together ideas and sketches, and most jokes aren't funny to me - slightly amusing at best. Maybe I'm just fed up with Chaplin's style after watching 3 of his films, but that's how I genuinely feel watching it. 5.1/10 on this one."

As all baseball historians know Phil Wrigley was the last of club owners to put lights in his ballpark and the Chicago Cubs did not have lights on Wrigley Field and play night games until after his death. So to Chaplin was the last silent screen artist and Modern Times was his triumph in that art form. People actually did see it in 1936 and this was now an audience that was used to dialog from the mouths of movie performers.\n\nModern Times has Chaplin and his little tramp character go after the effects of industrialization and how factory work robs the soul of its individuality and sense of accomplishment. The smarter bosses recognized this and provided workers with incentives and activities that ameliorated this feeling. Too many were like Chaplin's bosses who only thought of increased production.\n\nOne of the great moments in the film comes when the manager selects Charlie as a test guinea pig for a feeding machine feeling that too much production time was lost while employees had their lunch. Charlie in that machine being force fed was hysterical. The gag was so good that Crosby and Hope used it for a double effect in The Road To Hong Kong.\n\nAfter losing many jobs and spending time in jail when he's picked up for union organizing, Charlie among other things gets a job as a singing waiter. Here Chaplin treads ever so gently into dialog when after losing the lyrics he sings a gibberish type ballad, similar to the Klopstokian language in Million Dollar Legs. Another treasured moment from Modern Times.\n\nModern Times also introduced Paulette Goddard to the big screen and she and Chaplin were involved and got married. In his memoirs Chaplin ironically recounted that while she got many offers after the film was over he because he still would not consider a sound film just stayed at home until 1940 and The Great Dictator.\n\nHe also said that costuming was difficult. It's easy enough to make a good looking girl enhance her beauty with the best of fashion. But Paulette Goddard who played a poor waif in the film had to look beautiful in rags. Chaplin recounts he spent a lot of time trying to get the right effect for Goddard.\n\nAmong the many of Charlie's talents was that of composer. His famous ballad Smiles is heard throughout the film at poignant moments. Naturally only as an instrumental. I commend Nat King Cole's recording of the song.\n\nSpeaking of poignant moments the uncertain future that Charlie and Paulette have at the end of Modern Times cannot be described. Charlie the tramp and Paulette the waif just looking for a spot on earth where they can be themselves. Isn't that something we all want.\n\nThough it has little spoken words and none from its leads Modern Times lived up to its billing in that it came out at a time when organized labor was given the right to finally organize and it was struggling to assert that right during the New Deal. A lot of the lessons of Modern Times on that subject need to be revisited. And often."

However I was determined to see Modern Times because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. At first, I wasn't really impressed because I didn't understand what they were doing. I also found the first few minutes pretty boring. I was wondering, \"I thought he was supposed to be FUNNY.\" I even thought of calling this review that. I was not laughing. I felt that way until he does his hilarious signature walk, twirling around the jail. I was feeling very tired and sick at the time and I burst out laughing. I rewound it and I laughed again. That was a turning point. I was beginning to love Charlie Chaplin. Not only was I amazed by his comic genius, but his physically daring (or what would seem so) stunts. My dad and I were amazed at it! We had to rewind several scenes to try and figure out how it worked. It just worked perfectly. Another person who I was impressed with was Paulette Goddard. Although I think she wouldn't have been a good Scarlett, I think she is stunningly gorgeous in this. She really has a screen presence and I loved her in this. Yet another thing that was so relevant was the political element. Charlie Chaplin hits the nail on the head about the industrial situation in those days. So here I am, reflecting on this wonderful movie. Although it took me a little while to get into it, I am now a very big Charlie Chaplin fan. His modern genius amazes me. Not only do I love Chaplin, but this wonderfully told story.\n\nI am a Chaplin fan for life."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin stars as The Tramp - or Little Tramp - working in a factory doing pretty much what a robot would do today. The factory boss is presented with a device which will significantly cut down on lunch time, and is tested on Tramp, with very little success.\n\nUnlike Chaplin's previous work where he was naturally funny, I found (most of) the humour in 'Modern Times' a bit slapstick, almost forced. Back then it probably had the audience roaring with laughter. At least there were still more than enough delightfully funny moments in true Chaplin style. I admire the production for its innovative inventions.\n\nWhen Tramp suffers a nervous breakdown - probably due to the monotony of his job - he wreaks havoc in the factory. The scene where he falls into a machine, was incredibly well done with an amazing production design. Having lost his job, Tramp is later mistaken for a Communist leader and imprisoned.\n\nThe film is also the story of a young, unemployed woman, Ellen - played by Paulette Goddard. I really enjoyed this character, who always seemed happy despite her dreary circumstances. She is an inspiring character, and I thought Paulette Goddard had a very modern look considering the time when the film was made.\n\nWhen Tramp and Ellen meet, they fantasize about a good, happy life together - living in a quaint little house with plenty to eat. I enjoyed them working towards realizing their dream, and being blissful about trivial things.\n\n'Modern Times' is interesting in the sense that it is a part talkie/part silent film. The characters themselves never speak, except for the factory boss over the monitor, and some instructions being read aloud, and various other sounds - and even a scene in a restaurant where Tramp performs a song!\n\nThere is a lot happening in this film, and it almost felt like an anthology film, but in the end everything tied perfectly together. The events illustrated Tramp and Ellen's journey to fulfilling their dreams, and the obstacles they had to overcome."

After various mishaps including a spell in prison the Tramp winds up working at a department store with some pretty hilarious results. Paulette Goddard is really terrific in her role too and gives it a great deal of gusto and energy. Together they're a terrific team. The themes of looking out for each other and trying to overcome the hardships of life were quite touching and one I'm sure most Americans understood while living through the 1930s. The film acts as great final farewell for the character of the tramp, killed off in the end by the talking movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "A genius makes this. So it is wonderfully good. Chaplin has seldom faulted and here he is standing at his genius best.\n\nSo many elements are new in this, the effect of industrialization on humans. The need and greed for money. Craving for love and doing work so as to keep the lover happy. This is one of the most poignant films culturally and on humanitarian terms. Charlie as the Tramp delivers an immaculate performance that is a treat to watch. From being a hero in jail and struggles outside of jail. He comes to terms with the world that has become a flock, like flock of sheep that braze on grass, humans now braze on their new jobs as workers in factories.\n\nOK, technically, this is a Silent film, now considering 1936 where the \"talkies\" have become regular in Hollywood, it seemed somewhat anachronistic. Yet, had the tramp spoke he would have become one among many, a common man and his mystic characteristics might have surfaced and he would have lost his charm. So it was a good thing that it was kept silent just for the sake of maintaining the uniqueness of \"The Tramp\".\n\nThere are so many unique things in this film that even today, it would to be tough to scale the magnanimity of the sets involved, the charm of the love story and the simplicity of the humor. Be it a scene where he looks at buttons of a woman as nut and bolts trying to fix them, or his fall into the damp water realizing that it is not a lake or pond. So many moments are beautiful and simple and this is one of the rarest films, that will bring laughter irrespective of time and age. And it indeed brings a tear drop at times too. Emotions are universal, and the better connected they are, more beautiful the film will be.\n\nChaplin knew the art if film making, yes and more than that he knew the art of being a simple human being. What it takes to live a life simply, what goes through a simple man trying to earn his bread. What goes through a lover who is trying to win the heart of a girl. He knew all this so well and many traits of his thoughts have surface in this film, making it a wonderful film and how many times ever I watch this, I never got bored and I never will.\n\nTo distinctly say that so and so in this film is wonderful would be demeaning the essence of the film. So, everything is superb and I can bet on this for laughs any time. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films ever."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mr. Chaplin's pi\u00e8ce-de-r\u00e9sistence, MODERN TIMES is his last silent feature, but rendered with an innovative adulteration of sound voices solely from mechanical devices, barring Chaplin's near-end humorous performance of THE NONSENSE SONG, for the very first time, audience hears the maestro's real voice from the screen in a gibberish ditty, one could only imagine the hype and excitement at then.\n\nMODERN TIMES introduces Chaplin's iconic screen alter-ego aka. little tramp as an assembly-line worker in the Depression era, the factory's pristine props hark back to Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), but less futuristic, more realistic in its scale of grasping capitalism under the efficiency- prioritizing doctrine whereas a proletariat like the tramp, has no means to secure an auspicious future and is inescapably subjected to the exploitation by the industrialized society, picked as a guinea pig for a novel lunch-feeding contrivance, constantly under the duress of the ever- accelerating assembly-line, after being engorged by it (a brilliant surreal light-touch), he is driven mad and wreaks havoc on the machine and is sent to hospital, subsequently, being mistaken as a Communist and thrown into the prison, where he accidentally becomes a hero by thwarting a jail- break attempt, but ironically because he is high on cocaine, which he mistakes for salt in his lunch. Yet, whenever he is given a new lease on life, reality will cunningly squash his effort although in some cases, he has only himself to blame for. There is a skewering political spin aiming at the modernized assembly line, the humongous machines, the callous industrialists and the oppressive authority, being buried underneath the surface of bang-up farces, which has been scarcely actualized in Chaplin's works before.\n\nThe plot mainly consists of a string of superlative skits de rigueur, which is completely in Chaplin's elements, the tramp's free-flowing pantomime, delightful slapstick and ingeniously devised set pieces (although the stomach-churning duet crops up as a head-scratcher) are typically endearing to watch, what is more astonishing is how he can make tough stunts look incredibly effortless, in particular with sleight of hand, an arresting trompe l'oeil is accomplished when he roller-skates blindfold against a matted painting which puts viewers at the edge of their seats for his safety. The story also presents a fiery heroine, the gamin (Goddard), a recently orphaned girl who is anything but a damsel-in-distress, Goddard, although is not endowed with Chaplin's bent of physical comedy, is impeccably elemental in foregrounding the gamin's gallantry and loveliness, takes on a weighty counterpart against the tramp's unostentatious playfulness, together, they help each other out in the difficult times, share bitter-sweet moments. A self-encouraging coda might betray Chaplin's precaution that comedy has its built-in calling to look on the brighter side, by and large, MODERN TIME is a reverberating showcase of Chaplin's competence which further transcends its time and context."

True, this film was not made during the silent era, and it isn't a completely silent film (just as The Jazz Singer was made during the silent Era and wasn't a complete Talkie), but these details only added to the fact that silent films could still be relevant in a period of movies with sound. This film shows that you don't need dialogue (or cgi) to make a perfect film that touches on multiple emotions."

        "review_detailed_main": "The so-called \"Little Tramp\" was Charlie Chaplin's most beloved on-screen character. The figure, which became a veritable icon worldwide, was created when Chaplin worked for Mack Sennett's famous Keystone Studios. This was during the silent film era and the Tramp was first seen in the one-reeler \"Mabel's Strange Predicament\" in 1914. Soon the guy was the star in the studio's company of players. Chaplin then continued to play his character in more than fifty short films. In full, feature-length productions however, he only appeared four times.\n\nIn 1927, \"The Jazz Singer\" became the film that introduced \"the talkies\" to the world. As expected, it didn't take long until silent movies were practically gone from the silver screen. When Chaplin began to prepare a new production in the mid-1930s, he was therefore advised to go with the flow. But the great comedian knew that the Little Tramp's appeal would be lost if he had to speak. Consequently, Chaplin insisted on making the picture without any dialogue.\n\nIn addition to starring in \"Modern Times\", Charlie Chaplin produced and directed the movie himself. He then spent a whole year in his own Hollywood studio, shooting the piece after his own screenplay. The film's highly stylized look was due to the fact that it was shot with 18 frames per second (the standard for silent film) but was shown at 24 frames per second (the standard for talking pictures). This, of course, made the slapstick comedy even more frantic.\n\nMany leading critics consider \"Modern Times\" to be Charlie Chaplin's last \"silent\" film. Even though the director used both sound, vocal and musical effects throughout. Still, after more than three years in production, \"Modern Times\" became a great, international success for the director. One of the signature works of his career, even. But sadly, it was also the last time the cinema audience got to see the Little Tramp up on the silver screen."

We gotta be honest here, nothing is revolutionary. It's quintessential Charlie Chaplin.\n\nOne redeeming thing is. Sammy Stein shirtless in the movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "Known mostly as The Tramp's last motion picture, \"Modern Times\" is physical comedian and gifted writer/director/composer Charlie Chaplin's take on the quickly changing world around him. It's fitting for what's considered his last silent movie and the last hurrah of early Hollywood's most iconic figure and one of the greatest in cinematic history.\n\nIn \"Modern Times\" the Tramp is fired from his assembly line job because he literally can't keep up with the grueling speed of his machine, a fantastic introduction to Chaplin's central idea of the breakneck speed of technology. He's even made the guinea pig for a new \"eat while you work\" machine that breaks during the test, resulting in the film's most comical scene. After surviving jail, the Tramp looks to find a new job, failing multiple times and dodging policemen left and right. Along the way he meets a gamin, a young orphaned woman (Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's then wife) and despite being at the bottom of the barrel, they strive to live in their own house and find work together.\n\nThroughout the film, the Tramp and his new gal desperately try and fit into a society that naturally rejects them like bad shrimp. The Tramp looks completely out of place and seems incapable (of course humorously so) of doing even the smallest of tasks, like assisting a mechanic by carrying his tools. But he will not be deterred, his ambition to live the American dream is as strong as every working class American who struggled through the tough times of that era (the film was released in 1936).\n\nIt's not hard to draw a personal comparison between Chaplin's art form and the struggles of the Tramp in this film either. Silent movies were dying if not dead by the time \"Modern Times\" was released, but Chaplin was determined to prove that talking pictures were not the only suitable form of entertainment. He proves his point in an ending musical act where the Tramp speaks for the first time but must make up words because he's lost the lyrics. The ending shot is even more hopeful than the entire rest of the film.\n\n\"Modern Times\" might not be Chaplin's most hysterical physical humor, but it's certainly one of his most biting social commentaries as well as a somewhat inspiring love story. As wacky as the Tramp might be, we certainly identify with his dream and secretly admire his propensity to act outside of social norms like we ourselves wish were more comfortable doing."

I mostly am strict about not watching movies released before 1960s since I neither can connect with them nor appreciate the technology used. But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation. Considering the frame rate, scope size, loud background score, this movie didn't put me off as much as I thought it would with a large help from the screen presence of beautiful Paulette Goddard.\n\nA Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) works in a large manual assembly line and due to his hypnotic work schedule goes into a temporary nervous breakdown causing havoc in the operations. When sent to jail, due to a freak accident and a bizarre incident ends up thwarting an escape plan by fellow prisoners thus building a rapport with the police. With the outside world crumbling in union strikes, unemployment and hunger, the little tramp seems to be making a good life for himself inside the prison walls. When the day finally comes for his release, he makes up his mind to do something to get back to prison which is when he meets a beautiful but down on her luck young girl A Gamin (Paulette Goddard).\n\nChaplin's entire screenplay revolves around coincidences, pure good or bad luck and how he deals with his positive outlook. Though loud, light hearted and in your face on the outset - the power of human spirit, current political satire and hope are always the underlying themes of most of his movies. The perfection of the finished product is easily seen in most of the scenes which actually looked quite technologically superior for its time. Paulette Goddard looked gorgeous and her pleasing presence elevates the likability of the movie. The background score has some melodious tunes but mostly spoiled by the loudness and acoustic nature of the sound available at the time. The comic choreography is very imaginative and actually has a very solid plot even with very little said.\n\nBrilliant comic choreography with a story relevant to this day"

The skit here with the 'nose-powder' leads to Woody Allen's \"Take the Money and Run\" and \"Sleeper\"; the struggle to serve the roast duck was extensively borrowed by John Cleese in \"Fawlty Towers\" (and the hapless 'Manuel' character); the department store robbery was the basis for John Hughes' \"Career Opportunities\". The recently and sadly departed Marcel Marceau drew hugely on Chaplin's mastery of the physical language of silent film.\n\nIn particular, when Woody affected silly, lecherous behavior (his 'Orgasmatron' skit), he tapped directly into what made Chaplin great -- his ability to simultaneously convey innocence and naughtiness. See how his Tramp attempts to adjust the strategically-placed bolts on women's outfits, and scratch your head as to just how this got past Code restrictions.\n\nIt seems all the ingredients for greatness are there, the key being the brilliant idea of a 'talkie' vs. 'silent film' construction. But that's all it adds up to: a jumbled collection of ideas that is less than the sum of its parts. It tries to carry a 'message'; it tries to cross pollinate a satire of politics and the dehumanizing power of the industrial state with 'progress' in the form of talking films (all of the vocal parts emanate from machines); it tries to hold together a coherent romance. It's too much to assemble all at one time\u0085\n\nI look forward to seeing 'City Lights', and then reconsidering this movie in the context of having seen both"

The Tramp and the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) are always silent. Yet they convey anything anybody ever needed to know.\n\nModern Times is about a little man who just doesn't seem to belong anywhere. In the beginning, he's working in a factory on an assembly line, and when an efficiency expert brings in a \"feeding machine\" that will require workers to take less time for lunch, our Tramp is chosen. The machine breaks down while still connected to Chaplin, making for a fabulous scene. In another scene, he becomes part of the machine as he goes through it.\n\nThe Depression is on and jobs are hard to come by, especially when you keep getting into trouble, so the Tramp goes from job to job. Eventually he meets the homeless Gamin, who is quick on her feet, and the two attempt to survive the hard times together.\n\nA small but handsome man, Chaplin as the Tramp is still recognizable today with his funny walk and little mustache. The most astounding thing about Chaplin is the way he used his body. The most brilliant example of this is the roller skating scene, but there are so many others - Chaplin's flexibility and balletic grace made him the greatest comedian ever. When he fails as a waiter and is called upon to sing in a restaurant, his movements to the song are phenomenal.\n\nGoddard is young and beautiful as the Gamin and does a terrific job as a streetwise girl who can't help getting discouraged. But The Tramp won't let her - he knows that together, they can make it. As funny in parts as this movie is, we're reminded of how poverty victimizes people and how try as some might, some people just don't belong in these modern, practical times that don't allow time for some of the simpler pleasures.\n\nOne scene that foreshadowed corporate America today - there is a large television screen where the boss can see everything that's going on, even in the bathrooms, where he yells at people to get back to work. I'm sure that, even if that isn't available in most, if any, companies, workers definitely feel they are being kept track of every minute, with the use of time sheets, security cards, sign-ins, computer monitoring and the like.\n\nA truly great film by a master. A must-see."

The camera angles were a little bit more creative. I like the use of even more long shots and panoramic shots. The movie tries to outsmart the limitations for sound by playing a sound recording with a great timing precision. Yet I cannot say the same about the story. Yes it did address many of the era's troubles directly and openly in an entertaining way. I like how Chaplin insert the issues of machine modernization, the communist latent danger, poverty and even the aftermath of the malaise in this movie. Yet I think that the whole story doesn't really bind together as well as the previous other Chaplin works"

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times is Chaplin's take on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions that people faced during the Great Depression that hit the world between the 1930s and lasted till the late 1930s or mid-1940s. Charlie Chaplin took the depression and the problems it caused and found a way to make you laugh it off. Modern times is an addition to the classic movies of the last 100 years, as it stands out as one extremely funny movie, that you have to see before you leave the earth.\n\nModern times is a movie done in 1936, that depicts Chaplin's take on the modern world and what industrialization brought with it. Set during the Great Depression era the movie's plot is about how the tramp was coping with the depression and with him was an orphan who too was struggling with the causes of the depression.\n\nOur Tramp also discovered that life in jail is better than life outside.\n\nChaplin had long been against \"talkie\" and his last film before this City Lights (1931) was a silent film and he began preparing for this flick in 1934, and it was supposed to be his first \"talkie\", but he later abandoned the idea of making a talkie because he felt the world was not ready to hear the tramp talk. The movie does have some dialogue, but that can be found in the early scenes soon after the movie went back to the silent film genre. Nearing the ending there is a scene where Chaplin's tramp had to sing to keep his job, this scene was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard in any movie. The song that the tramp sang (the song is known as The Nonsense Song) was L\u00e9o Daniderff's comical song Je cherche apr\u00e8s Titine. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie as Chaplin's version of L\u00e9o Daniderff's song was all gibberish with the lyrics being a mixture of French and Italian words in a nonsensical manner that it made no sense but his comical gestures tell the story of what he actually meant.\n\nThe movie's opening scene shows where the tramp was in a factory and he had to keep up with the speed of production, this scene has been used by many filmmakers even Disney and in the sitcom I Love Lucy used the idea.\n\nModern Times, is my 2nd favorite Chaplin movie after City Lights and the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) rated the movie78 in its list of 100. There is no reason why you should not get a feel of one of the best Chaplin's film out there, so find it and watch it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first half hour might be the best critique anyone ever did on the society of the 20th and maybe 21st century. Chaplin was surely inspired by \"Metropolis\" here, but evolved the idea and made it understandable for everyone. We all know, Humor is the best way to tell the ugly truth. Even the first picture of the movie with the sheep and the men in the subway is epic.\n\nAnother reason to see this movie is the sexiest woman I've ever seen on screen. I mean Chaplin always knew to pick his actresses, but this one is just breathtaking. Another reason: his dance and singing at the end of the movie. I really enjoyed that.\n\nSo, \"Modern Times\" isn't as funny as \"City Lights\" or as touching as \"The Kid\" or as important as \"The Great Dictator\"(which achieved something, nobody had ever done before. It managed to break Hitlers heart), but I can promise that you will enjoy these 83 minutes of your life."

Having heard about Charlie Chaplin a lot throughout my childhood and seeing the infamous mustache, it had taken me a lot of years to watch his movie.\n\nAbsolutely loved it, the comedic timing is on spot and the benchmark set by him is difficult to surpass.\n\nIt's a classic and in my opinion not a lot of Comedy Movies can be watched more than a few times, but it is different in the case of Modern Times. Every time I watch it, it makes me laugh as hard as I had laughed the first time I watched it.\n\nThis is my first review, so bear with me as I haven't been very critical of the movie and is more about my experience of watching the movie."

The Tramp struggles to keep up with the automated world (hilariously) in setting after setting. But another layer to the film is its Depression setting, which results in more serious situations. But the end concludes with a line that applies to both angles of the film, the end of his era of work and outside life.\n\nThe films looks very good: it held up well over time. The short spoken segments remind the viewer that Chaplin chose to make this a silent film. The music, very prominent, is excellent as well. The sets are huge, and I wonder how some of the factory scenes were made.\n\nThe film is really funny, especially the first act in the factory. The food machine caused me to laugh out loud. Despite the serious overtones, the film is always light and provides countless laughs.\n\nChaplin is excellent, especially with Goddard's Gamin. They're very sweet together, and the ending is very heartwarming.\n\nFor sure this is the best silent comedy I've seen, a very entertaining film with substance. 8.5/10"

In the first moment you thing all will be about machines, but in a deep understanding and thoughtful conclusion, it was about the human being all the time. How we see ourselves in this mechanic and rational world.\n\nSo, consider some of these reasons if you didn't watched then do it.

The movie features Chaplin's beloved character, the Little Tramp, who struggles to survive in a mechanized world.\n\nWhile \"Modern Times\" is celebrated as a cinematic masterpiece and showcases Chaplin's genius in physical comedy and social commentary, it may not appeal to everyone. The silent film format and black-and-white visuals can feel dated to contemporary audiences accustomed to modern filmmaking techniques.\n\nDespite its historical significance and moments of brilliance, the pacing can be slow, and the humor, reliant on slapstick and visual gags, might not resonate with all viewers. For those who appreciate classic cinema and Chaplin's work, \"Modern Times\" is a must-watch, but it may not captivate those looking for more dynamic storytelling and modern production values."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Modern Times\" was made during the Great Depression era (1929-41) and comments on surviving during that time as well as the dehumanizing effects of mass production assembly line techniques just introduced. If Jon Stewart (of USA's TV \"The Daily Show\") had made a movie during that era, maybe this is a much gentler version of what he might have created.\n\nWorld-wide, Chaplin was often called the most famous person alive on the strength of his many previous \"Little Tramp\" shorts and feature silent films. But the modern progress introducing \"talkies\" in 1927 meant the demise of silent films and of those rich techniques Chaplin had honed for communicating without speech. (This film is a hybrid between being a silent film and a talkie.) Also, just previously (the early 1930s), Chaplin had made a couple round the world trips in which he saw the effects of the world-wide depression and assembly lines in many countries. In the USA, some typical factory conditions of that era were described in a recent (April 2011) NPR report: (Google: \"NPR Flint Sit-Down Striker: 'Equal Pay, Equal Conditions' \")\n\nOverall, this movie knits together five distinct segments that could be called: factory work; jail time; the night watchman; the waiter; building a life together. The sets for some factory scenes (giant intermeshed gears that swallow and transport people) were astounding; Charlie's waiter scene when he sings made up foreign words while dancing the intended words in pantomime is fantastic; his athleticism and coordination as he skates backwards blindfolded is breathtaking; his anticipation of television monitors is remarkably prescient/ foresighted; and the beauty of Paulette Goddard, (one of his many real-life loves & possibly wives), is striking.\n\nThe overall message of this film is to find a way to adapt to whatever adversity comes your way and to \"smile.\" Chaplin composed all the music used in the film including the song \"Smile\" and its music and message often recur throughout. (Google: \"Chaplin's 'Smile' Modern Times\" for music & words)\n\n(\"MT\" was shown at our monthly \"Great Films at the Cathedral\" series. We saw the Criterion version of \"MT\"; this includes a 2nd disk with several earlier \"Little Tramp\" comedy shorts. Comparing these early slapstick performances with \"MT\" shows how much work Chaplin put in to refining the Little Tramp's silent but so expressive communication with his audience. If you can watch this version, please do--no flicker, dirt, or extraneous noise.)"

        "review_detailed_main": "In which Chaplin demonstrates his mastery of his medium in instinctively reverting his would-be talkie debut to a mainly silent piece reliant on skilled writing, timing and direction in delivering an indictment of the \"modern times\" he was living in. It's a brave movie for much more than just flying in the face of the prevailing Hollywood \"The Silents are dead\" trend, in indicting the soulless dehumanisation of factory-working, imprisonment and on a deeper level the suppression of individualism in society, yet makes its point by making us laugh at all this and more in a succession of hilarious set- pieces reliant on the great man's genius for mime, slapstick and comic invention.\n\nInterestingly, the movie does employ some speech, but only from the detached, inhumane factory owner, in an almost eerie prediction of Orwell's \"Big Brother\" from \"1984\" penned a full 12 years later. There are also background sound effects and the musical number near the end is given voice too. However Chaplin's little tramp central character and Paulette Goddard's \"the Gamin\" utter nary a word and indeed old-fashioned title cards are used to convey speech as well as scene-changes.\n\nThere's little to criticise here other than an episodic feel to the narrative, like so many silent-sketches knitted together, but when the quality of the sketches is so well-done, this can be forgiven. Even Chaplin's much-criticised over-sentimentality is reined in somewhat (and Goddard never does get reunited with her two younger siblings who are put under the care of the court) with an open-ended finishing fade of the two-against-the-world deciding to take the hard road back to fight for the conventional house-on-a-hill dream of most Americans, all the more, so given the background of The Great Depression.\n\nSome of the scenes are sheer genius, including Charlie's depiction as a cog in the inner-workings of the industrial machinery, his guinea-pig forced participation in the automated feeding process experiment of a dotty inventor, his foiling of the prison jail-break, the hilarious protest-march, his French song and dance routine near the end and so much more. In fact the only comedic scene which missed its mark for me was the tummy-rumbling scene with the visiting senator's wife. I also liked the more adult humour he introduces to give the lie to his cuddly family image as his traumatised factory-worker looks to tweak the dress-buttons-as-nipples of a passing female's clothing.\n\nChaplin's direction show him at home in combining old-time fixed-camera slap-stick with sight-gags using combinations of imaginative camera-shots. His body movements and facial expressions are wonderful throughout. Goddard is beautifully fresh-faced throughout and successfully acts \"older\", which thankfully lessens the \"cute\" factor, if not quite belying the old criticism of his penchant of employing too young an actress as his female lead.\n\nFor me then, this movie shows Chaplin confronting the modernising of society (and Hollywood itself) with complete mastery and redoubtable courage, not to mention plenty of laughs too."

        "review_detailed_main": "The most amazing thing to me about this famous film is the way Charlie Chaplin so ably duplicates the style of one of his earlier silent pictures. He knew all too well how fast the future was coming up, and how cinema had changed with the advent of sound recording. Like many, he feared mechanization and modern industry. He knew that his legendary Tramp character had to be put to bed, so he decided to go out in style. The picture is a tribute not only to The Tramp as a cinematic icon, but a showcase for Chaplin's truly varied talents as actor, writer, and director.\n\nTo go without sound when you don't have to do so is a mark of true class. Chaplin reminds us of how much we can rely on visual information to understand a story. The quick close-ups, tight edits, and the slightly exaggerated, histrionic scenes with Paulette Goddard are a stunning and pleasurable flashback to the simple melodramatic silent films of earlier years. It is sophisticated and serious despite the hilarious scenes. It was almost as if Chaplin wanted to remind modern film audiences that pictures of the silent era are an entirely separate genre from the \"talkies.\" The closing scene, with the two leads walking off down the road, is elegaic and touching. I simply cannot understand why the Academy did not recognize the artistry that went into so many components of this picture. However, this oversight was made up later by the well-deserved lifetime achievement award for Chaplin."

And of unemployment (between a Great Depression and a World War)? Written by, directed by, produced by, edited by, music composed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. A true genius.\n\nThe factory is not just \"modern\" but futuristic in a sense, looking like 1950s and 1960s sci-fi films. There are monitors everywhere (shades of \"1984\") and gigantic switches and cranks, and robots doing uniquely humanlike things.\n\nChaplin, a socialist sympathizer, was clearly attacking the capitalist system in this film, particularly the idea of the assembly line and how monotonous it is. The film even goes so far as to show ways a company could make men even more like machines -- feeding them in line so as not to need a lunch break.\n\nHooray for the \"gamin\" (Paulette Goddard), the child of the waterfront who refuses to go hungry! (The film's use of \"gamin\" is interesting to me for two reasons: one, the word is male, with the female being a gamine; two, it is today a more or less dead word, with the current popular term being \"street urchin\".) And hooray for Chaplin's dancing, which was just about the highlight of the film."

Having produced countless amount of short-comedy movies Chaplin started to get concerned on more serious issues while the world was experiencing difficult times. Modern Times is one of his best movies as well as probably one of the most criticized ones as ironically it got too much critical. After watching the movie you can understand what Chaplin was trying to do was not simply making a movie but far beyond of it. You understand how well he digested what he had been observing during his era and the transformation of human power into the mechanical technologies. After all, the result was an intoxicating mixture of comedy genre and political criticism in a masterpiece: Modern Times."

Fortunately for Chaplin, he is the genuine article and he has staying power (making several of his films legitimate classics to be enjoyed for generations to come).\n\nThe automated food server bit has great, as well as the \"nose powder\" sequence. Several times I was laughing out loud watching this by myself. If a comedy makes you laugh with no one around, its great.\n\nThere are few legends as powerful as the image of Chaplin's tramp character. Imagine you are sitting in your living room and the tramp walks in. You simply would not know what to do or say... Chaplin has become immortal in our culture and is one of the few people to transcend being human and truly live well beyond his years as a force to be reckoned with."

Chaplin's character is a factory line worker doing speedy and redundant work. Cue tons of physical comedy. Later, he meets the impoverished young woman and they enjoy the slower and simple things in life yet get swept up in the rushed modern society. Chaplin meshes together a touching story of kinship with his stellar well-honed and well-timing physical comedy. This would be Chaplin's final silent film of his famous silent film catalog as the world had moved on. It is a silent film yet incorporates some recorded spoken dialog through radios and machines while still using the traditional title cards; perhaps his hat tip to the future. This is a great film of pure Chaplin style. Also try to tally up how many times he gets arrested. Ha"

        "review_detailed_main": "THERE ARE NO POINTS YET THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO THIS MASTERPIECE THIS MILESTONE IN THE WORLD OF CINEMA, THE ONLY FILM THAT WILL BE WATCHED BEFORE YOU DIE\n\nHonestly, such films are not being made even at this time!excellent movies with excellent effects come out almost every day, but unfortunately there are no movies that are so original, have a high sense of humor and will make you instantly positive when watched!this is undoubtedly thanks to Charles Chaplin,I think he is a good person and a sensitive actor not only in his films, but also in his normal life,watch it without thinking, even when you are bored,it is just one of the Charles Chaplin films that I often look at and laugh at, especially some parts of it that are available in my archive..\n\nThere is no need to tell what a great master Charlie Chaplin is. The most famous master of silent cinema, he not only made entertaining films; he thoroughly instilled a socialistic point of view into cinema. From the point of view, it is not every valiant's duty to overthrow the 80 years by keeping the impact of the first day alive. If there is a name that can achieve this, it is Charlie Chaplin. Modern Times - Modern Times was presented to the taste of moviegoers for the first time exactly 80 years ago today. Modern Times, which appeared on the screen during the Great Depression, has a broad framework that tries to look at the social life of the period from different windows in addition to being a harsh criticism of the system.\n\nModern Times, which opened with the whistle blowing announcing the start of the shift, showed how harsh expressions it had with its first scene. After seeing the progress of a flock of sheep, the flock is replaced by blue collars coming out of the subway. The blue-collar workers, who are portrayed as a big flock of sheep trying to keep up with their jobs in the factory, are told how they have become slaves of the system in the special of the worker portrayed by Chaplin. Modern Times, which was published 13 years before the publication of George Orwell's 1984 novel, portrays a factory that may have been an inspiration to Orwell. The workers working in this factory, every corner of which is monitored by cameras and every movement of the workers is interfered with, are not yet aware of their importance in the system. Chaplin explains that the main cogs that keep the system afloat are the blue collars with the most iconic scene of the film. This scene looks like an accident, but in fact it happens due to the ambition of fast production of the company manager who oversees the automatic Decoction machine so that production is not interrupted even at lunch. The Worker, played by Caplin, is crushed under an excessive workload that he cannot handle, but still cannot leave the factory without going completely crazy.\n\nIt stands out as a small representation of the Great Depression that the worker subverts the entire order of the system that he was still a part of before he left the factory from the inside, and no one has the power to stop it. From a macro point of view, it was the system itself that used the system's deficits with great ambition, and as a result, the biggest economic crisis America has ever seen broke out; there is no functioning economic system left. When the worker breaks down the system and leaves the factory, he is still under the influence of what he has experienced, and this situation begins to affect the street on this axis as well. In the continuation of the film, Chaplin gives place to the hardship of unemployment and hunger. The fact that the worker starts to march in front of the workers who are fighting for rights and the subsequent police intervention allows us to face the law. Our Worker who goes to prison encounters the formalization tactics of the system he was exposed to outside again. The most striking part of the prison episode is that while under the influence of drugs, he empathizes with the lawmen and helps them. The fact that the Worker, who lives more comfortably than the life he will live outside during his time in prison, does not want to remain free is also a guide for measuring the unemployment and hunger dimension.\n\nIn the sequel to the film, Chaplin moves his window to a more social environment. He turns his camera to a street girl who is trying to overcome her desperation by getting support from her family's happiness. The story of this girl, who ran away from social services after the death of her father, bears a close resemblance to the story of Jean Valjean. Just as Victor Hugo described, he is wanted for arrest by the police because of a loaf he stole. While the system appeared as the capital at the beginning of the film, the state and law enforcement agencies assume its role in the sequel of the film. The worker and the Street Girl who ran into him and ran away from the police together are finally starting to dream the American Dream. However, realizing this dream is not so easy.\n\nThe parts where Workman, who found a job as a night guard in a shopping mall and now starts living with Street Girl, spends time in the shopping mall can be interpreted as Chaplin's method of symbolizing consumption. Thanks to these scenes, Chaplin, who has moved from production to consumption, likens the danger of debt to a great abyss that is constantly being navigated on its shore. In these scenes, the \"Danger\" warning that never disappears from the screen and the fact that the space in the middle of the shopping center is surrounded by no railing can be shown as details that support this interpretation. The thieves who entered the shopping center at night said, \"We are not thieves, we are hungry.\" his sentence is also an indication of how far the American Dream is from reality. The worker is arrested again for not doing his job properly. The state continues to appear as an enemy every second in the film. When the worker gets his freedom again, the Street Girl gives him the good news that he has found a home. One step closer to the American Dream. Although it has ceased to be a dream now, this dream is still very far away. But to learn from a news report in the newspaper that the factories have reopened, it would be a hope again.\n\nCharlie Chaplin cinema is not temporally stable. The time that passes between the events may seem too Deceptive, but this situation is parallel to the humorous jargon of the film. In modern Times, when the worker re-enters the factory, the workers go on strike on the same day. This is a naive explanation of how volatile and unstable the political and economic atmosphere is.\n\nModern Times, following the development of the entertainment industry, change the class it focuses on again. Chaplin criticizes the upper-class people's understanding of entertainment and the upper-class entertainment industry, which exists even in a crisis environment, with a dance scene. When he sings with completely made-up lyrics, he is showered with applause by the audience who do not understand what is actually happening. It gives a glimpse into the world of these comfortable people who do not know and do not care what they are applauding. In addition, looking at the issues of hunger and unemployment that are focused on throughout the film from the point of view of the upper stratum, Chaplin draws attention to how many different troubles exist.\n\nModern Times, which strongly emphasizes that the authority does not leave behind any cases where the power pursues it rightly or unjustly, is a classic that clearly shows the struggles of a collapsed economic order. The performance of Paulette Goddarg, who very successfully accompanies the characteristic performance of Charlie Chaplin, also feeds the film. Chaplin's unflinching attitude, combined with his experience as a filmmaker, results in a masterpiece like Modern Times."

He puts smiles on the viewers' faces throughout the movie. So not going into further detail about the technicalities of the movie, it can be said that it makes you smile and think at the same time.

Maybe the most complete, funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art, with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer. If made without a single joke, this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times."

It is also a very powerful commentary on modernisation and industrial development, with a generous splash of politics thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe physical acting on display in this film is absolutely mesmerising and should be mandatory watching for any students of drama or dance. Even if silent films are not your thing, you cannot possibly watch this and not feel like you've witnessed something very special."

I thought it would be too old and boring for me since I tend to watch a lot of modern stuff but I was pleasantly surprised! This is a very well-done piece of work for its time and while a bit doesn't hold up anymore with relevance, at the same time quite a bit of it actually did! I liked both Chapman and Goddard in their roles and the story progressed well, and came to a satisfying ending. Of course it also made me laugh quite a few times as well which it was designed to do for its audience, showing exactly how timeless humor can be! I will definitely be checking out more from Chapman, who I'm impressed directed this film too!! He did great!"

        "review_detailed_main": "OK so in essence this movie perhaps is like the just as brilliant French comedy \"\u00c0 nous la libert\u00e9\" but \"Modern Times\" is a real classic on its own right. To be honest I think that some Chaplin movies and other classic comedies in general are a bit overrated but \"Modern Times\" always had been a movie which I enjoyed watching.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is Charlie Chaplin's protest about the fast growing modern industrial society (seems a like a pretty silly to protest against now days of course). It makes fun of industrialism, with as a result some highly amusing and innovative sequences, when things start to go wrong in the factory, when the tramp starts to loose his mind. This spoof and protest however got him in trouble though, since the American government was not amused by it and labeled him as a communist from that moment on. After that Chaplin left to live for the rest of his love in Switzerland and he never returned to America.\n\nAlthough the movie does feature sound in it, the movie is still shot as a silent movie and also features hardly any dialog in it. It makes this movie of course quite unique and I actually wonder if the movie would had been better if it did feature full sound and more dialog in it. I really don't think so though. Charles Chaplin of course always had been a king of slapstick and silent comedy.\n\nChaplin is in good form in this movie. He shows off his silly antics as his famous tramp character, although in this movie his character is simply listed as 'A factory worker'. His timing and execution is fine as always and provides the movie with moments that will make you laugh, guaranteed. Also Paulette Goddard is fine and looking lovely in this movie. She married Chaplin the same year but then again which co-star didn't Chaplin had a fling with throughout his life.\n\nLike so often he also directed and wrote the movie. With this he shows that he not just had a talent for comedy acting but also really for comical writing and directing. For a silent slapstick movie the movie simply features a good and likable story. Also the directing is done with lots of pace and sense for timing.\n\nIt also has some great looking sets, for factory sequences of course most obviously.\n\nA great Chaplin classic!\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

It is forever talked about and made by a Director/Star who is relentlessly talked about and most likely anyone involved in Film History or just casual lovers of the Art will never go silent on the famous Chaplin.\n\nCharlie did shut up for the longest time. Here in 1936 he bucked all trends and common sense to produce a \"silent\" picture with the most amazing result. It seems that it is so well conceived, so rich in Sociology, so funny in its slapstick and biting satire that once the sheep were herded into the theaters everyone instantly forgot this was a Silent Movie.\n\nThere are numerous set pieces that are part of the social consciousness and subconscious of American life that will remain as long as there is a collective. A sense that we all belong in some sort of macro life force and have the ability to empathize, and have an awareness of our social structure and can feel.\n\nChaplin felt deeply. It is obvious in his Art. In real life he paid a price for anti-establishment views and expressions of discontent. But he never lost the Love and respect from his admirers and Fans. This Movie is considered one of his best. It is, because of its insights and sight gags, its heart and its mindful attempt to enlighten while entertaining."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Who's that goofy looking man with the over-sized suit stuck in that machine?\" One would ask catching a glimpse of Charlie Chaplain's Modern Times (1927). Charlie Chaplain, bent and contorted between gears and sprockets, provokes laughs as well as thoughtful insight into man's relationship with technology. This film entices one to consider the conflict between the human body and machines.\n\nTo stimulate thoughts on man's relationship with machines, Modern Times places the main character, a happy-go-lucky factory worker who inadvertently finds trouble with the law and has difficulty keeping a job, in a variety of awkward situations. In telling his story, the movie exposes themes surrounding industrialization, unemployment, and social stratification. These themes reflect the movie's main point that industrialization can lead to unemployment and a stratified social structure.\n\nIndustrialization is a major theme in the movie. At a factory, it is obvious that machines play a large role. In fact, it seems that the men are secondary to the machines. The workers do their work based on what the machines do; a machine is even brought in to feed the workers. This is apparent during the main character's struggle to keep up with an ornery conveyor belt. Eventually, the main character finds himself sucked into the machine. Watching a man surrounded by the inner workings of the machine, one cannot help but reflect on the ubiquitous nature of machines in society. Although the machines are helpful, their presence causes hardship amongst many.\n\nThe increasing use of machines is depicted in the film as a chief cause of unemployment. While trying to find work, Chaplain's character experiences the hardships caused by vast unemployment. A young female friend of his personifies the struggle endured by many who could not find work. The machines are directly connected to unemployment through a newspaper clipping. The clipping reads, \"Factories Open: Men returning to work.\" Were it not for the machines in these factories, men would have no work, but one must remember that it was the machines who put them out of work in the first place.\n\nThe movie goes on to suggest that machines have stratified society. While many suffer from unemployment because of the machines, others thrive. The president of the factory provides the best example of this. He sits in his office doing puzzles and occasionally shouting an order through a machine. While his workers exert themselves and others starve on the streets, this man has benefited greatly because of machines.\n\nThrough these themes, one notices the constant conflict between man and machine. Chaplain's character struggles against conveyor belts and escalators and suffers at the hands of an uncontrollable feeding machine. While in a constant struggle with machines not to be replaced, man finds himself in need of them as well. They make his life easier in some cases. Although produced seventy years ago, the social commentary provided in this film raises pertinent questions for today. As machines become \"smarter\" and more useful, how can man maintain his value?"

        "review_detailed_main": "One of the last silent films of its era. In this film, Chaplin presents a critical analysis of industrialization and its effects on society, especially on the world of work. His unique style as a multi-talent (actor, director, screenwriter and composer) is fully manifested here. The almost perfectly balanced interplay of Chaplin's pantomimes and the specially composed music supports the film and conveys the unique comedy. Chaplin left out the dialogue in the film because the technical change from silent to sound film was already uneasy. The film has less of a well-structured plot than it is made up of individual, magnificently staged scenes. The film is still an extremely watchable film today. Its universal themes, masterful staging and timeless comedy make it a work that is still relevant and entertaining even after so many years.\n\nThe critical examination of industrialization and social problems remains relevant in the modern world."

Telling the story of The Tramp as he struggles with the change with modern society, he meets a young girl whose father was killed and whose sisters were taken from her, Chaplin forms a bond with her and does everything in his power to assist her.\n\nPerfectly directed with stunning cinematography and iconic shots (none more so than Chaplin in the interior of the machinery as he goes through the assembly line), Chaplin masters everything once more. The score is beautiful, his direction is perfect, his performance as perfect if not better and with a strong supporting performance, Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" masterfully conveys the struggle of poverty better than most \"talkie\" films ever could.\n\nBrilliantly paced for a film with no dialogue, \"Modern Times\" is a hilarious film that is satisfying in every possible way."

You can just watch it and enjoy it anyway or you can watch this and be in awe of how you basically are watching the inception of cinema unfolding before your eyes. This movie is clearly one of the influential of all time, you don't need a critic or me to say that. The whole way through I was wanting The Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) to say \"Ciao, Bella!\" like from Life is Beautiful (1997). The absurdity juxtaposed to the monotonous tasks performed throughout is where the insanely funny slapstick. It's quite remarkable how just body language can make you laugh so hard. The movie is quite clearly a preach on capitalism and respecting and helping the poor, which even holds up to this day. Chaplin, and the rest of the cast, have this uncanny ability to create story and narrative just through a few cards of text and their body language. The musical score also is amazing at creating the story, maybe even more so than the acting. The silence is new to me, but I enjoyed it so much as i let me imagine what they wer saying. The ADR, which I am imagining wasn't in the original, is horrendous but what are you expecting? Brilliant movie that anyone remotely interested in film should watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, I know that Modern Times were not Chaplin's first attempt at drama (the first one was A Woman of Paris, that did not go well with the critics or the audience, and the poor Chaplin even had to apologize for trying out something honest!), but it is his first successful and winning formula of smuggling a drama in the disguise as a comedy. While even City Lights showed Chaplin in a dramatic role, Modern Times seems to me, even today, as primary a dramatic, tragic film about the Great Depression, and only secondary as a comedy. Bear with me, I am aware that there are a lot of laughs in this one, yet watching the movie as a whole, as a context, they seem to be there to at least keep a little will for life in the otherwise bitter, sad and depressing story. Heck, even the ending is revealing.\n\nChaplin here plays his iconic Tramp, except that this time practically half of all the characters in the movie can be labeled as such - bums, poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions, the story is even more relevant today after the 2008 financial crisis. Heck, you could screen this at the shelters, the people would identify with this for sure. Chaplin was rich, but he came from a very poor family and never forgot how it is to work hard for a living. He was aware of the changes in the society and how millions of people were struggling to survive, so he channeled their frustration into this movie, a warning to the people in charge to do something. Things eventually improved, only to just recently get back to a state Chaplin was warning all along. Modern Times are a classic of unobtrusive social commentary, an ironic tragedy where technology - instead of making jobs easier for the people - just made them work even more, and the wages were so low you could not afford to live. Inside Job (2010) or Capitalism: A Love Story (2009) cannot even hold a candle to this. The sequence where Chaplin is frantically trying to keep up with a production line, tightening bolts, may not be as iconic or recognizable as his 'shoe dance' in The Gold Rush, but it is way more identifiable and easier to connect with the daily life, at least for me."

Modern Times had many exceptional scenes and my favorites include: The climax dance and the events prior to it where he plays rugby with that roast duck, relieving the ship from the dock, blindfolding himself and skating in a danger zone, The dream scene with Paulette in which he had grapes and apples grown inside his home and a cow that milks himself and, the test he undergoes with the food-machine.\n\nRollie Totheroh's photography is masterful.

People trying to make more money on people who don't have any. The two main characters that are struggling just to get by never make a sound. Also when Chaplin does finally speak he signs a song to Americans in another language and they love it. Actions speak louder than words and that's what this movie is about. Chaplin pokes fun at the new films and makes a silent movie when they were all but over. Probably one of the 50 best movies ever made for its history, hidden meanings, and subtext."

        "review_title": "Coming to grips with a changing world.",
        "review_detailed_main": "This is now the fourth Chaplin film I've watched in succession. I'm aware that I'm going with the favourites in The Kid, The Gold Rush and City Lights, but still what a career. He's The Tramp again here, this time struggling to keep up with a modern world that's speeding up around him. It strikes me that although on the surface we think of The Tramp as the lovable fool. Where Chaplin excels is placing him in worlds that the audience recognise and can emphasise with. How would Chaplin back in 1936 imagine these films being enjoyed nearly a century later. Sure our connection to the changing world of the 30s isn't really there, but I think in 2022 we can all still empathise with things changing around us without our control. The Tramp is a factory worker, thrust into a world of machines, electricity, productivity. He seems ill suited. The Tramp appreciates life, his calm polite energy at odds with this steel and chrome environment. He's certainly at odds with his boss, the president of the factory (Al Ernest Garcia), who was also the millionaire's butler in City Lights. He wants everything yesterday. Why let workers stop for lunch, when you can get a machine to feed them faster while still on the job! The Tramp, always the genuine pig expertly shows why some things are best done old school. This feels like a much more physical performance, as The Tramp loses his marbles in the industrial frenzy, literally caught in the machine. The camera moves more too though, giving this a phrenetic pace. Until it all becomes too much and The Tramp looks for a life without excitement. Without any effort though, excitement always finds him. Mistaken as a communist leader, accidentally getting high on Coke whist banged up, thwarting prison breaks. It's not short on drama. As is often the case with Chaplin films though, the heart of it is people. Here his understanding that modernisation isn't working well for everyone. Machines are taking jobs and the mass unemployed are being left behind. The Tramp's affable nature puts him in situations that aren't just funny, but allow him the chance to help those around him. He can't help it. He's looking out for himself too, but is just inherently programmed to do the right thing, even when it's the wrong thing. The score, also by Chaplin as well as writing and directing is great. He understands the rhythm of the story, how each scene moves things along and how the music brings the emotion and voices to the silent characters on screen. The Tramp finds himself a partner in crime with a young homeless woman (Paulette Goddard), who's an interesting character in herself. She's not the stereotype of the usual female roles of the era. Shoeless and slightly bedraggled she has a wonderful unencumbered freedom to her performance and she compliments Chaplin perfectly as they dream of a different life in a department store after hours. They're a sweet pair, happy in their version of domesticity, but the call of work is never far away, as is The Tramp's ability to find the humour in every situation. Like helping a trapped coworker with his lunch by funnelling tea into his mouth through a chicken, brilliant! Will he find a steady job though and will The Tramp and his partner's checkered past catch up with them? It's certainly the busiest looking Chaplin film I've seen so far, but he never loses sight of the importance of character, of story arc, of keeping an audience on its toes and doing it with a delightful sense of purity."

        "review_detailed_main": "I loved this movie from the fist time I've seen it and would watch it for countless times without getting tired. This is what I call flawless&timeless comedy.\n\nYet a comedy of the more serious sort,a somewhat humorous version of a movie symbolically anticipating modernity,in the style of Metropolis or 1984. Instead of depicting this topic in an apocalyptic style,he analyzes the issue in a humorous style,at the same time critical. The story is set in hard(by the way might the title be inspired by Dickens's famous novel \"Hard Times\"?,Dickens also being a ruthless social critic,both Dickens and Chaplin having grown up in London's most desolate neighborhoods,both having experienced hunger,utter poverty,society's worst parts before they both became rich and famous)rather than modern times,in the time of the Great Depression.\n\nWhatever Chaplin stated,the film has a clear social message,the opening scene beginning with a black sheep among white ones,the very next second instead of the sheep you see a very sheepish crowd of busy workers flocking,hurrying to work(needless to say that the black sheep is,of course,the Tramp)-a brilliant symbol standing for the way consumer-society is altering mankind into animal-like,unidentified,mechanized masses. This time the Tramp,again nameless,appears in the cast simply as \"a factory worker\",but still he is nameless and also unfit for living in an industrialized(or any kind of)society. The way industrialism and modern living is altering our natural self is depicted in various scenes:long after work Chaplin's character compulsively and convulsively repeats the repetitive moments he is daily performing at the assembly-line(criticizing Ford?),the feeding machine: it feeds the worker automatically so he doesn't go on lunch break and therefore he saves time-it just shows how extremely thrifty and greedy capitalist bosses can be to introduce such appliances,and,the most iconic,best remembered scene from this movie when the little fellow is literally turned,twisted among the wheels of a huge and surrealistic industrial machine.\n\nFollowing various mishaps the Tramp is first believed to be a Communist,as a red flag accidentally fell of a truck and as he is following the truck in order to give the flag back he unintentionally waves the flag,attracting the masses of hungry,unemployed,angry people into the streets and into a demonstration(after all this is the Great Depression). In a series of adventures,in which the Tramp is involved,including being jailed,being taken for mad,being employed and then fired,he doesn't much alter his characteristic lifestyle-extremely miserably poor,yet somewhat careless. And he's got a female companion to stand by him,the(also nameless)Gamine,superbly acted by gorgeously attractive then-wife Paulette Goddard,as poor,wild,bohemian,good-humored as he is: they even fancy Paradise together,in a respectable home combining both modern comfort and luxury but also a return to a more natural,country-style living(almost like Biblical Paradise).\n\nThen comes my favorite scene from this movie,one of the most funny in movie history,the scene where Chaplin sings gibberish his all time hit the Nonsense song-pity that i don't have the text,I would so gladly sing along!Ironically Chaplin first wanted to sing the original version of it,the than famous hit \"Titine\" complete with all its lyrics but by not doing so he made film history-as the Tramp has the text written on his cuff which he accidentally lost he has to improvise in front of his audience,singing imaginary words sounding,without actually being so,somewhat French or Italian,accompanied by Chaplin's characteristic gestures,depicting a possible storyline for the imaginary lyrics-later on this scene was copied,without the same wit and fun in many films-for instance,look carefully at the act performed by the wandering entertainers at the hotel from Death in Venice or the carnival scene from Fellini's Vitelloni,where an overlong instrumental version of Titine is played by the band,the effect being,as expected,terribly entertaining and hilarious,matching the mood of the partying crowds,being still the perfect party music in 1953 like it was in 1936(and probably even today).\n\nSeldomly a film has captured the essence of consumerism more accurate than this-applying to our today's world more than ever,seldomly a comic has inspired so many other great comics. Should never be forgotten-that is if you need a huge portion of healthy and yet intelligent laughter over and over again."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" is exceptional for several reasons. With it one of the most well-known characters in cinema history, the beloved little Tramp, bids his farewell as the time of silents had definitely ended in 1935. Yet despite the odds are against him and his girl (played by his wife at the time, the gorgeous, cheeky Paulette Goddard), the Tramp's departure doesn't end on a sad note. Rather the both of them set out to greet the dawn, smiling in a heart-warming finale...\n\nBut \"Modern Times\" is also a film that addresses the dehumanizing aspects the rationalization of labor brings to the modern employee, where the sheep flock into the factories only to become cogs among cogs in a machinery which eats them up. You can take that quite literally in a Chaplin film. And to this day the poignancy of Chaplin's ingenious take on the consequences of industrialization which he fights against as the black sheep are as valid as they were when the film was made. And as funny - after all it's perfectionist Charlie Chaplin who is at work here, who wrote, directed, composed music for and starred in his film. See him tighten screws at the conveyor belt and everywhere else he is not supposed to, head a communist movement, sink a ship, roller-skate with a blindfold, being fed by a new invention, or cause chaos in a magnificent set piece that could have been taken right out of \"Metropolis\". Oh, and then there's of course that famous one and only scene when the little Tramp finally does open his mouth and, well, he surprises once more as you may discover. The language of the little Tramp is universal, you know, regardless of culture, color or age..."

        "review_title": "The Tramp says farewell with his best piece of advice for all",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.\"\n\nI can't think of a more fitting line than that final one from the Tramp to the Gamin to say farewell to silent films as they cheerfully walk towards the horizon. By 1936 everyone was watching talkies and they expected Modern Times to be Chaplin's first one considering his previous film, City Lights, had already incorporated some sound effects five years ago. Modern Times is considered one of Chaplin's finest movies and perhaps a lot of it has to do with the fact that it was his last silent film so it has the nostalgic factor going for it. The way Chaplin incorporates sound in Modern Times is pure genius because the only moments where we hear sound is when they come from mechanical devices, so in a way he blended the social critique of the Industrial age with his own critique of the use of sound in film. This mechanical monster that was taking over his industry was putting an end to the silent era which made him such a popular figure. Chaplin may have stated that his films aren't social critiques, but I don't think anyone managed to capture the human spirit during that era better than he did. During the first hour of this film which I earnestly enjoyed I couldn't quite understand why this film was considered superior to his other films which I enjoyed more. Up to that moment there wasn't really a scene that stood out for me like there had been in all his other features. Then suddenly when I was about to lose hope came the restaurant scene where the Tramp performs a song where we can't understand what he's saying, but through his gestures he makes himself perfectly understood. That was the scene that sold this movie for me and reminded me of Chaplin's genius. The ending in Modern Times is perhaps my favorite ending in all of Chaplin's films, although I still think I would rank City Lights as his best film.\n\nIn his last silent film Charles Chaplin stars as the Tramp once again, and this time we find him working at an assembly line in a factory. The quick working pace and the mechanized movements he has to make slowly begin to affect him. He can't keep up with the pace in the assembly line and production is delayed because of him. During a lunch break he is chosen for experimentation with an automatic feeding machine that they want to sell to the president of the steel corporation. The machine goes haywire and the Tramp also begins to lose his sanity so he is sent to a mental hospital. Eventually he is released but after an unfortunate incident he is mistaken for a communist and imprisoned. In prison he becomes a hero by stopping several prisoners from breaking out of jail so he is released. Unemployed and unable to find a job all he wants is to go back to prison, but when he meets a Gamin (Paulette Goddard) and falls in love with her, he makes it his goal to find a job and buy a house where the two can live happily ever after, but in these modern times it won't be an easy task.\n\nCharlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard have excellent chemistry together although the film is a little too sentimental at times. In Modern Times, Chaplin manages to once again balance pathos with slapstick, but I found some of the scenarios to be a little too similar to his other films so I felt it was getting a bit repetitive. However, what Chaplin does really well here is include the social elements of the time and use it to his advantage by focusing on the struggle the people had adapting to the modern industrial age. He does this by using satire through his brilliant physical comedy. In an era of dehumanization, Chaplin humanizes Modern Times with a sweet and tender story reminding everyone that the obstacles can be overcome. With every new problem that the Tramp has to face somehow he always finds a way to remain hopeful and rise to the occasion. That is perhaps why his comedies still remain timeless and continues to touch the hearts of those who encounter Chaplin for the first time. They will also understand that dialogue was not always necessary to tell a story, and the best to do so was Chaplin with his unique energy and brilliance."

        "review_detailed_main": "It will probably be close to being useless reviewing a classic film--especially this masterpiece of Charlie Chaplin, the best comic genius who ever lived.\n\nThe movie brings back some memories of my theater class under another genius, Professor Anton Juan, who is probably already a legend in the Philippine Theater history. Sir Anton required us to watch Modern Times in order to get insights about basic acting movements. Back then in 1998, it was extremely difficult to find classic films because there weren't any pirated DVDs available. Good thing, a classmate found a video rental shop where classic films in VHS were available to be let.\n\nWe watched the movie in White Plains, at the house of one of my classmates. Prior to watching the film, we haven't seen any single film by Chaplin. We knew who Charlie Chaplin was but we didn't know any of his works. He was just that funny tramp with a funny mustache known around the world.\n\nWatching Modern Times was a revelation for me. It was laugh-out-loud funny yet picturesque and thought-provoking. The film depicts the plight of Man in the modern world of industrialization, where men are like robots literally being winded by gears of monstrous machines or droves of sheep moving side by side aimlessly without a shepherd.\n\nIt is a story of a factory worker who became jaded by the monotony of his job, tightening the screws of some metal plates. The dreariness of his life messed his sanity and he was sent to the hospital after attacking people with his monkey wrenches and tools. After being released, by pure unlucky accident, he was put into prison after being mistaken as a leader of a strike. Once in prison, he felt that it was much better to live there than out in the streets where people lead miserable lives, jobless, hungry, and desensitized. In and out of prison, he just survived--until he met a woman whom he felt a connection with--then, he started to live.\n\nChaplin brilliantly explores and satirizes the greatest burden of Man: work. As time flies by quickly, Man finds himself unable to keep up with everything happening around him. He feels lost and defeated, realizing how small and unimportant he is in the society.\n\nChaplin's remedy to this universal problem is simple: positivity. For the simple tramp who always sees the bright side of life thrives and survives. The world is one big comedic act.\n\nMore than any other film, Modern Times was the first film that made me appreciate the language and beauty of film. It made me a film addict, rummaging through various DVD kiosks, looking for classics, searching for beauty.\n\nIn our modern times, we are trapped in a fast-paced world, jarring with montages and mountains of images, issues and crises that have been unthought of in the past centuries. But as Charlie Chaplin delivers it plainly at the end of Modern Times, the only way to live through all of this is just to... smile.\n\n:)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor,director,writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film.\n\nSadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent film making began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.\n\nTimeless Charlie Chaplin satire savagely critiques the industrial age and its dehumanizing effects on the working class. After his monotonous assembly line job leads to a stay in a mental asylum, Chaplin is released and encounters lovely hobo Paulette Goddard. Soon, his desire to make a better life for his new love leads to a side-splitting series of failed jobs and prison stays.\n\nModern Times is also one of the most stirring love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.\n\nFinal shot is among Chaplin's most famous and most moving. The final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world. 10/10\n\nThe Chaplin-Goddard Marriage: Was It Legal?\n\nCharlie Chaplin. Famous for his tumultuous early marriages, his third \"marriage\" to actress Paulette Goddard has been the source of much scrutiny and doubt. Some say the issue even cost Goddard the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.\n\nThe pair met in 1932, when Goddard was still a chorus girl, and became fast friends and lovers, Paulette even moving into Chaplin's Beverly Hills home. He bought her contract from producer Hal Roach and cast her in his classic Modern Times, which took two years to develop and film. After the release of Modern Times in 1936 the couple went on a tour of the Orient where they supposedly married secretly aboard ship. However, no official paperwork was ever provided to substantiate the claim which had the potential to further harm Paulette Goddard's career. They went on to co-star in Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, but the relationship began to fizzle. When the two decided to part ways in 1942, Goddard obtained a quickie divorce in Mexico and allegedly received a handsome settlement.\n\nGoddard went on to become a major star at Paramount and Chaplin (after a nasty paternity suit) married his final wife, Oona O'Neill in 1943."

        "review_title": "Chaplin saved his best silent film for his last...",
        "review_detailed_main": "... as I find it to be the combination of the most relatable and the funniest of his films.\n\nNormally I start these reviews with a short synopsis of the plot with a few personal observations, but it's hard to do that in this case without it turning into a bunch of \"And then's\". I've read that Chaplin had the general idea of what kind of film he wanted to make in this case, and came up with the specific skits and gags he wanted, and then built a specific plot around it. It was unusual for Chaplin to put any of the women in his life into his films, at least while they WERE the women in his life, and it was also unusual for them to get away without having at least one child by him. Paulette Goddard managed to do both. So Goddard is \"a gamin\" - a street urchin, also known as Ellen. Chaplin is just \"the tramp\" character that he normally is.\n\nAt first, the tramp is all alone facing these \"modern times\" of the 1930s - a dehumanizing factory job that causes a breakdown, then he's falsely labeled as a Communist leader and instigator and jailed, and when released he finds himself looking for work among the many millions of unemployed during the Great Depression. His fate joins with Ellen when she is caught stealing a loaf of bread and he takes the blame for it to spare her from jail. When they both escape - they are both arrested for the thievery - they join forces and try to find happiness around the edges of society, finding jobs when they can.\n\nThis is Chaplin's last silent film, but it really is more of a mute sound film than a true silent. The factory boss speaks - \"Get back to work!\" and Chaplin himself sings the gibberish song towards the end of the film - the first time his voice had ever been heard on film. You can also hear the crowd noise in the cafe when Chaplin sings.\n\nThis film has lots of blatant anti-capitalist themes, based on Chaplin's long held beliefs and observations from a childhood rife with poverty, as well as the contrast of the America he found when he returned after being abroad for a good long time versus the one he left, before the Great Depression had taken hold. Had he not been playing his Little Tramp character while making all of these statements with his art, the film might not have been passed by the censors."

        "review_detailed_main": "We all know and somehow have memories and nostalgic feelings about \"Modern times\" made by the legend of silent movies sir Charles Chaplin And we all have listened to the voice of Chaplin who's singing at the end of this masterpiece\n\nModern times is a silent movie about the human progress which had lead them into a new world, (the world of machinery) , (the trap of gears). There is no love and there is no smile in this world but as usual our old fellow following his own old footsteps doesn't want to get involved in this soulless world. He's still doing his old deeds having fun with himself and falling in love but this not from the heart but like a robot, and that's what makes this movie so sad. He goes to jail more than often, and it's like all the world is against him unlike the kid or the gold rush which have bright endings this one ends in a different way you do not know what's gonna happen to them, where are they going to go or where they are going to settle , but you surely know that there is no future waiting for the tramp and his love If we look deeply into Chaplins face we'll notice that from the beginning until the end there is no trace of real happiness in it and all the smiles and funny deeds are out of habit. I believe that Chaplin failed in his woks after he entered to the world of talkies and I personally do not like non of his sound movies But certainly it's the same issue for him too, he had never wanted to enter to this new noisy word because he knew that if he would've entered this world of gears there which nobody listens to anyone he will fail to even utter a single word And no one is going to listen That's why all the world in the movie had cried when Chaplin began to sing\n\n(He once had a lot of things to say, but the time he has opened his mouth there's left nothing to be shared)"

        "review_title": "A Satirical Masterpiece",
        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times is a satire on capitalism; it highlights the drawbacks of the Industrial Revolution and how machines have burgeoned into a menace, dominating all aspects of human life. It is the story of an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the various social and economic changes; generated with the advent of industrialization. It portrays how capitalism can push an individual to the periphery of the society. The first shot transforms from a flock of sheep to a crowd of people .Idea associative montage has been used to portray that human beings have lost their individuality and their lives are dictated by a social dogma. The movie was made when the world was going under an economic crisis and the political undertones employed, in this movie, are very conspicuous. Charlie Chaplin is shown as an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the industrial and social changes. The movie is about his constant conflict with capitalists, police and the society in general; the movie is definitely a landmark in comedy. The impeccable humor timing of Chaplin makes him one of the greatest entertainers in film history; but despite being a comedy one cannot help but wonder about the various political and connotations made in a satirical and humorous way. The movie, in a subtle way, highlights the plight of the working class who are often exploited by the capitalists. The movie was made after the great depression during which thousands of people were unemployed and many families starved to death. The movie was light years ahead of its time and delivered strong thoughts in the form of humor; the movie has a lot memorable scenes which make us laugh and think at the same time. This movie is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made; made by a genius who was not only a great film maker but also a greet visionary. This piece of art has stood the test of time and has been appreciated by people of all ages. This movie serves as a testimonial to the artistic and creative genius of one of the greatest entertainers to have graced the celluloid screen."

The unfortunate experience of an unemployed man is treated as a comedy, and the director makes his work and life constantly ups and downs, and constantly reverses, and constantly gets new opportunities, which shows that life is indeed difficult, but it is not completely without a way out. Who says that a diaosi at the bottom of the heap is impossible to reverse? Even if he does not succeed in the secular sense, he can at least get the care of the beloved, can harvest a more promising life. This hope will not fade away, either in the 1930s, when the gap between the rich and the poor was huge, or in today's more modern world nearly a century later."

        "review_title": "A cinematic marvel too modern for its times",
        "review_detailed_main": "There is a single scene in Modern Times which perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the production, one where a blindfolded Charlie Chaplin, essaying his timeless 'Little Tramp' figure for the last time, roller-skates around the top floor of a department store, continually skating perilously close to the edge of a steep drop but each time miraculously changing direction at the last moment, danger averted by a hair. As well as a perfect example of the absurdly meticulous care Chaplin invested in his film-making process and enormous risks he took for his art, the sequence proves allegorical for the film as a whole: breathtaking, dazzlingly beautiful, hilarious and yet always on the brink of a fatal crash, each time veering away at the last moment. Considering all the factors against, it remains astounding that Modern Times works as a film - an almost entirely silent film released several years after talking pictures had permeated the film industry which also proved a daring social critique masked as a silly slapstick comedy. Yet despite what a difficult sell such a film must have been, Chaplin's frantic energy, confidence and eternal courage instead elevate the film into a monumental accomplishment, simultaneously challenging and enormously entertaining, decades ahead of its time, as its ironic title would suggest.\n\nOf course, as such it inevitably proved a box office failure, with audiences uneasy about a film seeming to rally communist support for striking workers (an interpretation Chaplin wryly mocks in a sequence where the Tramp is jailed for accidentally leading a worker's revolt), but such an initial failure only served to demonstrate how innovative Modern Times was and remains. For a film appearing to be loosely structured around a series of sight gags, it is easy to mistake the remarkable complexity inherent in Chaplin's masterpiece. The seamless integration of barbed satire of authority and social commentary on poverty into Chaplin's hysterical slapstick were hard worn cinematic traits of his by now, but his critique on the dehumanizing monotony of industrialization and factory work is what generates the real spark, providing a whole new setting for Chaplin's irreverent tramp to wreak havoc and expose the inherent problems of (one particularly witty situation sees the workers, chasing the tramp magnetically dash back to their assembly lines as soon as the lines are turned back on).\n\nBut every time the depiction of rising poverty and unemployment rates grows too sombre, Chaplin veers the film emotionally off into the opposite direction, perfectly counterbalancing such sobering undertones with astonishing acrobatics, inspired silliness and an ever infectious cheeriness, even in the face of increasing adversity. While poverty may not be entirely avoidable, Chaplin seems to imply, everlasting persistence and optimism are often the best one can do - a potentially overly saccharine message, but from a film which produces such genuine, unfiltered movie magic (the aforementioned roller-skating scene being only one of countless examples) it is difficult to imagine a more fitting culmination.\n\nThe fanatical dedication of Chaplin pervades every aspect of the production (most of which he personally toiled on) from his subtle but rock steady direction and perfect pacing, to his wonderfully resonant musical score to his usual knack for ingenious setting choices, firmly imbedding the viewer in both unsettlingly realistic dank, dirty depression era streets and one of the worst imaginable industrial black holes. Chaplin's factory setting is a fascinating, albeit grim cinematic marvel, both fantastic and frighteningly real, with horrific machinery no doubt inspired by Fritz Lang's dystopian Metropolis, but serving instead as an unconventional playground, with the nightmarish turning cogs and spewing bouts of steam making for some of the film's best sight gags.\n\nOf course to downplay the performance of Chaplin himself would be an unpardonable offence, as the last outing of the delightful Tramp proves arguably one of his most rounded performances. As the tramp is continually hard done by, struggling to survive in an impoverished, industrial nightmare of a world, the everlasting twinkle in his eye and bumbling gait make such a journey a hilariously enjoyable and poignant one instead of a melodramatically downbeat one. Ever hysterical and brimming with cheery pathos, Chaplin's tramp is as much a joy to behold as always, his final appearance truly one for the ages (fittingly enough, his 'last words' are \"C'mon - smile!\"). Backing up the irresistible dynamo of a lead, Paulette Goddard brings a rawly determined vulnerability and feisty charm to her impoverished female lead, making her infinitely more compelling and likable than the usual starry eyed love interest role.\n\nEasily one of his very best (if not singularly best) pieces of work, Chaplin's Modern Times is a masterpiece of film-making, a pinnacle of cinematic comedy and an exuberantly emotional triumph, perfectly blending an underbelly of dark satire and social commentary with irreverent silliness and wit. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting or all around majestic swan song to the tramp's legacy, instantly worth seeing for any viewers unfortunate enough to have not yet experienced it.\n\n-10/10"

        "review_title": "Chaplin Sticks to his Plan, Makes a Silent Film, in 1936 yet! It sure must be Great to own your Films, Studio and be a Founding Partner in the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation!",
        "review_detailed_main": "A Film by Charles Chaplin as Writer,Producer,Lead Actor,Composer of Musical Score. with Paulette Goddard,Henry Bergman,Tiny Sandford,Chester Conklin,Hank Mann,Stanley Blystone,Allan Garcia,Richard Alexander, etc,etc......\n\nMr. Charles Chaplin saw himself as a sort of \"Champion of the oppressed, the Figting Hero of the Little Guy\",a sort of real-life Charles Foster Kane; albeit one with his own motion pictures to use, rather than the mythical newspaper, The Daily Inquirer. To a high degree, this was largely true.\n\nHis Little Tramp character was indeed a reflection of all of the countless anonymous, ordinary folk who go about their business, day in and day out, looking for no help from government or anyone else. Charlie's character is much more than an image of a man in a story. He is a sort of symbol, often times functioning like an editorial cartoon.\n\nChaplin was also fortunate to have been a man of good business sense, as well as a singularly gifted Actor/Artist/Director/Writer/Composer. He always had a keen interest in Political and Socio-Economic systems, including the then fashionable types of Socialism in the world. This favourite party-time talk fodder was little more than that, in that he was never too willing to open up his check book in order to aid either the Fabian Socialists or Joe Stalin's Gang or whoever else. None the less, this interest would help to categorize him as \"an Undesirable Alien\", who was refused re-entry into the USA in 1952. As a further indication of his Business Sense, he had the re-release of the gems from his vault coincide with his triumphant return to the United States after 20 years exile.*\n\nThat's enough of that business. We've all heard it before. Let's get on with the examination and evaluation of this film, this MODERN TIMES (1936).\n\nChaplin definitely was also a champion of another cause, almost one at that. This would be the Silent Movie form. Here was a movie type, previously the only kind, but by now, the mid '30's, that was now old hat, pass\u00e9, outmoded, old fashioned and all but deserted. Yet Charlie made fine use of the art form of the silents twice in what we will call the \"Post JAZZ SINGER (1927) Age\". Twice in the decade of the 1930's a Chaplin Feature was made as a Silent, the sound track being used for musical score and some sound effects.\n\nIn this MODERN TIMES the period viewed by our 1972 audience was then nearly 40 years old. It could be even older in a sense; the period in which young Mr. Chaplin formed his attitudes and opinions would set this story,attitudinally,back to a Pre-World War I society.\n\nSo, we saw a serio-comic look at Industrialization, Labor Relations, Economic Boom, Governmental \"assistence\", Red Tape and uncontrollable human emotions of true love and despair(leading to suicide!). In presentation of such matters, the Writer/Director was wise in spreading all the \"bitter pills\" throughout the story.\n\nAnd the scenario itself is slowly developed. The elements of the story line are given plenty of cushioning. The plot is unfolded in a series of extended situations, using different circumstances, changing settings. It is almost as if there were 5 or 6 2 Reelers contained within this one Supersized Comedy.\n\nWhereas this is a Chaplin homage to the Silent Screen, it was also their Swan Song. Sir Charles realized that no one, not even the Little Tramp would or could delay the eventual inevitable for very long. Here are several instances of dialog on the sound track. Other than a fine comical song an dance by the Little Tramp ,the other 3 or 4 occasions of sound all originate in a mechanical devise, Radio, Closed circuit television or phonograph record.\n\nSo MODERN TIMES bids a fond farewell to not only the silent, but to a style of writing. In his previous films, the rule of thumb was avoid the use of Proper Names for the character in favor of only the descriptive terms of the characters in the story. Hence, we had terms like \"a Tramp\", \"a Gamin\", \"the Mayor\", a Drunk\", \"a Millionaire\", \"a Factory Worker\", etc., etc. (For some reason \"Tiny\" Sandford's character in MODERN TIMES rates a name, \"Big Bill\"!) Chaplin Features made after this generally assigned full names to their main characters, e.g., Henri Verdoux-Charlie's name as the main character in MONSIEOUR VERDOUX(1947).\n\nSo we, of the Post War Baby Boomer crowd were introduced to Mr. Chaplin's work. This was in a big way utilizing a whole season of screening most of his top features,rather than the viewing of an occasional old, butchered up Keystone Short, sans title cards. This was the story on early Television, and mainly on kiddie shows.\n\nThe release schedule wenta lika thisa: MODERN TIMES(1936), CITY LIGHTS(1931), THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940), MONSIEUR VERDOUX(1947), LIMELIGHT(1952), A KING IN NEW YORK(1957) and the compilation, THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959)**. After this series was screened, one could be properly classified as an expert in Chapliniana.\n\nAs a sure sign of change, Chaplin's Signature Ending of Walking Off, Down the Highway of Life, features a companion. The Little Tramp is joined by the Gamin(Paulette Goddard),as an offering of Hope, but forever altering the Chaplin Film.\n\nNOTE* The invitation was from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences. They gave Sir Charles a Special Oscar for Lifetime Service to the moving picture business. It was at the 1972 Oscars seen on ABC.\n\nNOTE** The film THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959) was a fine compilation of 3 of his short subjects from his tenure at First National Pictures. It consists of SHOULDER ARMS(1918), A DOG's LIFE(1918)and THE PILGRIM(1922). Added footage is shown of super sped up construction of Chaplin Studios, mock \"Rehearsing\" for the Camera's benefit and original musical score and crisp narration by Mr. Charles Chaplin, himself!\n\nThis film is highly recommended as a Chaplin Primer for anyone's initial Chaplin experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times is a film I would describe as a roller coaster. In the beginning, I expected it would go in one direction, but towards the middle, a new character was introduced, and the story progressed in a different turn of events. I love how they wrapped up the obstacles in the end. To sum it up, the silent film follows Charlie Chaplin throughout his various employment adventures which leads to comedic side quests. Along the way, Charlie befriends the Gamin and together they both work to earn money while dreaming of living a better future.\n\nOverall, I would recommend watching Modern Times, I laughed so much in the beginning that I could not get enough and I ended up expecting more of the funny scenes. I was surprised to see that this film also touches on deeper themes, such as life's hardships of exploitation of labor and the working class. In some way, it made me feel seen that even the people of this era faced similar struggles as my family. Charlie Chaplin's stunt tricks in the film were also incredibly satisfying to watch and the rollerskates scenes will always remain iconic in film history.\n\nI believe it is important to watch Modern Times because it highlights various classic comedic scenes that are valuable for filmmakers seeking to learn and analyze production techniques. If you are a struggling filmmaker looking to compete with the new generation of advanced digital effects or for inspiration, it might not be a bad idea to revisit the basics of early cinema history. Older film tells us a lot about basic storytelling and filmmaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin is one of the actors, who gives us his body and his soul playing for the audiences in series of pantomimed movies. It is easy for all of us to express what we think, feel, and are concerned of by simply opening our mouth and speaking out, but Chaplin shows us that the ability to communicate with the other actors and the audience can be accomplished not only by the verbal speech, but also by the body language and our inner intentions. In the movie \"Modern Times\", he gives us a show of his sarcasm towards the fast-paced technology and the inability to catch up with the modernization in the world he lives in. The technology he describes and is concerned of supposedly should help us in our daily tasks as well as improve our life for the better; miserably it not only creates difficulties for him, but also makes it emotionally unbearable for him to deal with. He tries to be as fast as he could be when screwing in the nuts of the machines; he tries to adjust his attitude and physical body to perform and give his one hundred percent, but unfortunately he is left with disappointment when catching up with the rapid environment he is surrounded by. His skills and mind become rusty as he works only on one part of the assembly line over and over again like a robot without a break. His body is beaten- up from work and there is either no excitement at the work place or no direct benefits from the technological advancement. He tries to work hard and by the acceptable norms of the society, but his happiness is diminished as his soul and his inner self suffocate by the cruel demands from the management of the factory he works at. His dedication to accomplish his work requirements creates not only a problem for his co-workers and his superiors when slowing down the factory production, but also creates a nervous break for himself that only makes him physically and mentally weak and vulnerable when he foolishly plays around and annoys others by spraying them with machine oil. Throughout the movie Chaplin shows to us the dysfunctions of the new technology and he sadly transforms the difficult moments in his work career into comic laughter for the audiences. The situations he develops in front of our eyes make us question the advantages much argued and discussed to us about the positive influence of the new machinery. Back then human persona suffer to adjust to the new world which created obstacles and frustrations with the technology. The humanity was challenged by the new and changing future of the technological expansion. The movie shows us different unexpected scenes and aspects that the working class was dealing with at the times of scientific adaptation. Was it worth it or not for the human race to pass through the discomfort and discontent that the future had in store? Deeper insights are needed when conducting a formal or informal research on the case. Chaplin acts astonishingly in order to maintain his view for the present and future evolution concerning the human attempts to improve and benefit the society; and the movie brings us to our senses in observing the reality of the advantages and disadvantages in the new worldly- and quickly- changing technology."

It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.\n\nModern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most.\n\nOverall, wonderful, another one of Chaplin's best."

        "review_title": "A satirical take on struggle during unemployment era couldn't get more hilarious and genius than this.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times (1936) : Brief Review -\n\nA satirical take on struggle during unemployment era couldn't get more hilarious and genius than this. Modern Times, often cited as Chaplin's best satirical work ever is definitely underrated as a comedy. I don't see many people talking about how hilarious and funny it is and all the way intelligently, not mad comedy. In my opinion, this is Chaplin's most intelligently choreographed comedy ever. Many comic situations and funny sequences in this film feels impossible and unbelievable, just like we saw in Buster Keaton's adventurous comedies. The question that how did Charles Chaplin managed to perform all the scenes so perfectly without any fumbles is still eating my head. That first scene when he's working in the factory then the Robbery scene and so many and at last the Waiter's scene in the hotel all are simply stupendous. Modern Times lacks the emotional touch and impulsive Nature, may be because it was set on serious issues like industrialization and commercialization, however, the Satire is perfectly built by Chaplin. The film tells a story of a tramp who struggles to live in modern industrial society with the help of a young homeless woman while both of them are in search of employment. As always, Chaplin gives an inspiring message from the film and this time it is, \"Never give up, we'll get along\". Modern Times came very late for a silent film as Talkies had became popular by 1936. The same film in silent era i.e before 30s would have had bigger legacy left. Nevertheless, Modern Times is still a Classic and a timeless entertainer for all ages. The similar concept was presented by Chaplin later in 'Monsieur Verdoux' which was hardly a comedy, so naturally this one more enjoyable.\n\nRATING - 8/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest."

        "review_title": "Humorous tale of life during the great depression",
        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" was released on February 25, 1936. This film would be Chaplin's last silent film. Charlie Chaplin reprises his role as the Tramp in this film set during the Great Depression. Chaplin continues his mastery of silent theatric humor in this film, whose storyline many people would have a hard time finding humor in. This film is fittingly produced in black and white. Modern Times is based in the midst of the Great Depression. The main theme of the film is to make the viewer aware of the conditions of the Depression and how they affected most people. This film raises our awareness of issues such as poor work conditions, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and the harsh reality of broken families during this time in history. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp who recently becomes unemployed after having a nervous breakdown, as a result of being worked too hard. The Tramp struggles to find and keep a job in these tough times. Discouraged, he resorts to trying to get thrown in jail so he has a place to sleep and food to eat. During his attempts to go back to jail, the Tramp meets the Garmin, played by Paulette Goddard. The Garmin is a young runaway orphan who recently lost her family, as a result of her father being shot in the street. The Garmin and the Tramp are now homeless, hungry and poor. They come find hope in each other and find a new determination to survive together and beat the odds. This film follows their struggle to overcome the odds, earn an honest living, keep nourished and maintain hope throughout all of the obstacles they encounter. Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, composed and produced this film. Chaplin's masterful use of sound draws the viewer into the scene. In this film, sound is vital in establishing mood and atmosphere of scenes. One defining scene in the film that is a perfect example is a scene where the Garmin loses her father. The Garmin and her sisters are on the dock collecting wood (happy, joyous music is heard), next a gunshot is heard and the music becomes frantic. The Garmin sends her sisters off and she rushes to see what happened. She arrives at her father lying in the street and takes him in her hands as the music turns sad and she mourns her father's death while holding him in her hands. Chaplin also uses masterful body language to portray the emotion and tempo of the film. This is a vital component to this film, like so many other silent films. One good example of this is when the Garmin and Tramp are sitting on the side of the road. The Garmin suddenly comes to tears and dramatically places her head in her arm to cry on. The Tramp and the audience are fully aware of her mood at that moment. This films overall theme is similar to that of Cinderella Man. Even though these films were produced about 70 years apart, they share a theme. Regardless of the circumstances you are dealt, you should never give up. While Cinderella Man is based on a true story of the Great Depression period, Modern Times is based on Charlie Chaplin's unique portrayal of the period. I would strongly recommend viewing this movie to gain a better understanding of this period in American History."

        "review_detailed_main": "As I love Charlie Chaplin, I desperately wanted to see this film, and I am glad I did. It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.\n\nModern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most."

        "review_title": "These are but a few delightful features of the Billows Feeding Machine\u0085Modern Times",
        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is a wonderful little film. It is in effect a series of shorts strung together and connected by the two leads, Chaplin's tramp and Paulette Goddard's gamin. The tale is about how the machine age has taken over industry, throwing men on the streets with no jobs or money to keep their families afloat. In a brilliant stroke of ingenuity, Chaplin decides to scrap the idea of making this a \"talkie\" and allows only machines to have a voice. For instance, if the boss needs to bark orders, he does so through a TV screen and if Mr. Billows needs to explain how his feeding machine works, he plays a record containing his full speech. The sound effects are great and the visuals stunning, especially while at the factory. What its essentially a silent film at its core, Modern Times is so much more. A commentary on technology and the dream of making a home for the ones you love, it is also a very sharp comedy that will have you laughing throughout with its physical gags.\n\nDuring the course of his travels, Chaplin's tramp gets mixed up in some impressive set-piece jokes. From the assembly line shenanigans, to the giant gear trappings, to the feeding machine, inadvertently leading a Communist march, a couple stints in jail, a department store disaster, a dilapidated house, and the struggles of waiting tables, he always finds a way to get out of trouble. With all these things happening, the film can appear a tad disjointed, but as his character continues to evolve and the title-cards give us elapsed time, it still holds together as a complete story. A king of physical laughs, Chaplin never holds back either. His nervous breakdown at the plant shows his dedication to the comedy by being unable to shake the arm motion of his job even when he is outdoors and, of course, the rollerskating stunt later on is impressive. I'd be interested to see how that was shot, either composed post-filming to add the drop, or if he really was that close to the edge.\n\nYou can't deny the man's gift as an artist. How each vignette plays out is inventive and humorous on its journey. Even the moments with the beautiful Goddard are funny in their own right. Her manic facial expressions and piratelike mannerisms while stealing bananas on the docks during her introduction bring some good laughs. Her character is used pretty much as a straightman to Chaplin's lunatic, but she plays the part well. The dream sequence of the two living in a nice house with fruit hanging at every window is priceless and the final scene at the restaurant is a riot. With her trying to help him out in getting a steady job and him mucking it all up to end up needing to sing in gibberish, it is the best part of the movie.\n\nWhile I feel people of all ages can appreciate the film on its own merits\u0097the comedy is broad and kids will enjoy the stunts and bodily harm stuff\u0097it does contain some adult situations. Besides the Communist march mentioned previously, there is a short scene with Chaplin drunk along with a more lengthy part with him after imbibing some \"nose powder.\" It is never actually labeled as being drugs and the scene could be effective still without knowing what the powder is, so one should not use it as the sole reason to not show it to children. Modern Times is a classic on many levels and has proved so by standing the test of time for seventy years thus far."

        "review_title": "The Tramp goes out with a bang...",
        "review_detailed_main": "The arrival of sound to films in 1927 (in the movie \"The Jazz Singer\") was definitely a major turning point in history of cinema, and one that would have enormous consequences in the motion picture industry of those years. Only 2 years after \"The Jazz Singer\" was released, sound films (\"talkies\") became the dominant format in cinema, and slowly the silent era reached its end and with it the careers of those who couldn't make the transition. Of course, sound faced harsh opposition from many prominent artists of silent movies like directors Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin, who felt that sound diminished the art of cinema instead of elevating it. Soon, both directors would find themselves forced to get with the times and make the transition, but Chaplin wouldn't quit without a last laugh. 1936's silent movie \"Modern Times\" would be Chaplin's sweet farewell to his beloved silent era, and with it, to his most famous character: the Tramp.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is the story of a factory worker (Chaplin as the Tramp), who works at an assembly line in an enormous industrial facility. The constant overworking begins to take its toll in him and suffers a mental breakdown that sends him to the hospital. After his recovery, he discovers that he is no longer an employee, as the workers are on a strike, and are now marching towards the factory. By a weird series of circumstances, the Tramp is arrested after being confused with a Communist leader, and sent to jail where he spends literally the best time of his life. After being released for good behavior, he finds himself again jobless and on a very difficult condition, so he plans to return to jail as soon as possible; however, his plans will change after he meets an orphan girl gamine (Paulette Goddard), who is living in a harshest condition than his.\n\nAs usual, \"Modern Times\" was not only a movie directed by Chaplin, but also written and produced by himself; and once again he returns to his familiar mix of drama and comedy that he had been perfect over the years with monumental classics like \"The Gold Rush\" and \"City Lights\". This time however, Chaplin takes a more politically charged approach and fills his comedy with his ideas about the harsh life of factory workers, dehumanization, and the Great Depression. While this often unsubtle use of comedy as an outlet for his ideologies could had been damaging for the story in other writer's hands, Chaplin creates a joyfully optimist and very humanist plot that helps to make easier to enjoy and understand the overtly political tone of the film. The story is written in an episodic form, but it flows with nicely thanks to its nonstop series of excellent gags that keep the fun coming.\n\nVisually, the movie is probably Chaplin's greatest artistic achievement, as he extends the themes of his screenplay to the overall look of the film. With a clever use of montage (obviously inspired by Soviet filmmakers) and several nods to German expressionism, Chaplin brings to life his vision of society slowly transforming into a industrialized monster where there is hardly any place for love and happiness. The excellent art direction by Charles D. Hall and J. Russell Spencer is an essential piece for this and it's definitely a highlight of the film, as it truly makes \"Modern Times\" feel \"modern\". While for the most part Chaplin manages to keep a good balance between the drama and the comedy of the film, he can't help but fall on excessive sentimentalism, making the film feel a bit too preachy at times.\n\nThe main cast, as in every Chaplin movie, is remarkable in their performances, and each one of them truly add a lot of their personalities to their roles. As his most famous character, the Tramp, Chaplin here is pure gold and as always, he fills the screen with his charming presence and enormous comedic talent. His body control shines in several scenes of slapstick comedy that are nowadays classics, and he also shows off his total domain of pantomime as he easily transmits the audience that joyful optimism that has become the Tramp's trademark. As the Tramp's counterpart, Paulette Goddard is simply beautiful, displaying a natural charm and freshness that makes her character the Tramp's best sidekick since Jackie Coogan in \"The Kid\".\n\nWhile this movie was supposed to be Chaplin's first \"talkie\", he quickly dismissed the idea as he considered that his Tramp character worked better without speaking; so with this in mind the legendary comedian decided to transform \"Modern Times\" into a hybrid: a \"talkie\" in the silent era style, where every sound in the film is audible except the human voice. In fact, the only spoken voices that become audible are the ones that come out of machines (radio for example), keeping in touch with the script's themes of humanity trapped by the modern industrial nightmare. This could also be seen as Chaplin making fun of \"talkies\", as while technically he shot a movie with sound, he faithfully followed classic conventions of the silent era like title cards and specially, the pantomime style of acting.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is without a doubt one of Chaplin's best films, and one of the most interesting comedies of all time. While it kind of lacks that naivet\u00e9 that made \"The Gold Rush\" such an amazing experience, it offers a new and more sophisticated style of comedy. As the last movie of the silent era and the Tramp's final on-screen apparition, \"Modern Times\" is a timeless classic that even today helps us to remind that despite the advent of the modernization, there's still place for happiness, as in the Tramp's words, \"Buck up - never say die, We'll get along.\" 9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "There are some good analyses of this classic film, so I'll just take on my observations after watching it for the first time here in 2001, 65 years after it was made. I have been rediscovering the classic movies of the past, esp the comedies such as the Marx Bros. This is the first Chaplin I have seen outside of a few short pieces when I was a kid.\n\nWhat struck me is how applicable this movie is to the society of our times. I guess this transcendancy over time period is a sign of any good art. As I watched \"Modern Times\" I couldn't help but think that living in 2001 seems to actual be old-fashioned if you reflect on the dittohead pundits that rule the airwaves, mega-corporate owned & controlled media, politicians that fire up the masses over religion, Iraqi radar, and the usual sanctimonious hypocrisy to make them forget about how they work harder & longer for less, or other important problems.\n\nHeck, insinuating healthcare for the masses in our modern times gets one labeled a \"commie pinko\" by Rush Limbaugh et al. So can you imagine the reaction in modern times of a group of workers peacefully walking down the street with a guy waving a red flag? They'd have the riot cops out spraying Mace & pepper gas before you can hum a few bars from \"Smile.\" Can you imagine a film with leftist, socialist sympathies being released in these modern times? In makes you wonder which times seem more modern from a human perspective, the 1936 of this film or the 2001 of corporate America?"

        "review_detailed_main": "MODERN TIMES (United Artists, 1936), was written, produced, scored, directed, and stars Charlie Chaplin in what was to become his final role as the Little Tramp. It also marked the close to the silent screen era. In fact, MODERN TIMES, though not essentially a silent film in a sense, but more like some made between 1927-29 equipped with underscoring, sound effects and talking sequences. While silent movies officially ended by 1929, Chaplin kept that genre going with CITY LIGHTS (1931) and MODERN TIMES, demonstrating that silents is still golden. Chaplin, having come a long way from London music halls to American silent comedies dating back to 1914, not only developed his character but established the greatness in his work. Reportedly in production for two years, possibly more, Chaplin's ability to perfect comedy routines into a simple story like MODERN TIMES is amazing. Supporting Chaplin is Paulette Goddard, an movie extra since 1929, now awarded the opportunity in a major role opposite the comedy legend. Unlike Chaplin's other leading ladies of the past, Goddard is reportedly the only one to become successful, especially during the 1940s following her second pairing in Chaplin's first talkie as THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940).\n\nThe opening credits super imposed in front of a clock, indicates time as now, while its opening title that reads, \"Modern Times is a story of industry - of individual enterprise - of humanity crusading in pursuit of happiness\" indicates something else, a satire of the machine age, past, present and future, while in fact being one story with two related themes. The first revolves around two people of different backgrounds facing uncertainties with their present lives while the second half turns into a love story between these two same people who have fallen through hard times of the Depression. Before their devotion to one another occurs, their introduction begins with Charlie (Charlie Chaplin), a factory worker of the Electro Steel Corporation where he tightens bolts on moving belts. Unable to adjust to the advanced technology as a tester to a a new type of feeding machine, he acquires a nervous breakdown that has him committed to an asylum for a rest cure. Next introduction is on the Gamin (Paulette Goddard), a waterfront girl whose unemployed father (Stanley Blystone) is killed in a riot, leaving her two younger sisters to be sent to an orphanage while, after escaping from the juvenile officers, struggles to survive in the outside world. Caught stealing a loaf of bread by the law, Charlie, who has since been released from the hospital and struggling himself to find work, comes to her defense admitting he stole it. The lady and the tramp meet again in the patrol wagon that soon breaks down in an accident, leaving these two strangers to make their escape together into the world of uncertainty. Their uncertainty finally turns to hope when a cabaret owner (Henry Bergman) hires the girl to work as a dancer while Charlie is employed as a singing waiter. All's well until the juvenile division track down the girl to have her arrested.\n\nFor one of Chaplin's most admired films, there's no spoken dialog, at least from Chaplin's standpoint. Talking sequences comes from the factory president (Allan Garcia), who, at one point, yells at Charlie to \"get back to work.\" Other sounds include a radio announcer's voice, police sirens, a barking dog and stomach churning. Chaplin, who preferred to keep his tramp character silent, did offer audiences the opportunity to hear his voice for the first time, in song, for the cabaret sequence, doing some double-talk rendition to \"Titina.\"  \n\nWhile MODERN TIMES has become relatively known throughout the years, it was rarely revived until Chaplin's reissued it some time prior to his death in 1977. Having attended the 1980 theatrical revival of MODERN TIMES at the Regency Theater in New York City where it played to a full house, I witnessed patrons, young and old alike, laughing hysterically and watching with amazement at many key scenes being the feeding machine sequence; Charlie roller skating around the department store blindfolded; and his method of feeding lunch to his employer (Chester Conklin) while stuck inside the machine's safety wheels. Considering MODERN TIMES to be not quite so modern by today's standards, it demonstrates how comedy never grows out of style.\n\nAcquiring less pathos than CITY LIGHTS, MODERN TIMES is most memorable in the way it bids goodbye to Chaplin's world of silent movie making through its underscoring to the sentimental \"Smile (Though Your Heart is Breaking\"). MODERN TIMES, along with other Chaplin features and short subjects, were distributed on CBS Home Video in 1989 to commemorate Chaplin's centennial year of his birth. Though frequent revivals on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (1989), American Movie Classics (1991-2001), and Turner Classic Movies (as part of \"The Essentials\") assures how this and many other Chaplin films are to remain in view as long as there are those around to appreciate his art and style the way he originally intended it to be, through laughter and a little tear, especially during these modern times.

Expressions and gestures are key here, and all of them are executed perfectly by the crew and cast.\n\nThe visuals that are given will not be as grand as the film now, but the basic techniques of cinematography starting from the angle until the transition just flows to the point that we are unaware that this is a silent film.\n\nThe interesting premise is conveyed accompanied by scoring music that gives the audience's tension up and down. It's no wonder why Charlie Chaplin has become an idol."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin is one of the acknowledged kings of comedy from any era. He excelled during the silent film period, when dialogue was merely an attachment to the action that was going on in film. Although this is a sound film and has dialogue, the dialogue is still just an attachment to each scene. It is Charlie Chaplin performing as if he is in another silent film that is so hilarious. Scene after scene, he displays his comic genius. With one sight gag after another.\n\nBut in addition to the sight gag, Chaplin had the talent to build up a scene until it reached a crescendo of hilarity. He did not just do one or two funny things in a scene; he did several funny things all through the scenes. You must see it."

        "review_detailed_main": "For uncertain reasons I find the silent film comedies of Charlie Chaplin entertaining even though the silent film era is nearly a hundred years over. As the old saying goes \"talk is overrated while action is everything\". The orchestral music somehow blends with the action. \"Modern Times\" was his last silent film as by then the \"Talkies\" had taken over. I am introduced to the word gamin describing the character of actress Paulette Goddard. However, a female is a gamine while a male is a gamin. The term refers to the mischievous street girl. The film dares to discuss cocaine use in jail but camouflages the word as \"smuggled nose powder\" (at least it passed The National Board of Review). I suppose one needed to be careful about using censored language back in the day. The film's implausible situations at quadruple speed are best described as outlandishly manic. It is the era's version of an action film. Hopeful ending. In any case, it was distracting fun during The Great Depression."

        "review_title": "A Timeless Satire on the Modern Industrial Society",
        "review_detailed_main": "The film follows the misadventures of a nameless factory worker, played by Charlie Chaplin himself, who becomes a cog in the soul-crushing machinery of a modern industrialized society. Through a series of comedic and absurd situations, Chaplin's character navigates the challenges of factory work, unemployment, poverty, and the pursuit of love and happiness.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths is Chaplin's masterful physical comedy and his ability to convey deep emotions without uttering a single word. His iconic character, known as The Tramp, embodies resilience, hope, and a sense of childlike innocence in the face of a harsh and unforgiving world. His interactions with other characters and the inventive gags throughout the film evoke both laughter and empathy.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is not merely a comedy, but also a biting social commentary on the dehumanization and alienation brought about by modern industrialization. Chaplin skillfully exposes the absurdity of assembly-line work, the relentless pursuit of efficiency, and the disregard for human well-being in the pursuit of profit. The film's themes remain relevant even in contemporary society, making it a thought-provoking piece of cinema.\n\nVisually, \"Modern Times\" is a marvel of filmmaking. Despite being a silent film released well into the era of sound cinema, Chaplin uses clever visual storytelling techniques to convey his message effectively. The film's cinematography, set design, and inventive use of props enhance the comedic timing and create memorable and iconic scenes.\n\nThe film is also notable for its musical score, composed by Chaplin himself. The playful and melodic tunes perfectly complement the on-screen action, heightening the comedic moments and adding emotional depth to the more poignant scenes.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is a timeless masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences today. Through its brilliant physical comedy, social commentary, and heartfelt storytelling, it remains a powerful satire on the dehumanizing effects of modern industrial society. Charlie Chaplin's iconic performance and his ability to blend laughter with social critique make this film both entertaining and thought-provoking. \"Modern Times\" is a must-watch for cinema lovers and a testament to Chaplin's genius as a filmmaker and performer."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the second time that I've watched this semi-silent classic. The first was for a film class. I picked up a copy on DVD after that. It was one that I knew I've eventually check out again with a critical eye. I finally did as it is on the Internet Database Movie Poster that Jaime and I are working through. I jumped on watching this when she begrudgingly agreed since I kept making jokes about how we could watch it.\n\nWe start this off with a factory worker, Charles Chaplin, as he creates issues. This gets to the point where a protest breaks out and the factory is closed. It leaves him out of work. Chaplin gets arrested when a brick is accidently thrown at a cop. He goes back a few other times, including when he ends up marching with a group of communists. He is released when he thwarts a prison breakout while on cocaine.\n\nThere is another story that joins up with his where a gamin, Paulette Goddard, is left an orphan. Her mother is deceased and her father is killed by accident. Her siblings are taken in by the state, but she flees. When she meets Chaplin, the two of them decide to start a life together. Things aren't easy though and everyone is out to stop them.\n\nNow I'm sure when I watched this in class, I was taught about the social commentary. This came out and is set during the Great Depression. Work is hard to come by and the capitalist people who run the factory as well as other businesses are just looking for mindless workers. Chaplin's character doesn't fit. He is bumbling which cause stoppages and damages machinery. There is a great scene where he gets sucked into one of them and we see that him, as well as the other workers, are just a cog in the greater economy.\n\nThis movie makes this message easy to take with the slapstick comedy that Chaplin is known for. Jaime wasn't impressed, but I laughed quite a few times. He is just a master of what he does. From his look in the oversized clothes that he wears and make him look like a tramp. To his innocent smile and his distinct mustache. We even get to hear him sing at the climax of this movie as well. To compliment him, there is Goddard who is cute. They're doing what they can to make it, but the world isn't helping.\n\nAll that is left to say is that this is well-made. There is a scene in the department store that gives me anxiety. The cinematography is fine. The settings and effects are basic, but they are effective for what they need. Other than that, I'd say that the soundtrack fit for what was needed. What is amazing is that the commentary is still relevant today. I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you like older films like this. I would say give this a watch as it is a classic.\n\nMy Rating: 8.5 out of 10."

        "review_title": "An essential, timeless classic - both funny and heartfelt, and all too enduringly relevant",
        "review_detailed_main": "There's not possibly any missing that this picture pointedly zeroes in on the hustle and bustle and inhumanity of modern life; the general oppressiveness of industry and employers, and the specific oppression and dehumanization of workers and the common man; and not so fictional sci-fi dystopian notions and visuals - giant machines looming over the small people that are ground between them, state violence, social unrest, life on the streets in a fast-paced society that leaves the common folk behind, and more. It frankly would have taken startlingly little modification for this to have been fashioned into not just an unremittingly dour drama but even a discrete horror film (and truthfully, I wouldn't mind seeing some enterprising filmmaker do just that). Yet it really says so much about the genius of Charlie Chaplin that he's able to take these ideas and fashion them into a feature of such boisterous, irreverent energy that it has been hailed time and again not just as an enduring classic, but as one of the best comedies ever made. Seizing creative control as producer, writer, director, star, composer, and co-editor, there's no mistaking that this is Chaplin's baby. Personally I'm inclined to think some of his other works leave a bigger impression, yet to whatever extent there's any difference from one to the next, it surely has more to do with the supreme quality of those other works more than any specific failing on the part of 'Modern times.' One way or another this is superb, and something that everyone needs to see at least once!\n\nRest assured that the same traits that defined the reverie of 'The circus,' 'The Gold Rush,' or 'The kid' are here in abundance here, too. We're treated to a cavalcade of gags and physical comedy amidst plentiful situational humor, not to mention exaggerated acting of which Chaplin's highly animated Tramp is the keystone. This is most certainly a joy - and at the same time, it's depressing yet heartfelt as it addresses major social issues. There is earnest, important storytelling here, with substantial, critical themes, that ninety years on remain infuriatingly, despairingly relevant, not least the enforcement and maintenance of harmful social, political, and economic systems at all costs rather than for one moment take any steps toward helping the needy, uplifting the marginalized, or righting the wrongs and inequalities of the world. And despite all that, Chaplin is invigorating and earns some definite laughs; despite all that, Paulette Goddard is unfailingly charming and sympathetic, giving such a tremendous performance that she threatens to outshine the man himself even as she has less time on-screen. The movie runs the gamut from riotous, to heartwarming, to dreary and dispiriting, and back again, and all the while the conglomeration is so expertly crafted that it never feels imbalanced, or too heavy-handed, or too light. The great success of 'Modern times' lies not in utmost hilarity, but in the absolute sincerity and heart that it boasts at all times, lightened at the exact right times and in the exact right ways by the exact right type and amount of good-natured silliness. And that, I think, might make this more brilliant that would be the case were it an outright frivolous romp.\n\nThrough every mood and complex thought herein the flick is fabulously well made in every way from start to finish. The sets are huge, detailed, and highly impressive; every stunt and effect is ingenious and impeccable. The choice to stitch together select sound effects, dialogue, and music with the use of intertitles and a predominant silent presentation is marvelously endearing and speaks to the lasting value of cinema before the advent of talkies. Ira H. Morgan and Roland Totheroh's cinematography is stupendous, with some moments being especially smart, and likewise the editing of Chaplin and Willard Nico; Chaplin's score is sharp and lively in contributing to the vitality of the viewing experience. The narrative is absorbing, compelling, satisfying, and rewarding, with relatable and sympathetic characters, and the scene writing is exceptional in laying the groundwork for one rich, spellbinding beat after another, whether it's one of high-flying spirits or wholehearted, impactful drama. To that same end, Chaplin's direction is pretty much nothing less than extraordinary, illustrating a dexterity and mindfulness that allows every inclusion to achieve the maximum intended effect. As if to illustrate the point of all this lofty praise: for all the ups and downs of the picture in the preceding length, in the very last moments 'Modern times' swerves into a single scene of such momentous, soulful vibrancy - at once countermanding the comedy and drama, yet also flowing directly from it - that it becomes inescapably emotional, concluding the affair with an ending so perfect that I wonder if it doesn't even outshine that of 'City lights.'\n\nI can understand how older films don't appeal to all viewers, and how some folks may have a hard time engaging with such fare. I would have said the same of myself at one time. Some features exist outside such concerns of personal preference, however, be it because of how funny they are, how lasting and meaningful the story is, possibly just because they are so roundly well made, or even because they have earned a reputation over time. This is an example where all these statements are true. In every capacity, this film released in 1936 genuinely demands viewership, and that remains so no matter who you are. Without going into even more extensive detail about every tiny odd and end, what more is there to say? While I do still think some of Chaplin's other flicks hold more favor in my eyes, with the level on which the man operated, the distinction is meaningless. You need to make time for 'Modern times,' and that's all there is to it."

        "review_title": "\"Timeless Brilliance and Social Satire: Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" (1936) Captures the Heart of an Era\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Modern Times,\" a cinematic masterpiece directed by the incomparable Charlie Chaplin in 1936, stands as a testament to the enduring genius of the silent era and the art of storytelling through physical comedy. With a runtime of just over an hour and a half, Chaplin ingeniously weaves a tale of hilarity, social commentary, and poignant emotion, making this film an everlasting gem in the annals of cinematic history.\n\nAt its core, \"Modern Times\" is a satirical commentary on the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and modernization during the Great Depression era. The film paints a vivid picture of the struggles faced by the working class, as they grapple with assembly lines, mechanization, and the overwhelming pace of modern life. Through the iconic figure of the Tramp, Chaplin captures the heart of the everyman, embodying the resilience and optimism that persist even in the face of adversity.\n\nChaplin's unmatched ability to convey emotions without words shines through in every scene. His physical comedy transcends language barriers, evoking laughter that is universal and timeless. One of the film's most memorable sequences involves the Tramp's encounter with a malfunctioning feeding machine, perfectly encapsulating the absurdity of mindless mechanization. The slapstick humor in this scene is not only side-splitting but also serves as a scathing critique of a society that prioritizes efficiency over human well-being.\n\nAmidst the laughter, \"Modern Times\" delivers moments of profound reflection. The Tramp's relationship with the Gamin, portrayed beautifully by Paulette Goddard, adds a touch of poignancy to the narrative. Their tender connection amidst a chaotic world brings a sense of hope and compassion to the film. The poignant scene of the two walking hand in hand into the sunrise is a powerful reminder of the simple joys that can be found amidst life's trials.\n\nChaplin's directorial finesse is also evident in his attention to detail. The film's visual gags are executed with impeccable timing, showcasing Chaplin's mastery of physical comedy. The factory scenes, with their synchronized chaos, are a choreographic marvel that highlight the absurdity of the modern work environment. Additionally, the use of sound, though sparingly employed due to the film's status as a \"talkie,\" is done purposefully and enhances the comedic effect rather than overpowering the narrative.\n\nThe film's soundtrack, composed by Chaplin himself, deserves special mention. The hauntingly beautiful melody of \"Smile,\" which has since become an iconic song, underscores the film's overarching themes of resilience and hope. The song's emotional resonance lingers long after the credits roll, a testament to Chaplin's multifaceted talents as a performer, director, and composer.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is a triumphant symphony of humor, satire, and heart. Chaplin's portrayal of societal issues remains strikingly relevant even in the present day, as we continue to grapple with the effects of technological advancement and its impact on human connection. The film's ability to seamlessly blend uproarious comedy with thought-provoking social commentary cements its status as a timeless classic.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Modern Times\" stands as a crowning achievement in Charlie Chaplin's illustrious career. With its brilliant physical comedy, heartfelt performances, and incisive critique of modern society, the film continues to captivate audiences, inviting them to both laugh and reflect on the enduring human spirit. As we celebrate the marvel that is \"Modern Times,\" we honor not only the genius of Chaplin but also the enduring power of cinema to transcend time and touch the very essence of what it means to be human."

        "review_detailed_main": "Modern Times (1936), filmed between 1932 and 1936, it was directed, written, and produced by Charlie Chaplin. This was Chaplin's first film after his successful City Lights (1931). This film is Charlie Chaplin's protest against what is lost from silent films through the sound industry revolutionizing the film industry. There is no traditional voice dialogue in the film - but voices and sounds do originate from machines (e.g., the feeding machine), television screens (i.e., the authoritarian on the screen in the lavatory), and Chaplin's actual voice is heard singing as well as special sound effects are used. Set during the Great Depression, the movie's main concern reflected the millions of Americans in the era - joblessness, destitution, and famine. It had a number of marvelous and memorable scenes that showed the frustrating relationship between man and machine in the Industrial Age and social institutions. The scenes of the Chaplin's character Tramp is alternated between scenes as a factory worker, a shipyard worker, a night watchman, a singing waiter, or a criminal put in jail. The Tramp also deals with various authority figures during his abuses: a 'Big Brother' factory boss, a minister, juvenile authorities, a sheriff, a shipyard foreman, a store manager, etc. Under the overlaid credits, a clock face approaches 6 o'clock. The preface explains the film's topic: \"'Modern Times.' A relationship between industry, and individual enterprise - humanity exploring a median between efficiency and happiness.\" The film starts with an overhead shot of a flock of sheep crowding their enclosure, and rushed through a shaft. Instantly, sheep dissolve into a related overhead shot of industrial workers pushing out of a subway station on their way to work in a factory during their commute. Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin is a milestone film, showing numerous changes in Chaplin's film making. It is also one of Chaplin's most famous films. It contains quite a few first attempts by Charlie Chaplin. It is Chaplin's movie used to make a social remark. It introduced Paulette Goddard, his partner both on & off screen. It is his first true talking film; in keeping with the movie's topic of the dehumanization of society, all of the voices in the film came from non-living sources (radios, a phonograph record, etc.)"

There are a lot of films out there that are funnier, but to see Charlie Chaplin indulging in some Charlie put me into hysterics and, erm, opened my eyes to the time. Good stuff all round."

        "review_detailed_main": "Charlie Chaplin's last semi-silent picture, and his final appearance as the little tramp. It's also a not-so-subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets. Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain. The film gets bonus points for throwing its star into so many unique, visually spectacular situations, including what's probably his signature scene inside the belly of a giant, mechanical assembly line."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a Chaplin classic; it is funny, touching and has all the hallmarks of Chaplin at his best. However, the film is a hybrid film that is a semi-talkie and a semi-silent film. Chaplin wasn't yet comfortable working entirely in sound but apparently the studio was unwilling to allow him to make a pure silent film ala City Lights. On a technical level the film struggles trying to be of this hybrid form. I wish either the studio or Chaplin got their way entirely on this point. This is a minor quibble.\n\nA more pressing problem is the film is a pastiche of the then current social issues of the mid 1930's. The Great Depression, labor unions, police repression of labor strikes, moral panic over communism etc. Etc. All get used as background material. The film's design sensibility is vaguely reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis. This sociopolitical material is not the focus of the film-the storyline is a set of The Tramp's misadventures-but too much of it is included to be mere color. One can feel Chaplin aiming to be more overtly political but is unsure of exactly he is trying to say here. It is distracting from the charms and laughs of the film.\n\nThis is a work of a gifted artist but one that was always suffering midlife growing pains."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Modern Times\": A Timeless Classic of Satire and Humanism\n\nCharlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" (1936) is a timeless classic that brilliantly satirizes industrial society while also showcasing his unique humanism. Despite being a silent film released long after the advent of sound, \"Modern Times\" remains one of Chaplin's most beloved and enduring works.\n\nThe film follows the exploits of Chaplin's iconic character, the Tramp, as he struggles to survive in a rapidly changing world dominated by machines and capitalism. Through a series of hilarious and often poignant set-pieces, Chaplin skewers everything from factory work to police brutality to the dehumanizing effects of mass production.\n\nDespite the film's overtly political themes, Chaplin's humanism shines through in every frame. His character's kindness, resilience, and determination in the face of adversity inspire empathy and admiration, making the Tramp an enduring symbol of hope and resilience.\n\n\"Modern Times\" is a masterful blend of satire and pathos, seamlessly blending Chaplin's trademark physical comedy with deeper themes of social injustice and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world. Its influence can be seen in everything from the films of Jacques Tati to the television show \"Mr. Robot.\"\n\nOverall, \"Modern Times\" is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Chaplin's unique blend of satire and humanism, combined with his mastery of physical comedy, make this film a must-see for any lover of cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's 1930s America. The unemployment rate is sky high, the strikes are constant, and the unions and police force are in an undeclared state of war. Adrift in the chaos, the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) wanders in and out of jail, from one short-lived job to another, at the mercy of his nerves and his penchant for explosive accidents. During one of his many run-ins with the cops, he meets up with the gamin (Paulette Goddard) a poor but feisty patron of the streets. In love, in abject poverty, with nothing to hold onto but each other, they struggle to carve out a life for themselves, in spite of the odds and the brutal demands of a slapstick comedy.\n\nUnlike City Lights, my favorite Chaplin film, the screwball moments in Modern Times began to feel extraneous, and had me glancing at my watch, waiting to get back to the meat of the story. I've always loved Chaplin, but loved him for his skill as a director and actor, for his uncanny ability to make beautiful women look natural and unadorned, and for his knack at presenting poignant satire without ever sounding preachy, and not because I find him especially funny. The childish romp through the department sore is whimsical, heartwarming, and more than a little forlorn, but less can be said of the Tramp's accident-prone attempts to aid the master mechanic, which, like many sequences in the movie, feels overdrawn, and a little superficial compared to the weightier material it supplants.\n\nSometimes I found myself wondering if the film could benefit from a hack job or two, yet it was never irksome enough to get between the movie and its reputation, for indeed, Modern Times is every bit of the classic it's purported to be. Chaplin was a man of great endings, and the ending of Modern Times \u0096 first its triumph, then its tragedy \u0096 leaves little to be desired. Also great are the opening scenes at the factory, which feel just as creepy today as they must have felt in 1936."

        "review_detailed_main": "1936's Modern Times finds Charlie Chaplin's iconic Tramp character at work in a modern, mechanized factory. He struggles to keep up with the ever quickening pace of the production line where he screws nuts onto bolts and suffers a mental breakdown. After being released from hospital, The Tramp finds himself as the accidental leader of a Communist rally and is thrown in jail. Once released he finds life in the Depression ruined 30s difficult but meets an orphan girl with whom he develops a friendship. The film then follows their ups and downs as they try to scrape by and stay out of jail.\n\nModern Times is one of Chaplin's best remembered films and features some wonderful set pieces. Just some of the iconic scenes include; when he gets caught up in the cogs of the factory machines, when he mistakes cocaine for salt, when he roller skates blindfolded and when he is used to test a new feeding machine. All of these scenes are laugh out loud funny. While the film features some of Chaplin's funniest moments, the laughs are spread more thinly than in some of his earlier films. This is much more of a comedy/drama than out and out comedy.\n\nChaplin's politics are obvious to see throughout. The opening scene shows sheep being lead out and then cuts to men streaming into a factory. Once inside, the workers are worked to exhaustion and we see the harsh conditions of the unemployed. Chaplin is later falsely accused of leading a Communist march and gets thrown in jail, an eerie premonition of what later happened to him. It is obvious that Chaplin blames modern industrialization for the conditions of the Great Depression and understandable why it came under scrutiny at the time.\n\nChaplin is joined on screen by the beautiful Paulette Godard, who was also his wife at the time. Despite playing a homeless orphan she still manages to dazzle and is also superb in the more touching scenes. Chaplin as always is sublime. There are little touches in every scene that cement him as cinema's greatest entertainer.\n\nThe film is still considered 'silent', despite it containing 'talkie' moments. Most of these moments come from inanimate objects or from one or two characters but I wish it had been one way or the other. It's a bit of a cop out to be a mixture of silent and spoken but by 1936 silent films were considered very old fashioned so its understandable why the decision to introduce some dialogue was made.\n\nUnfortunately, Modern Times was one of Chaplin's final films and the last to feature his Tramp character. For that reason its ending carries even greater significance and is wonderful. The film contains some of Chaplin's best moments and is a wonderful reminder of his genius and the class of his film making.\n\nwww.attheback.blogspot.com"

It's a simple film, but touches on the theme of technology gone wild and foreshadows Orwell's \"Big Brother\" (\"1984\" came a decade after this film). As with his other films, it is episodic and uneven, but it mostly hits the mark. Highlights include Charlie's antics on the assembly line and his stint as a singing waiter, but the most hilarious scene has Charlie testing out an automatic feeding machine that goes out of control. Goddard is lovely as the gamin that Charlie hooks up with."

The movie kicks off with a harsh comment on modern society as Chaplin combines a shot of sheep with people pouring out of the underground. A nice detail is the black sheep, which can be seen as a reference to the outsider (Chaplin) The strongest points of the film are the visual gags. Chaplin plays with his audience and opens every register of his acting-skills.\n\nTechnically he uses a variety of shot-techniques without making them too prominent. Especially the fluidity of the movie comes to mind. Notice how he lets scenes intermingle by echoing the pose of the actor. The directing skill can also be detected in the way he avoids the problems connected with filming in black and white:we know the colour of the flag Chaplin is carrying is red, because it was attached to a truck with an extended load. The weak points are that he isn't able to keep up the pace all through the movie. Also his critique on society is not very sharp, and the end is moralizing and too positive. Nice detail: Chaplin's comment on the talkies. He sings a song with nonsensical lyrics, to prove that suggestion is as strong or even stronger than the real thing"

It is not inspirational because of the laundry list of problems facing our heroes, but because of their unrelenting resilience, their ability to \"Smile\" at the end of it all. Chaplin social commentary is presented in a satirical, yet optimistic, way, so that we are free to recognize the size of the problems at hand, but never allowed to sink into the hopelessness that such troubles often bring. We are led by Chaplin through a tumultuous time in American history; one of labor disputes, high unemployment, poverty, and despair. Fortunately we are guided by The Tramp, in his final screen appearance, all the way to the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel, his humor and pathos as poignant as ever. Through his phenomenal brand of physical comedy and ingenious directing, we see that all we need to do is smile, and not give in to the world that surrounds us, and we will see a brighter day. An extraordinary film of great power, with a message that should be seen by anyone who has ever struggled through a hard time in their life! A masterpiece!"

There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though. It's an endearing and entertaining ride that definitely fulfils its opening promise of a 'smile and, perhaps, a tear.' 8/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "After 22 years of playing one of cinema's most popular characters, The Tramp, comedian Charlie Chaplin decided to hang up the cane, the worn hat and the over-sized shoes. The Tramp's swan song was February 1936's \"Modern Times,\" which happened to also be Chaplin's final silent film (accompanied by a musical and sound effects soundtrack).\n\nAfter his 1931 \"City Lights,\" Chaplin gave serious thought of producing his first Tramp film with dialogue. In fact, he had written a script with words coming out of his silent character's mouth. But during the early rehearsals for \"Modern Times\" he realized The Tramp should forever be destined as the quiet one in a crowd full of loud voices. Consequently, \"Modern Times\" emerged as a non-dialogue film, marking the end of the era of silent films-save for a few parodies such as the 2012 Academy Awards Best Picture \"The Artist\" and avant garde flicks.\n\nOn a European tour after the release of \"City Lights,\" Chaplin was struck by the poverty he witnessed, brought on by the Great Depression. During a conversation with India's Mahatma Gandhi, the topic on factory machinery came up. Gandhi complained machines were making life difficult for the masses. Chaplin countered there was some benefits to those automated engines, but the profiteers overseeing the industry was the cause for such misery. The comedian/writer/director developed from that discussion what he called \"a satire on certain phases of our industrial life.\" Not only is the factory system criticized in \"Modern Times,\" but other critiques are offered on incarceration in prison, menial restaurant work, and other livelihoods whose cruel 'bosses' make life miserable for those trying to make ends meet.\n\nTo retain the look of silent movies, Chaplin shot \"Modern Times\" at 18 frames per second, a common rate in silents, versus the 24 frames required for sound. This explains the rapid movements of the characters when projected at the 24 frame rate, especially during the hilarious scenes. Chaplin dug in the past from his earlier movies to mimic several highlighted sequences, such as 1916's \"The Rink.\" The Tramp roller skates blindfolded, twirling away on the upper floors of a department store, dangerously close to the outer edge without any railings. The scene, taking eight days to shoot, used trick photography with a the lower floor painted on a matted glass plate placed to one side of the camera lens to show the seemingly dangerous heights. But in reality he was simply skating on a flat surface. In another scene inside the same department store, the comic has a battle with the escalator, similar to his 1916 \"The Floorwalker.\" Paulette Goddard, a Goldwyn Girl dancer, was marking time in Hollywood with uncredited roles when she met Chaplin, 13 years her senior. As the homeless 'Gamin' in \"Modern Times,\" Goddard drew positive reviews as the stereotypical 'down on her luck' women Chaplin repeatedly peppered his films with, such as 1928's \"The Circus\" and 1931's \"City Lights.\" The pair's two-year relationship was strained during the filming of \"Modern Times\" because of Chaplin's famous obsession to his work, devoting up to 18 hours a day while sleeping on a studio cot. Playing a homeless woman, Goddard was required to appear daily on the set with dirty clothes and no make-up. So tired of the filthy routine, Goddard showed up one day on the set with her hair washed and combed. Angry she appeared out of character, Chaplin fetched a bucket of water and dumped it over her head.\n\nSome of Chaplin's most iconic shots are seen in \"Modern Times.\" As a factory worker, The Tramp has trouble catching up to his task of tightening the widgets on an assembly belt. He jumps on the conveyor to continue his tightening, only to be sucked up into the machine and its gears. The construction crew built steel-looking gears in wood and rubber, but its filming still pained Chaplin as his body unnaturally bent through the mechanism. He planned to go through the process only once, and a reverse shot in post-production showed him being extracted. Another laborious sequence to film showed the Tramp testing out a time-saving device to enable the employees to continue their assembly line work while eating lunch. The corn-on-the-cob eating experiment goes haywire, sending corn kernels everywhere. Filming took seven days before Chaplin was satisfied.\n\n\"Modern Times,\" like all of Chaplin films, was a highly anticipated event that didn't disappoint the critics. Film Daily said \"Chaplin has scored one of his greatest triumphs.\" Chaplin's biographer Jeffrey Vance wrote the movie, \"remains one of Chaplin's greatest and most enduring works. Perhaps more important, it is the Tramp's finale, a tribute to Chaplin's most beloved character and the silent-film era he commanded for a generation.\" Film reviewer Ed Howard concludes, \"Romantic, hilarious, beautiful, and endlessly inventive, Modern Times is one of Chaplin's greatest works, an ode to the irrepressible human spirit and its capacity for love and invention.\" The American Film Institute ranks \"Modern Times\" as the 78th Best Movie Ever and the 33rd Funniest Film. The Village Voice named The Tramp's last hurrah as the 62nd Best Film of the 20th Century while the BBC listed it as the 12th Greatest Comedy of All Time. The Chaplin film is included in the '1001 Movies you Must See Before You Die' book."

        "review_detailed_main": "Made in 1936 between \"City Lights\" (1931) and \"The Great Dictator\" (1940), Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" (1936), much like Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927) before and Tati's \"Playtime\" (1967) after, depicts a society whose fabric is largely built on technology that does not liberate, instead enslaves. In Lang the society is infected and fallen, dystopic, but in Chaplin and Tati the society itself seems to be largely unaware of its mechanics, which adds a tragic dimension.\n\nIn this sense Chaplin and Tati after him are more concerned with the individual's, the outsider's, perception of a world to which the general population seems to be oblivious to. That something's wrong is felt to the core by the poor workers within the factories in this film. It's this hopelessness that leads the Tramp to excel in Vigoan anarchism.\n\nSome of the jokes are iconic in their visual creativity, others make use of sound quite brilliantly. What is surprising is how Chaplin takes many of the jokes to their extremes, as the visual gag of the lunch machine plays far too long for my taste, just as the scene with the lady on the bench.\n\nThis might summarize this film for me: on one hand wildly creative, on the other unexpectedly prolix, perhaps because of its self-awareness."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie Review: Modern Times The movie Modern Times provides a funny point of view about the unemployed people. Charles Chaplin characterizes an unemployed person who tries to stay in jail for life. At the beginning of the movie, he is wrongfully accused of communist and stayed in jail. One day after he is in jail, some inmates try to escape, but Chaplin killed them and saved the policemen's lives. As a result, he is freed from jail. However, he does not want to leave. He did not have a home or place to live. When he left the jail, he met a girl who is also unemployed and poor. He tried to get back to jail, but the girl gets him out of jail. After a couple of weeks, he found a job as a night watchman for a department store. However, he felt sleep at his job and was put back in jail. While he was in jail, the girl found a job as a dancer. After he left jail, he finds a job as a waiter and singer, but the police finds them and they escaped. Finally, they decide to move to another city to find new adventures.\n\nThe music adds a special touch to the movie. Even though there are hardly any words, the few sentences that are pronounced or written in the movie helps the audience keep up with the story. It is a beautiful story where two people meet and fall in love. They are both poor, but with each other's help they decide to continue and try new adventures. I would have liked to see a happier ending where both will have found a steady job and bought a house."

        "review_detailed_main": "A TIMELESS story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the most timeless theme in any Charles Chaplin movie - a man's struggle inside the insanity of the modern world. Technology is technology, no matter how advanced and small. And novel technology, no matter how good it might look on the paper, doesn't usually work as it's supposed to (the magnificent scene with the automatic feeder). Already in that era, Chaplin compared the people rushing to work with the herd of sheep, a metaphor that is widely overused nowadays.\n\n'Modern Times' is a pure lighthearted comedy, with slight tragic undertones, but in this case, they are so brief that barely the audience has the time to shed a tear when another fantastic burst of humor wipes the drama out of our minds. Yet, this is not a simple comedy. Lighthearted, I said, yes, but the movie carries a heavy message.\n\nChaplin performs some of his better-known stunts - rollerskating in the department store and swimming through the heavy machinery and of course the unforgettable singing scene at the end. I'm sure that people at that time were quite surprised by how good a singer Chaplin was. And how anyone can forget Paulette Goddard as a fiery\u00e4eyed Gamin. That performance is the epitome of a self-reliant strong woman who can handle any situation. Real badass woman.\n\nChaplin has created a movie that offers us joy even nearly ninety years after its release. And with the uplifting line from the movie I end this review - Buck up - never say die! We'll get along."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is undoubtedly one of the best works of Charlie Chaplin and therefore can be classified as one of the best movies in the silent era, and as I see it one of the all-time best comedies.\n\nThe main character, \"The Tramp\", is a factory worker in the early days of industrial revolution who cannot really adopt to the changes. But along with a homeless young woman he is able to face every challenge that comes on his way and able to enjoy life.\n\nThe movie when compared with modern day comedies, differs a lot. In-fact the modern day comedy producers should learn from watching movies like \"Modern Times\". The movie doesn't contain any profanity and sex at all unlike many comedies seen nowadays. However without any of these modern techniques of making people laugh, \"Modern Times\" is still able to make people burst out of laughter.\n\nThough it is a silent movie, it keep the viewers engaged in it for almost 90 minutes and makes sure that they get something for their lives at the end of it. It teaches how to enjoy life despite all the obstacles life bring along its way.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best comedies ever produced and will stay the same in centuries to come. So, don't hesitate to have a go at it even-though it is produced black and white. It will surely keep you entertained and is a movie that the whole family could watch together."

        "review_detailed_main": "Chaplin's sentimental politics and peerless comic invention dovetailed more perfectly in this film than in any other he made. An ungainly masterpiece, but Chaplin's ungainliness is something one can grow fond of. Charlie Chaplin finally got around to acknowledging the 20th century in this 1936 film, which substitutes machine-age gags for the fading Victoriana of his other work. Consequently, it's the coldest of his major features, though no less brilliant for it. Remains Chaplin's most sustained burlesque of authority. Part satire, part slapstick comedy, part melodrama; the great pioneer of film, Charles Chaplin, has created his own monument with this film. At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier. After nearly 90 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. To me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it's certainly as relevant as it was then..!?"

        "review_detailed_main": "No pun intended - this was sort of the first talkie Charlie Chaplin did. Although he himself never really \"talks\" (in the broad sense of the word). And the beginning seems to give us voices through machines ... well it is fitting for a movie called Modern Times ... of course considering where we are now, the times may not seem too modern. Although the CCTV thing (invention) was quite ahead of its time.\n\nChaplin is universal - and while this is a movie where you hear people talk, it still is mostly gestures and impressions/faces. Many things stay silent - except for music, which you had anyway, even with the silent movies - where you had music accompany the movie. But back to Chapling being universal - anyone could understand him, when he was just doing his usual thing. Moving his body, facial expressions and so forth. No matter the generation, no matter the age (young or old), everyone was getting him and the jokes/humor.\n\nThe movie right here is a bit of a piece work. And I believe the commentator that having a woman center piece was quite new - I reckon not just for Chaplin, but also for him. A woman whom he took a liking to and was also romantically involved. Why they broke up, as in if the talking pictures had anything to do with it ... well maybe there is a documentary who will bring light into it. Does not play a role in the movie anyway (no pun intended).\n\nThe sketches or whatever you want to call them, work ... it may seem like patchwork at times, but it is a whole movie. And a very good one at that. Modern times was in fact ahead of its time. I missed watching them and I look forward watching more of the so called classics. The Criterion Collection has quite a few extras - some behind the scenes pictures are showing Charlie without a mustache ... and I have to admit I did not recognize him at first ... Something that may be true for those who may have expected a certain thing from this movie and might be dissapointed by it. Most will enjoy this and the fun it gives you... song and dance number included."

Both of these films infused slap-stick with societal satire and won audiences over with its charming characters. A factory worker discovers a waif and a trash compacter robot discovers a probe droid; Factory Worker is to Gamin as WALL-E is to EVE.\n\nAnyone familiar with the working industry can appreciate the sequence of a herd of sheep turn into a factory line of workers or when Chaplin has to improvise the words of a song with nonsense. My favorite scenes in Modern Times include the nervous breakdown at the beginning and the roller-skating tricks in the mall. A must-see for fans of classic comedy and aficionados of Chaplin!"
