I'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning, but upon seeing it, it is neither horror or thriller.\n\nI was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.\n\nYes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero \"jump-in-your-seat\" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Now I haven't seen the original version, but I can tell you that it's probably better than the remake. The movie's PG-13 rating takes almost all of the thrill and suspense out of the film.\n\nThe beginning of the movie starts off sudden, but afterwards there's a nice drought of action until the first prom killing. The PG13 rating makes the death scenes quite bland and boring. You won't see the victims actually getting attacked, but you'll see silhouettes and blood smears. That's about it.\n\nThe characters in the movie make it seem like you're watching a movie of The Hills. The girls are the classic \"dumb blonde\" stereotypes while the men are the typical \"hard jock\" stereotype. Any angst there is between the characters is very dry and holds no real meaning to the overall movie.\n\nThe plot is very predictable, I sat through the entire movie correctly guessing what was going to happen next and when something good was going to happen.\n\nAll in all, this is a good movie if you're looking for some good laughs, but overall don't expect to be extremely happy with the final product. Personally I'd wait for the movie to come out on DVD. If you've seen any other slasher film, chances are you could guess every next move in this movie."

Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and clich\u00e9 on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away.\n\nWe have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again.\n\nOn top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.\n\nFinally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time?\n\nClosets, that's what.\n\nLots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called \"CLOSET\", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: \"what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one. This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. It's dramatic \u0085 it's sappy \u0085 it's immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.\n\nOur director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You'd probably go \u0085 \"OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa.\" Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. You'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING). I'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.\n\nAs if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. I'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.\n\nWith a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of \"Silver Spoons\", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend \u0085 at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! A complete waste of my time and yours. I bit the bullet to get you this review. Don't let my sacrifice be in vain. DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!!"

The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clich\u00e9d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film doesn't have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular."

Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw \"Semi-Pro\" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???"

And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies.\n\nNow before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.\n\nThe only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate.\n\nIf I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.\n\n1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would)."

For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.\n\nThere is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage.

I acquired an advance screening ticket to this movie and who am I to give up a free movie ticket? The film started off as you would expect. A little character development combined with some backstory and mystery. I wont give anything away but it is a little weak and leaves the audience wanting more information. As the teens arrive at the Prom, Donna (played by Bittany Snow) is trying to forget the horrors of her past but little does she know, shes in for one hell of a night. A stalker which is obesessed with her has broken out of prison and come to find her. The night is filled with screams and blood(not a lot of which I might add) and it all ends in disaster. The acting throughout this film is not great but is believable. The actress who plays \"Lisa\" really does shine in this film. All in all, Prom Night is not a masterpiece.

        "review_detailed_main": "I doubt there's much question to this movie being technically terrible. I mean this movie epitomizes clich\u00e9 in all the wrong ways. From the not-so-clever scare tactics (i.e. cinematic tension unfolding into either a jolt or a joke) to the clear as day plot twists. It ripped off all the classic slasher flicks failing to amount to them whatsoever. I'm not saying that Scream was good, but this is like a carbon copy of Scream minus the strategic comic relief and plus some awkward, cardboard acting and poor attempts at getting a laugh. There is little doubt that this movie is an abysmal failure.\n\nThen why say success? The one thing that this movie delivered with incredible success only applies to a certain target audience. Those are the 11-13 year olds who are simply excited to have gotten into a 14A movie and will be bombarded with, for some, their first \"horror\" movie experience. It gives them all they want: blood, twists, jolts, tension, and of course kissing. They can't tell a bad slasher flick from a Tarantino masterpiece. Not because of their age, however, but because they just haven't been exposed to enough 14+ movies in order to have a well developed movie sense. It's a good experience for them, a benchmark, if you will. I may have hated the movie, but all the twelve year old screams and laughter in the theater made me think that maybe it was worth it to make a horror so mind numbingly terrible for the sole purpose of appealing to those young ones. Revisiting the Scream days, but with less prowess.\n\noh, and financially, it was a great success as well. This probably due to the massive influx of underage movie goers.\n\nA success. An abysmal success, but a success nevertheless."

It was so enjoyably terrible however, that I was thoroughly entertained by its utter failure to create any original circumstances, generate a suspenseful moment in the film, or frighten anyone over the age of 14 in the audience.\n\nWith those two things considered, i recommend this movie with 7 stars to anyone looking for a good laugh."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first saw the previews for Prom Night, I got very excited because the previews made it look really good. I couldn't wait to see it. I saw it on opening night and was not disappointed! The film follows Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) on the night of her prom, fours years after she was traumatized by her pedophile former teacher stalking her and then watching him kill her family. This is shown in the very first scene and the thrills and suspense take off from there. Let me just say this movie is very creepy and not for the faint of heart.\n\nThe thrills I got from this movie were the most I've gotten in a long time. It had that natural horror movie tension buildup, where the character slowly walks backward as the music builds. Sometimes the climax was just the character bumping into a lamp, while other times you saw the guy, staring infatuated at her with those creepy, unforgettable eyes. I will admit I jumped out of my seat a couple of times.\n\nThis movie was one of the best teen slasher films of the 21st century, as the acting is amazing! Brittany Snow is spectacular and believable as the lead and the supporting cast was amazing as well. The characters were realistic, too.(Most of the time) they were intelligent and believable as party-going, fun-loving young teenagers with romantic drama enjoying their senior prom.\n\nThe only thing that could have been better for me, was the ending. I felt it could have been better. You will probably realize it when you watch it, but they had a golden opportunity to make really creepy ending.\n\nAnyway, if you are a fan of horror films, particularly teen slashers, watch this movie! Teens especially would love it, as I did. There are thrills, suspense, romance, and you actually become attached to the characters and hope they survive. This movie will stay with you and have you checking your back after you get back from the theater and have you checking your bathroom after you walk in."

Yes, this movie is certainly not a masterpiece, but it's quite enjoyable.\n\n7.4 out of 10."

The kills are exactly the same, it's basic level horror tactics with no direction or authenticity, even for a remake this is horrible. Idris Elba is a superb actor (See Luther) but his American accent is horrendous (He's British) and completely undermines his power and influence as the leading detective. Honestly, I wasted 90 minutes watching this film, I hope you don't do the same."

I have literally just wasted 89 minutes of my life watching a serial killer stab countless students and hotel employees with no one battering an eyelid. I'm not even going to describe the plot to you, you all deserve better. Typical slasher plagued with uninventive deaths, bad acting, dull dialogue, no characterisation, lack of backstory and piercing cheesy American pop songs that you would find in a teen flick from the early 00s. The only positive aspect to this whole diabolical mess is Idris Elba, who tried his best. But hey, even great actors have to start somewhere. The story is literally pointless. A creepy stalker who creepily stalks a girl whilst wearing creepy attire that shows off his creepy stalker personality is creepily waltzing around a hotel killing everyone, just because he wants to stalk a girl. That is literally it. There is nothing else to this. It's like eating a jam doughnut and realising that you've got no jam in your doughnut. Are you disappointed? Yes. Did you waste your time hoping to taste that sweet juicy jam? Why yes, you did. The killer hides his victims in various hotel suites, to which a detective casually walks along and then BAM a body flings out randomly to create a jump scare. If that's not scary enough, then you'll be \"frightened\" multiple times by the repetitive use of characters walking backwards only to trip on something or knock into someone which consequently somehow creates a loud noise or scream. There's more suspense in the hotel beds than the plot itself! The conclusion then arrives and...well...it ends. Literally bang bang, hugs and tears and then the credits roll. The pointlessness of the film meant that its conclusion amounted to nothing, it couldn't even end properly. I endured this savagery, this uninspired piece of rubbish, just for it to end abruptly. I'm done. This film has ended my existence. I cannot be saved, there is no going back. Goodbye."

Frankly (and I do try to be frank), there is nothing new here. In the venues of remakes, sometimes that is a good thing as it lends familiarity to an old story, and basically gives your ardent fans an updated version of their comfortable old slippers.\n\nIn this case, however, instead of atmosphere and skill, the audience is cheated by cheap thrills (loud noises that make you jump instead of earning the scare via masterful suspense); cardboard cut out characters with so little depth that there is NO WAY to develop any emotion at ALL towards them, be it sympathy or worry or even animosity; and no dialog, no effort whatsoever in the area of a screenplay and/or story.\n\nIt's a shame, really. This could have been a GREAT slasher flick, but alas! It is pretty mediocre in every way. From the performances to the screenplay, this movie is flat, plastic ... flaccid.\n\nAll in all? If you're a horror fan, don't bother with this. Wait for On Demand. Actually, if you're NOT a horror fan, there is no reason at ALL to see this. Actually, there's no reason at all to see this at any rate. Yes. That's it. All in all? Don't see this.

        "review_detailed_main": "Prom Night (2008)\n\nNOTE TO READERS: This review is for the UNRATED version of \"Prom Night\" on DVD. I didn't see the PG-13 version, but I can't believe that this is much better.\n\n2008 didn't start that well for horror. One of the first movies released in theaters in 2008 was \"One Missed Call\", which was so horribly awful, it was funny. March's \"Shutter\" was even worse, because it was horribly awful, AND it wasn't unintentionally funny. And April's \"Prom Night\" concludes the trio of awful horror movies that are some of the worst of all time.\n\nSo, there's a girl named Donna. Her entire family was murdered by a teacher who was obsessed with her. But, the teacher was caught, and locked up in a maximum security mental institution. FLASH FORWARD a few years. Donna is a high school senior, going to her prom. She and her friends go to the prom and (surprise, surprise) the teacher has escaped from the maximum security mental institution and is back to kill everyone that makes any kind of contact with Donna.\n\nFirst off, 99% of all remakes suck. Hollywood, please stop remaking movies and think of ORIGINAL ideas. Even though this can hardly be called a remake (the only things the same are the \"killer at a prom\" idea and the title), they still shouldn't make remakes. Just getting that out of the way quick-like.\n\nSo, this is an awful, awful, awful, awful, awful movie. It uses EVERY clich\u00e9 in the \"Book of Slasher Movie Clich\u00e9s\". Every character makes the absolute stupidest decision you could make in a situation like this. There's nothing really right with this movie.\n\nYou know how in most slashers, you don't know the killer's identity until near the end? And if you do know the killer's identity, sometimes you don't know WHY he's killing? Well, \"Prom Night\" gets this wrong right off the bat, because in the first 10 minutes, you've learned everything about the killer. His name, what he looks like, why he's killing. And instead of revealing plot elements cleverly through dialogue, all they do is have a cop talk about the killer for a few minutes, telling you everything you need to know about him. Yeah, eliminate any and all mystery from it right off the bat.\n\nThen, you're introduced to the annoying characters that you don't give a crap about. The closest thing to characterization is one girl whining about how her boyfriend is complaining about her going to college. Most of the dialogue is annoying, too, plus it adds absolutely nothing to the story. \"So, my dress is kinda like a champagne color, but it's got diamonds on it, so, you know, it's kinda sexy.\" WE DON'T CARE! The first half hour of the show is like a freakin' episode of Gossip Girl. \"Oh my god, she's such a hoe.\" \"Oh my god, look at you. You're so hot!\" \"Oh my god, like, oh my god!\" Stop talking about your damn dress. I don't care. No one in the audience cares. It makes you want them all to die so the damn movie can be over.\n\nSo, after the first \"Gossip Girl\" act of the movie is over, we get to the actual killings. The director has no idea how to handle a killing. Of course, it's PG-13, so they can't show much blood. Even in the unrated version, they don't show anything gory at all. But along with the absence of gore, the director feels the need to make all the kill scenes \"flashy\" and \"stylish\", but fails miserably, just making them unwatchable. Here's how EVERY one of the deaths goes. Killer pulls out knife. Screen goes black for a second. Killer runs towards victim. Screen goes black for a second. Wide shot of the killer stabbing victim, with weird stabbing noise that sounds incredibly fake. Screen goes black for a second. Kill scene over. Plus, add random slow motion, fast motion and annoying camera angles, and you've basically got every kill in the movie.\n\nAlso, the characters are so mind-numbingly stupid, it gets to the point where you think they deserve to die. In one part, the fire alarm gets pulled, and repeatedly the words \"Warning. Leave the building at once,\" are said over the PA. But despite this, no one gives a crap. Everyone EVENTUALLY leaves the building. Except that Donna, after leaving the building, just goes \"Oh, oops, I forgot my shawl,\" and walks up to her hotel room, despite the flashing lights and the \"Please leave the building\" warnings. Is anyone really that stupid? Seriously?\n\nIn some parts, it's even nonsensical how stupid the situations are. It's either a stupid situation or a clich\u00e9 that has been done many, many times before. About 6 different times, Donna opens a mirror to get something, and then closes a mirror, and suddenly, someone's behind her. Somehow, she doesn't actually notice the person going through the door, which is right by the mirror. Plus, it's about as scary as the \"cat jumping on screen\" gag that has been done so many times. Jump scares are overabundant here. Donna runs into lamps and jumps. Donna runs into her creepy aunt who appears out of nowhere many times for no reason and jumps. Donna trips over a table and jumps. Not only are jump scares not scary most of the time, when they're handled as badly as they are in this movie, they're just funny.\n\nWell, I'm going on and on, so I guess I'll just stop myself here. You get the point. \"Prom Night\" is awful. Here's the full rating:\n\nOverall Rating *** (3 out of 10)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I really enjoyed this one. If you like the teen slasher genre but don't like a lot of gore, this movie is perfect. Decent acting. Decent plot. I was pretty riveted the whole time. More of a thriller than a horror, but I'd watch it again. I found all the characters mostly likable. Makes you root for the final girl.\n\nDon't believe the low ratings. Honestly. It's a good little thriller. A lot of good actors in it too, including Idris Elba as the cop. I couldn't remember if I'd seen this before so I caught it on Netflix. I vaguely think I might've seen it when it first came out I do think it holds up.\n\nThought the time period was so nostalgic too. The last grad class before iPhones came out. Ahh the memories of a simpler time. Loved seeing the purity of high school society before everyone got so wrapped up in cancel culture and social media."

OK, the girl gets stalked by a crazy psychopath.....Oh wow. How many movies have you seen that have girls and crazy psychopaths? Brittney Snow played her part well for the main role, but it's not really the acting that Im upset about. It's the story line. No plot,no interesting dialogue, and no thrill. Maybe once or twice something popped out, but it was somehow expected. The original movie is scarier, it has a good plot, and the dialogue was little more interesting. I got into the original way more than this movie."

The main character is as plastic as Barbie and you won't want to see this film unless you could sit through Clueless. The plot itself has some gaping wholes, and some BAD cinematography including some very eighties stuttering slash scenes. As is any teen slasher there is a creepy looking bad guy, except in Prom Night, you might be offended as he isn't actually that bad, adding more to conclusion that if you haven't got that blonde cheerleader mind set this film will be tough to envisage seriously."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am NOT a fan of slasher pictures. It isn't that they gross me out...but it just feels wrong to enjoy watching people die for entertainment purposes. However, my dislike of the genre didn't prevent me from watching \"Prom Night\" because I have a weird hobby...finding and watching films from IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. Yes, I am trying to watch all the worst movies I can....call is masochism if you'd like.\n\nThe story begins with a family being butchered because some maniac wants to impress a girl. How killing her family will make her fall in love with him isn't exactly clear...but he is a maniac after all! Three years later, the surviving girl, Donna (Brittany Snow) is going to her Senior Prom...only to have the maniac escape from prison that same night. The police and her new family don't immediately get Donna because they want her to enjoy the prom (?) and because the police don't think he's going to return to town (???). Even when bodies begin to pile up everywhere and the guy just starts randomly killing just about everyone, the police seem pretty chill about the whole thing. No immediate warnings are sent out to the school and the prom just goes on! Can Donna survive this onslaught? And, will the audience care?\n\nConsidering the film is among the 100 worst rated films on IMDB with at least 10,000 scores, you would expect the writing to be terrible...and it is. The way folks act and react throughout the movie makes little sense. The police are too blaise and victims just stand there waiting to be murdered...even though the killer has no supernatural powers that would explain this lack of a normal response. Plus, considering the maniac wants Donna so badly, wouldn't you think the cops would just watch HER and have cops waiting to apprehend the guy when he strikes?!\n\nSome reviewers complained that the film wasn't graphic enough. While the amount of blood and some of the killings are underplayed, the squishy sound effects and repeated stabbings you see are pretty depraved and awful. How anyone could enjoy this is beyond me...nor why they would want to see more.\n\nOverall, you have a brainless film in which realism is completely out the window. Instead, it's just one killing after another after another...and the folks mostly just stand around waiting to die. Not among the worst films I've ever seen but among the sickest and least entertaining to make the IMDB list."

        "review_detailed_main": "This has to be one of the plain laziest slasher films I've seen in a good while. As a \"remake\" it fails; the only idea carried across is that a killer is killing teens during their prom. Great, I thought, perhaps the chance for a more original storyline (I'm not generally a fan of remakes anyway). Unfortunately, no, this turns out to be just another lame, politically correct movie, a slasher that goes through absolutely all of the motions without ever once approaching anything halfway decent or unique. I truly hate the way these films exist and act like the same old storyline hasn't been done a hundred times already.\n\nThis one suffers from a particularly inane script that features the killer lurking in a hotel suite for much of the running time, bumping off anyone who pays a visit. I mean, seriously? Could this particular story get any LESS suspenseful or interesting? A bland cast of interchangeable characters are the victims, but you couldn't care less about any of them. In fact, the only people I really registered were Idris Elba's detective (mainly because he's one of the few here who can actually act) and Uncle Jack, as played by Linden Ashby (MORTAL KOMBAT), a one-time martial arts star. Mix in a kid-friendly PG-13 rating that makes this an entirely bloodless affair and you have one big waste of time. About the only compliment you can give this is that it's better than the WHEN A STRANGER CALLS remake, but that really isn't saying much."

The scenes were switched back and forth very nicely although maybe some weren't needed.

After years in a mental institution, he escapes and comes back for her, on prom night.\n\nI never really thought the horror remakes were truly horrible until I watched this piece of crap. For some strange reason these PG-13 horror remakes are still being made, ruining the reputation of the originals. Damn you Prom Night, Black Christmas and When A Stranger Calls...why? WHY?!?!?!?!?!?! So what's wrong with this film? Well, let's get out the list.\n\nFor one, it's not thrilling, chilling, scary, intense, jumpy, gory, fun, interesting, funny...so on and so on. The execution of this film is pathetic and weak. It's not even a well made crappy horror flick, at least When A Stranger Calls can say that. This isn't even really a remake, it's a remake by name only. The film is so predictable that it makes the ending to films like Titanic or Passion Of The Christ surprising.\n\nSlasher horror films always have certain clich\u00e9s to them, meaning they are full of violence, sex and gore. This film had none of that. That PG-13 rating cripples it so much that I did not even get any enjoyment out of the deaths of these horribly acted characters. That's right, the acting is bad too, surprised? The characters are horribly written, I had no attachment to any of them. I didn't even hate them enough to want them to die. I simply did not care. At least in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre I hated the Franklin character so much that I was cheering when he was finally killed. Here, none of them do anything. I guess you can say that the horrible acting is attributed to the horrible script with horrible characters, but some blame has to be put on their shoulders. Don't even get me started on the dialogue.\n\nThe killer? What ever happened to mystery? We know who it is from the beginning, we see him all the time so there is no suspense or edge of your seat entertainment. It's just the viewer sitting there wasting their time watching this guy stab people.\n\nSo to say this movie sucks is an understatement. It's a pure and simple cash grab. I'm sure film fans know well enough to skip it, now I'm telling you horror fans. Save your money as well."

What we mostly get is a lot of dumb, clich\u00e9d teen dialogue about how much fun prom night is (unless a serial killer shows up, I guess). In recent years, Hollywood has started releasing R-Rated horror films again after a brief spate of PG-13 drivel that wouldn't scare a five-year-old. Producers thought the PG-13 rating would bring in more money, but the fact that junk like Prom Night didn't bring in the big bucks as expected apparently led them to change course."

The main thing that bothered me about this movie was if your going to have an unrealistic slasher flick where an obsessed school teacher manages to be very skilled at killing hand fulls of people at least make it bloody. This was a PG-13 flick to the core (saw the unrated version), people get stabbed repeatably and it just looks like they put alittle red paint on the shirt. Plus the director kept trying to pull off cheap thrills by shocking the audience with family members suddenly appearing in the mirror or what not. It just got just old quick. I did think the villain was well cast and a few scenes I actually felt like he was a creepy person but the movie got so caught up in killing tons of people that they didn't focus on the villain being creepy or evil. This is why I liked The Hitcher so much. It wasn't a perfect movie but at least they got the concept of a truly evil and creepy villain without having to turn it in just some random person killing off the cast."

It's a slasher-generic movie where you know which characters must die. Basically, it will kill any characters going upstairs. This film is less than an hour and a half long, but the pace was appallingly slow.The antagonist takes too long to kill the characters as the movie attempts to build \"suspense\" before they decide to kill the characters eventually, and this attempt to build suspense affects the pace tremendously. This film is so poor that it couldn't even be seen by Idris Elba. With this one don't waste your time!"

He's in a maximum security cell and he escapes through a ceiling vent? Come on... Even worse is how he disposed of kills. How can you stab someone so many times so violently and have only a few drops on the victims shirt. There should be blood everywhere. Even worse how can someone hide something like that from other victims so quickly. I couldn't relate to any of these characters at all. I didn't feel sorry in the least seeing them picked off. I was actually looking forward to it. I'd pass on this film. Travesty! That's the word I was looking for."

Various prom attendees find reasons to go do things alone, and a killer reliably stalks and kills them. It features, rock-bottom, nonsensical scripting. In the 15 minutes before the prom king and queen are announced, two eager noms head up to their rooms to fool around. ???\n\nI've seen some lazy horror movies before, but this one takes the cake. Everything is perfunctory, lazy and limp. It uses the clich\u00e9d medicine-chest mirror scare not just once, but twice. (Thank you, Fatal Attraction) Startle scares, Yep we got em by the pound. The movie can spare about ten seconds of film after the killer is shot to jump to the credits.\n\nThe movie goes to some length to incorporate a black couple as the white protagonists friends, and then the director, the script and the white couple treat them like garbage. This is the kind of movie you'd make when you've given up competing on every aspect, except style. The prom looks like it has the budget of a decent awards show. If you are in your teens and so sheltered that you don't know your primary colors or your alphabet, this may be for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.\n\nThere really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.\n\nThe plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.\n\nThe worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.\n\nI really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Don't do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet to play ghosts with."

Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.The cast who include Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original.I've seen scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes"

        "review_detailed_main": "Prom Night was very close to the best movie of the year. I honestly loved it so much. I thought that it was so suspenseful and hip. I loved the sudden scenes that would make you jump. In my opinion their were only a couple that got me jumping. The rest of the theatre though every single five minutes they would scream and jump. The theatre was getting very annoying. It was pretty hard to enjoy the movie listening to all the young teenagers scream and talk. So when you can enjoy the movie even with the young teens it must be a good movie. It didn't even seem like a remake based on the original. I had seen the original one and it was very different than this one, it had nothing the same at all. The whole entire cast was great. I loved the killer they chose for this movie who was played by Johnathon Schaech. He did a great job making himself look like what a real stalker would. Brittany Snow did a very good job as well surprisingly. Everyone thought she would do a bad job. I also thought she would to but she did a good job. She didn't act like a dumb blonde. It was very different from what I expected though. I didn't think that the hotel they stayed at would be where the prom was held. This was a very fun movie to watch. I think mostly teenagers would enjoy this movie. The story was pretty clich\u00e9 but in my opinion I liked the story a lot. Some of the visuals were pretty cool at the prom. If you want a lot of blood and gore you wont like this. If you are looking for suspense and pretty jump out of your seat scenes then this is the movie for you. It was amazing go see it. Overall I loved it and think that all the teenagers should go see this movie. The only thing is if you look for the theatre to be quiet it wont be."

Secondly I walked in knowing that it is a PG horror film, so you know that there is going to be very little blood, nothing more than kissing and looks in the intimacy department and whatever killings were done would be mostly off screen. Within this kind of setup the film works reasonably well. The only reason I didn't rate this higher is because of the logic flaws in the story which are almost funny to try to accept. As they could be called spoilers I won't try to list them here but some of the comments here allude to them, and some of the other characters come off as cardboard cutouts, which is more the fault of the characters and the writing than the actors. The acting works for what is here though Ms Snow isn't given much to do other than do the bland I'm the heroine of the story shtick. There are no major flaws in the killings the tension is reasonably done for a PG flick and the best acting in it is done by the bad guy who is played by someone who isn't really known for playing psychos. So if you want a decently paced quickie that won't strain your brain this is for you but stay away if you like your horror more direct."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to this movie some credit, it's hard to make a slasher film thats more boring than the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick Prom Night and in 2008 it was actually accomplished with it's remake. That is of course if it were actually a remake! It had nothing to do with original at all. The original Prom Night begins with five children playing in an abandoned house and one of them dies as the result of a prank, and five years later on prom night a mysterious killer begins picking them off on Prom Night. It was pretty mediocre even for 1980. The coolest thing about it was the cover art which is the only thing these movies have in common. But cool posters only makes the movie more disappointing when it sucks. The remake begins with a cheerleader named Donna witnessing the murder of her parents by a psychotic teacher who is in love with her, Just like in the original. I'm not dropping a spoiler here this movie gives you all the information you need in the first ten minutes.One year later he escapes from a mental institution (because that's where all teen stalking double murderers are put. This clich\u00e9 only works if the killer is psychologically interesting and the killer in the movie is anything but that, Charles Manson isn't even in a mental institution and he's beyond batsh*t. So after his escape he stalks Donna and her friends at the prom. The only other thing this movie has in common with it's original\n\nIn the original you don't find out who the killer is until the end which is a key essential to making a slasher movie. Don't you know the rules? there are certain rules one must abide by in order to make a successful slasher #1 the killer's identity is a secret until the end. This guy doesn't does even wear a mask or so say anything cool. The same thing was done in Slumber Party Massacre but they got away because was wielding a giant drill. This Teacher guy in Prom Night uses a knife that is so small it doesn't even make his bleed. Which leads me to rule #2 which was also broken by Nelson McCormick on this movie. BLOOD! There is almost no blood in this movie. One horizontal splat on the wall just to be artsy. Along with it's lack of DNA it also has no T&A a minor sin really but after making it's demographic watch this whiny boring blond whine about how screwed up she is, and try to have fun with you boring football player boyfriend, while the killer stands around in hotel closet. Showing Lisa's amazing cleavage in that blue Prom dress without having her whip'em out once before she dies her boring, bloodless,off screen death. that's just mean. and the Lisa character she more attractive and has a little personality. who is played by Dana Davis is the one the killer should be stalking. Donna is so bland. Her Banality is unmeasurable, She's only factory setting attractive, Her personality sucks. What makes her worth this killer's effort. If she was like Thora Birch with the Personality like Juno McGough I'd buy it. but even this killer's taste in women is lame.\n\nA Prom Night remake should have been about Mary Lou the villain of the original Prom Night Franchise. anyway yeah this movie sucks"

In fact what we have here is a predictable yet enjoyable teen slasher flick, yes it doesn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out whats coming next but if you do give it a chance you will find it does have suspense and under the unlikely circumstances a certain degree of realism. The leading Cop is professional and he instructs his men in a sense which is be believable as a genuine detective, and his supporting comrades do a fine and professional job too. The victims also play their roles well, the crying and screams are very realistic and yes they all make typical dumb moves that is the exact intention with this kind of movie. Did you expect them to all to just stay in one place and hold hands? what kind of a movie would that be! The real star of the show is the Villain it just shows that we don't always have to have some creepy guy in a hockey or clown mask to pull off scary expressions human expressions can also be terrifying too and he portrays this with perfection his actions and cold temper extremely credible as a serial killer.\n\nThe cinematography in this film is great excellent scenes good camera work atmospheric sound maybe needs more gore but then the PG rating would need to be pushed up and this was aimed at a wider audience All in all what you see is what you get with Prom Night and i knew exactly what i was expecting so i didn't let myself get disappointed, instead i saw good acting with likable characters in suspenseful scenes! Although the end isn't great this was an enjoyable 90 minutes ignore all the bad ratings and give this a go 7/10"

And in the process, he just happens to kill he family, and her friends, and even her enemies!!!\n\nNow, I think the world is tired of PG-13 'horror' movies that aren't even close to scary. And don't get me started on all the stupid (girly-girly) talk. (Oh My Gosh! I am, like, SO tired of hearing Oh, My Gosh!!!!) And come on, what is with all the relationships and the crying and the gossip and the non-violent killing! Oh please!!! I see almost all those things almost everyday, and I really DON'T want to see it in movies!!! Besides, Hollywood NEEDS to get creative and quit remaking every foreign country's movie that they can get their hands on.\n\nWhat can I say about this movie that isn't already obvious? It's a wanna-be horror movie that forgot the horror. You can laugh 'so much more than scream in horror ' And if that's the case , then this movie needs all the comical help it can get because I thought I had invented the stalest joke ever, but this movie proved me SO wrong. It was good for nothing- wait, scratch that, - it's the perfect put-me-to-sleep movie. And you still won't be able to sleep because it's that boring.\n\nOkay, so what have we leaned? First, this movie is SO predictable and has no suspense or fear. Secondly, it's flat out boring. No horror, or comedy, and too much 'girly-talk', and not enough blood for a horror (show me the blood!) And third and most importantly, don't see it unless you like wasting money. Go see, Barney's Halloween's Special and you'll be more interested. So go, listen to me, and don't, waste your time for what it's worth."

The acting was horrible - and this by horror film standards - the plot did not exist, the dialogue was excruciatingly terrible, and I would burn all the copies if I could to prevent anyone from having to suffer through such an atrocity. The characters were so irritating, it was a pleasure (well somewhat) to see them killed, and the thrills were non-existent. Do not waste your money, do not encourage more pointless remakes, and do not try to justify the existence of such a truly dreadful film."

The emphasis could have been more on him instead of Snow's character. Although, that still would not have been nearly enough to save this monstrosity of a motion picture.\n\nIts biggest problem, besides being predictable and not scary, was that the story line was completely uninteresting. I didn't give a rat's ass if these characters lived or died anyway. I guess that's what makes this a slasher film.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing to this movie. A bunch of horny teens go dancing in a hotel on prom night. A guy with a knife comes along and kills some of them.

The bad acting, the cut-away murders, the dumb plot, everything comes together to make Prom Night so dang enjoyable.\n\nThis film has two separate identities: one is a petty high school drama where the girls make fun of the lesbian teacher, bicker with the popular girl and reminisce about the good ol' days while anxiously dreading graduation. The other is a creepy slasher flick involving an obsessed teacher who kills people in front of their children, stashes bodies in the ceiling and cries while looking at a camera (with a dead body sitting next to him). Unfortunately, these two storylines conflict with each other more than they build off one another.\n\nThat being said, there is a special place in my teenage heart for Prom Night. Every few years I have to revisit this movie just to remember that it exists.\n\nBest Character: Lisa Best Quote: \"Michael is making me so darn mad. And on top of that, I have killer cramps!\" - Claire Best Scene: The Construction Level Murder\n\nNote: Shoutout to Ronnie.

The incompetence of the characters and lack of personality along with the pg-13 rating leaves no glory in these deaths, with barely a speck of blood and, clumsy editing causes every one of these one dimensional characters' deaths to be as messy as the weak script and bland cinematography. With blatant shot rehashing and an entire lack of attempts to do something new this movie shapes up to be a bland, uneventful, and un-unique piece of trash. With all that being said certain scenes of tension were somewhat entertaining and a few character moments were genuinely well written, which makes this movie at least worth a watch if you want something stupid to tear to shreds."

        "review_detailed_main": "For me Prom Night was actually a pleasant viewing. After reading the copious negative reviews on IMDb, and an appalling (then) 3.7 rating, I was expecting bad acting, no script, no brainer slasher, but this is not what Prom Night is at all.\n\nA brief synopsis - maniac falls in love with schoolgirl, kills family, gets arrested, goes to jail, escapes from jail, goes looking for schoolgirl. Simple enough, and this is where the bulk of the film begins - Senior Prom Night, and the night Mr Maniac picks to ..uh.. woo Mrs Schoolgirl ..? Okay, so there's better and easier nights to pick, but this wouldn't do much for the films title.\n\nThe movie gets underway like any other average teen horror, predictable killings and cheap scares as the killer closes in on his prey, there's a small amount of underlying tension building throughout the first half, but it could have been done so much better if it wasn't ruined by the typical Hollywood rush job. But okay, its not a masterpiece. The second act for me is the best. I enjoyed the way the film introduced a Police Detective with evident intelligence, and as we soon learn the killers close on the tail of our schoolgirl heroine, the film reaches its best parts, and we're not just seeing the film almost purely from the viewpoint of the victim (like so many poor horrors), but seeing the whole situation for what it is. We're stepping back and saying 'Here We Are, This is Where We're At' and this for me was refreshing. The third act was predictably the big...let down. I take back the Police Detectives evident intelligence, you've let me down sir..some bad decisions on your half. Bit of an anticlimax ending also, but hey, what ya gonna do.\n\nThe acting? Good actually. No Oscars here, but there were hardly any cheesy lines, fake expressions or what not. Brittany Snow is good, and the supporting cast do what they can with the airtime they're given.\n\nOverall, not a bad film. Probably better for me going in with low expectations, which may have heightened the experience. Its not a horror though, which some people may argue why it was bad. Come to this film expecting a thriller and you'll enjoy it more. There's no gore, not a lot of suspense and no creepy haunted house here. This is the straight to DVD kind of thriller.\n\nSome people will moan about the predictable clich\u00e9s (there were some) and the predictable plot (okay, the final act was predictable) but lets face it, its not going for any Film of the Year awards. Its good fun, just sit back, go in with no expectations and enjoy the ride. There are so many awful awful films out there with better ratings than 3.7, this isn't one of them.\n\nCraig"

Digressing to the fact that this is NOT a remake of the original, this one has a very thin premise, but that would be fine if the movie was good in executing a slasher film. The acting is fine so it's not a case of poor acting, it's a case of THIS IS SO EMPTY and DEVIOD of entertainment. It is missing almost all the content required (in at least a decent mix) of the elements needed to attain proper \"Slasher\" status.\n\n1) I am not a fan of gore/torture porn so the kills OWULD be fine , but they were so quick and hinted at (Mostly facial expressions) that even a slasher nut like me who doesn't like crossing the line into ridiculous torture or gore couldn't fine the quick, blink and you'll miss them, kill shots.\n\n2) The story, though extremely thin is fine for a slasher, but there's is so little of it delved into that it's basically just a commercial for \"Why this all happening\" without any character development at all. You feel little to nothing for any of the characters and have near ZERO fear of the villain.\n\n3) there was ZERO T&A, (Remember, I own the UNRATED version) there was NO \"boob\" shot for the Straight men and Lesbians, and no Butt shots for the Straight women and Gay men to get that \"slasher ummm giggle\" (Whether you find that cheap or not is your own affair, it is still a HUGE ingredient in a good slasher film as long as both genders show a bit of T&A for the crowd to avoid accusations of exploitation of one gender which can be a problem in many films regarding only showing female nudity) This has ZERO, not even the unrated version.\n\n4) the conclusion is abrupt and leaves you with very little satisfaction, and ZERO to look back on the film with a \"Well at least there was this or that\" to hold on to as a worthwhile memory for your time.\n\nI'm am glad about only 1 thing, that I got this brand new Unrated version for just 3.99 on EBay and so cannot be mad about losing 20 bucks or something...lol I find it very hard to imagine what they \"put back in\" to call this the UNRATED version, I can only imagine how awful the PG-13 version must have been if this unrated version is suppose to have more...lmao Because there was NOTHING THERE. Save your 4-5 bucks you can buy this for, and pass on this film."

Sure for some people who are expecting a grotesque slasher film with a lot \"dirty\" material and scenes that will scare you horrifically it will be a bad movie, but you can't expect that.

It also could have been better. But that doesn't mean it was bad! It wasn't really scary but it had it's moments! It was suspenseful and also a little disturbing! There was also a make out scene for some people who like that ;-) I can see how the critics wouldn't like it and I can also see how some people in general wouldn't like it, but there are also some people out there that will find it great or good! Teens - some will like it some will not. People that are in their 20's - some will like it, some will not. 30's and over - they are most likely to like it less than other people, but some of them still will like it! My mom did and she is 41!

Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt's a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do. It's clear Hollywood Horror is dead. Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. Prom night is virtually bloodless and I'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is. Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.\n\nOne of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.\n\nWhen the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn. But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna.\n\nWho will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do when she's forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off going to see this. Witch if you ask me is a good thing.\n\nWithout much to work with, McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations. At one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp (a lamp!) and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment. Desperate times really do call for desperate measures. There haven't been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue.\n\nIn the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society's creepy obsession with youthful beauty. This is not that movie.\n\nMy final verdict? Avoid at all cost. Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights. A night you'll be in a hurry to forget."

The problem is it's far fetched and ridiculous at the same time. The worst problem with this movie is that by the time you realize who bad the movie is, your past the point of no return.. you know, when you invested too much time in it to turn it off as that would be a waste of your time. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!\n\nP.S. The special effects guy from this movie should not only not be allowed to work on another film, he shouldn't even be allowed near a Heinz ketchup bottle again! Who gets stabbed multiple times and only has a few red spots on their white shirt? Has the guy ever seen an episode of Forensic Files?"

I couldn't watch the credits because I was busy looking for a knife to slash my wrists.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Prom Night remake is really not a retelling of the 1980 horror classic. The story is completely different from that one or any of the sequels that followed. In this film, a young girl Donna (Brittany Snow) watched in horror as a man brutally killed her entire family. Much time has past and her prom night is fast approaching. She has been living with her aunt and uncle since the nightmarish incident. The man who killed her family is revealed as her school teacher (Richard Fenton) who developed a very unhealthy infatuation with her to the point he would kill to be with her. Of course as prom night hits, we see that the psychopath has escaped from the asylum he was in. The prom is held at a gorgeous hotel, and our four main teenage characters rent a room on the third floor. Of course the killer follows them to the hotel and up to their floor. A few murders take place throughout the middle part of the film. None of the murders are very gory, but there is a certain brutality with the way in which he kills them. There is one chase scene in the hotel, which I guess pays homage to the 1980 film where Wendy gets chased throughout the school for 10-15 minutes. Donna finds out that he has escaped and is in the hotel. This all leads up to an ending that leaves you sort of wanting more.\n\nThat's how this movie came across to me. It constantly left me wanting more. The murders were very quickly done and had little suspense to it. It just felt like the makers of the movie wanted to rush through a lot of good stuff that makes horror fun, and just skip to the story and the ambiance of the prom night dance scene. The reason the original prom night worked was because of the suspense with the killer's identity. It kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out who was doing the killing and why. In this one, we know from the start who it is and why. And the motive of the killer is very weak in my opinion. There are some good parts within the hotel corridors, especially the chase scene involving Lisa (Dana Davis) and the crazed maniac. The acting for the most part is very good. Brittany Snow and Dana Davis were believable and Johnathan Schaech who plays the killer is pretty creepy.\n\nProm Night (2008) is sort of the perfect horror film for a person who cannot handle real scary movies. It milks out all possible gore and suspense and leaves you with some jump scares and a few bloodless kills. It is a decent watch for a modern day horror film, but the 1980 version is much better.\n\n6/10"

So my friend was willing to see it again with me, so I could see if I liked it. We were the first ones in that room, because everybody else was seeing Iron Man. There were only three other people who showed up after us and boy, did we have fun.\n\nIt was flat out terrible, completely predictable and funny every time we were supposed to be scared. That's why we loved it; it wasn't scary at all, but it was entertaining because we had big- and we mean gigantic knee-slapping rounds of laughter, so I wanted to see it again in case we missed some stupid move the \"I've obviously never seen a horror movie\" teenagers made. For example, in one scene, one of the protagonist's friends is running away from the killer, and the elevator won't show up in time, so the girl decides to run down the stairs with her high heels on, she breaks one of the heels, takes the shoe off, and continues running down the stairs with one high heel shoe on and the other off. Pardon me, but if the girls are really that dumb, then they almost deserve to die.\n\nThis movie is so dumb, that I was whispering to my friend what I thought was going to happen, and nine out of ten times, that's exactly what happened. Now if you like classic horror movies and want to be scared, you will be disappointed, but if you want to see one of the years biggest laugh riots, you'll be pleasantly entertained.\n\nIf you've seen as many horror movies as I have, and you watch this and don't laugh at least once, I'll be astonished. 5/10"

That's my predicament in a nutshell: saw an interesting trailer, got very excited and was disappointed at the final product. Of course, if I had started at anything scarier (as this was my first horror movie), I probably would have left. I scare easily and this is perfect to start out with if you're not used to the jump scenes. However, I can understand good scripts and acting and this was not it. The characters had no real personality and most of the \"chase\" scenes were about 45 seconds long. Is it the bad actors or is it the lousy script? I have seen \"Red Eye\" and that really intrigued me and I hope to find more good thriller or horror movies in the future. For example, I am hoping to see \"Disturbia,\" \"Flightplan\" and \"When a Stranger Calls.\" We'll see how well they turn out. This got a 5 from me because, again, it was my first horror movie (although I'm not sure whether you would call this movie that or not) so I was lenient, but for all you experienced moviegoers out there, this is not the right \"Prom Night\" to go to."

Especially her and friends are going to their senior's Prom Night together for the last time before College. But Fenton actually escaped from the mental hospital to be with Donna and he kills people, who gets in his way to get to Donna.\n\nDirected by Nelson McCormick (Who's an pro directing T.V. Episodes like \"E/R\", \"Nip/Tuck\" and \"NYPD Blue\") made an entertaining teen slasher movie with the right moments of suspense and terror. Schaech does an good job playing the crazy serial murderer in the movie. Although i am not a big fan of actress:Snow, she does an pretty good job in the feature. Idris Elba has an scene-stealing supporting performance as Detective Winn. The cast are likable as well like Jessica Stroup (The lead actress from \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\"), Dana Davis, Collins Pennie, Scott Porter, Linden Ashby, Mary Mara and others.\n\nDVD from \"Prom Night\" is actually the Unrated Version, it includes one minute of additional footage (Mostly violence are added back in this version). DVD has an solid anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the filmmakers, actors:Snow and Schaech. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes with optional commentary by the filmmaker, same goes from the Alternate Ending, Featurettes and Bloopers. This is not a remake of the infamous Canadian film of the same-name, who was starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Although there's one scene in the new Prom Night that reminds me of the original. Slasher fans will find some enjoyment in this thriller and don't listen to the critics in this one, just watch and enjoy it. Joshua Leonard from \"The Blair Witch Project\" fame has an amusing cameo as one of Fenton's victims. Written by B-Movie Scripter:J.S. Cardone (Alien Hunter, The Covenant, The Forsaken). Super 35.

Needless to say, the new story could have truly gone somewhere and it's a shame that it ends up feeling more like a typical Lifetime movie event rather than a scary or suspenseful thriller.\n\nThe young cast manage to give pretty decent performances, but they have very, very little to work with. Dana Davis as Donna's best friend, Lisa, is especially likable.\n\nThe film's condescending PG-13 level shocks and scares are pretty dull and bland, but the film does have a nice pace to keep things rolling smoothly, which is one thing that you can't say for other watered down pre-teen efforts like Boogeyman and When A Stranger Calls.\n\nFans of the original might want to consider this new film as more of an unofficial sequel in the Prom Night series. Eiher way, no matter how you think of it, remake or sequel, it's a disappointing, scare less affair, with a lots of potential, but little pizazz."

The bad thing is that there are some clich\u00e9s. The good thing is it's different from everyday slashers. Like I said, barely any blood is spilled in here.\n\nIf you don't like the sound of that, well, skip this movie. It isn't for you. Yes, the clich\u00e9s are still there, like some big \"WTF\" moments pop out in the middle of some scenes because of some characters' stupid moves. Other \"WTF\" moments, in my opinion, is the unusually high body count, which is ten or more. I found some kills very unnecessary but I guess it was to please the gore hounds out there, which obviously didn't work. I was also disappointed in the end.\n\nApart from those flaws, the film stands up pretty well. I appreciate that the film was trying to do something new. I love the use of sound here, and if you know me, I usually don't praise horror movies for their sound effects. The use of sound makes this movie more suspenseful and gives it a more dark tone. I also love the way the kills were shot. It was different and unique.\n\nI also liked the fact the filmmakers decided to show the killer's face within five minutes into the movie. Judging from the trailer, you would think they'll show it in the end but you're wrong. The performances were good. I also felt some sympathy for the characters, which is also another high point in the movie.\n\nOverall, the way this film was shot, the use of sound, and some other magical elements in this film, like the young, unknown cast, gave the film some life. The film is not perfect in any way but I liked that it was trying to be different, and although it may have failed with many viewers, whom weren't likely the target demographic in the first place, I appreciated that."

I haven't seen the original PROM NIGHT so i don't know what to compare it to. My best is that if you saw and liked I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER then you would probably like PROM NIGHT (2008), butPROM NIGHT (2008) is more of a cat and mouse kind of movie. What else can you expect from a PG-13 horror movie? Fits my standards an overall was a decent movie that we all could have lived without."

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching this film, I read some reviews and the 99% of them were negative. Of course I saw the 3.9/10, something not really encouraging. Finally, I decided to watch this film, so I can understand by my own what's the problem with that film. Eventually, I think that I understood. This film is full of cliches, I knew what was about to be happening, who was going to be dying, etc.\n\nThe other thing that personally annoyed me was the representation of the film, as a reboot of the 1980 original of the same name. To be honest I didn't liked the original, I think it is bad for other reasons. This \"remake\" has nothing to do with the original. It's a completely different film, since does not contain any similar elements from its prior. The story line is also completely different. I personally like obsession themed films, so this is the only one bonus in this one.\n\nAnother thing that I didn't like is the protagonist. She never convinced me. I didn't liked her acting skills. I would prefer someone else to take the part. Maybe it would be better (?), I don't know... then the killer. We know from the beginning of the film who the villain is, so automatically this film does not make the viewer to be concerned, to trying to guess who is the killer. Besides, he wasn't either convincing as a killer.\n\nThe killer was so obvious, that if you would just stare at him, you knew that he's a bad person. But no! No one actually understood a thing. He was somehow \"invisible\"! Plus, it wasn't scary or even suspenseful at all...\n\nSo, I fully understand the reason of why this film is hated. To me is a completely stand alone, since it has no connection with its prior. In my opinion, when it is decided to be made a remake, of course they should do this different, because (personally) I don't want to watch the same film, but the story line it could be kinda similar, and of course the most memorable elements of the original (if not all of course) they have to get into the film, so I (we) can understand the reference from the authentic movie.\n\nNot recommended."

In this day in age, it would be hard to have total originality in a horror film because of the history of horror movies.\n\nThis movie strays from the plot of the original Prom Night, which featured Halloween star, Jamie Lee Curtis. Brittany Snow has made her mark in Hollywood, but on a different scale of acting.\n\nThe film follows all the criteria that is needed for a B horror movie, however you are sensitized by stronger characterizations of having more than one dimension to the others on the screen. For the setting the plot has, it is necessary and may even suggests that the film could have been longer to further develop Donna and her friends.\n\nOverall, it isn't the worst horror movie, or the best. Films like these quite often are underrated on IMDb and don't get the attention that they are screaming for. If you like a good thrill, take my advice and see it."

The movie is really predictable and there's a bunch of cheap jump scares that is really obvious for the viewer. Also the climax is really lousy because it doesn't even take place at prom and is extremely disappointing. Also, there's a lot of moments that is stupid or make no sense. All of the characters are extremely bland, forgettable, and really stupid. The kills are extremely disappointing and really repetitive. Most of it are generic stabbing that gets old really quickly and some of it happens off-screen. The gore effects are ok, but nothing too special."

But I should say that if you have this opportunities(budget, actors and etc.), you have to be more conscious about what are you doing instead of wasting them. I actually do not know why I gave a 2 out of 10 to this movie. Yes it may not be the worst movie ever, as I saw worse ones, but I feel that '2' is like a reward after what I saw. I tried to respect the crew's effort of making, directing and editing of the film. That's why I gave a 2. Otherwise, this movie has one of the most ridiculous plot ever, it is full with clich\u00e9s that the audience are sick and tired to see in movies. Also, the acting are not good enough except Idris Elba(the black police officer). Honestly I could not stand it to the end. So if your time is valuable, you better stay away from this movie."

Now on the day of her senior prom he escapes from the asylum and the real fear begins.\n\nThoughts: Next up on the remake chopping block is this pretty bland slasher. Truth be told I was never really fond of the 1980 original that starred scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis so I thought a remake couldn't hurt this one. I did like the remake a bit more. There is really no suspense since it's revealed right off the bat who the killer is. There isn't a whole lot of grue in either the PG-13 rated version or the unrated for that matter. The screenplay goes through the motions and clich\u00e9s and never really does much to engage the watcher. The photography is fine since the main bulk of the action takes place at the hotel. The sound design picks up a little slack by making the kills sound much worse than they were. The cast is pretty, faceless and chock full of the teen drama types.\n\nIn Conclusion: 'Prom Night' is a bland remake that still manages to better the original, barely. Good for teenagers and snore inducing for adults."

But Fenton's escaped from jail and he tracks her to the prom. Det. Winn(Idris Elba), the man who put away the psycho those years ago, desperately tries to stop him before he finishes what he once started.\n\nNow I know there are crappy horror remakes like House of Wax and One Missed Call, but this one takes the cake. For the positives, it's incredibly short. But that's about it. The acting is pathetic, with wooden performances all around. The scares are weak too.This is supposed to be a horror film. You need the occasional pop-ups. But this ruins any of those chances, like Fenton slowly appearing out of the darkness to the point where you can see him clearly and then attempting to scare the wits out of you, but that slow movement has already killed that off.\n\nOverall I give it a 1 out of 10(I wish there was a zero stars option). This is definitely a night I WOULD want to forget."

Those Hollywood movie producers should reconsider every time they decide to remake something. This is dog pooh and nothing else. What happened to logic? Why does the killer look like Billy Bob Thorton? Where did they find the guide female actress? Just awful.When i see movies like this just makes me go back to the eighties and nineties again.Back then there wasn't much CGI but the movies were enjoyable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Besides all the girls in the theater screaming their heads off every two minutes, it was an amazing movie. Johnathon Schaech gave an amazing performance as Richard Fenton. Hes the perfect guy to play the role of a creepy killer. The amount off effort that Brittany Snow put into her role as Donna Keppel. Brittany Snow is nicely cast as the vulnerable Donna whose nightmares give us an early opportunity to understand the circumstances in which her parents and brother were murdered. There's fun and laughter as Donna and her two best friends prepare for their big night with cool frocks, hairdos, stretch limos, attentive boyfriends and high expectations. From the start, director Nelson McCormick injects jabs of uncertainty into the proceedings. Tension builds as we, the audience, know more than the characters. There's the clanging of the hangers in the closet, the creaking door, a disappearing face in the mirror, a figure in the doorway. There are screams, a splash of bright red blood and shadows in the darkness. Predictably, the first victim is someone we don't know. The next is someone we care little about. Then the killings step up a notch.\n\nMcCormick toys with the tone, flitting back and forth to the light and gleam of the ultra modern LA Club-style prom for relief, after each killing. There's a contrast of obsessions - between Johnathon Schaech's darkly broody killer, Richard Fenton, and Idris Elba's Detective Winn. Fenton obsesses about Donna as something he must possess, while the detective is determined to stop Fenton at all costs. Schaech, with his angular features and disturbing stare is a convincing villain while excellent editing by Australian Jason Ballantine (Wolf Creek, Rogue) keeps the story moving as it neatly unsettles our equilibrium. Unashamedly catering for its target market, Prom Night delivers pretty much what you expect with enough scares to satisfy but not to keep you awake till the wee small hours. If your into suspenseful horror movies or just wanna see a good movie, i strongly suggest you go see this movie as soon as possible. and i know this review isn't detailed about the movie, but thats because i don't want to spoil it for you. and trust me, you wont want to miss this movie."

However, Prom Night fails to capture the imagination, tell a realistic stalker story, and develop characters despite massive emotional trauma being present.\n\nThe entire premise of Prom Night revolves around a series of unrealistic mistakes from a wide range of people. The narrative takes you out of the story once you realize the entire scenario is highly unlikely.\n\nThe film could have been good if it touched on the issues Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has to deal with after first encountering her stalker. The one good point about the film is the acting is solid and shows what type of film Prom Night could have been with a much better script.\n\nIdris Elba and Ming-Na Wen are in the film, but neither is used up to their abilities due to the flat script.\n\nTrue Score: 4.9."

Despite all the bad reviews about this film however it did make a lot in the box office just showing that the movie watching generation like the \" Non - Brainer Films \".

        "review_detailed_main": "So, before I begin, one thing I really need to stress.\n\nTo all the bad reviews on here with \"high hopes\" or \"expectations\" ....... The movie is called Prom Night, what did you expect?\n\nYes, the movie is unbelievably clich\u00e9, yes, the characters are your typical teen/horror movie characters, but again -- the movie is called Prom Night.\n\nI'm tired of listening to folk whine about how upset they are that movies like Prom Night turn out with the aspects I stated above.\n\nYour teen slasher is always |ALWAYS| going to turn out like this. Sure, some will be better than others, but when it comes down to it, they're all the same. Centers on the girl, her friends get slaughtered because the \"stalker\" wants to get close to her, the cops try save her, she almost dies, they shoot, stab or set him on fire -- the end.\n\nRight? Yes.\n\nNow, Prom Night wasn't the best I've seen from this genre, not even half-way, but, there were a good few scares here and there that I will admit to gasping too.\n\nThe main problem with this movie was, the usual story (I stated above^) was too obvious, even for a movie like this. She looks in the mirror, he's there, she turns - he's not there. The friend has an argument with her boyfriend, she goes up-stairs to chill = killing time.\n\nThe biggest thing that got to me was the choices these teens made, for instance.\n\nThe Prom is held at a well-off, beautiful hotel. Towards the end of the movie, the cops take over and tell everyone to leave - so you leave, right? No.\n\nThe automated voice is talking over the loud speaker: \"Emergency, please leave the building\" (repeated over and over). So, what does the girl do?\n\n\"Oh I forgot my moms shawl, it's up-stairs\" of course, because that's the first thing you worry about, naturally.\n\nThere are about one hundred of those \"shawl\" moments in this movie that it just gets you thinking, it's now 2008, can't they come up with anything better?\n\nNow, I'm not gonna take a pop at the actors, because their acting was good, but with this material, there's only so much you can do.\n\nGo into this movie the way I went into it. I expected the expected, and I was right.\n\nDon't go into a slasher movie titled, \"Prom Night\" thinking you're gonna get a stunning piece of film.\n\nIt's just not common logic."

It's so sloppy, like they made it overnight or assigned a middle schooler to write it.\n\nBasically, a teenager was stalked by a psycho teacher and he killed her family. He was sent away, and he broke out 3 years later on her senior prom and attacks the place. The killer is not mysterious or creepy, just a Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men expression-less looking guy with a pocket knife....very scary.

The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too. Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake. Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10."

The killer just seemed to kill people for no reason, managed to teleport dead bodies around rooms and magically move across a room without one of the main characters standing in the same room noticing?? The main characters are just annoying and I ended up not caring if they died and wishign some would get killed quicker because they annoyed me so much. The black girl only ever moaned about becoming the prom queen or slagging off her opponent, her boy friend just took pictures the whole time. The main character and her boyfriend just moaned about how they would not see each other again and how \"real\" their relationship was.\n\nThe killer never managed to kill anyone well not that I seen anyways, the camera just suddenly found another object in the room more interesting than one of the main characters getting killed and suddenly when we next see them they are dead. Another thing I noticed was that this killer wasn't scary, creepy or weird at all just that he wanted to screw some chick really bad.\n\nThere was no suspense or surprise at all when characters were about to die it was all predictable and very very boring. There was a cool slow down camera effect when the guy got killed when he jumped out of the wardrobe. This was actually the only memorable part of this movie to be honest DON'T GO AND SEE THIS< ITS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOUR TIME"

        "review_detailed_main": "Prom Night is the sort of horror movie you go into expecting nothing more than a cheap scare, sure in the long run it's likely to be forgettable, but so long as it makes you jump, gives you a laugh and lets you leave the cinema feeling entertained. Prom Night is your average slasher really, no big creepy set piece, nothing really out of the horror movie clich\u00e9, its just a piece of average horror junk. Its a shame then that its also a poorly made, acted, and delivered piece of horror junk that not only fails to entertain you, it fails to even slightly chill the bone, it fails to even make you jump! I'd have accepted this a tiny bit more if there was at least some gore to make the movie a tad more interesting, the gore is beyond tame, how this got a 15 is completely beyond me. Adding insult to injury the movie is also stupidly boring, its the same scene pretty much repeated over and over again, its only in the last half hour we get a tiny bit of change, and yet that features so many stupidly pointless scenes its hard to wonder what the hell the point in the movie is. Oh and did I mentioned its funny, stupidly funny. Hell I was crying with laughter in one bit, its a shame its completely unintentional, and the bit I am on about is a bit when a man gets killed. The stupidly poor reaction just sent me into hysterics. Prom Night is a thriller basically devoid of any thrills, the only reason it actually gets a 2 is because of the fact I laughed in it, and I think my brain has numbed the experience making me forget it almost instantly.\n\nSo onto the acting, or well the cardboard cut-outs. First there is Brittany Snow, who I noticed had a distractingly hairy face, anyway she was stupidly poor. Her acting experience ranging from startled expression to make random crying noises via trying not to scream. The opening sequence with her is just ridiculous, and one of the final scenes, which conveniently enough is repeated (yes the scene is literally a copy scene for scene) just shows you've had enough of the actress. The actual killer himself, played by Johnathon Schaech just has little to do. The biggest failure with the character is that we see him too often, he's just not scary as we know exactly where he is in every scene. The acting itself is tolerable, but then again he doesn't have to do much but look evil and stab people. Dana Davis (of Heroes fame) is just about tolerable, although once again she has little to do. She features in the best scene in the movie (trust me that isn't a compliment) as well as the very worst scene (random pigeons, good god). The rest of the cast really are that pointless/forgettable. Essentially they're there just to die, or go through the whole prom motions, or try and catch a killer, they're basically living breathing stereotypes running round.\n\nSo that gets me onto the horror side of the movie, or the extreme lack of it. As I have previously mentioned the movie fails because we see the killer to often. Its just so annoying. Scenes that start to become tense are ruined because we just see the killer calmly walk in, scenes that look like they may make you jump abruptly end when we see the killer just standing somewhere in a corner. Tense chase scenes are ruined by stupid random damned pigeons appearing out of nowhere! As you can imagine I really disliked the pigeon sequence. The film being unintentionally funny just stomps the final nail in the coffin really, the porter death scene is something that I want to see again just for a laugh really. The poor dialogue is just embarrassing, the script is once again embarrassing, and the ending so damned predictable you might as well have not bothered to even see the movie. The movie does admittedly improve as it goes on, the first forty minutes being almost unbearable. Once the killing starts you no longer want to slit your wrists, but you still have to cope with an incredible amount of stupidity.\n\nOverall Prom Night is boring, stupid and just a lazy attempt at a horror movie. People who nearly die when watching the tamest horror movie could watch this, it just isn't scary, doesn't make you jump and doesn't even attempt to creep you out. Save your money, go rent the original Halloween if you want a good slasher."

Keep in mind that for PG-13 it still manages to be a horror film. I believe that was smart on the studios part since 13 and older would be the target audience for a movie that is about a prom whether it be \"The Prom\" or any high school dance. Britney Snow might have helped carry the movie, not sure, but still in the end it was up there with the rest. The movie has a sharp well polished look to it, and for many of the actors (not all of them) they are pretty likable and pass for any scary movie. By the way might be one of the sexiest serial killers since Michael Myers."

And the killer is not very good at killing either.\n\nThere is no comedy. Like the \"Scream\" films, it has comedy to support the up and down flow of the film so the scary bits are actually scary. This on the other hand is just drama and stupid teenage behaviour. It is funny when Tatum (Sidney's friend) gets trapped in a cat flap in \"Scream\" because its ironic. In \"Prom Night\" there is no comedy thus makes the tense bits (which happen a lot!) kind of dumb.\n\nOverall: It did make me jump but I had to force myself to stay to the end.

        "review_detailed_main": "One problem for this movie in my opinion is the wild body placements: a loft or a car trunk on the outside?! It's possible that he could have gotten outside with a body--if he was clandestine enough; there is a network of stairs and police were busy guarding the prom and extra security was on Donna. Second entrances should be accounted for always(IT'S STANDARD OP FOR A ROACH OR RAT TO OPERATE WHERE PEOPLE WILL NOT LOOK AND A COP SHOULD THINK LIKE A CRIMINAL IN ORDER TO GET HIM), but sometimes they get overlooked. The loft's kind of iffy; they should have lost that, because that would mean getting blood on the carpet and for him to be a major bodybuilder: he didn't look like the type! Why go through the trouble of doing those 2 things when there's space under the bed. What hotel has one of those anyway?! The other one would be how the bodies kept conveniently popping up out of nowhere as the cops or Donna was passing by from the hiding space that the killer hid them WITHOUT REASON! I don't have problem with Donna's lack of emotion; she's lost her family and probably having post traumatic stress over this guy since; her emotions and emotional states are maybe beyond repair outside of divine intervention! Misery has bigger problem than this movie and I'm sure it got a pass; after all, Stephen King was behind that! Problems with Misery: 1. Him rolling around in a wheelchair as he did when Wilkes was probably going to be back within an hour or sooner! We have lived in a rural setting all my life and it took us about 20 minutes to go to the store at most no matter where we have lived at. So, he did not have all that time to go lazily through the house. 2. Then, he had stolen the pills; I accept that, but the knife?! And Paul didn't think repercussions were coming when his nurse had a medical chest full of things to do to him and could implement them whenever she wanted?! 3. Also, why would Paul have to write Misery back to life, if Annie burned his manuscript that never got published? THESE ARE 3 CRITICAL ERRORS THAT DOOM THAT MOVIE FROM BEING COMPLETED! To me, Prom Night has small errors compared to that classic!"

I love horror movies myself but I'm not picky if there's a little extra something in a horror movie. For instance, I think the problem with this movie is that it is claimed to be a horror movie but actually there are the same amount of drama scenes and action scenes. Not to mention that there seemed to be a lot more suspense scenes than horror scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and I really think that the acting on the actors starring in this movie was well done."

Donna has been under psychiatric care and taking strong anti-psychotic drugs ever since her entire family was murdered by her English teacher Richard Fenton, Johnathon Schaech, three years ago. Fenton who had an obsessive attraction to the at that time 15 year-old Donna went berserk when she turned him down to be her lawfully or, in Donna not being at the age of consent, unlawfully wedded wife.\n\nUnknown to both Donna and her Aunt Karen, Jessalyn Gilsig, and Uncle Jack, Linden Ashby, whom she's now living with Fenton has escaped from the loony bin, or mental institution, that he's been interned in. The murderously as well as revenge driven Fenton is now headed for the Grand Pacific to rekindle his strange and unnatural relationship with Donna. It's that relationship that ended so abruptly with his capture and conviction some three years ago.\n\nThe movie \"Prom Night\" has the cunning but mentally deranged Fenton turn the Prom Night ceremonies at the Grand Pacific Hotel into a house of horrors. Fenton is so unstable and blood thirsty that he ends up murdering a good number of the hotel staff who have nothing at all to do with keeping him and his \"beloved\" Donna apart! The guy-Fenton- also seems to have the power to travel from point A to Point B in some cases 20 to 30 miles apart on foot, he probably wore a pair of Air Jordans, faster then even a speeding police car, running red lights, could have done!\n\nThe local police headed by Det.Winn, Idris Elba, have more then their hands full in dealing with Fenton in that besides his ability to be a step or two ahead of them at every point in the movie he's also a master of disguise as well as expert in camouflaging himself. As we soon see Fenton can easily turn himself into a piece of furniture as well as any member of the hotel staff without anyone, including Det. Winn, ever noticing him!\n\n***SPOILERS*** Donna who had enough troubles to deal with, in overcoming her deep psychiatric problems in seeing Fenton murder her entire family, is now confronted with the knowledge that not only is \"Mad Dog\" Fenton on the loose but had already murdered a good many of her high school friends, in his rampage at the senior Prom, including her one and only love, that she plans to marry after collage, her overprotective boyfriend Bobby, Scott Porter.\n\nIt was Fenton's big mistake in going after Donna at her Aunt and Uncle's home that turned out to be his own undoing. with the house surrounded by at least a dozen policemen Fenton's crazed love, or obsession, for Donna made him walk right into the trap that the cops set for him. But not after the slippery as an eel Fenton just about did them all in with only Det. Winn still around and on his feet in him being able to finally stop the crazed lunatic!"

If you are a fan of Brittany Snow and Jessica Stroup, like I am, then you will definitely die for this flick. Brittany Snow(John Tucker Must Die) finds herself target by an escaped mental patient Johnathan Schaech(The Forsaken and Hush), who comes after her three years later after targeting her and her family. When she goes to her senior prom with her close friends Jessica Stroup(90210 and Hills Have Eyes 2), Scott Porter, Dana Davis, Collins Pennie, Kelly Blatz, he hides inside the hotel, waiting to strike. As her friends begin to disappear, she must confront her past in hopes to survive the night. This movie really rocked, i like the ones with obsessive psychopaths and the things that they will do to express their love. So definitely check it out and its also a Screen Gems release."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alright, first of all, I never made a comment on IMDb before. I personally decided to register to make a comment on this movie. I mean, I use this site a lot to find info on a lot of movies, and was never irked as much to make a comment on this site. However, when I read the comments by a few people who say; hmm, probably 95% of comments on this movie is wrong and maybe the movie wasn't made for them, is complete BS, and you know what that means. Any person who defends this movie and actually says it is a good, OK, or even bearable movie should never be allowed to comment on movies again.\n\nI saw the trailer to this movie and I was like it looks horrible and trailers are the best parts so I know it is awful. Would have never watched this movie, but my new roommate actually rented it and we had just moved in the apt. and had only one TV with no cable at the time. She was wanting to see it; she likes cheesy horror movies as well as good ones,but she can not tell either one apart. So, to be a good new roommate, I decided to watch it with her. I figured that I would just bear it and see if there are any good horror jump scenes or just great bizarre scenes. Man, I should have just been plain mean that day to my roommate and saved an hour and a half of my life, cause the only horror to this film is actually sitting down through the whole film.\n\nThis movie is so clich\u00e9d it does not even let you remotely guess wrong. You will actually fall asleep because you know what is going to happen. My poor roommate guessed everything right, and she believes that is what you are suppose to do in a good film, poor poor girl. Plot, can you say I need to make money so lets make a film to make quick money, just long enough to fool people into thinking this is going to be a good remake plot. Cause that is exactly what I was thinking, and I am sure the people responsible for making this crap was too. Suspense, thriller, blood gushing, or any startling scenes, you better not expect that if you come see this horror movie. If you do, well you should have listened to me. For people who are frightened at horror movies and think this might actually be a movie for you to enjoy because it is not scary, I hope you do not plan on taking a quick nap after the movie, because I can ensure you will want to go to sleep during the movie if you are not sleeping to hold off for that nap later on. NO entertainment purposes associated with this movie whatsoever.\n\nPlease bear this warning and save yourself from a horror of a movie. Unless you are like my roommate and can not tell from a bad horror movie from a good one. Or like some of these people on here and can't just tell from a bad movie period. I mean I have seen some bad movies in the past, however this has to be in my top worst five. I mean Charles Barkely would not put this movie in his fav five for money endorsement. Just ignore the 5% percent on here who says that this movie is even bearable to watch and just stare at your TV while it is off for an hour and a half. I guarantee you will get more out of that than this movie."

Tell me how I just watched the \"unrated\" cut & it seemingly to me, was even worse than I imagine it could've been if I had watched the theatrical cut. How this movie earned back it's budget on opening night in 2008 & then turned a profit during its theatrical run is absolutely insane. I'll never forgive this movie for stealing an hour & a half of my life, as a matter of fact I've considered legal action against the writers, production crew & the director, hell, even the key grip for the past 30 minutes. Please, Do NOT watch this."

        "review_detailed_main": "I've seen this film a few times over the years but thought I'd give it another shot in 2020, since the entire year has been a letdown. A lot of reviews here criticized the film for not being bloody enough and it's true, there's not much blood. Despite the killer being knife happy, he seems to avoid getting a spot of blood on him. It's also interesting to see which actors careers have stood the test of time. Elba, for example, has gone on to do some great things, while others have seemingly faded into obscurity. Murphy, for example, has continued to be the \"other Brittany \", despite her competition being dead. (Not much expectations for a blonde haired, blue eyed FL girl, I suppose) Prom Night stayed with all the cliches, minorities die first, the killer is everywhere despite never running, and don't look behind the open door. If they remade this in 2020, there would definitely not be as much hyper masculinity and a lot more racial diversity, but it was the early 2000s, so it is what it is. If you're watching this expecting any big plot twist or anything other than a very standard B-rated slasher flick, you WILL be disappointed. But if you shut off your brain and just enjoy it for the popcorn flick it is, you should have an okay time."

        "review_detailed_main": "...that's the best way to describe 2008's \"Prom Night,\" which isn't a remake of the 1980 film. Brittany Snow plays the protagonist hounded by an ex-teacher who's psycho-obsessed with her. He escapes from prison and goes on a killing spree at the grand hotel where the prom is held. Jessica Stroup and Scott Porter are on hand as friends of the protagonist.\n\nBeing a PG-13 film there's not much gore, but I could care less because I'm more concerned with how interesting the story & characters are and not how much blood & guts are shown. While this is a well-done production -- costing $20 million -- the story & characters are only mildly interesting. The film never rises above mediocre to become something great or even good, but at least it's decent mediocre. For comparison, every single Friday the 13th film is more entertaining. Despite this, \"Prom Night\" was a minor hit at the box office, pulling in well over twice it's expense in the USA alone. Go figure.\n\nPractically the entire movie takes place in a grand hotel, shot at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. The flyover views of the spectacular bridge were shot in Newport, Oregon. The film runs 89 minutes.\n\nGRADE: C+"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having survived a traumatic experience, a teenager and her friends decide to celebrate her senior prom when they learn one of her ex- teachers who harbored a psychotic crush on her has escaped from jail and is out stalking them at the hotel and must stop the madman.\n\nThere wasn't a whole lot here that actually worked for the film. One of the few bright spots is the fact that it gets off and running at a fairly early time, as there's a fairly fun pace to this moving along quite quickly here. It's barely half-an-hour into this one before the first attack comes and the relatively high body count works much more in it's favor since it starts knocking them off quite early on and gets the most out of these few sections. The only other fun part of the film is that it's got a couple of really entertaining stalking scenes which are better than expected and are quite enjoyable at times, as the first stalking scene in the under- construction segment is rather good, with the creepy setting coming into fantastic use, the action is really nice and the whole sequence works really nice as well as a really good sequence where he stalks her within the hotel room that is quite good and a little intense at times. These here are the film's overall best qualities as there's a whole lot of problems with this one that really hold it down. One of the main ones is that this one is just so tame as the kills are just done with a simple knife. To have them be singularly stabbings is where it really fails by not offering any creativity to the kills with this one since it's incredibly embarrassing to witness the kills in this as there's hardly anything to see when the stab-wounds aren't visible at all, merely marked by a small red dot on the article of clothing near the area where the knife entered. That's considering that you can even tell where the kill took place as most of the time this is edited in such a way as to make sure that the official killing method isn't determined so as to make sure that no one is really offended by this one. That seems to it's entire spiel, to be sure that no one is offended, as there's no blood or gore during the kills, the ones we can see are so tame a kindergartner wouldn't be offended at it, offers no nudity or sleaze despite this being about prom night for high-schoolers and features a resulting feel of just being so completely tame and harmless that it's really almost enough to knock it down because of that. Another problem is a completely glossed-over back-story that really doesn't do much of anything to explain rationale, motives, or anything at all. Rather, it's just explicitly stated as being a crush and the one time something could've been done with it, the keeping of journals with photos and thoughts about her, nothing is done. It's a grand missed- opportunity to really give this one something to it, and it fails on that mark badly. The last big flaw to this one is the fact that the never-ending series of utter stupidity presented from everybody here. The characters' constantly go wandering off by themselves to investigate the disappearance of their friends, all of which is done at the exact same area which makes them really stupid, but the biggest ones goes to the police for failing to inform others of what has happened. That should've been top-priority once news leaked of the escape, yet that doesn't happen and really makes them look foolish once this happened. All of these here lower this one considerably.\n\nRated PG-13: Violence and Language."

He was locked up for that only to break out of the insane asylum and travel 2300 miles to try to reclaim Donna on her prom night. The only real protection Donna had was Detective Winn (Idris Elba) who could only do so much.\n\nWhat we got was typical high school movie drama interspersed with some tempered killing to maintain that sacred PG-13 rating (which did the movie no favors). \"Prom Night\" began as a loud whisper and ended with a faint whimper."

The movie starts with the killings of a family of a young girl named Donna who later rakes up most of the attention of this poor movie . The killer is a deranged highschool teacher obsessed with this half chubby girl Donna and he finds his way to escape from the prison where is sentenced . He is even shown how he manages to flee from the prison and ends up at the hotel of the prom Donna attends with her friends. The cop who was into the investigation of the case is alerted of this prisoner's running away from the clutch of the authorities and he throws the fit of a kid and rushes to the house of Donna and he sees his family and tells them the escape of the killer .He later goes to the hotel where Donna is celebrating her prom and the poor storyline takes up most of the attention .\n\n1- The cop never asks the hotel of the surveillance cameras which are most likely used by the hotel .\n\n2- the janitor is killed and her whereabouts is found by another janitor who is also killed right after he has seen the female janitor's dead body .\n\n3- there are no floor cameras the cop wonders to ask to the receptionist.\n\nI can count more incoherence but i am really not going to waste anyone's time reading these clich\u00e9s.

        "review_detailed_main": "OK, I gave this a 5, on the basis that I watch 30-50 horror movies a year so believe I have a fairly balanced view on what makes a good and bad horror flick.\n\nI have seen many terrible films in the genre recently and whilst this one offers little which is original, it's not a flawed as many of the others.\n\nIt is relatively enjoyable but falls short in some departments - e.g. there is no real mystery at all in this horror film. That alone is quite unusual for a horror flick involving teenagers and school kids etc.\n\nOn that note the casting is bad. I mean its not unusual for directors to cast actors older than they actually are. But this film cast near actors who looked near 30 to play teenage prom kids. It really did detract from the look and feel of the film.\n\nThe other note on casting is that strangely the main killer is very good looking. Whilst many horror flicks involves a creepy mask and so on, this guy is not creepy at all to look at. Very strange indeed - and even though I am a hetero sexual male it made me very unphased by staring at this killer who is meant to freak me out. It simply didn't. I was even contemplating how 'cool' his look was.\n\nWhilst there are obvious flaws in \"why didn't she do this and that\" throughout they are by far not that noticeable compared to other similar horror flicks.\n\nI was quite surprised this film received a 3 overall. I thought it deserved at least a point or two more than that.\n\nI'd comfortably give this film a 5. Merely for the fact that although its not original in story, it does follow a strange pattern where what you expect to happen half way through doesn't entirely happen. Without spoiling it I'll leave it at that.\n\nWorth it if you are under 30 and like films like the craft/urban legend. If you are older you may find it a little hard to swallow being more mature and all."

        "review_detailed_main": "The problem with Prom Night is the same problem that so many remakes have. Relevance (or lack thereof). They're so busy trying to keep you distracted from the lack of a sensible plot that between jump scenes (albeit well done ones, at times), they forget to tie things in. Random bits of plot are thrown in to keep you from wondering what exactly the point of the movie is, or what it's even trying to say, or why you care are all. There were a dozen times during the movie where, had the director not been afraid to push a little further, he could have done something that wasn't so ... well, predictable. Maybe, in the future, McCormick should stick to directing TV shows.\n\nYou have to feel bad for Brittany Snow who tried her best, but clearly wasn't given too much to work with. Then again J.S. Cardone did write The Forsaken and Wicked Little Things; both similar to the remake of Prom Night in that the plot didn't push where it should have, or pull back where it should have. Good original concepts, but without that edge they became just a few more dime-a-dozen, poorly executed movies with decent make up effects (or CGI, as the case may be).\n\nI will give the movie a few points for the few properly executed jump-shots (even though I have to take said points away for the many many painfully obvious and predictable ones) and for the good filming. Also, props to Johnathon Schaech for his creepy intensity (but then again he was also one of the few saving graces in The Forsaken)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, it's a raining day and I had nothing better to do so I did what I've been avoiding\u0085watching this movie.\n\nAfterwards, I read the IMDb reviews and was somewhat shocked at all the negative reactions to the film because it really wasn't that bad. Most of the negative reviews were about the LACK of blood and gore in the movie and how that was a betrayal of the \"genre.\" Apparently to some, the \"slasher genre\" requires a certain body count as well as a certain \"yuk\" factor in order to be valid.\n\nThere's no question here that the film makers are trying to \"break rules.\" I like that. Out the gate, I'd give them a 5 for trying to do something different and trying to change the genre. That's what \"Scream\" did. It changed the genre and reinvented it.\n\nFirst broken rule, as noted, this isn't a \"blood and gore\" flick. They've specifically minimized that which is apparent from the PG-13 rating as well as the opening scenes. Those wanting more should have walked out at the opening (or shut off the DVD). There's no sense waiting for something that isn't going happen.\n\nThe second rule that's broken is that the killer doesn't invisibly sulk around the fringes of the film while committing his mayhem. In fact, the physical appearance of the killer is very much a part of the unfolding story. To further this, they've even cast a \"hottie\" as the killer; someone whose screen presence is more likely to delight rather than cause fear. This is a very significant deviation from the expected.\n\nAnother rule that was broken was that bodies weren't discovered until later in the movie. This means that our \"core characters\" don't wander off in the face of danger. Of course, they still wander off to their fates, but not with the usual setups. Instead, they event some equally implausible setups to bring the killer and victims together.\n\nHowever, that's where the rule breaking ends and the regular genre rules come back into play.\n\nThere's the usual \"false jump\" shots where something could happen but doesn't.\n\nThe cops are only marginally competent and end up being simply more \"cannon fodder\" for the killer/stalker.\n\nThe worst though is that there is no character development. The teens are all just \"eye candy.\" There's nothing special about any of them and they are all interchangeable. You can go down the checklist of possible characteristics and find only the expected. There's the \"going off to college\" conflict(s). There's the \"who is going to be Prom Queen? There's the horny teens going off to propose marriage/have sex. Even the main character has only one individual characteristic in that the killer tried to get to her before. But, beyond that, she's a vacuum. The stalker/killer also has no character. He \"wants\" Donna (our main character) but we don't really know why which would actually seem to be critical if want any kind of believability.\n\nAs such, I don't think the film makers have advanced too far in challenging the genre. They've made some positive efforts but have fallen way short of making something different and unique. A few more steps in new directions could have given us our \"next generation\" for the genre. Instead, we'll have to wait for someone else to finish those steps."

I never saw the point in them remaking the original because the underrated 80's slasher film itself was on a decent level and it wasn't anything special at all. Sure it brought another slasher to the table but still. It didn't need a remake because it's an untouchable classic like \"Halloween\" or \"The Omen\". It didn't need a remake because there was nothing to improve on at all! The remake is a totally different film and serves no purpose to the original at all. It sucks and it just sucks. People who love the original (not like me) will be gutted if they see it. The remake basically stars cheap actors and then there's Britney Snow. The remake's story is departed from the original as well.\n\nThis girl's parents get killed by an overly obsessed teacher who wants to be with the girl dearly. He gets taken to prison and that's that. A few months (I don't know) how many what ever's later she is going to her senior prom with here boyfriend. The teacher manages to escape and he follows, stalks and kills his way through the Prom to get to her.\n\nI hated this film. The minute I got watching, the minute I wished I had turned it off. I mean why???? It didn't need a remake because the original was so good, just mentioning again it didn't need the remake because there is nothing to improve on. Remakes are purely done these days for money and not for improving on. Out of 100% most of them are OK but never improve on the original movie.\n\nThis was just crazy. The CGI-effects were put to good use and serve no purpose. The actors are crappy and I was disappointed with Britney Snow's performance here. She did so well in \"Hair Spray\" but here, my gosh she was awful. The killer is not imitating nor is he scary. A guy in a baseball cap and a suit does not make for a scary killer. Many kill scenes are done the same and they are laughably boring. There was no suspense build up at all.\n\nOverall, the original was a decent/average film which was actually watchable. Here, it's definitely not the case. Here there is no improvement. They should have put so much more effort into this remake. When you do a remake, you are trying to improve on the original. That's what I would do if I chose to remake something (which in most cases I would never do that). Like the \"The Fog\" remake, it is a wasted shred of film, and deserves to be forgotten. It does absolutely nothing to improve on anything and doesn't even make for a better story! 0/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Three years after Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) survived a home invasion by a former teacher, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech), who became psychotically obsessed with her, Donna now lives with her aunt and uncle and coping with lingering trauma from the event. Donna is now looking forward to her attending her high school prom with her firends and her boyfriend at the luxurious Pacific Palace Hotel, but unknown to Donna Richard has broken out of jail and now seeks to finish what he started spurring Detective Winn (Idris Elba) to action to try and stop him.\n\n2008's Prom Night followed a wave of remakes spurred by the success of Michael Bay/Platinum Dune's remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre which became a sleeper hit and encouraging remakes of other classic horror films (House of Wax, Friday the 13th, The Fog, etc.). In Prom Night's case, the film was an attempt Neal H. Moritz' Original Film and Prom Night rights' holders Aliance to reboot the long dormant Prom Night series for the modern era. While the Prom Night was a respectable hit at the box office back in the day owing mainly to being one of the earliest in the wave of films that made the 1980s slasher glut, retrospective reviews haven't look back as fondly upon the film as Friday the 13th or other contemporaries. I myself didn't hate the movie and appreciated some good performances and a well done third act finale, but most of the original Prom Night is a meandering bore as we wait a really long time for four people involved in a prank gone wrong years ago to get their comeuppance as the movie impotently tries to throw us off with Red Hearings that mean absolutely nothing since a flashback sequence that begins the movie makes it painfully obvious who did it and why. With that said, there was a decent enough foundation for a remake to tackle the same material and do it better, but unfortunately not only is Prom Night '08 an \"in name only\" remake, it doesn't even put the name to good effect stripping away even the good elements that made Prom Night worth viewing.\n\nFrom the opening frame of Prom Night '08, the movie makes the wrong impression. Playing an angsty remix of \"it's the time of the season\" overlooking idyllic pacific Northwest coastal towns the movie let's you know it's from the same production house behind films such as The Skulls, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Urban Legends sporting an overly polished look that makes the film feel like the teen drama pilot for The WB rather than a horror film. Even when we do get to the opening horror the movie undercuts itself in two ways by 1) putting it in the extremely predictable framework of a dream sequence and 2) a PG-13 rating that can't allow any visceral impact. Even when taking the horror out of the equation the movie is obnoxiously loud, vapid, and over cut as many times it feels like a promo fro an MTV reality show collided with a music video. The movie's over usage of angsty pop and stuttering club beats might have been forgivable if it was diegetic sound that made up the Prom, but no, from the get go these music choices are hard coded into the soundtrack for the audience to hear and not the characters. This is one of many missteps the movie takes as it feels like it's a teen drama trying to fight against being a horror film.\n\nThings aren't much better character wise. Brittany Snow's Donna is supposed to be suffering from PTSD (and also recently off her anxiety medication for reasons frankly too stupid to go into) but throughout the film she seems perfectly fine gabbing and giggling with her friends, hanging out of limo rooftops, and attending a prom that is so overdone complete with bouncers and red carpet that even most award ceremonies would challenge it to \"tone down\". Aside from our inconsistent lead, the movie's group is filled with all manner of characters who are either bland, stereotypical, or one note. The one bright spot in the movie is Idris Elba as Detective Winn who brings his usually A game of relaxed masculine charisma that makes him such an appealing presence, but he's basically a glorified plot device who isn't allowed to act and put a stop to everything because if he did the movie would only be about 30 maybe 40 minutes long if he did.\n\nProm Night is an awful and vapid movie. It takes a mediocre but serviceable 80s slasher film and replacing anything that worked from the original with sanitized PG-13 kills, erratic editing, and an idiot plot that would be over if the characters had two brain cells to rub together. While not the worst from this period of horror remakes, it still can't even justify its own existence."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoyed Prom Night (2008), then I feel bad for you. Because you have been lied to throughout your undoubtedly short life by many people and institutions. Mostly though, you've been lied to by yourself. This is less of a movie and more of a giant commercial for everything that is wrong with our dying nation. This crap-fest has nothing to do with the mildly enjoyable predecessor that it shares the same name with. Other than the name \"Prom Night\", the only thing it has in common with the original is that there is a prom. Only now, Proms apparently are more glamorous that any Oscar celebration and there are no long fat people or kids with acne in high school. Plus, money is no object for the most annoying characters you'll ever endure. Never have I rooted more for a killer in a horror film. They spared us any suspense by showing us who the killer is in the first 4 minutes of the film. From there on the viewer is subjected to painful dialog and unbearable music that fills each ocean of time between the letdown killings. Everyone in this turd acts embarrassed to be there, as they should. Any evil person or group to churn out crap like this onto the public and stamp the name \"Prom Night\" on it should hang there head in shame at the disservice they have imposed on their fellow humans. The way this movie sucks so effortlessly is a reflection of how the United States is fast slipping into the footnote of history. Prom Night (2008) is a simple reminder that all is lost and that we deserve the demise that awaits us. After watching this, I realize that we are now one step closer to oblivion. I hate this movie. Not even God can help us anymore. Prom Night (2008) will forever scar my brain with its putrid and unyielding assault on everything that is good in this world. Hunting down and destroying every last copy of Prom Night (2008) may not undue the damage that it has inflicted upon our universe, but it is a start that may protect future generations from such careless and irresponsible film-making."

He doesn't belong here and every scene he's in draws stark contrast to the mediocrity everywhere else.\n\nI really wish more of this movie had been from his perspective. The hardened, intelligent cop chasing the killer a la Se7en. Would have been a vast improvement to this, whatever this was. But we live with what we have and in this case it's not a lot. Can only imagine slasher diehards getting anything from this, not really worth everyone else's time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Anyone bored with mediocre horror films had better get used to them. Even this film made some good money. With its PG-13 rating, and millions of parents looking to get their teens out of the house for a couple hours, this film couldn't miss. Thank goodness I saw this film at home and not in the company of a hundred or so teenagers in a theater...\n\nI guess this is a remake of an old Jamie Lee Curtis film from the early 1980s. Oddly enough, I've seen just about all of those old horror films a million times each, yet I don't recall seeing that one. Hard to imagine it was any worse. The story here deals with a deranged former teacher breaking out of prison to murder a teen on her senior prom night. It seems he killed her whole family 3 years earlier in some bizarre effort to win her over. Honestly dude, I don't think that was the best way to go! The girl is played by the fetching Brittany Snow who may or may not have a decent career ahead of her. I liked her performance, actually. She and her classmates are having their prom at a swanky hotel in the Portland area. One thing that struck me is the supposedly most bitchy (think Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls minus the talent) girl in school had her dad pay thousands of dollars for the whole thing. Apparently in an attempt to get the prom queen crown rapped up for his daughter. Anyway, that would be a hell of a generous gesture for anyone to do for a senior class. Yet the protagonist kids still rip on her at every chance.\n\nThe killer in the film is played by Jonathon Schaech, a man whose career once looked brighter than it now does. Recall him as Jimmy from That Thing You Do? He was the arrogant band leader and boyfriend of Liv Tyler. He dated Christina Applegate in real life for years. Any way, in the opening scenes of this film he is a dead ringer for one of those Geico cavemen. Later on, once he's broken out of prison and killing the teenagers, he has cleaned up a bit. Only now, he's a dead ringer for Billy Bob Thornton whenever he wears a baseball cap!! You have to see it to believe both resemblances! The kids and hotel staff are picked off in a series of predictable and not the least bit gory scenes. Really nothing scary about the film, you just might have a bit more trouble than usual predicting who lives or dies.\n\nSome random observations...... Did I hear a product plug for Midol?? Do most maids clean rooms during prime time hours? There are at least two early scenes where our killer finally has the girl of his dreams all alone in the suite and does NOTHING with her!! Uh huh. He's been obsessing for how long? How many films have we now seen the dead detective in the car outside on the stakeout? Let's see.... Black Christmas, Tightrope,... help me out here, people. It's only one of the oldest clich\u00e9s ever. Watch if you must. I had to, because like the dirty older guys in the elevator, I find high school girls delicious! 5 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think sometimes it's fashionable for everyone to hate, or at least state they hate, a film. A couple of years ago it was 'I Know Who Killed Me' and with both these films, I watched them with an open mind and found them both to be fun. entertaining and stylish movies, that really didn't deserve the critical bashing they got.\n\nNo Prom Night doesn't resemble the original- but if there's one thing Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake taught me, a remake that sticks too closely to it's source material is more interesting in concept than execution. It's the same with US remakes of East Asian horror- while most people are raving about how fantastic The Ring is, those who have seen the original are bored by it's uninspired retelling. I want people to take the source material and roll with it, I want new ideas, a completely new take- because if I wanted to watch the same film twice, I'd replay the original, not venture out to the DVD store. Perhaps this is the reason I was very impressed by Rob Zombie's Halloween- well at least the first half.\n\nProm Night reminds me of the slasher films I fell in love with during the 90's- horror was given a boost after Scream and fun, hip films like I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and, to a lesser extent, Urban Legend were out in cinemas, and for a teenager who grew up on horrors, it was heaven. Prom Night is a tight film, with likable characters, breezy dialogue, some slick cinematography, and some genuinely tense moments. There's so much horror out there that drags on, perhaps under the misplaced belief that it's building tension, but this film hits the ground running, and keeps going.\n\nIt's not especially original, some of the shots of the Prom Night partiers feels a little bit too music video which comes across as trying too hard to be cool, but the film kept me watching, and interested all the way through.\n\nWith regards to the gore, this film doesn't need it. I watched the unrated DVD, which apparently only adds a minute of blood splats here and there, but even without this I don't think this film would feel neutered- because this film isn't about gore. It's not like the DVD of My Bloody Valentine I watched recently, where the cuts to gore were so apparent that the film felt like it had lost something important- like I was watching the shreds of what was left after a major edit.\n\nProm Night was never made to depend on gore to draw it's audience in- you get a coherent fun little film despite this. And at a time when so many horror films rely on gore, torture and sadism, it's nice to have a film that almost feels like a more simplistic, even innocent, entry into the genre- one where you want the girl to survive, not wondering what gruesome way she can be murdered."

This movie is directed by Nelson McCormick (The Stepfather, 2009) and stars Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect 1 & 2), Idris Elba (Thor), Johnathon Schaech (Ray Donovan), Scott Porter (Speed Racer) and Brianne Davis (Jarhead). The storyline for this picture is very straightforward and fairly cliche. The kill scenes are also mediocre and lack gore and intensity. This film has a great cast but they're underused and suffer from a script and storyline that's underwhelming. This film for being a remake of a classic is disappointing. I'd score this a 2/10 and recommend skipping it."

To me, this 'horror' flick turned out to be a crappy teenage movie, something 14-year-olds would watch with their boyfriends on a Friday night. The style itself reminded me too much of movies like \"My Life as a Teenaged Drama Queen\" or \"Bring it On\", and in my opinion horror movies shouldn't even be near that genre. If I were anybody, I'd stick with \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". At least those provided good scares."

        "review_detailed_main": "As far as the genre goes, this is hardly the worst movie to watch out there. But just like its original it's also far from the best. It's not very original and it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do and be, which strangely enough was also something that the 1980 original movie suffered from, even though both movies are very different from each other in story and approach.\n\nThis movie basically has very little to do with the 1980 movie \"Prom Night\", which starred Jamie Lee Curtis. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing though. The original movie also really wasn't a great one to begin with. It's basically only a sequel in name and only basically uses the idea of letting murders take place during a prom night. The story and all of its characters are totally different and so is the killer, which is not a good thing though.\n\nThing about its killer is that we know who it is. We see him commit all of the murders and we even know what his motivations are. So there is totally no mystery about it who is the killer in this movie, which already takes away lots of the movie its tension as well. It besides isn't a very strong villain. He doesn't act very smart and only seems to unnecessarily get himself into more trouble when he needlessly kills lots of people. The actor besides didn't impressed me, as did none of the actors in this movie really.\n\nIt's one of those movies in which a bunch of teenagers get portrayed by people in their 20's. They are over-the-top ridiculously beautiful and perfect and are all oh so friendly all of the time. The characters were all quite annoying, though I must admit that I kind of liked Kellan Lutz in this, though his role is extremely small. All of the actors are kind of acting in this as if they are big stars already who are going to make it big time. I have some news for them; no one is going to know who you are in 10 years from now and no one knows who you are now either by the way. Except for Kellan Lutz, who I for some reason predict a great future, most likely in the action genre.\n\nThe story doesn't really provide the movie with much originality. The movie isn't really being a slasher, which should be a big disappointment for the genre fans but I have no clue as well what the movie is being. Not scary, not bloody, not surprising...I know what the movie is not being. It's a very clich\u00e9 filled movie that doesn't even handle its clich\u00e9s well. A lacking movie that can perhaps be best described as a teenage-thriller, without thrills and real teenagers though.\n\nBut nothing about this movie makes me say that it's a completely horrible or unwatchable one. It's lacking on basically every department yes, but nothing about it makes me hate this movie. Perhaps it's just that I have seen some far worse movies. But anyway, no, it's not a movie that I would ever recommend to anybody watching.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

When one of the detectives is detectives about Donna's case with her past teacher and her family, it's scary HOW infatuated he was with Donna and what lengths he would go to to be with her!! You would think that he would have somewhat of a mind to understand what a restraining order is and how to live by the rules but NO!!! Keeps going, gets locked behind bars, sent away to the looney bin; hopefully that would say something like: \"hey, I might be crazy but I can fix it if I work at it.\" but, he doesn't and gets the punishment he deserves.

        "review_detailed_main": "Seriously, this movie was nearly unwatchable. My biggest problem with this movie was just how absolutely atrocious the script was. The \"scare\" moments were laughably predictable. To be fair, I have no problem with any of the actors. Nearly all them were more than serviceable and I honestly had no problem believing any of them were teenagers enjoying their senior prom. I can't understate this enough... The acting and dialogue were pretty darn good. The strength of the performances were enough to lift this movie from a 1/10 to a 3/10 for me, but everything else about this movie just fails so miserably. All of the dramatic set up and so-called \"tension\" was forced and poorly constructed and it ruined any chance this movie had for working. I counted 3 occasions in which supposedly dead bodies suddenly became animated and just fell out of places. Is this thing a zombie flick? I understand the limitations that a PG-13 rating forces upon a movie, hence the liberal use of the cheap scare tactics, but that was the least of this movie's problems... It felt less like a PG-13 movie and more like a 13 year old wrote it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Gifted director Nelson McCormick has simply done an inspired job of bringing J.S. Cordone's brilliant screenplay to the screen. The shocks and thrills come fast and furiously from the very opening scene to the shattering climax. However, it is the sensitively observed portrait of a traumatized young girl going through a profound life transition that makes this motion picture so much more than a horror film. The film has its share of blood and gore but it never diminishes the development of the central character. A superb performance by Brittany Snow brings depth and humanity to her role of Donna Keppel and it is a deeply moving portrayal. Certainly a unique genre film as it departs from the expected and will surprise audiences in many ways."

You might think that the remake of \"Prom Night\" could not possibly be more hackneyed and predictable than the 1980 original \u2013 but you'd be wrong. In fact, there is not one original idea to be found in this film, neither in its storytelling nor in its filmmaking style.\n\nBrittany Snow plays the pretty blond teen whose entire family was massacred three years earlier by an obsessed teacher who, at the time, looked like only a slightly more maniacal version of Charlie Manson. Now, it's prom night and the killer, all cleaned-up and ready for action, has just escaped from prison, determined to finally claim Donna for his own (though whether he wants her alive or dead is never made entirely clear). Thus, as the revelers dance the night away in the ballroom below, an assortment of whiny, horny teenagers \u2013 and various hotel staff \u2013 meet their untimely ends in the poorly lit suites above.\n\nNelson McCormick's directorial style consists entirely of obvious point-of-view shots, false scares and images of people popping up in mirrors at inconvenient (though entirely predictable) moments. The greatest waste is that of Scott Porter and Idris Elba who are both so good in their respective TV series (\"Friday Night Lights\" and \"The Wire\"), but who have been given absolutely nothing of interest or quality to work with here."

People move around in corridors and rooms, where lights flicker, with the murderer lurking around in the shadows, and so there is suddenly a squeaky sound, and it's a big SOUND OF NOISE supposed to make you jump, but oh (!) it was nothing, but oh, wait, it was something after all, it was... the killer. Sadly the killer is one of the less effective I've seen in a horror film, mostly because you see his face all the time (a handsome face too), and he's a romantic at heart, and he uses a small, jagged knife that would look better on a cheeseboard table, and he wears a cap. When the killer and his chosen one battles throughout the latter parts of the film, they sound more like a married couple arguing. And the prom night dramatics are truly terrible, as we shuffle through kings and queens, slow dances, DJ music, partying and school nostalgia. This is bad American teenage horror."

In other words I haven't got the slightest idea why specifically this slasher deserved the remake treatment, but apparently it doesn't matter, as the new version is a remake \"in name only\". One could claim there definitely are some plot-similarities between the two movies, but then again, nearly ALL teen-slasher movies feature these prototypic characteristics. As dreaded but expected, \"Prom Night 2008\" is an incredibly redundant, politically correct and frustratingly routine new horror movie that contributes a great deal in giving the genre a bad reputation nowadays. The movie nonetheless opens mildly promising; with a modern reworked version of the song \"Time of the Season\" (the original sung by The Zombies would even have been better of course, but still\u0085) and some niftily shot images during the opening credits. Immediately after that, it's just a never-ending spitfire of dull clich\u00e9s, out of date stereotypes, painfully ineffective attempts to build suspense, bloodless killings, unsurprising twists and acting performances that are beyond amateurish. Johnathon Schaech is a good and versatile actor, but I haven't seen him star in a good film since \"The Doom Generation\", and somebody really ought to advise him to put a stop to his frequent collaborations with writer/director J.S. Cardone. Schaech's performance is the only remotely decent aspect about \"Prom Night\", as he depicts a former teacher with a deadly and permanent obsession for one of his female students. Three years before Mr. Fenton barbarically slaughtered Donna's family and swore to return before he was declared insane and got institutionalized. Now he escaped and heads straight for Donna's hometown, just during a night that should have been one of the greatest nights of her life\u0085 the Prom! The main problem with \"Prom Night\" (or at least one of the many) probably lies with the characters. You don't care whether they live or die since they're such fake and cardboard individuals. I mean, come on\u0085 The jock, the sensitive guy, the competitive bitchy girl, the gym teacher with lesbian tendencies, the obsessive cop, the rookie cop, the good-hearted aunt and uncle and so on. Perhaps if the film were intended as a parody the cast of stereotypes could have worked, but unfortunately everyone involved in the production takes this stinker dead serious. The PG-13 says it all in this case: goody-goody childish garbage without violence, guts or even a minimum of sleaze."

Instead, it instills boredom, disdain, and sheer anger that time and possibly money were spent watching this garbage.\n\nWhile the premise of 'Prom Night' is not the formula for a masterpiece, it actually had the potential to be somewhat scary and even a decent movie. A teacher becomes obsessed with a female student, murders her family, gets locked away, and escapes years later to return to terrorize her on her prom night. Unfortunately, the director, screenwriters, and actors appeared to make it their mission to throw away any hope of making something memorable. The killer is not menacing, the scares are poorly built up, and the actors are too bored to put in any effort.\n\n'Prom Night' is, to put it plainly, a mess. It's predictable, implausible, clich\u00e9d, and mind-numbingly dumb. This is the horror genre at its worst, and, for that matter, American cinema at its worst."
