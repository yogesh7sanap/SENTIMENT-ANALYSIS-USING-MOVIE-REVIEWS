        "review_detailed_main": "Satyameva Jayate 2 pulled a Marvel with its trailer. I actually believed that all three avatars of John Abraham existed together in the film. But sadly, that was all a farce. Milap Milan Zaveri returns with the (spiritual) sequel to his 2018 violent film; Satyameva Jayate starring Buy 2 Get 1 Free John Abraham, producer & actor Divya Khosla Kumar; who surprisingly doesn't sing for herself in the film and other irrelevant cast members who don't survive the triple Joh Abraham punch/slap/flex/spank.\n\nBalram Azad's (Papa Abraham) twins become the Home Minister (Homey Abraham) & a self proclaimed flamboyant cop (Flex Abraham). Together they battle corruption in the country. The sequel is basically multiple incidents stitched together and at the end we get a big reveal (which we saw coming a mile away because of the actor cast in that role).\n\nWe are all aware of the Buy Two Get One Free offer at our neighbourhood supermarkets right? When retail outlets try to get rid of their almost expired or expired stock. Well, think of Satyameva Jayate 2 as that expired, foul smelling, crumbling stock. Where Zaveri Sahab gives us three Abrahams for the price of Two.\n\nThe movie tackles the age old problem of corruption. For people who thought this movie would tackle it in a unique way; think again. It is the same old solution showcased incident after incident. It aims to be secular by covering all religions (albeit one); tackles poverty, intolerance and harassment.\n\nDivya Khosla Kumar plays the most cold blooded character till date as she doesn't bat an eyelid when her father is lynched/beaten to pulp in front of her eyes by a group of coordinated & disgruntled farmers.\n\nIf Milap Zaveri is making a third film in this franchise, then we will have two Papa Abrahams who are brothers, they both have a pair of twins, who also grow up to be Abrahams. So, we get 2+ 2+2 = 6 John Abrahams at the cost of our soul."

These two John Abrahams (actually three) manage to do what Captain America failed in by actually stopping an airborne helicopter and by also solving problems like corruption, communal dissonance, systematic malfeasance, sexual misconduct and whatnot by killing the culprits, hence by promoting aggressive vigilantism and instant summary execution as the only hope. I think Satyameva Jayate 2 should be inducted into the dictionary as a synonym for Hyper-jingoism. This film is so exaggerated in every sense that calling it ridiculously excessively would be an understatement and making sense of the plot is like wishing to find a strawberry tree bearing a mango."

Why your fans should tolerate this trashy film. And why the makers are still making movies like this in 2021?\n\nFrom the first scene of the movie, the makers have shown that it will be full of cringe scenes and shoddy screenplay. Watch it at your own risk. Everything is awfully bad in the film, insufferably poor writing, terrible direction, pathetic performances, and cringe-worthy dialogues.\n\nSome are like: Har gunehgar ko aisi maut maroonga ... ki agle janam mein maa ki kok se kya... baap ki top se bhi nikalne se darega.\n\nMera funda dandi nahi hai ... mera funda danda hai ... Gandhi ji ki hamesha jai ho ... lekin Bhagat Singh mera banda hai.\n\nJohn Abraham's triple role turns into three times more torture. Divya Khosla Kumar has no relation with acting. Potential actors like Harsh Chhaya, Anup Soni, and Gautami Kapoor are completely wasted. With the high-octane action sequences, over-the-top dialogues & loud background music, everything in the film is unbearable.\n\nSome scenes are insufferable and very hard to digest. John Abraham in his Kisan role triggers a mini-earthquake by hammering a plough into the barren ground \ud83d\ude00. Second John pulls the engine off of SUV with his hands \ud83d\ude1c. Third John lift the Bike with a person sitting on it\ud83d\ude1b. And in the climax scene, all three John come together and prevent a helicopter from taking off with their bare hands \ud83d\ude02.\n\nMovie Rating: Direction 1/5 Acting 1.5/5 Dialogues 0.5/5 Story 1/5 Screenplay 1/5."

But hell, it started with some bad doctor denying to treat a trauma victim. This was so 60's and 70's when the villains used to abuse the home physician at will. But unfortunately this hasn't changed even after 50 years! The script writers don't even do their research properly before making the so called blockbusters! Did they not know that in any doctor's strike in the country, which has unfortunately increased in the past few years for true reason though, the emergency services are never denied???\n\nAt least give respect to them who have laid down their lives during this pandemic, sacrificing everything. More than 1500 have laid their lives in the past one year and still you manifest them as evil. I realize there will be some bad elements everywhere, but do not victimize the whole profession for them!\n\nA Bollywood movie of this magnitude will alter pubic notion, who might in turn abuse some hapless doctor sitting in some remote hospital emergency, without security. Johny A wont come to protect them there!\n\nActors should be selective of the script they are playing a role in. Dear Johny sir, please don't do this to your hardcore fans!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Satyameva Jayate 2 review :\n\nA honest patriotic hero is bumped off and his sons take revenge with one of them turning in to a vigilante killer. That was pretty much the plot of the original Satyameva Jayate (2018) directed by Milap Zaveri. The moderate success of that film meant a sequel was on the cards and Milap recycles the same story in part 2. Only John Abraham plays all the three roles here - father and his twins who are all hyper nationalists and who scream more and talk less. Subtlety is not their family virtue, you see!!\n\nJuggling triple roles has never been a winning proposition for Bollywood stars - the late great Dilip Kumar failed with Bairaag (1976), Amitabh Bachchan's Mahaan (1983) met with an underwhelming response. So did the otherwise invincible Rajinikanth in John Jani Janardhan (1984). In all likelihood, Satyameva Jayate 2 too is likely to go that way if I consider the half empty Plaza Cinema at Dadar where I caught it on second day first show.\n\nThe script belongs to the bygone era when Manmohan Desai's logic defying mass entertainers were lapped up happily by the audience. Infact, the Sherawali song seems to be an od\u00e8 to Desai's Mard (1985). Everything from dialogues to action is over the top here. The new found pop patriotism is generously sprinkled in almost every scene with most characters talking in rhyming couplets reminding you of Kanti Shah's oh so bad that its good Gunda (1998) which marvelously achieved this cheesy feat. One particular action sequence in a hospital room turns unintentionally hilarious when John is warding off a dozen goons armed with swords with just one hand while donating blood from the other. \"Do Haath toh namard istamal karte hain taali bajaane ke liye\", he says. Phew!! And yes, the climactic helicopter sequence is reminiscent of Vijay Anand's Ram Balram (1980) and T. Ramarao's Insaf Ki Pukar (1987).\n\nOf the cast, John is first rate even though the writing doesnt support him. The actor deserves a salute for carving his own nich\u00e8 without any mentor or \"Godfather\" and making it on his own stead in this nepotistic industry. Trust me, this film would've been unwatchable without John at the helm. He lends tremendous credibility and dignity to most implausible situations. Kudos!\n\nThe gorgeous Divya Khosla Kumar makes a comeback of sorts as the main lead after eons. I remember liking her in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo (2004) and here, she not only looks pretty as always but also pitches in a competent performance. The other cast including Harsh Chhaya, Gautami Kapoor and Anup Soni are sincere as ever. Nora Fatehi sizzles the screen with her 'Kusu Kusu' item number.\n\nOn the flipside, the climax is slipshod and utterly unconvincing. It seems to be a hurried effort to just finish off the movie. As for that twist in the tale, even a school kiddo would be able to guess who the real villain is long before that person's evil intention is revealed.\n\nNever mind!! With all its pros and cons, Satyameva Jayate 2 is an average fare which will appeal more to those who grew up relishing the '70s and '80s cinema. This film belongs to that era. Only it has released forty years too late!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

It attempts to make up for that deficit with endless overdone action sequences, thuddingly heavy handed MESSAGES!!!(tm), and symbolism so glaring you could be two weeks dead and still notice it. (One brother wearing an orange shirt, the other one wearing a green shirt, and dead Dad wearing a white shirt... Seriously? I mean... SERIOUSLY??!?).\n\nAdd to this the fact John Abraham, although he is a decent actor, is by no means a good enough actor to pull off three separate roles in one movie. (You need Suriya for that). By halfway through the movie, you basically can't tell the three characters apart any more.\n\nI could go on, but other reviewers have pretty much covered the rest.\n\nLong story short: Don't waste your time with this crap-fest.

But, script is what lets this movie down completely. Entertaining movie for the actions but I wouldn't revisit it as the script and direction is just a last minute hotpotch of loads of different plots fromother movies that don't tie up. Bu John must keep doing good action movies and select a good script next time imo."

        "review_title": "John Abraham's Satyameva Jayate 2 Is A Tribute To 1980's Masala Fare !!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The only way Satyameva Jayate 2 takes ahead from its prequel Satyameva Jayate is by tackling corruption and greed for power. At the onset, writer-director Milap Zaveri and the film's team have maintained that it's a massy fare, like the popular cinema of the 1980s. When you see John Abraham turn into a vigilante to punish those who caused the death of innocent citizens, you're not as surprised as you are when you realise it's Satya who's handing out the death penalty, and Jay is being roped in to bring the vigilante to justice.\n\nMilap makes no effort to hide that he's paying a tribute to the 80s movies, and his pride in that is abundantly evident in the screenplay and dialogues - be it Satya calling the ACP to tell him that he won't stop punishing the guilty, Jay's introductory sequence or even Dadasaheb Azad (John Abraham yet again, as their farmer father) single-handedly ploughing a poor farmer's field, or the brothers wearing saffron and green, fighting each other in the pre-climax. All this and more only adds more masala to the meat of the story.\n\nBesides the menace of corruption, Milap addresses farmers' suicides, violence against women (Nirbhaya in Delhi, Veterinarian in Telangana), Lokpal Bill, the importance of communal harmony and religious tolerance in good measure as well. The writer-director also makes a telling comment on today's media and social media that focuses more on capturing news and sensationalising on the cameras and smartphones, even as someone is bleeding to death on the streets in broad daylight.\n\nJohn Abraham looks comfortable in this old-school, and far too often tried and tested commercial potboiler fare. Be it as the twin brothers or as the father, he plays his triple role with equal ease. If he shows a little restraint as Satya, he doesn't shy away from playing to the gallery as Jay or as Dadasaheb, a simple farmer leading the fight for the Lokpal Bill to the assembly.\n\nDivya Khosla Kumar is pleasant and has a fairly prominent part to play in this otherwise male-dominated movie. As the righteous Vidya, she minces no words when she disagrees and strongly opposes her husband Satya and her Minister father (Harsh Chhaya) on different issues. Gautami Kapoor lends due support as Dadasaheb's wife and Satya's and Jay's mother. Harsh Chhaya, Annup Sonii, Zakir Hussain, Dayashankar Pandey and Saahil Vaid perform their parts well.\n\nThe soundtrack is easy on the ears, be it the wedding song Tenu Lehanga or the Karwa-Chauth track Meri Zindagi Hai Tu, while Nora Fatehi sizzles in the Kusu Kusu number.\n\nThe raw hardcore action is the highlight of the film and John doesn't disappoint - whether he has to lift a motorcycle with a rider and fling it, or rip out the engine of an SUV, or even rip a few metres of earth by smashing his plough in a field. For action lovers, there are several seeti-maar moments to lap up. While we understand the film is a homage of sorts to the over-the-top cinema of the 1980s that we once relished, some scenes like three John Abrahams stopping the helicopter from taking off with their bare hands, could be a blow too hard even for the OTT sensibilities.\n\nIf you enjoy the massy masala fare of the bygone era and are willing to take on thrice as much of John Abraham in one frame, you can go indulge in this one."

These kind of movies should be banned otherwise it will lower the standard of Bollywood cinema. Take some lessons from south Indian cinema to respect the Indian Culture, people and keep your dirty politics out to fool people. I think Sensor board should upgrade their policies and make sure such movies are not allowed on screen. Show somet good stories."

She has been definitely a fantastic iconic role model that will create her impact. I loved the way she acted.\n\n4. Divya Khosla Kumar was one of the fine-tuning actresses who had left her stamp in the industry. Clearly a performance worth remembering for ages!\n\n5. The best movie to date I have seen in Indian Cinema. Such performances give you an essence of a class of pure theatrical nature. I have been loving to see this again today.\n\n6. Creation that makes you feel motivated all the time. I was in tears when I saw that scene of Divya being taken by the cops to the police station. Truly amazing!\n\n7. Never back down is the motive behind this film. I learned from Satyamev jayate 2 that we have to fight our odds every time we feel like being left out. Great work!\n\n8. Effortless acting throughout the movie! I believe the transformation by Divya Khosla Kumar was fantastic. She had prepared for this movie so wisely that the movie seems to be a hit.\n\n9. Let's watch this movie guys. It is a movie that teaches us how to tackle situations when everything is against us. Nothing works apart from your willpower and dedication.\n\n10. The director Milap zaveri has made through to the strong base of Indian Cinema. He is a gem of a personality who knows what kind of content everyone will love. You rocked!"

But finally good sense has prevailed and she has once again lit up the silver screen with her talent and beauty that is of the standard of Madhubala and Meena Kumari.\n\nIf not for Divya this movie would have sunk without a trace.\n\nThough Milap Zaveri and the producers of SJ2 deserve brickbats for making the audience endure this torture , they deserve bouquets for casting Divya Khosla Kumar and giving her a role in this movie.\n\nDivya is the only reason to see SJ2 and we hope that she gets a author backed role in her next film without the added weight of wooden faced heroes.\n\nThe film is worth watching only to see the competent acting skills of Divya Khosla Kumar."

        "review_detailed_main": "Movie - Satyamev Jayate 2 Source- Theatres Rating- 3/5 a total timepass IMDB 9.4/10 Genre- #Action #Thriller #Drama Audience - General\n\nMySpace Muvi Review- Satyamev Jayate 2\n\nAt times you like the good old popcorn but to get over the monotony, you like a cheese or caramel popcorn.\n\nLikewise John made a Parmanu which was applauded by critics but this one is a sheer tribute to 80s masala movies with a message for the country, it's just too loud.\n\nThe movie tells you about the blatant corruption in an entertaining way with whistles expected at every B&C centres and from not so shy fun loving crowd at A centres.\n\nThe original farmer John as in Dadasaheb is the one who stands for the public and instills the value in his twins Satya and Jai. The boys continue the crusade against corruption one as a home minister and one as an ACP. However night is their friend as one ventures to punish the wrongdoers in dark shadows.\n\nJohn is all over the movie and double fun as you have 2 oh wait 3 Johns in it . Someone who can take over the Salman's shirtless avatar or the strong Jatt Sunny, it's John. He is shown flaunting his body at every instance and looks a bit more shredded than usual. You can feel the crunch in his muscles and his veins flow like river streams.\n\nHis action is over the top, he is made to strip so much that even the girl victim who is apparently harassed, starts smiling looking at his six pack and crowd goes wow.\n\nMovie tackles the rampant corruption in the country albeit in a melodramatic way..The underlying concept of brothers, the solidarity and integrity of Muslims, the woman empowerment, the medical system, The Farmers, the adrenalised patriotism for motherland etc is all top loaded.\n\nCrunchy rhyming energetic film dialogues in every 10 mins is simply fun say this one where John stops fighting shirtless as National anthem is on n he says \"Tan Dhan Man se badhkar Jan Gan Man\" Mera funda Dandi nahi Danda Hai, Gandhiji ke bandar honge magar Bhagat Singh mera Banda Hai\n\nIf you like Fast and Furious, it's a fantastic ride with John breaking a table, pulling off heavy bells in the temple, taking off the whole engine from a car or lifting a bike with a guy on it, the man is in breakable and a powerhouse.\n\nBesides John, n other Johns , you have Divya Khosla a package deal with T Series. It is a pleasure to see some good actors like Zakir Hussain, Anup Soni,Harsh Chhaya, Rajendra Gupta and Rituraj in limited roles.\n\nThe new poster girl Nora is a sight to behold as she has the grace of Helen from yesteryears.\n\nIn terms of styling, one of the laziest movies, as the hairstyle of all the 3 Johns is the same.\n\nA mindless action movie high on adrenaline quotient and loud BGM..Enjoy the movie as one can't get bored when u watch a masala movie once a while.\n\nPro tip - Workout and watch it , you feel more pumped."
