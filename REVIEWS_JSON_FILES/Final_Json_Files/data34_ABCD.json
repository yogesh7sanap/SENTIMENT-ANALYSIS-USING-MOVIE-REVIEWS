        "review_detailed_main": "The acting is questionable and the story of this dance-centered enjoyable movie is ditto Hollywood flick \"Step Up!\"\n\nFor people who didn't get the first line, ABCD is a very good movie for dance lovers. Minus the aforementioned factors, it is a visual treat. And the 3D is very amateur, to be frank. But, who cares when we are really enjoying it. The 3D, actually spices up the dance moves and water splashes. Director Remo has justified at making a hardcore attempt on a dance film. The dance sequences are great and with oodles of style and motions, ABCD scores high! But, when it comes to the plot, acting, dialogues or even screenplay, ABCD fails, badly.\n\nBut, with a plot so predictable and feeble, ABCD is not serious cinema. Prabhu Deva is cool with his wacky moves but I couldn't find improvisation 'cause it gives you the old Television reality show look. More like a b-boy battleground this. Dancing has been little bit misinterpreted here. It has n number of plot holes and over that one gaping hole which could sink a ship. Clich\u00e9d, stylish, and subtle - that's what ABCD is. But, over all, I enjoyed it!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A must watch for dance lovers and a fine entertaining watch if you don't get serious with the plot or story or acting. For everyone else, there's Special 26.\n\nOVERACTING ALERT: Ganesh Acharya & Dharmesh Yelande!\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: No | Sex: No | Nudity: Very Mild | Violence: No | Alcohol, Smoking: No | Drugs: Mild"

        "review_title": "Remo is a Dilletantish Storyteller But A Virtuoso Choreographer; With A Committed Cast Who Give Honest Performances, He Gives Us A Mildly Yet Consistently Entertaining Work",
        "review_detailed_main": "Remo D'Souza is a dilettante in the art of storytelling. He isn't able to proficiently explain and construct his character motivations and narrative respectively nor is he able to write something truly novel. His films' themes are predictable and visibly repetitive, his plots have hardly any complexity and both his works are I believe borrowed from Hollywood ideas (his first feature film disaster 'F.A.L.T.U' was the Hindi version of a 2005 movie 'Accepted'). The only difference between his debut attempt and sophomore effort is that the latter has its heart in the right place for the obvious reason that the movie is all about 'dance' and not some faltu 's.h.i.t' (those who've watched Accepted will get the pun).\n\nYes, Remo D'Souza is a dilettante in the art of storytelling, but he is doubtlessly a virtuoso in the arts of dance and choreography and with the perfect theme to complement his talents, he is able to put up a mildly albeit consistently entertaining work that has a clearer vision and cleaner execution than his dismally wonky 'F.A.L.T.U'. His cast in 'ABCD' also has a major role in realizing his vision successfully, mainly because the actors who played dancers are dancers themselves in real life and so they are able to understand their characters and their struggles much easily without looking too artificial or schmaltzy.\n\nABCD, acronym for Anybody Can Dance, uses the classic theme of competitive rivalry with Jahangir Khan (played by Kay Kay Menon) the pompous, calculative and ego-maniacal head of a prestigious dance academy clashing with Vishnu (played by Prabhu Deva), the former head choreographer at his academy who quits after Jahangir relegates him to desk-job duties just to accommodate a new foreign choreographer. Jahangir's monomaniacal ambition is to win awards, name, fame, money and personal glory and he heedlessly crushes anyone who comes in his way. Vishnu on the other hand believes that the best man should win, and so he leads life righteously and encourages his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to do the same. When Vishnu moves in with his old buddy Gopi (played by Ganesh Acharya), he discovers immense latent potential in some of the youth there and makes up his mind to teach them everything he knows for free. The motley of youngsters is divided into two rival gangs, one led by Rocky and the other by D; Rocky's gang is less tapori (street) than D's gang, and they are the ones who readily accept Vishnu's offer. Slowly, Vishnu's team builds with D's gang joining in first, then a few others in the locality and lastly Rhea, the lead dancer of Jahangir Dance Academy who quits after being fondled by Jahangir during rehearsals. Both the rival groups enter a national dance event similar to the popular Dance India Dance show (most of the dancers in the movie are former contestants of the show) and try giving their best shot at winning the prestigious title, but Vishnu's group has to overcome many obstacles on the way.\n\nA surprising thing about ABCD is that its story is'nt flat. I liked the way they used Ganesh Chaturti as an important motif in the film and was impressed by the manner in which Jahangir and Vishnu's ongoing rivalry parallels with Rocky and D's. There is a scene towards the climax of the film when we realize someone from Vishnu's group has switched loyalty and joined hands with Jahangir's group, and here we are kept in suspense for about a minute where we are keen to know whether the person whom everyone suspense indeed turns out to be the Judas. Well, I do not intend to reveal the suspense which is surprising in an effective way, and the entire sequence leading to the climax is well shot. My personal favorite dance sequence is when Vishnu's group perform dressed as clowns after being told off in the previous round that they were only selected to 'entertain like clowns and get TRPs'. The movie does drag in the middle and I feel it is because the screenwriters didn't have much in mind about what to do with all these dancers and so they added some uninteresting and trivial subplots that don't really add up to anything consequential.\n\nThe thing that's helped a lot in saving the film is the cast, which is quite likable. Everyone in the theater except me knew the dancers since I'm the only guy who doesn't watch Dance India Dance, yet I smiled often at the cast's peppy presence and genuine attempt at filling their roles; it shows that despite being paid comparatively marginal fee and having zero or little acting experience, these dancers at least bother trying unlike those mega- stars like Salman and Akshay Kumar who've being doing every new role on autopilot. I felt throughout ABCD that Prabhu Deva really cared about the film, and this could be seen in his performance; he is no Gene Kelly, he has little of Kelly's suaveness and charisma but in this particular film, his lack of screen presence works to an extent as his character is supposed to be selfless plus he does compensate for that in his lengthy but exciting dance number. Ganesh Acharya's casual charm made him noticeable but he has got to lose some weight. The dancers all try hard, especially the guy who plays the alcoholic (but his solo creeped me out) and bubbly Lauren Gottlieb whom I instantly recognized being a fan of So You Think You Can Dance. Kay Kay Menon has the best part in the film, and he shines during the movie's resolution which I won't reveal!\n\nThe title ABCD reminds me of the Pixar film Ratatouille; while the former doesn't explicitly state the relevance of the title, the latter does and the quote, which applies to ABCD goes like this: 'not everyone can be a great artist(or dancer), but a great artist can come from anywhere'. I am satisfied."

        "review_title": "Watch it essentially if you love dancing and watch it as a must if you don't!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Exploring a new genre of dance movies in Indian Cinema (earlier tried in the 80s with DISCO DANCER, DANCE DANCE & more) ABCD straight away comes to the point in its first scene itself featuring a dance competition. And then it takes you on to an energetic dancing journey right till its explosive climax where Lord Ganesha is remembered in a spectacular show on the stage.\n\nTo finish with its weaker points first, story wise ABCD may not have got anything novel or fresh to offer but execution wise it does have many exclusive firsts in its kitty, especially for the viewers who share the same passion of dancing in their real life. The film has music, dance and expressions written all over it and it keeps moving around these three things only woven with all the clich\u00e9d plots already seen before on screen in various films.\n\nBut if it has nothing new to offer then what is so special about this film which forces me to rate it as an essential watch for every young at heart living in India?\n\nThere is in fact more than one answer to the above question and they are all mentioned below as the merits of the film intelligently called ANY BODY CAN DANCE which interestingly gets an abbreviation as ABCD.\n\n1. First of all this is a film in which you have \"The Indian God of Dance\" Prabhudeva(acting after a long time) playing the Master of Dance only for a group of enthusiastic students eager to learn from him. And when Prabhudeva is there as the maestro himself then you are sure to get some exclusive, unbelievable and jaw dropping dance sequences on the screen like never before.\n\n2. Along with Prabhudeva, ABCD has also got another popular dance maestro Ganesh Acharya playing a dance teacher assisting Prabhudeva as a true friend to achieve his desired goal. The lovable act of Ganesh straight away wins your heart as its not easy to accept such a side role, when one himself is running a professional dance academy and considered a Master of the art in his own industry. Displaying this appreciable sportsman spirit, its indeed a treat to watch the two masters together on the screen in one frame.\n\n3. The third merit of the film includes all its stunning stage performances well supported by a breathtaking choreography, innovative cinematography and a dazzling technical show which superbly shines in 3D. Director Remo shows a tremendous growth in his second venture made on his most favourite subject and he does come up with an impressive show with many worth watching songs and dance sequences lead by the grand finale saying \"Bappa Moreya\" loudly. The film features almost all kind of dance forms and is sure going to be a great watch by the young ones who are into learning the art seriously. Here though I missed an instantly likable composition with some catchy beats in its songs but still the soundtrack of ABCD (by Sachin-Jigar) successfully impresses the viewer while watching it as required. Particularly I loved hearing the track, \"Duhaayi Hai\" & \"Saada Dil Vi Tu\" which are both rendered and filmed quite well.\n\n4. Now after these key points, in my opinion ABCD's biggest USP is that it features almost all the winners/participants of the famous TV show \"Dance India Dance\" who became famous in their hometowns due to their amazing performances on the show.\n\nHere director REMO thankfully found that vision, courage and spirit to bring all his young contestants of the show together in his own film made on dance. Therefore I consider ABCD as a valuable example set by him in the industry by acting like a responsible mentor, giving them the much required chance to showcase their skills on the big wide silver screen. This young brigade in ABCD is lead by Dharmesh and Salman along with many other talented names who show a commendable confidence acting with stalwarts such as Prabhudeva, Ganesh and KK, who is simply outstanding as the cunning, ambitious owner of a renowned dance academy.\n\nAdmitting the truth, yes as a film script one may find ABCD just an average flick made with great passion, highly inspired from the STEP UP series of the west. But as a special project collectively made by all the masters of the art together along with the young talent picked up from their own TV Talent shows, I would like to rate ABCD as an important film of the current times which actually shows us a new inventive way of making interestingly appealing films featuring the fresh talent.\n\nSharing the experience of watching it in the theater, it was really great to see ABCD with a group of young dance students sitting in the row ahead, who were really enjoying each and every dance movement on the screen with their energetic shouts, whistles and comments.\n\nAnd while its final song was there (in the end credits) with Saroj Khan, Prabhudeva, Ganesh Acharya and Remo dancing together on the screen in one frame, I just had a thought that if me and these young students are enjoying so much watching these masters dancing together, then what a good time they all must have had in shooting the whole project like an unforgettable picnic lived away from all the worldly pains and discomforts...........following only one common mission in mind and that's the passion of dancing.\n\nSo as I see it, ABCD is a zealous and appreciable attempt from all the dancing maestros putting their own students in the front, which deserves to be looked upon with love & respect by one and all. In short, watch ABCD essentially if you love dancing and watch it as a must if you don't as it may open your mind towards one of the most precious gifts of nature, i.e. The Joy of Dancing\u0085\u0085\u0085Cheers!"

I knew there wont be any story, direction, acting, etc. But one thing that everyone will find in it is Choreography. Remo is good at it.\n\nSYNOP-\n\nActing- KK Menon very good acting, or an average one seemed so because no body else new what the thing is acting. All rest of the actors(i doubt they can be called so) deserve 1/10. Prabhu Deva needs to learn the diction first. Also his much hyped dance was looking awkward in front of others. He was good but awkward.\n\nScript and Story- Well, after watching this movie, any one will say \" What the hell is this thing called Script\" lol.\n\nDANCE- The only thing in this movie that can pull the show and Remo has really worked well in the choreography of Dance Sequences. And to those who say that it is inspired from step up, buddy all the Dance movies are one and the same. And so is this movie.\n\nAs i said DO WATCH-If u love watching Dance...\n\nDON'T- If u love watching Movies...\n\nAlso i would add that in-spite of being a dumb movie, this movie is going to do good business, all credit to its Wonderfully choreographed Dance."

All tries their best to act and does just enough justice in movie to make it digestible and fillers for dance sequences where they beat all odds.\n\nExpected story flow but great music and moves brings life on screen. Remo has just got it right amount of humour, few scenes can be edited but wouldn't make difference. Though having huge number of great dancers across the country he didn't add any guests appearances to get oohhs aahs from audience which tells us he knew what he wanted to present on screen.\n\nCasting has most of dancers from DID (most of them were first seen in Boogie Woogie), who are undoubtedly very disciplined and great dancers. Starting dance at home, taking it forward on street, accepting challenge of competing at bigger platform and finally making it in a movie with delivering all their best is something immensely appreciable.\n\nQuite balanced amount of performances for all characters like Dharmesh/Salman/Lauren/Puneet No one gets extra limelight.\n\nPrabhudeva fits into the character with decent acting, you know him for dance not for his acting and he is bloody best in it. Lauren Gottlieb was like bonus in a movie. Intelligent choreography and honest attempt for showing quality of Indian dance on cinema.\n\nGo for making yourself aware of where we are heading in dancing and what talent we posses. This one belong all talented dancers who has struggled and delivered over the years and open doors for many more.\n\nInstead of comparing it with Step Up series, call it as Indian version of step up and just enjoy the treat. We have more variety of music and dances, hoping sequels to come in future with more dancers like Shakti/Binny/Raghav and obviously little champs."

The only thing enjoyable here are the dance sequences and music, minus that we have a fill of poor acting, screenplay and dialogues. The story clich\u00e9d and predictable. The cheap 3D usage with all those pointing sticks and pipes was evident even if I saw it in 2D. Overall, if you ignore the elements of good film and just focus on the dancing you will have a good time. I mean, even I enjoyed watching the Prabhudeva light up the screen with his wacky moves! and Remo's choreography is always fantastic. Still, I cannot say ABCD is a good film.\n\nRATING: [2/5]"

        "review_detailed_main": "Even with all the considerable resources of color and choreography that Bollywood customarily brings to bear on its productions, \"ABCD: Any Body Can Dance\" has no more depth, maturity or sophistication than its American dance- film counterparts like \"Step Up\" and its sequel \"Step Up 2: The Streets.\" And it's a lot more cloying and lengthy to boot.\n\nPrabhu Deva stars as a mopey dance instructor - who can be a bit of a drama queen when things don't go his way - who takes on the task of whipping a group of high-spirited but decidedly undisciplined youngsters from the \"ghetto\" (which looks only a shade less affluent than Beverly Hills) into a presentable troupe in time to compete on an amateur TV dance program.\n\nIt's all pretty much paint-by-numbers as Vishnu (Deva) takes his charges through their various stages of readiness, with teeth-rotting cutesiness and thumb-sucking childishness the order of the day. The dancing's okay, I guess, but, I seriously think it's time for Bollywood to grow up a little and stop pandering to this apparent need on the part of its audience for emotional primitivism all the time. As one character, in a rare moment of honest self-reflection, says about the entertainment industry in India, \"Mediocrity is king.\" Truer words were never spoken."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have always believed that music has no boundary. After watching ABCD , my saying has changed and I would say that dancing \"pumps up your heartbeat , refreshes your mind and will make you forget about all the pain in life\". Any Body Can Dance is the bible for dancing which will entertain right from the beginning till the end.\n\nA brilliant choreographer is fired by his own company after they claim that his dance skills are old-fashioned. To prove his mettle , he starts his own company by hiring group of wanna-be dancers and even some local goons.\n\nDirected by Remo ( FALTU) , ABCD takes you by complete surprise with excellent presentation of dancing skills and beautiful choreography. Remo , being a great choreography himself, does a superb job as director making sure that film is made with universal appeal. The story line is strong with Prabhudeva being the soul of the film. Watch for him dancing extensively in the disco scene and you will know he is one of the best dancers in the country. Screenplay is tight keeping you engaged. Cinematography is eye-catching capturing the wonderful choreography with ease. Editing is crispy. Dialogues are good. Background score gels well with the flow of the film. However , I felt music could have been better considering it to be a musical movie. Barring tuneful \"Bezuban\" with wonderful picturization , other songs were average. Kay Kay Menon did fine job as a shrewd as Jahangir Khan. Other performance were nice.\n\nOverall , ABCD was heart-wrenching dance movie which will leave you spellbinding with excellent dance moves and eye-catching choreography. Excellent 4.5/5"

They really do disregard any attempt at a proper premise, instead putting full focus on dance. In fairness, that's all the majority who choose to watch this will likely want. Still, they could've tried harder with the plot; which hits almost every clich\u00e9/trope imaginable.\n\nThis might've made for a fun/silly 90 minute production, but at 136 minutes it's a very long watch - it proper dragged, for me anyway. I was OK with events until the ending, which is awful from a story point of view. That's unfortunate, as it is actually set up well with a hearty event - the performance for which is nice, but it quickly loses any momentum that it created from it.\n\nPrabhu Deva (Vishnu), while likeable, isn't lead-worthy in my opinion - he doesn't bring anything memorable or noteworthy to the role. Ganesh Acharya is alright to watch, he brings the amusement as Gopi. None of the dancers stand out, away from their dancing anyway.\n\nA disappointment in many ways for me, though you may like this if you're in search of a film filled to the absolute brim with dance."

Also, I did watch Special 26 it was great. But it doesn't have the unity factor that this movie aims to highlight and showcase."

The camera focus is not properly and cause a headache to me. In Some Part (in clip when Dill Se appears) it was too bad even worst in some dance steps.\n\nOtherwise movie is awesome and i will give it 9/10.

Hats off to director Mr. Remo D'Souza. Film is very vibrant, even the fight is colorful. Screenplay by Tusar Hiranandani is smooth. They slightly touched the sensitive issue of drugs also, which gels with script. Your eyes get moist in emotional scene and widely open to see their dance. Dialogues by Amit Aryan is very good. This film could have been very small but it is big in every way, rather it is in 3D, or cinematography, graphics. It has only lack that is star power but if you go in then you won't regret or feel need of any star. Performance wise Mr. Prabhu Deva is very impressive and emotive. Surprisingly Mr. Ganesh Aacharya is very good. His comic timings are just like any veteran comedian. He makes you laugh even without dialogues, only with the help of his expression. Kay Kay Menon is good. All other actors are very good but they are in lot so I am requesting to excuse me for not mentioning every one name but you all rocked guys. A person who performed in discotheque scene, in some robot style dance, is as good as Mr. Prabhu Deva , even in his brief performance. I would have loved if they invited some known choreographers as Judge in the dance show. Music and background score by Amit-Jigar is good. It keeps the film pace moving. Lyrics by Mayur Puri is good. Any Body Can Watch it and would love it."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: ABCD",
        "review_detailed_main": "You'd wonder why it took so long before Bollywood finally came up with its own dedicated film about dance. With dance incorporated into just about every film, perhaps that was reason enough not to have a movie that dwells within the confines of a dance premise, which the US has in its Step Up franchise and UK with its StreetDance equivalent. But the lucrativeness of these franchises mean untapped opportunity, so why not make one and dabble with the 3D technology as well? The result is the aptly titled ABCD - Any Body Can Dance, because if anything, every character here does show off a thing or two, of the rhythm within.\n\nAnd not to mention the success of the wildly popular Dance India Dance television series that also made that final push for box office potential, with some of the participants also making it to the film in leading roles. The storyline by Tushar Hiranandani is kept functional, and really simple. After all, all you need is an excuse to assemble a crew, and have them put through the paces in rehearsals and competition whether underground or official, to have highly choreographed item numbers to thrill the movie going audience. It begins with the rivalry within Jahangir Khan (Kay Kay Menon) and Vishnu (Prabhu Deva), the brains behind JDR, a dance troupe who is once again crowned champions in the nationwide Dance Dil Se competition, only for the former to kick out the latter through the employment of foreign talent.\n\nIt took a while before things started to pick up, because of the necessity for Vishnu to go through the motion of moping about what he should be doing, whether to go back to Chennai and continue teaching dance, or hang around in New Delhi to take another potshot at Dance Dil Se, with a vastly different crew. And helping him assemble something is good friend Gopi (Ganesh Acharyaas), although the members they finally get into their troupe are hardly any professional to begin with.\n\nLike any self-respecting dance movie, this is again the requisite characters necessary to impart values like teamwork, camaraderie, trust, loyalty, and more essentially, dance skills through various training montage. And having a rag-tag crew also allowed little subplots to creep in, such as romantic rivalries, parental objections to all things modern and deemed destructive to culture, envy, melodrama, and drug abuse even, that allows individual characters their respective share of the limelight, given so many supporting ones who will inevitably fall by the wayside.\n\nAs far as competition goes, we don't really get to see much of JDR in action, especially since they're progressively turned into a balletic outfit courtesy of their new choreographer from the US imparting something that's quite lacking in the imagination. After all, they're an outfit who are dancing to impress, moving away from Vishnu's, and their original philosophy of dancing to express. So we follow DDR for the most parts, in watching how Vishnu whips up a motley bunch into a well oiled machine able to take on some of the best, especially with its inventive choreography.\n\nWhich in truth belonged to the multitude of choreographers that Bollywood is no lack of, providing an opportunity to showcase various dance forms through DDR's execution and their march towards the finals of the Dance Dil Se competition. Even Prabhu Deva playing Vishnu has to put his foot where his mouth is, given once central spot before the interval to dance and demonstrate a thing or two why he is and still at the top of his game. Unlike the Hollywood counterparts, the camera-work and editing here all combined seamlessly in providing the audience with the best possible vantage point in which to observe the dance and dancers, and nary did any put on the wrong foot such that you'd miss something crucial to their movement. It's only a pity though that there's no screen in Singapore showing the 3D version, as you can tell that deliberate care has been taken to craft this for the 3D medium.\n\nWhile some dance choreography and sub-plots may have already been suspiciously experienced before in other films, there's no doubt that the key ingredient to the film's success is its ability to blend culture into dance, which will whip up any audience into a frenzy. And I suppose that is the key message, that while things we share and experience can be universal, culture is what will truly make a people stand out and differentiate themselves for the better. And in this case, if others can make a dance film, so can India, and doing it even better! For those venturing into dance movies fo the first time, ABCD should be on the top of your list, and for fans of dance movies, this is something you'll not want to miss!\n\nP.S. It's interesting to note that besides the Smoking is Injurious to Health warning at the start of every Bollywood movie of late that features scenes that have characters smoking, a little warning also appears at the bottom of the screen just when the deed is about to be done!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before watching this movie, I'd read some awful things about it that how it's nothing but a rip-off of Hollywood's Step-up movie franchise. I decided to watch it just the same as I am an avid dance fan, and let me tell you I'm really glad I did. Not to put the step-up movies down or anything, but of late they've become a canvass for showcasing done-to- death dance sequences without paying much attention to the story- line/script or even acting (case in point Kathryn McCormick as the female lead in the last step up movie, Step Up Revolution). This movie, although it started out like any other \"jilted-dance-teacher-changes- the-fate-of-some-down-trodden-dancers\" film, but as the story progresses, it develops into a moving and at times pretty funny film and you can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters. Some of the acting performances were extremely commendable especially Kay Kay Menon as the proverbial scornful yet comedic villain out to get the little guys, as well as Ganesh Acharya as Prabhu Deva's trusted and humorous side-kick. I was particularly amazed by Lauren Gottlieb's Hindi-speaking skills. For those of you who don't know her, she was a contestant on the American T.V series \"So you think you can dance\". At first I thought somebody had lip-synced for her, but then I found out I was wrong. Seeing as how she has no background knowledge of the Sub- continental culture or language, I thought she did a surprisingly good job. There were a couple of songs you won't be able to get out of your head,( \"duhayi\" and especially \"bezubaan\") not just because they're catchy but because their background story is so deeply stirring that they get seared into your brain. As far as the dance sequences themselves are concerned, they're nothing you haven't already seen in any typical Hollywood dance film. Save for a couple of solo performances like Rocky's (Salman Yusuff Khan)and especially Chandu's. I was also pleasantly surprised by the free- running/ parkour sequence in the beginning that was superbly choreographed and well executed. In short, this is one movie you won't be sorry to see, watch & enjoy...!"

There could have been no one other than Prabhu Deva who could have played the role of \"Vishnu\" with so much conviction. Kay Kay Menon was great as usual - Give this man anything and he can do it. For that matter Kay Kay is in a different league as an actor along with others like Manoj Baypayee, Nana Patekar, etc.\n\nIt is so good to see that all the others in the star cast managed to put up such great performances despite being new to the big stage of the Bollywood. It is surprising that some of them even managed to act better than our seasoned plastic faced Bollywood actors. Only if we Indians would give more value to acting skills rather than good looks then these youngsters would have a great career ahead of them. I firmly believe that good acting belongs to the theaters and films and good looks belong to the modeling world.\n\nOverall a good film and should be watched for the sake of all the great artists who put up a good performance in the film along with the film crew and the director."

I won't go into any detail here as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not seen the film yet. However, by typical I do not mean it is bad in any way. It definitely isn't.

It was vibrant, exciting, colorful, sexy, and superbly choreographed. If there's one thing a Bollywood film should be able to do well it is a large scale dance scene, and ABCD certainly doesn't disappoint in any way.\n\nAll in all a great movie that will prove a hit with anyone who loves a feelgood movie filled with dancing. It scores a well deserved 8/10 on both counts."

I find it very hard to express what I feel after watching this movie.\n\nHowever, since I'm writing a review, here are a few words.\n\nDancing: 10/10 This movie offers the variety and the quality. I could hardly point any repetitions, and that's says it all in a movie with so much great moves!\n\nStory: *can't grade a taste* Well, with that being said, I personally, really loved the story. It's not too original, but certainly shown in an interesting way. Moreover, I watched the whole movie \"in one breath\" (and it's about 2.5 hours long).\n\nCharacters: 8/10 I can't presume to know about the country and/or it's people, certainly not on a level to judge the originality or reality of the characters. Something I can say however is, Everyone will find someone to connect to. *lost 2 points simplicity for some semi-main characters.*\n\nTotal: *check whats in the summary (the title of the review)* As noted above, can't express with words. That in itself says something. Feelings. Isn't that what a good dancing movie is all about? If you love dancing.. And not afraid to feel - Give this movie a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n\nHave fun!"

        "review_title": "'Liberation' for India's film dancers \u2013 and choreographers!",
        "review_detailed_main": "For a nation whose film industries have traditionally thrived on lush use of dance in its cinema, it is honestly shocking how so few of India's movies focus directly ON dance. All too often, a choreographer's duty is to distract the audience from the fact that a movie's lead actor or actress cannot actually dance. Even when a lead actor can dance well, backup dancers are usually there just to provide colour and fill out the screen. The dancers are always there, but we do not 'see' them.\n\nThus \"ABCD Any Body Can Dance\" arrives like a breath of fresh air!\n\nHere dance and dancers take centre stage \u2013 not just as magic elements in and of themselves, but as a celebration of the power of art and dance to draw people together and transform lives.\n\nVishnu (Prabhu Deva), the longtime choreographer of India's most successful professional dance group, gets cashiered by his ambitious and domineering partner Jehangir (Kay Kay Menon). Vishnu's career seems over. He feels like giving up. But on his way out of town, he spends a few last days with an old friend, Gopi (Ganesh Acharya), a retired dancer who ekes out a small living teaching dance in a not-very-fancy neighbourhood. Through Gopi, Vishnu becomes impressed with the sheer raw talent he observes among an assortment of apparently dead-end street kids whose lives are limited by their inability to get along with each other, their parents, or anyone else. He volunteers to teach these kids dance for free, determined to change their lives through imparting Discipline, Attitude, New(ness), Confidence, and Expression. In the process, Vishnu manages to rebuild not just his own life and those of his students, but even his old friend and later nemesis Jehangir.\n\nSome of India's greatest living dance choreographers came together to make this film happen.\n\nPrabhu Deva himself, of course, is not only a celebrated choreographer (for instance, the National Award winning 'Main Aisa Kyon Hoon' straightjacket dance from \"Lakshya\" (2004)) and commercially successful director (such as \"Wanted\" (2009) and \"Rowdy Rathore\" (2012)) but also probably India's best pure dancer.\n\n(My biggest gripe? Tamil native Prabhu Deva's voice is badly dubbed, in a heavy baritone that suits neither this character nor his own personality.)\n\n\"ABCD \u0085\" is directed by famous choreographer Remo D'Souza, who also wrote the story.\n\nGanesh Acharya is so sincere and charming as Gopi in this, his acting debut, that he almost steals the movie. (The elephantine but surprisingly-light-on-his-feet Mr Acharya, despite his bulk, is best known for choreographing sexy item numbers such as 'Sheila' in \"Tees Maar Khan\" (2010) or 'Chikni Chameli' in the 2012 \"Agneepath\".)\n\nIndia's all-time most honoured choreographer \u2013 the legendary Saroj Khan herself \u2013 dances a cameo over the end credits with Mssrs Remo, Acharya, and Prabhu Deva. Terrence Lewis and Shiamak Davar also contributed to \"ABCD \u0085\" and are thanked in the opening credits."
