I don't have the energy to dissect the film scene by scene nor would anyone want that, but I actually did enjoy certain aspects of the film, what I enjoyed was its 'campy' improvised feel, and how it always manages to avoid clich\u00e9, and that even in the most unconventional ways. The film has the creators stamp all over it and when he encounters a snag or hiccup in the plot, be damned to those who disagree with how one should deal it, he plows through it and comes up with his own completely unique solution no matter how illogical it may be. This is film this is make believe, I don't care if it makes sense it is actually refreshing to see a little bit of 'weird' now and then. That is not to say that I wholly enjoyed the film, I found it to drag on and several times let myself be distracted by other things while the film played, it is no great film even in its badness, it is bad for sure, but there were more than a few entertaining moments. For instance, Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls, it is a movie about goblins, but hey whatever just a technicality eh? lololol."

When the Waits family swaps house with a family from Nilbog in the countryside to spend vacation, everybody is excited but Joshua since Grandpa has warned him that the place is evil.\n\nJoshua travels to Nilbog with his father Michael (George Hardy), his mother and his sister Holly (Connie Young) that invites her boyfriend Elliott Cooper (Jason Wright) to meet her and he also travels with his three best friends to Nilbog. Joshua discovers that the Nilbog is goblin written backwards and the place is the kingdom of evil goblins that want to eat them. But his family does not believe in his words.\n\n\"Troll 2\" is one of the worst movies I have ever watched; but also one of the funniest. On 31 July 2003, I became curious with the reviews of this movie and I decided to check whether it could be so bad; actually it is worse. The horrible and ham actors and actresses and the amateurish direction, screenplay, dialogs, effects and make-up are lame. Today I have just watched it again and it was good to relax and laugh in a Monday evening. My vote is two.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Troll 2\""

        "review_detailed_main": "This is it, folks: the worst movie ever made.\n\nI know, I know, there are many who argue that \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" are worse \"films\" than this one. Well, I'd advise those people to give \"Troll 2\" another viewing, this time with an open mind. As something of a self-made authority on the worst of the worst in modern cinematic torture, I feel qualified to make the bold assertion that \"Troll 2\" is the cream of that particular crop.\n\nFrom its laugh-inducing soundtrack (apparently recorded using only a vintage 1980s Casio keyboard) to its unilaterally awful acting, \"Troll 2\" is a life-changing experience, similar to the Middle Ages' trials by fire. If you succeed at ingesting this festering piece of cinematic detritus in one sitting, you will emerge a new person, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The watching itself may be painful, but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say, with conviction, \"I survived 'Troll 2,' and I'm still technically alive.\"\n\nThe special effects in this movie are, indeed, special -- like a one-legged blind woman with Alzheimer's. Trivia: one of the various Emmanuelles from the infamous \"Emmanuelle\" series of soft-core porno movies designed this movie's pitiful costumes. That should give you some indication of their quality.\n\nThe acting -- my God, where do I start? Suffice it to say that, if you set any cast member on fire, I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt. They're really that bad. More trivia: One of Elliot's \"boys\" in this movie would later go on to reprise his role (Disposable Character in Bad Movie) in the Lou Diamond Phillips classic \"Bats.\" Even more trivia: The father in this movie was a local dentist, and most of the extras were bona fide Utah residents, as well. Talk about low-budget.\n\nBack to the soundtrack -- There's not a single scene in the movie where the music is appropriate to the on-screen action. I get the impression that the \"composer\" employed for this stinker was, in fact, a failed auditioner for Def Leppard's still-vacant keytarist position. Seriously, it's rare, even in straight-to-video dogs like this one, to hear music of this woeful caliber.\n\nWhat more can I say that hasn't already been set forth in previous reviews? This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that's saying something. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to watch this film -- I recommend doing it alone, at least the first time you see it...that way, you can concentrate on its truly majestic badness -- and on feeling your brain cells die off, one by one, until you are no longer able to speak.\n\nGood luck to you, if you decide to watch this one. It doesn't get any worse than \"Troll 2.\"\n\nADDENDUM (October 2007): This is still the worst movie of all time. Its status as such will never change. \"Troll 2\" is simply the perfect storm of bad writing, casting, direction, cinematography, costuming, score, makeup, effects, acting, editing, and inspiration.\n\nUPDATE (June 2010): I just watched it again. Alone. In one sitting. God help me, some component of my brain must be fundamentally defective.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT (September 2013): This film continues to alter the life of each man, woman, and child with the good fortune/taste to bathe in its glory. I could not recommend it more strongly.\n\nCODA (February 2021): This magnum opus infests my soul still. Daily, I am haunted by its indelible essence. I will never escape."

        "review_detailed_main": "You often hear of movies that are so bad that they're good. It's hard to point to a single movie that is like this though. What some may say is \"so good it's bad\" may come off to others as just plain bad. However, everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie has agreed: Troll 2 is so horribly, shamelessly bad, that it is good.\n\nThe writing for film is more than awkward (take the redundant \"Stonehenge Magic Stone\"), and the character dialogue sounds so incredibly unnatural they might as well be robots. The reason for this is because the man who wrote the script and directed it, Claudio Fragasso, is a native speaker of Italian. He wrote the script in English when English was (barely) his second language. The acting is absolutely terrible, but who can blame them? This was most likely the first (and last) film any of these actors have been in.\n\nThe costumes and special effects have that wonderful B-movie quality to them. While there are many blaringly obvious errors, I find that the smaller ones are actually funnier. Actors shaking when time is supposed to be \"frozen,\" or flies on their face during the climatic scenes. There are so many continuity mistakes that I sometimes found myself wondering if the director was putting them in on purpose. It was like every time the camera shot changed, the crew completely forgot how the previous shot was set up, and had the actors give their best guess on where they're supposed to be.\n\nI think everyone needs to see at least a few horrible movies in their lifetime. Troll 2 is entertaining and hilarious, especially when watched with friends. The plot is ludicrous, but at least you never know what's going to happen next. Many scenes seem completely unnecessary, and this film simply does not bother to justify any of the things that happen in it. The end result is a horror B-movie that ends up being so horrible that you can't help but laugh. The only question I find myself asking now is do I give it a \"1\" because it was so bad, or a \"10\" because it was so good?"

Personally, I could not get up from rolling around on the floor, nor the people I was with, although they had it worse, as they kept falling off the bed. Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles, which could well be true. Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film. Or when they made it. Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production. Just possibly. Anyway, it is hilarious. I got my DVD copy for \u00a32. That says it all really I would say. Watch this film if you want to see: neon-coloured food, children in masks and dressed in sacks charging around a forest set to a dodgy 1990-theme, awful make up, worse acting, even worse dialogue, the funniest yokels ever (including Sheriff Freak - 'nuff said) and the mightiest weapon ever seen in any film ever. Go on, watch it. Best laugh of my life, could be yours too."

        "review_detailed_main": "I would like to begin my review by saying that watching this movie will be like taking a hot fork and shoving it in your eye socket for some people, whereas for others it will be the funniest F'n thing you've ever seen.\n\nBefore I get into the meat of the story or as I like to call it a double decker bologna sandwich\u0085Troll 2 has nothing to do with trolls (just goblins), Troll 2 also has absolutely nothing to do with Troll 1. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for Troll 2 didn't see Troll 1 or Troll 2!!!! The original cover of Troll 2 has a werewolf (Not in Troll 1 or Troll 2) chasing a little boy who doesn't even appear in either of the Troll movies! If that doesn't make you want to take your head and smash it against concrete, I don't know what does.\n\nI will now begin with the double decker bologna sandwich part of my analysis. The film begins with Grandpa Seth talking to his grandson Joshua. Joshua is constipated throughout the film and grandpa is dead. You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back\u0085that kind of dead. He tells that old story of how Peter Pan ran through the woods one day, ate green goup, and turned into a MLANT. The mother, played by Margo Prey (AKA greatest actress ever) assures Joshua that it was just a dream and goes onto explain that Grandpa's death was, \"Very difficult for your father, for Holly, and for me his daughter.\" You may want to give that quote a second reading\u0085 The daughter is also brilliant in this picture. The chemistry between her and her boyfriend Elliott is sizzling!!! Ouch very hot! So sizzling that Elliott and his friends couldn't be more gay! Holly explains, \"You take them to bed with you too (referring to Elliott's guy friends that are hanging out the window) and I don't believe in group sex\". What??? Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott (that he is a good for nothing) and that they are going on vacation for a month. Ellliott then asks, \"Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow?\" \"Yes!\" \"I'll come with you?\" \"OK I'll tell my father that you're coming with us tomorrow\" Believe me the movie keeps going\u0085Joshua must do it he must do it! He must pee on everyone's food before they eat corn with green paste on it. Oh my god! Or how about \"You're a genius big Sister!\" Watch for the mother staring directly into the camera and yelling, \"Oh dear god what can we do!\" So they have this family exchange and they go to Nilbog and oh my god!\n\nThis movie is a pure masterpiece. It's so bad it's fantastic! I recommend everyone to give it one viewing just so you can say you've survived it's stupidity. Make sure you watch it with friends though\u0085DO NOT watch this movie alone or you will lose your mind trying to figure out why anyone would make a movie this bad...I will leave you with this: Mother says \"Elliott what are you doing here?\" Daughter says \"Elliott is part of the family now!\" Mom puts her hand on Elliott's face, \"Oh Elliott!\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Everytime I walk out of a movie theater, no matter what movie I had just seen, I always think to myself, \"this was no troll 2...\" No movie since has been made that has left such an impact on me as a serious film critic. Why is this movie so great? Unlike 99% of movies out today, Troll 2 accomplishes something most movies don't even come close to and usually fail at, it's entertaining.\n\nThis movie has no relation to the original Troll and that is a good thing. The reason it was named Troll 2 is a mystery much like how Tarantino's movie, Reservior Dogs, has everyone guessing why it was named as that. Unfortunately, the director, Joe D'Amato, has taken that secret to the grave with him. The plot, every scene, every bit of dialouge, the acting, the costume and makeup, the music (especially the opening credits --classic), and every little detail of this movie captures your attention leaving you in awe from beginning to end. The movie is about a family who decides to go on a vacation in the small town of Nilbog despite protest from Joshua, the young son and hero of the movie, who was warned from his deceased grandfather about cruel deformed forest dwellers who live in Nilbog. As with most parents of the babyboomer generation, Joshua's pleads are not only ignored, but mocked and ridiculed. The family, needless to say, goes on with the planned schedule and the adventure begins.\n\nOne might criticize the casting of this movie. I'd rather have \"regular people\" in this movie, (\"regular people\" meaning the demeaning term used by arrogant movie star celebrities which refer to us, the people who aren't movie star celebrities), as this cast in Troll 2 has more personality than any overpaid, silicone enhanced, plastic surgery addicted, tabliod covering, tanning salon using, church of scientologist following, teen movie drama appearing, \"actor\" out there. Watching the cast is memorizing, especially how they react to the goblin threat.\n\nI could go on forever about this movie, I apologize for the rambling. Go and see this movie, find it, rent it, you will be introduced to a whole new experience you probably have never have had. Until Troll 1.5 or Troll 3, I'm going to defend Troll 2 as a true unique movie experience unlike anything else. Groundbreaking filmaking...Troll 2...Cue the goblin music!"

But my word, what can I say? The film opens with a man wearing a pointy hat being chased by what appears to be Yoda's inbred cousins. The pointy hat man falls and is revived by a girl with disturbing freckles. To be helpful, she offers him a bowl of green gunge. Naturally, pointy hat man drinks the green gunge without a second's thought. He then turns into a tree.\n\nThis tragic story has been recounted by Grampa Seth to his irritating grandson, Joshua. It turns out Grampa Seth is a ghost who has extensive knowledge of goblins and their evil green food.\n\nJoshua and his cretinous family set off for a vacation as part of a house exchange with a family of retards who live in the town of Nilbog. Thoughtfully, the retard family have left a selection of hideous green cakes for them to eat. Unfortunately, Grampa Seth appears and hints to Joshua that having a waz on them might be a good idea.\n\nClose behind them, following in a camper van, is his sister's boyfriend and his boyfriends, I mean friends. One by one the boys encounter many terrible things. Dork #1 sees a terrified girl in the woods, to reassure her he chases her and jumps on top of her. He then meets a woman from Stone Henge, who sounds like she is from Transylvannia, who turns him into a plant. And puts him in a pot. Dork #2 meets a policeman called Sheriff Freak who drops him off in town in the middle of a group of men with moustaches. Dork #3 has a grisly encounter with popcorn.\n\nMeanwhile, the family are given a traditional Nilbog welcome by the town's residents - a great deal of clapping, chanting and more green cake. Troublemaker, Grampa Seth appears again and encourages Joshua to set fire to one of the party guests. Shortly after this the goblins appear and throw sandwiches at the house. The film soon comes to a dramatic conclusion.\n\nIn many respects, this film is a disgrace. The acting is unforgettable - I am particularly surprised that the drugstore owner was not at least nominated for a best supporting Oscar. The dialogue is understated and poignant - especially where Holly punches her boyfriend in the gonads and he delivers the immortal line, 'Are you trying to turn me into a homo?'. And the music is the work of a genius of sorts, or at the very least a remedial level music student with a Casio keyboard.\n\nNilbog....Nilbog......."

I vaguely remember an opening scene where a man is being fed food by a girl, and he turns into a tree or dies or something, and immediately, I thought, \"What the hell is this crap?\". The movie progresses at an equally bad rate: A family comes to a town called Nilbog, and not a single one of them notices that Nilbog spelled backwards is Goblin, which makes no sense, because the title of the movie is, I believe, TROLL 2, not Goblin 2. Of course, the lead character, a small boy, happens to glance into a rear view mirror on his parents car, and see's that Nilbog backwards spells Goblin. Only one problem: Nilbog reflected in a rear view mirror spells qodliN, not gobliN. WHOOPS! Then there's this stupid chase scene through a forest, where Goblins keep on popping up from nowhere, and urging people to run towards them. Over all, this movie was pure junk. 1 star because I am in a good mood."

The script is mediocre and the acting is worse, definitely below average. The movie opening and narration is great. There's a great use of settings and interesting circumstances throughout the movie. The horror scenes, makeup, costumes and masks are very well done and extremely entertaining.\n\nOverall, this is an entertaining movie that isn't a masterpiece by any means, isn't particularly good but is extremely entertaining.

I didn't get into how Elliot was getting naked with his friends and watching porno stuff with monkeys and bad music, but since your friends are not even worried about how corn and vegetables will kill you, then it makes sense that you button up your shirt when your girlfriend shows up unexpected.\n\nI don't want to even think about reading a cook book about vegetables or have some guy try to make me eat ice cream with raisins on it.\n\nBut its good to know a baloney sandwich can save me from that."

It got that rating for a damn good reason. ***SOME SPOILERS IN THIS ONE, BUT THEY WON'T HURT THIS FILM*** The movie follows a family that, for no apparent reason, is just \"switching homes\" with some hicks in some podunk town called \"Nilbog\" for a vacation. If that concept isn't weird enough, don't worry, the movie will quickly outshine that wet spot. Well, the town is infested with--you guessed it--goblins. What's that? You guessed trolls? Ha ha, sorry sucker, this movie is titled wrong--probably just to throw you off!! In fact, as the horrible little boy in the movie suffers the line, \"Nil-bog isss Gob-lin... back-waa-ards!!\" you begin to realize this the movie has a wealth of increasing crappiness yet to vomit your way. The goblins are immensely laughable, if not downright pathetic--they're midgets (oh, I'm sorry, not-tall people) dressed in what appear to be fire-damaged carpet with masks apparently crafted by the artful hands of Helen Keller. One of them has eyes the size of golf balls--and they never blink! On top of it, the \"goblins\" are vegetarians, so of course, in order to eat the visiting humans (in case you haven't guessed, the whole town is goblin-infested, like in \"The Howling,\" but crappy), they--get ready--turn them into vegetables of some sort. The acting is gut-wrenchingly bad--the worst is the woman playing the Mom in the family, there is no atmosphere--it takes place under the terror of daylight, and well, there is but one entertaining thing in the whole movie: That classic scene where, haunted by the ghost of grandpa, the little boy pisses all over the family's dinner to prevent them from eating food that would vegetate them into Goblin-meal. No kidding. 1/10\n\nwww.ResidentHazard.com"

I've seen tons of films that I have enjoyed far less than Troll 2\u2014films with seemingly no redeeming qualities whatsoever, the celluloid equivalent of Ketamine; at least this one provides plenty of unintentional laughs and is so utterly bizarre in places that it kept me watching to the bitter end. Surely that's gotta be worth a rating of at least a 3/10?\n\nP.S. If you should find yourself struggling to finish the film, there are always the Troll 2 drinking games to make things a little less painful; I suggest taking a shot every time piggy-nosed brat Joshua mentions his Grandpa Seth\u2014you'll be plastered in no time!"

I wanted to see where that romance plot line was going, but the movie doesn't even stay focused on it, there are these lame trolls getting in the way.If I'd written this, Holly would maybe get a makeover and some dance lessons,to keep Elliott from switching teams.

My favorite parts were when the kid had to take a leak all over the familiy's dinner so they wouldn't turn into goblins, and also everytime one of the goblins throws a \"spear\" (it wobbles up and down in the air, and we can see the victim grab the spear and \"plunge\" it into himself....HOW TECHNICALLY ADVANCED!!)

Oh and the main lead is a boy who sees his dead grandfather. The Sixth Sense this obviously isn't, although I don't think you'll be harder pressed to find a much worse movie than this stinker. It's all horrendous, atrociously acted and full of awkward moments (Check out the homoeroticism between the boyfriend and his friends who sleep in the same bed without shirts!) and some of the worst special effects ever. Like Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2, Demolition High and R.O.T.O.R it takes the work of a true genius to make such a movie. It's impossible to make a movie like this on purpose and because this was done with serious intentions, I fully acknowledge it is as a true treasure of goofy cinema. I mean this is a movie that tries to ask us to accept a hero who uses a double decker baloney sandwich as a weapon. Or a twist ending that makes very little sense (on par with the rest of the movie) and cheap sets that define poverty row production. This has somehow become a cult classic and I must admit that if there is a Troll 2 convention near my area, I'll go. As it stands now, I worship this as one of the best comedies ever made.\n\n1/2* out of 4-(Awful)"

WHAT THE @%^# IS GOING ON??!\" It's probably the funniest thing you'll ever watch, trust me.

And then that kid, Joshua, pees on the food. WHAT?! Lol, it had me laughing forever-- YOU CAN'T P*ISS ON HOSPITALITY! Now I have a bunch of quotes that I can fire back and forth between my friends and I. Oh, and the other part I remember is the \"sexay\" scene with the witch, one of the guys, and a corncob.

I'm surprised Mystery Science Theater 3000 didn't riff this crappy in a good way sort of film for it would have been their most popular episode of all time, this movie has became a new cult sensation and even spawned a brilliant documentary called \"Best Worst Movie Ever\" which earned better reviews than this movie itself.

These films are made for teenagers that rented VHS tapes of Charles Band's Full Moon films or Troma for a few laughs with their friends. Troll 2 delivers on laughs, awful special effects, but it lacks a bit in the gore department.\n\nIt's worth pointing out in every bad movie there is at least one good actor. Michael Paul Stephenson as Joshua, the little boy who is sort of the lead role is better than most of the adult actors apart from Deborah Reed who plays a Troll Queen and really goes for it, hamming it up, every facial expression really turned up to the Nth degree, knowingly giving viewers exactly what they expect and being sexy with it.\n\nA documentary was made by actor, Michael Paul Stephenson and is favourably reviewed. I do like guilty pleasure films and try to see the good in most films, but while far from the worst film ever made it is difficult to recommend because it's bad on every level.\n\nOn Censorship: The film was passed in the UK uncut with an 18 certificate for VHS. It was downgraded to a 15 for DVD. For comparison the film has less violence than 15 rated Final Destination."

Anyone who has seen this movie would be much more likely to say, \"The movie I saw is pretty bad, but, it's not as bad as Troll 2.\" But it's unfair to compare because Troll 2 is like in a whole separate category.\n\nAmong the movies that are the worst of the worst, this one's not quite among the bottom dregs, which, to me, includes movies like Manos, Zaat, Beast of Yucca Flats and Pocket Ninjas (among those I've seen). Movies that have NO redeeming value. This movie sort of has redeeming values, which pushes it up (barely) to a 2 out of 10 in my book.\n\nSo what are these redeeming values, you ask. Well, there's the hammy over-acting of the witch Creedence, played by Deborah Reed. She doesn't appear to be trying to be funny, but her performance is so over the top, I comes across as comic gold. Then there's some weirdly memorable scenes, like the one where the witch makes out with a guy with a corncob between her teeth and then the room starts filling up with popcorn. And who can forget the scene where the boy, Joshua, pisses on everyone's food to save them (should I even try to explain this)? And then there's the famous \"Oh my God!\" line that's been popularized as one of the worst death scenes in film history.\n\nTo explain all the things about this movie that went wrong would exceed the character limit of this review, by a lot - a lot a lot. I won't even try. Unless you're really into bad movies, you should stay away from this movie, far away. You shouldn't even watch a movie on a video player that's ever been use to play this movie. It'd probably make even Citizen Kane suck by it's residual suckitude. Any video player that's been used to watch this movie should be subsequently burned and buried deep underground to prevent the infection from spreading. But if you are into bad movies and you love to laugh at them, this one is definitely worth laughing at."

A dead and creepy Grandpa Seth appears as a ghost and warns Joshua of the danger: Nilbog is populated by goblins, and it's up to Joshua to save his family.\n\nDisclaimer: the film is in no way connected to \"Troll\" and has absolutely no trolls in it. Also, the acting (with the odd exception of young Stephenson) is atrocious. The mom is the worst actress ever, but the others are not much better. The daughter, Holly, has a really bad dance routine.\n\nThe director, Claudio Fragrasso, says the movie \"is a fairly unpretentious story for children, shot in four weeks and two days in Utah. It's a pretty amusing film, packed with funny jokes which ridicule horror films in general.\" I think that he gives himself too much credit, though, as the \"jokes\" are not obvious at all.\n\nJim Harper says that although it is considered \"one of the worst films ever made\", it is \"reasonably well constructed\". However, \"the script is quite possibly the worst thing Fragrasso has ever put his name to, contradicting itself on numerous occasions\". Quite frankly, the documentary about the film, \"Best Worst Movie\", really sums it up. It's bad... but so bad it's good. That phrase has never been more true than with this film.\n\nI saw this movie sitting on a shelf at Wal-Mart on Blu-ray. I do not know why you would want it on Blu-Ray, but it's available if you do. Either way, no matter what format you choose to see it in (it's also a Netflix instant play), it's well worth if if you like bad movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "Every once in a while a special kind of bad movie appears that falls into the \"so-bad-it's-good\" subgenre of B-movies. There are plenty of B-movies that are entertaining due to the fact that their badness itself makes them interesting. The Godmonster of Indian Flats, The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed Up Zombies, Blood Feast and of course the immortal Plan 9 From Outer Space are all low budget disasters that are as fascinating as they are terrible.\n\nAnd it's not just low budget drive-in fare that fall into this category. Hollywood has produced more than its share of gargantuan exercises in laughable awfulness: Valley of the Dolls, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Michael Cimino's psychotic remake of The Desperate Hours, and even Richard Rush's unfortunate return to the director's chair, the bewildering Color of Night.\n\nAll these movies have something special in common. They're not just bad; they're insane. They're the work of a demented genius whose grandiose ideas of how to make an entertaining movie got lost in translation and resulted in the glorious mess that now spills across the screen. And for many fans, the infamous Troll 2 falls into this category.\n\nNot me, however. No frigging way.\n\nTroll 2 is mind-numbing. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. I agree with that. Unlike the movies listed above, however, there is no joy to be found. Other than a few admittedly weird moments, Troll 2 is a movie completely devoid of entertainment value. The moronic dialog, juvenile acting, incoherent story, pedestrian direction, pathetic special effects and irritating music swallow up the few chuckle-worthy tidbits in a black hole of banality.\n\nI tried to watch Troll 2 first not knowing of its cult following. Having found the original Troll moderately entertaining, I figured the second one would be another amusing little schlock fest. Needless to say, I was aghast at how dreadful it was. I watched it to the end only out of pure morbid curiosity. When it was over, I popped it out of the VCR, returned it to the video store and made a mental note to never watch it again. Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Then I heard there was a Rocky Horror-like cult following that held festivals and attended theatrical screenings of the movie. I thought maybe I had missed something, so I went out and plopped down $10 for the double feature DVD of Troll and Troll 2. While Troll was the same oddball slice of cheese I recalled, watching Troll 2 again opened my eyes up to the true nature of the movie: it is even worse than I remembered. I recall finding it to be a terrible but harmless little movie that I had no interest in ever bothering with again.\n\nBut watching it a second time I was shocked at how offensive the movie is. Not because of the subject matter or gore, but because of the filmmakers' obvious contempt for their audience. This is a movie that tries to cash in on the success of Gremlins (and its subsequent low budget rip-offs) without bothering to put any effort at all into making it the least bit interesting or entertaining. The undeniably bizarre feel to the movie is not intentional on the part of the filmmakers, but the result of a perfect storm of bad writing, acting, directing and special effects.\n\nThere's none of the earnestness of Ed Wood, none of the enthusiasm of H.G. Lewis, none of the misplaced zeal of Ray Dennis Steckler that made their movies so entertaining; just the half-assed efforts of some lazy, inept hacks trying to make a quick buck.\n\nTroll 2 sucks."

The town of Nilbog is actually the kingdom of the goblins, as told to young Joshua by his grandfather Seth, who is actually dead. Now it's up to Josh to save his family from Creedence, the Goblin Queen, who is hellbent on turning tourists into goo and vegetables.\" - This movie is funny. Period. It is so hilarious, and I mean it. There is not a person alive who could resist giving in to this movie. You have to laugh. I'm serious. There is too much to laugh at. Is it the acting? The acting that is as stale as that loaf of bread which sits forgotten at the back of a pantry until you find it, mouldy and stale, all crunchy, with flakes falling off. Or that lump of cheese. Oh God. That cheese you find hidden at the back of your fridge, sprouting green mould and smelling like year old garbage. Yes, the discovery of old food stuffs describes the acting superbly. The director must have found these mouldy-talented stinkers at the bottom of his bread-bin and the back of his fridge. It's hard to pinpoint most of the bad acting... most of it is most of most of the acting most of the way through. Hehe. I mean, Josh Wait's is probably the most irritating character to grace the big screen ever. His facial expressions are amusing however, those snarly, grotesque twisted faces provided me with multiple jolts of laughter. Stat, one two three *face*, Stat! Clear! Aaaaaaah, Goddarn, anyway, I've always thought, if you divided a DVD store up the way you do with a supermarket, in among the prize meats you'd have greats such as 'The Godfather' and 'Lord of the Rings.' Then in the cheese and dairy section would be all the stinkers like 'Manos: The Hands of Fate,' 'From Justin to Kelly' and 'Troll 2.' - Okay, the script. Where to begin? The \"row, row, row your boat\" scene? That was pretty amusing. The Wait's family are sitting in the car, driving along, when all of a sudden the Wait's mother says \"Josh, oh Josh please sing me that song. That one I love so much.\" He suddenly starts singing \"row, row,\" and then it becomes an audio orgy as we get the delight of hearing these croaky nobodies sing their sweet little hearts out. I found it amusing when Josh found out Nilbog was their world \"Nilbog! It's goblin spelt backwards! This is their kingdom!\" Other classic lines include the drugstore owner barking \"There's no coffee here in Nilbog - it's the Devil's drink!\" Diana explaining \"Joshua is not a little sh!t, he's just very sensitive.\" And Arnold screaming \"They're eating her... and then they're going to eat me... OH MY GAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\" Another part you have to look out for is the song the town-folk are humming when they throw the get-together for the Wait's family. That made me choke on my fizzy drink with absolute laughter. Ah, I have the song playing right now in the back of my head. It's pure hilarity! \"la la la, la la la, la la la la...\" Fantastic! - The plot and story is really weird, I have to say. It's nothing too complex, it's just very weird (by this I mean what the Nilbog folk are doing.) For example there is a scene where Brent and Creedence kiss an ear of corn together, and they seem to have left their popcorn in the microwave too long, because popcorn starts flying everywhere, in this totally messed up and excruciatingly painful to watch 'love' (would you call it 'love'?) scene. Another weird part was when Josh was in the car, and branches started to grow out of his fingers and he started to sweat green custard. What was the reason for that part? Probably no reason, but this movie is rather jumbled up, and painful. Anyway, this movie is great for laughs, but do not take it seriously. It's probably more fun if you get a group of friends round, grab some alcohol and big bowls of popcorn, and get ready to be perplexed, bemused, entertained, annoyed and to be laughing hysterically. Because this movie has it all. Except trolls. Weird, huh..."

Words cannot convey this sense of foreboding I feel in the pit of my stomach.\n\nI guess I should give you some background as to what I'm rambling about.\n\nI purchased Troll/Troll 2 for the sole purpose of owning Troll. I had no idea what Troll 2 was or what it would eventually do to me. You see, I had seen Troll when I was around 5-7 years old and had relatively fond memories of it, so when I saw the DVD for sale I gleefully snatched it up.\n\nThe strangest sensation overtook me then, a cross between dizziness and existential dread while razors danced in my stomach and my skin broke into a cold sweat. The feeling soon passed and I quickly tried to forget about the experience.\n\nLater that day I watched Troll expecting to relive a bit of my childhood. Well, the saying \"you can never go home\" held true for me. I found Troll to be an unforgettably, forgettable movie if that makes any sense. Completely disposable and not worth mentioning beyond this point.\n\nI watched Troll 2 the next day. My expectations were low, but I figured I might as well give the second movie a chance.\n\nMy life would be infinitely better had I washed my hands of the whole affair and turned my attention towards other pursuits, or maybe not. Who's to say? Where would the world be if there had been no Bubonic Plague or if the members of the Beatles had never formed a band? My soul cries out for a \"what could have been\" but without the Plague mightn't the world be even more burdened by overpopulation, pollution and resource depletion? Would we have been able produce someone whose intellect would dwarf Einstein's? If the Beatles had never formed would some other band have been able to garner recognition left by the void of the Beatles or would they create what in hindsight would be considered puerile drivel?\n\nThese are pointless questions that can never be answered. Time to get down to brass tacks.\n\nI cannot stop watching Troll 2. I have alienated friends and family members. I have become an outcast in my neighborhood and have been shunned by co-workers. What is worse, as each day passes, I find it harder to disassociate myself from this film. My waking thoughts are centered around it. My being has become enmeshed with its life force, and make no mistake...it is alive and it grows stronger with each viewing. There is no turning back. I have gotten to the point where I feel little remorse showing this film to others, addicting them, changing them, tailoring them so that they may spread the Gospel that is Troll 2. I'm slowly coming to the realization that this is not just weird gibberish that I'm spouting off. It's not cathartic and it does not ease my burden or put the last shreds of my guilty conscience to rest.\n\nYes...YES! I have become drunk off the wine of revelation and I understand now. I finally SEE. I do not fear the outcome. I feel HER re-assuring hand on my shoulder.\n\nWatch Troll 2, such wondrous and provocative pleasures await you!"

Lines are spoken as if the actors are reciting poetry in kindergarten. The direction would seem to imply this epic of film incompetency was a comedy, but, shockingly, the film actually seems to take itself seriously. The script has no cohesion, makes no sense, tells no story, and is such a series of unintentionally stupid lines, that you shake your head in astonishment.\n\nThe \"slime\" looks like that gelatin stuff they used on the \"You can't do that on Television\" children's comedy show in the '80's. The \"goblins\" look like they're wearing old, worn out Halloween costumes. The screaming of a victim being slimed is insanely laughable. The script meanders in and out of the kid's dream until you want to throw things at the screen. The kid always looks like he's about to lose his lunch. Speaking of lunch, you won't believe the lunch scene. Or the popcorn scene. Or any scene in this movie, actually.\n\nBest of all is the legendary Oscar winning acting performance by the lady playing Credence Leonore Gielgud (I'll be nice and leave her unnamed). She mugs, grins, casts psychotic gazes, walks stiffly like a marionette, over-acts, over-emotes, and delivers lines like she's intoxicated. Her overdone make-up job makes her looks like a cross between Morticia Addams, Betty Boop, Cindy Lauper, and Dora the Explorer.\n\nThe director of this film has earned a page in the annals of cinematic trash creation, standing proudly with the likes of Uwe Bolle and Ed Wood., Jr. A truly imbecilic movie, which I'll give a 2 only because it's so fun to laugh at."

I used to be a relatively intelligent man. You know how many brain cells I have left after watching this movie? One. He's all alone in there, and he's scared. His poor friends never saw it coming. However, the worst part is that being as the inside of my cranium is now an empty, barren wasteland, the poor fool can't even find the means to end his own miserable existence. Just him, and the horrible memory of ever single one of the 5,640 grueling seconds that his eyes were brutally raped by this film.\n\nTruly a masterpiece, showing what can be done with a home video camera and a steaming pile of crap.\n\nUpdate: At 10:45 p.m. last night, my last brain cell finally did succeed in ending his own misery.\n\nRIP Brain. Beloved friend and vital organ. You will be missed."

If you like bad movies, Troll 2 is the pinnacle of the early 90's. I am a big fan of Rumpelstiltskin, Leprechaun 3, and the Ice Cream Man, so if you liked any of those, you will LOVE Troll 2. I have also made a drinking game out of this movie. Every time a character says Nilbog, Goblin, or Joshua, you must take a swig of your favorite drink. You will be floored by the end of the movie! Troll 2 is an awful piece of art and one can;t revel enough in its splendor. Ive seen it 5 times this week already!"

But after watching this film maybe with my expectations set rather low I was quite surprised and I found this film entertaining if not really good, but then thats why we watch films isn't it? to be entertained. Yes OK the acting is appalling no doubt about that however there are some great expressions of shock on the faces of the \"actors\" I especially enjoyed the mothers look of shock ! All in all not a bad film I have seen many low budget films in my time and I have to say this is far from the worst, and almost good but not quite. Probably best viewed when intoxicated."

        "review_detailed_main": "When people say \"This is the worst movie ever\" they imply that they saw a movie. A MOVIE has two essential parts: 1. a plot and 2. acting. Troll 2 has neither. So technically Troll 2 is not a movie. Therefore, I say \"This is the worst THING that ever happened in my life\". And for the record Troll 2 has no trolls, it has goblins, ha!\n\nMy dog once asked me: \"I am going to make a movie.\" I said to him: \"You're a dog. Dogs don't make movies.\" After seeing Troll 2 I said to him: \"Go on and make your movie.\"\n\nI've seen a lot of crap. Believe me. I've become an expert in this field. And Troll 2 doesn't belong in my field of expertise. Because I watch movies. I like movies. I comment movies. Troll 2 is not a movie. Troll 2 is like just before you die. The same feeling. It's when you say: \"Damn, a whole life wasted.\" I wasted my life after watching it. I have no longer desire to live, to love, to hate, to feel. I have become totally numb. People ask me what's wrong with me, but I'm too embarrassed to say that I lost my desire to live because of Troll 2.\n\nThis is why, instead of writing a constructive comment, I'll make a public warning:\n\nTroll 2 is good only, if you are suicidal. Troll 2 is good only, if you hate people. Troll 2 is good only, if you lost your faith in humanity. Troll 2 is good only, if you no longer respect yourself. Troll 2 is good only...Troll 2 is good for nothing.\n\nDon't see it, you'll go blind. Don't try to understand it, you'll go insane. Don't try to rent it, you'll be sorry. Don't recommend it, people who love you will love you no more. Don't try to download it, your PC will die on you. Don't think about it at all or you'll end up just like me.\n\nPotential consequences in case (and I hope this never happens) you see it:\n\nYour girl/boyfriend will leave you. You'll lose your job. You'll have no prospect in life whatsoever. Nothing will be the same ever again, not even your appearance. You'll gain weight, lose your hair, become impotent, start drinking, start liking Paris Hilton.\n\nMy last appeal is: in God's name, in the name of everything and everyone you love DON'T WATCH THIS. Don't be even tempted. I know that what is forbidden is appealing, but don't follow your instincts, don't listen to your curious nature. Just don't. And everything will be fine. And the world will be the way it is. Better off without Troll 2."

        "review_title": "Unintentional comedy is the only thing that will help you get through this crummy backyard production.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Recent studies have shown that the average person's intelligence is going down, thanks to so-called \"contributions to society\" like American Idol, Michael Bay movies and unhealthy ingredients in foods. It has been started that intelligence started to downgrade around the time the new millennium started. After watching Troll 2, I believe this trend started ten years earlier, when a schlock Italian director was hired to direct this absolutely atrocious film, if you can call it a \"film.\" Everything about Troll 2 reeks of stupidity, from the cast to the script to the score and even the costumes. Ed Wood, notoriously named the worst director of all-time, wouldn't touch this film with a twenty-foot yard stick. Even the infamous Uwe Boll would call this one a stinker. Yet, along with the stupidity, there are still plenty of laughs to be had. Troll 2 is such a ridiculous film that it's very hard to watch it with a straight face. While cringing at the horrible celluloid you're watching, you might find yourself giggling as well. However, that's the only thing that will help you get through this crummy backyard production.\n\nThe plot of Troll 2, which I managed to find past the badness, centers around Joshua Waits, a young boy who constantly having conversations with his dead grandfather's ghost. Meanwhile, His sister, Holly, is having problems with his boyfriend, Scotty, the \"good for nothing playboy son of the Coopers.\" She wants him to spend more time with her and to forget about his friends. The plot starts to begin when the father decides to take the family on a vacation to the small town of Nilbog, but once on arrival, Joshua becomes suspicious of the other townsfolk. Scotty and his friends also head to Nilbog, where he hopes in finding Holly and they want to score with some local girls. The residents of Nilbog appear to be very kind to the Waits, constantly trying to feed them oddly coloured vegetables and milk with \"Vitamin D!\" Yet, Joshua and his grandfather knowing that the Nilbog citizens are in fact goblins in disguise, swoop in at the oddly right moments to stop them. Scotty's friends, meanwhile, are turned into \"man plants\" by the leader of the Nilbog goblins, a witch who likes to annunciate every single syllable.\n\nThe plot synopsis above does not do justice to how bad and laugh-inducing Troll 2 is. Claudio Fragasso, who at the time of making this had a limited knowledge of the English language, wrote and directed this with little care for story, characters, interesting settings and making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. The goblins are made with what look like Halloween masks that probably made up about two dollars of the budget and pillowcases full of hay. Sequences where characters ooze disgusting slime and turn into flat, green pancakes are especially embarrassing, due to the obviously bad editing and ridiculous nature of it. The score is also downright poor and laughable. Techno music was quite popular at the time of this film's release, but that's because they had style. Here, the composer just hits random notes on the keyboard. The script is the worst aspect of Troll 2, as it features the worst dialogue I have heard in any major motion picture and the story is extremely silly and badly fabricated. Eating bologna sandwiches kills goblins? Apparently so. Because they're vegetarians, they must turn humans into plants to eat them? I guess they have no idea how to plant their own vegetables in Nilbog. And don't even get me started on that out of left-field ending. It looks like the screenplay never passed the first draft page or Fragasso never even showed it to script readers.\n\nThe people involved I feel the most sorry for are the actors. Maybe they're very good and could have had some great careers in Hollywood, starring alongside Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise. However, any evidence of that is not displayed in Troll 2. Michael Stephenson gives quite possibly the worst performance by a child star I have ever seen, yelling and screeching and crying \"Grandpa!\" so many times I lost count after bad line delivery #1270. George Hardy, a practicing dentist, plays the father with as little emotion as possible, with every single expression looking exactly the same. Margo Prey, the mother, provides the difficult cast of being even more bland. Connie Young's performance as Holly is monotone and thus makes her character more uncaring and annoying that she already is. If she auditioned for her high school's school play, the drama teacher would cross her name off the list after about two minutes. Robert Ormsbry, is just as cringe inducing, playing Scotty the homophobic boyfriend (although he is oddly enough shown in one scene, sharing a bed butt-naked with one of his buddies). Darren Ewing gives probably Troll 2's most infamous acting job as Arnold, who provides a reaction shot that provides more laughs than screams.\n\nFinally, Deborah Reed attempts to shoot for Oscar gold with her performance as the evil leader of the goblins. She apparently finds it necessary to pronounce every vowel and in so doing so, extends what should be a short sixty-minute feature to a bloated and long ninety-minutes. Thankfully, Fragasso didn't give her a Paul Thomas Anderson-esquire monologue. Otherwise, Troll 2 would have yet another hour of running time. Despite the awfulness of Troll 2, the images of its unintentional hilarity are still stuck in my brain. However, unlike a classic horror film like The Exorcist which I highly appreciate, Troll 2 is only around and in circulation so myself and other people can make fun of it."

This movie is accidentally one of the funniest films ever released. The amount of ineptitude in craft and baffling story decisions are truly something that can never be repeated. Despite these traits that most people would associate with a completely despicable movie, there is an earnest sincerity by all of the crew that make this film so charming. You can tell that the director, and even some of the actors genuinely thought they were making a good movie. Certain scenes from this movie (OH MY GOOOOODDDDD!!!!!) are stuff of legend, but trust me there are many more that you have never heard of. If you like watching movies that are so bad that they are great, you have to give this movie a shot. Also give the documentary Best Worst Movie, made about Troll 2, a look as well. Don't try to take it seriously, and don't go into it looking to hate on terribly made cinema. Just enjoy the terrible lines, awful acting, and insane plot devices."

        "review_detailed_main": "If you are the type of sadomasochistic movie-goer who seeks out films so notoriously awful just to have a laugh or two, then chances are you are familiar with Troll 2, Claudio Fragasso's cult non- sequel classic. However, if you were to label Troll 2 as the worst movie ever made, then I would question whether or not you have actually seen it (although it was the subject of Best Worst Movie, a documentary made by the lead actor). Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most inept, poorly-constructed, and laughably performed films you could ever hope to see, but what separates it from the likes of The Beast of Yucca Flats, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Battlefield Earth is that it is enormous fun. I usually go into these types of films hoping for a few laughs but end up being subjected to 90 minutes of sheer tedium, but Troll 2 really is in a class of its own.\n\nWe open with kindly old man Seth (Robert Ormsby) reading his grandson Joshua (Michael Paul Stephenson) a fairytale involving goblins. The stunted creatures chase a man through the woods and force him to eat a green goo, which turns him into a plant. You see, goblins are vegetarians, so they can eat the man once he has completed the transformation. Goblins are everywhere, warns Grandpa Seth. The bedtime story is abruptly ended by the arrival of Joshua's mother Diana (Margo Prey), who causes Seth to suddenly vanish. The lovable old man has been dead for 6 months, but still appears to Joshua as a ghost. Fearing the boy is losing his marbles, the Waits family head off to the town of Nilbog as part of some kind of weird exchange program, which will see them tend crops and live off the land for a week while the Nilbogian family head into the big city in the opposite direction. On arrival, they are met with a feast covered in a strange weird goo similar to the one from the story. It seems Nilbog is the home of evil goblins posing as humans hoping to gobble them up at the earliest opportunity.\n\nBefore you think I've had a stroke, I can assure you that this is the plot of the movie. You will also see no mention of trolls, because there aren't any. Director Fragasso (under the pseudonym of Drake Floyd), who could speak little English, waltzed into town with a script written in Italian and seemingly cast the first people to audition who could string a sentence together. The dialogue was badly translated, nevertheless Fragasso insisted that the lines were spoken exactly as written on the page. Somewhat endearingly, the entire cast really give it their all, despite being lumbered with the lines such as \"It's goblin spelled backwards!\". Every single frame of Troll 2 lacks logic, and this is what makes the movie so charmingly hilarious and helps separate it from the horror lurking in the IMDb's Bottom 100 list, which may raise a smirk once or twice throughout their running time. Simply marvel at the complete disregard for common sense (Grandpa's Seth plan to escape the goblins is to Molotov cocktail the house while the whole family is still inside it) and stare open-mouthed at the moment when a young horndog is seduced by a corn-on-the-cob. There really is no way to describe Troll 2."

Some moments will have you on the edge of your seat, contemplating how this film was ever made and how this film was ever pitched to a production company. Tear jerkingly funny at some moments, and mind numbingly dull at others, the film has two sides. Even better, the film contains no trolls as the title suggest, but are instead replaced by crack head ewoks, who surprisingly offer a relative threat to holiday makers in the town of Nilbog. The main threat to this film however would be taking it too seriously."

It was a pile of S%$T!! At first my friend and I were just laughing hysterically, the movie was so bad it was funny. This was because the acting was so bad we couldn't believe it, emotions were hard to register, facial expression looked absolutely ridiculous and the actors didn't even look like they knew what they were doing. It honestly looked like the director tried to find the worst actors ever. But thats OK, because this may be the worst script of all time, so no talent was wasted. Seriously, the story is a mess and the dialogue is horrible. It sounds stiff, forced and is completely unbelievable. The plot is also equally ridiculous,making little sense and full of obvious holes that weigh the film down even more. On top of all that the film is just idiotic in every way possible.

That's right, Troll 2 doesn't have a single troll in it. That's not the worst part. All of the actors (save for the obnoxious kid) seem to have been dosed with a near-lethal cocktail of anti-psychotics and sedatives. They also appeared to have been instructed to read the lines as if they had no comprehension of proper inflection and/or any type of readable/audible human emotion. I could look past a phony accent, but these people seemed to have been beamed down from some planet where language itself simply does not exist. The result is a bona fide suck-fest of a film that I, a man with a wide sense of humor, have trouble comprehending. Just what exactly was this movie?

As a child I vividly remember watching this on VHS, only to find myself beyond confused at the infamous popcorn scene and god knows what else, only to rediscover this special film years later, along with the rest of the bad movie loving world. Troll 2 may live up to its title as the worst or one of the worst films of all time, but it's never boring and you'll get a good laugh."

The entire concept is just ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense at all. I feel like whoever came up with this idea had a stick shoved up his ass all the way to his brain or something. Something that made it so he couldn't think straight, because this movie was so bad, that it gave me cancer. I lost intelligence from watching this movie.\n\nHowever, you should watch it. Why? It is so bad that it actually happens to be the funniest movie ever created. You will laugh more at how terrible this movie than you have ever laughed at any other comedy movie.

Or that there were no Trolls in this movie and it should have been called Goblins. But it was so badly acted. So badly written. It had such any awful ending. It was not scary at all. I have to say. What a pile pooh. This really is one of the worst horror movies ever. I question it when people say this is the worst movie ever especially when it is a horror movie. Or when it is science fiction.

And, now that I'm reading that this movie wasn't meant to be a parody at all, I love this movie so much more. This movie is reviewed way too low. It's got everything: it's legit scary at times (this movie has some cool body horror and a wacky, real terrifying at times, antagonist), it has hilarious characters (they react to things for way too long, their line readings are a hoot), and it legit just feels like a parody (I mean, the opening is essentially stolen from The Princess Bride!). If you view this as just a horror, you won't like it. The same can be said if you view it as just a comedy. But, through the lens of parody like Airplane or Naked Gun (but with actual horror elements), you'll love this! It will have you saying, \"oh my gooood!!\""

By the way, this channel is golden as far as showing terrible films in stunning 1080i no less. After sitting through this in its entirety I'm assured that I did the right thing those many years ago. Troll 2 is just THAT bad.\n\nDirected by Italian hackmaster Claudio Fragasso, the real reason Zombie 3 sucks, here hiding behind the name Drago Floyd. The Waits family is participating in some bizarre hometown swap with some residents from the town of Nilbog, much to the chagrin of youngest son Joshua who delivers his lines with a facial grimace reserved for dire situations in a gas station bathroom when you have an upset stomach. Recently deceased Grandpa Seth assist Joshua from the beyond in keeping his family from being eaten from vegetarian goblins who instead of -I don't know eating plants!- have to get the humans to eat this disgusting green concoction that turns them into human trees to be consumed by the townsfolks, er trolls, I mean goblins. The goblins are controlled by their queen Creedence Leonore Gielgud who adds the ham to this cheese sandwich by using the same eyes widening schtick for every line she speaks. Joshua runs the gamut from urinating on dinner to assault with a bologna sandwich to save his family who are constantly hoodwinked\n\ninto consuming the food covered in green icing that no sane person would even think of eating. The fact that they never question anything in this bizarre town is what's so frustrating about this movie.\n\nThis film is definitely on par with Ed Wood's Plan 9 as far as worse acting performances ever. Joshua's mother Diana has the same clueless look on her face the whole friggin film and doesn't say one thing that's even remotely convincing. Michael Waits probably delivers one of the dumbest lines and probably most overlooked of this film as he explains to Joshua why the town is so empty in the middle of the day as a the \"farmers are all asleep this time of night\". Huh? One, it's mid afternoon. Two, what sort of farmer farms at night. Vampire farmers? Good god who wrote this! Which brings me to the worst of the worst. Holly Waits is the single most maddeningly awful character you will ever watch. It's downright vile how she spits her lines with this uber-bratty personality and her constant over emphasis on the wrong syllable. Her bizarre solo dance scene showcases that she's just as bad a dancer as an actress. There are some bad films that provide genuine enjoyment such as , for me at least, R.O.T.O.R., which is why the Bottom 100 is such as popular list. This film is not one of those as there is no hint of charm whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost."

Just had a few questions, other than, \"Why was this movie even made in the first place\"? Why did the dad have an unidentifiable southern accent, even though no one else in his family did? Why did the head witch (?) speak in a quasi-Russian accent, that she apparently found hard to stay in-character to enunciate? My favorite line in the flick was her mondo-bizarro, \"My people come from...Stone-henge\". Bloody 'orrible reference that was, mate! And why, when witchie-poo morphed into a vixen and seduced Johnny Stud in the RV, did she feed him popcorn? And why did it pop exponentially filling the Winnebago from hell? And what was the point? It didn't turn the guy into green, or any other color, slime. It didn't even harm him. Was she hoping for, \"Death by Orvillle Redenbacher\"? And the mom character, did she go to some kind of acting school which had a session entitled, \"If you want to emote intensity...NEVER blink your eyes\"? And I suppose, to close this missive, I could ask why the word \"Troll\" was NEVER mentioned in the film, but that would probably just hurt my feelings and give me a migraine. If you can see only one bad movie in your lifetime and you can't do Ed Wood films 'cuz they're in black and white, \"Troll II\" is it! Enjoy!"

To say that watching this film causes leprosy is a gross understatement. Everyone who worked on this movie and didn't submit themselves to daily brutal whippings from a cat-o-nine-tails as penance out of regret should be locked in a prisoner of war camp for causing a second Holocaust by helping this movie get made.\n\nHistorically, the Mongols were able to conquer China just by showing the people there this movie.

I also discovered that what was inside the box, the movie, was the best film EVER. If you ever want to see acting at its finest, acting that will make you re-examine your life, acting that will make you see the world for the first time, watch Grandpa Seth deliver words of advice from beyond the grave to little Joshua. It was delightful. No, it was brilliant. No, there is no word to describe its perfection, so I'm forced to make one up, and I will do so right now. This movie was scrumtrulecent. This movie was a blinding, brilliant light from heaven. Watching this movie is like staring into the face of god, and seeing him looking back and smiling, saying \"you are my most wonderous creation.\" I am born anew in its genius. So, go do yourself a favor and buy, or rent, the greatest movie ever made...by humans."

Plot holes and inconsistencies tend to be a standard feature in a lot of Italian horror/fantasy films and it's all part of their charm. Special effects are also pretty bad with some of the worst monster masks that I've ever seen.

Overall this is definitely the worst acting i have ever seen, i did not think i would find worse actors than Schwarzenegger in his debut as Hercules in \"Hercules in New York\" but this movie proved me wrong. I could understand Arnie, he had no idea about the language he was babbling........but these people......oh boy! My rating for the acting job = *FART* Special effects. Oh dear god! The goblins looked like they were made from feces, their faces looked fake and stupid. Special effects job seems to be done by some blind retarded teenager.\n\nMusic, it seems to be done by the same sound-engine found on the very first Pong console.....bleeping and stupid sounds without any relevance to what is going on.\n\nThe script? Jesus Christ! Who in their right mind wrote this? Or who in their right mind approved this to be aired?! I am 100% sure if i would throw some corns on my PC keyboard and let a chicken peck on it i would create something a million times better than this awful fiasco. The lines are so incredibly stupid, it boggles the mind! Once again you ask yourself is this supposed to be serious or just stupid?

Ninety percent of movies fall into these categories. To make a good or great movie requires ensemble talent and a sense of artistic direction. To make Troll 2, the producers would have had to know how to make a good film because they do absolutely everything wrong. EVERYTHING! This masterpiece rescued a rainy cottage day as I watched it unfold with astonishment. It fails so miserably, and so bizarrely, that it manages to rise above its form. Right from the start, the movie takes us further and further into the land of ludicrous, with side trips into insaneville and \"what-the-f*&% is going on\" city. To criticize the individual elements (ie. acting, plot etc) would only deter from the whole. Like a Beethoven symphony it must be viewed upon as a complete masterwork, the parts combining to make the one true artistic statement. Or, lack of there of, as case may be.\n\nA must see for all movie fanatics."

Here it is very pointless and stupid, and the only good I can say of it is that the woman is hotter than the one from part one.

        "review_detailed_main": "Troll 2 is basically just like other 80s horror movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Poltergeist only it has a truly entertaining campiness that makes those movies pale in comparison. The campiness comes from three things, the pi ss poor acting, the unconvincing dialog and the funny premise: A family goes on vacation to a small town called Nilbog(Goblin spelled backwards), where the locals, who look like humans at first, are actually vegetarian goblins that try to coax them into eating bizarre green food to make them into plants and then eat them.\n\nSurprisingly, not everything in this movie is awful. The film's isolated rural landscape creates a sense of dread and tension. You can see that the protagonists of this movie are truly alone, beyond the comforting reaches of civilization where anything can happen. Also the masks worn by the goblin extras look genuinely scary. Some of the characters in the movie are well casted, despite their incompetent acting. This includes the father and the little boy of the family on vacation and the little boy's deceased grandfather, who warns him of what he and his family are getting into right from the start.\n\nWhat Troll 2 does is take the boring old horror movie formula...\n\n1:Someone notices something weird and sinister going on and no one believes him/her.\n\n2:He/she proves the danger is real.\n\n3:They find some way to supposedly defeat the evil. Stupid magicy good vs evil cr ap happens. They think the evil is defeated.\n\n4:Fast forward a little and everyone thinks its happily ever after but then the evil force comes back and does something nasty. The film ends.\n\nand adds some fun to it with shoddy dialog and acting and a very silly plot and you end up with something a lot more fun than the average depressing, predictable horror film. Also it is blessed with one of the most hilariously delivered lines in the history of cinema \"You can't pi ss on hospitality! I won't allow it!\" Anyway, in the end, yes, Troll 2 is still bad, so much so that it's almost good but it's not as hilarious as some crazy idiots make it out to be."

        "review_detailed_main": "Troll 2 has been cited as one of the worst movies ever or the father of bad movies and such. After finally seeing it, I have to concur. This film is dreadful, but because it is dreadful it is somewhat hilarious. The cinematography and editing are incredibly slip shod and the costumes of the trolls(or shall I say goblins) are quite horrible. The story also meanders all over the place, the script is abysmal and the direction is wretched. Then there is the poor pacing and atrocious acting, and any hopes of any thrills or scares are replaced with scatterings of unintentional laughs and often for the wrong reasons. Overall, it is a dreadful film, but it does have some unintentional entertainment value unlike some of the other bad movies I've seen. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie at least 4 times when I was sixteen years old. Every single time I watched it I found something else to despise about it. It's not that it's overly gory- I've seen much worse violence in cartoons. No, it's that the movie itself is just so horribly made, with no attempt to place any cohesive structure to the many subplots going on, not to mention the ALL TIME WORST DUBBING JOB IN HISTORY.(Was this made in Italy? For crimeny all over, Lucio Fulci was supposedly a hack of a director, but at least his dubbing sounded halfway real, and he used different colors for his gore.) Speaking of plots, the storyline is supposedly a sequel to the original \"Troll\" movie, (which in itself wasn't half-bad; I found that movie to have a decent story which was explained surprisingly competently and presented with decent, high quality stomach-churning effects, unlike this film which uses nothing but bright green gunk for EVERYTHING; blood, cake frosting, saliva- you name it, they've got it being used for it) but manages, whether intentionally or not, to have no plot ties to that film whatsoever. The acting is annoying, the main character is the most worthless child actor ever in existence, and the ending is just so stupid that it achieves the effect the director wanted- it sickens and horrifies you, but not because it's actually all that horrifying or sickening; it is solely because it's such a horrible waste of time. Overall, and hopefully I'm not giving anything away, the only saving grace of the movie is the popcorn feast/seduction/whatever in the motor home. That actually made me laugh for a bit, and forget for a second how terrible the rest of the film was, and would continue to be.\n\nTo wrap this up, if you truly want to know what a terrible movie is, I would suggest that you first see \"Glen or Glenda?\" by Ed Wood, and then watch this film- trust me, \"Glen or Glenda\" is going to seem like \"Citizen Kane\" after this tripe. The only successful thing about this movie is its complete ineptitude in almost every single aspect.\n\n-1 star, since they don't have that rating on the board. Truly satanic in its awfulness."

There are no actors, only people trying to act. And their attempts are beyond the pathetic. The kid on the box isn't even the same actor as in the movie !!\n\nHowever, there are some scenes that are soooo bad, they actually make you laugh. One of these is Joshua, a 9 year old boy, the \"hero\" of the movie, who takes a leak on diner in order to avoid the family eating the Goblin prepared food, that would turn them all into green jelly (does this make any sense ??). Anyways, thats not the funny part cause u dont see him actually doing it....The funny scene is when his dad punishes him : get this, he actually tells him \"I'm tightening my belt by one loop so i don't feel hunger pains, and your sister and mother will have to do the same\". Is this a script or what ???? How dumb does one have to be in order to write such KRAP ??\n\nI actually bought this movie in order to show it to all my m8.

There's no doubting Troll 2 has a charm about it, it's amusing in its silliness. And it's never boring. Troll 2 could never be accused of being dull. The acting is...well...You have the grandfather (Robert Ormsby) who not only looks like Orson Welles but, in what is Ormsby's only acting performance, is good enough to match the great man. The boy too is pretty good. Around them are cast 'actors' ranging from reasonable to outright ridiculous, as if they practised acting by watching re-runs of Scooby Doo. Some 'performances' seem to have been carved out of wood, the kind you'd find in an M Night Shyamalan film, but at a much lower price. The special effects... sometimes they're OK for a low budget movie, but mostly are moments of comedy genius, like the food which seems to have been created by 5-year-olds. The real stars of the show, though, are the trolls themselves, or goblins as they're known. Some of the masks are so hilariously bad you can't help but like them...and then there's one or two in particular...well you have to see it for yourself.

        "review_detailed_main": "In-crappy-credible. That's the word that comes to mind. How do movies like this get made? Was there no sane person on the set (never mind, they didn't have a set) who had the guts to tell Claudio Fragasso \"sorry mate, this just ain't gonna work, just give it up already before anyone gets hurt\"? Wow. That's all I can say. I truly cannot summarize how awful this movie is in words. But I'll try, anyway. I have to get this film out of my system before I go insane.\n\nTake some rednecks and ex-porn stars, throw them into some anonymous town in the middle of nowhere, slap a huge \"NILBOG\" sign on a pole, hire lots of dwarfs and some sh!tty costumes, and get the most over-the-top, annoying, washed-up Z-movie actress you can find to play the main antagonist, add a delusional kid who is almost as convincing as the thespian from \"Pod People\", and at least twice as irritating, and you have a movie. That's the Claudio Fragasso way!\n\nSo we have a kid actor with whom we're supposed to sympathize, but he's so bad I just wanted to hit him most of the time and tell him not to be such an overreacting little prick. Seriously, Joshua looks like someone is repeatedly kicking him in the groin whenever he tries to emote.\n\nUnbelievably, Joshua isn't the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua's mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed. She plays Creedence Leonore Gielgud in a way that makes it hard not to think that the nice men in white coats were waiting for Deborah after major shooting of the film had finished. This woman has the scariest eyes I've ever seen, they're constantly moving up and down, bulging in and out of their sockets so fast even Rodney Dangerfield would be scared. Her eyes are enough to almost distract you from her horrendous overacting, but only almost. Hearing her deliver her \"little flower\" speech makes you pine for the subtlety and depth of Vin Diesel. But enough about her.\n\nCan it get any worse? Actually it can, because suddenly a myriad of the aforementioned dwarfs - sorry, I meant goblins - appear. Think of an army of walking, oinking potatoes with bargain bin Halloween masks - those are the goblins. Sound scary yet? I thought so.\n\nKill me now. I thought the film couldn't get any dumber, but it did - suddenly Joshua realizes that \"NILBOG\" is actually \"GOBLIN\" spelled BACKWARDS!!! Yes, I'm stunned too. This truly is the most brilliant plot twist this side of M. Night Shyallaman. And so cleverly set up, too! I can assure you I did NOT see this coming, no siree. Gee whizz, what a shocker! All sarcasm aside, this is probably the part of the film where I completely lost it. The sheer look of shock on Joshua's face upon his revelation combined with the \"scary\" music (which was probably stolen from some Japanese TV show from the eighties, by the way) - this is unintentional comedy at its finest. And by \"finest\", I mean \"most painful\".\n\nSo, when all is said and done, what can we make of this movie? It's low budget, so badly acted you'll want to gouge your eyes out, unintentionally hilarious, blatantly homoerotic (Elliott having trouble choosing between his \"boys\" and his girlfriend, Elliott's \"boys\" sleeping half-naked next to each other) and it gave me the impression that Claudio Fragasso has a fetish for the colour green. In conclusion this film has very deservedly earned itself a position on the Bottom 100, and I'm still blown away by the fact that there are movies this irredeemably awful out there. My review has barely scratched on the surface of how awful this film is - it's worse than \"Red Zone Cuba\", worse than \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\", worse than \"Time of the Apes\"... and I wouldn't hesitate to say that it's *this* close to being as bad as \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" (interestingly enough, both films feature a hilarious scene in which the main characters inexplicably burst out in a chorus of \"Row your boat\"). My Bottom 100 marathon couldn't have ended on a higher note of badness and I'm happy to say that I survived this ordeal (Watching \"Bloodrayne\", \"Captain America\" and this in a row) without any extensive brain damage... or did I? Anyway, to any devoted fan of bad movies, this is truly appetizing... and provocative. To quote Arnold, one of Elliot's \"boys\": \"OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\""

Maybe it was. I did laugh a few times.\n\nWas this some kind of strange statement about vegetarians? Or meat? I didn't get it if so. We are treated to various bizarre sequences about meat and vegetables but it never really comes together at all.\n\nThe costumes are atrocious, designed by Laura 'Emmannuelle' Gemser. Porn star? Maybe. Costume designer? God no. Watch for the goblins, clearly little people or kids with masks. It was like they got the props from Party City, it's that bad.\n\nThe music, which has been a source of ridicule in reviews on here, was, at times terrible but it didn't stand out to me as overly bad. Perhaps it was overshadowed by worse elements.\n\nAll in all, \"Troll 2\" will have you scratching your head in amazement and questioning the sanity of all involved in the project.

Truly bizarre. There are no words that can convey just how bad this film is. I have taken a better standard of movie (with my mobile phone facing the mirror) called Nasal Triming! The plot, such as it is, revolves around Goblins, a suspicious town called Nilgob, Urine, Ectoplasm, the spirit of a deceased relative and Baloney Sandwichs. Just to add some randomness, surprisingly none of these elements bare any understandable or logical connection. The scriptwriter is clearly insane and hopefully has found some form of medication that will allow him to exist on the plain of reality as the rest of us. The cast offer creative talent easily surpassed by toe nail clippings and the Director, i believe, is running at least 7 part times jobs. Dumb."

I have no idea how Dances with Wolves won best picture with this film being made during the same year......The Oscars are Rigged!\n\nThere will never be a greater movie.....unless.....\n\nThey make a Troll 3!"

Production wise, nothing is done right. The music is completely unfitting, the camera angles are weird, the writing could have been done by an elementary school child, and the acting, wow, don't get me started. But all this somehow comes together to make a brilliant comedy. I recommend it to anyone who is willing see this movie as it is: a movie so bad, it's hilarious. It is definitely worth watching."

The movie is full of midgets/small children who are wearing plastic masks and burlap. There's lots of 'Double Dare'ish goo. It comes from everywhere: the actors' mouths, their headbands, everywhere. MST3K should do an episode of this. It's ripe... make that overripe. Anyway, I won't give a synopsis, but if you like worse than B movies, this is the movie for you."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't get the notoriety and the alleged \"so bad it's good\" fanfare of this film?\n\nOK I love bad movies. Specifically I love unintentional comedies in the Action/Martial Arts genre.\n\nWhether it is a proper Hollywood production with Swarzenegger (Commando), Van Damme (Street Fighter) Chuck Norris (The Delta Force) or some obscure undiscovered VHS gold starring ? (Deadly Prey) (Lady Terminator).\n\nWithout sounding a hypocrite I discovered a good laugh by scraping the barrel with Undefeatable (check out \"best fight scene ever\" on YouTube) and the pant wettingly funny Samurai Cop.\n\nMost of the above films have one thing in common. Foreign film makers directing Western \"actors\" with hilarious consequences- odd plot quirks and really bad acting- and an abuse of film-making conventions.\n\nAvid film buffs, media studies students and fans of late night movies with 4 tins of beer tend to lap up these type of films.\n\nHowever there is a new sub branch fanbase of these types of films that casual fans of bad movie wince at. Anti-social YouTube reviewers (shudder), nerdy blog posters (Cinema Snob) and other friendless, weirdo basement dweller types who do video reviews that are as long as the film itself. Why? You might as well go and watch the film, download it, rent it or buy from the bargain bin at the DVD store. But what makes it worse is their odd choices of \"bad movies\" that just aren't funny- they're downright boring.\n\nOne of these films is Troll 2. I only made it to the 48 minute mark and after pausing the film for the 4th time I switched it off. The film isn't that badly made- its a very average straight to VHS low budget horror flick. Sure the make up effects are atrocious even by late 80s, horror standards but we're all familiar with people using them in their profile pictures on public chat forums- whatever humour has been lost. As for the acting and scripting there is little in Troll 2 you didn't get in any other straight to VHS horror- waiting to be exhumed and used in \"viral\" Gifs, Internet humour and (excuse the pun) trolling message boards with weird stills from the film.\n\nA bit like when \"The Room\" came out with Tommy Wiseau. Whilst so many geek film critics thought that film was hilarious; I didn't. In my opinion that was just like the bad unsexy \"erotic\" made-for-TV thrillers of the early 90's\n\nIn summary don't waste your life watching Troll 2. If you thought the infamous \"Oh myyyyyyyyyy godddddddd\" scene was the most hilarious thing you've ever seen a) you've lived a sheltered life b) you don't know was real bad acting is c) that was the highlight of the film's \"comedy\" so no need to watch any more"

At first glance a sub-Z-grade continuity abomination, this fine fine example of direct-to-video hysteria is a nonstop explosion of genius disguised as ineptitude. Grade-schooler Joshua is visited by the protective ghost of his Grandpa Seth, who warns him that his family's vacation destination of Nilbog (.) may be worth avoiding. But there's no changing dad's mind, and soon the whole family is knee-deep in black magic and nefarious villagers, including the remarkably abnormal `Sheriff Gene Freak'. Joshua and his dead grandpa are the only ones aware of their mortal danger, which Joshua at one point attempts to curb by urinating all over the dinner table. Not bad for PG-13. Worth noting is the fact that `trolls' aren't mentioned once in the film, while the threat of goblins remains all too real. Directed by `Drago Floyd', who was actually Claudio Fragasso, a low-rent auteur from the initial home video exploitation tidal wave of the late 1980s. Fragasso most importantly directed Alice Cooper in MONSTER DOG, but also made a significant mark by writing TERMINATOR II in 1989. No, not TERMINATOR 2 with Arnold Schwarzennegar.the other one, starring, uh, nobody."

I remember being SUPER disappointed when I watched this because it was nothing at all like the original. But I watched it, and I remember thinking that it was a lot like a Goosebumps episode, or Are you Afraid of the Dark. I didn't hate it, but I didn't ever think I would watch it again. Then I saw the documentary \"The Best Worst Movie\". I watched it and was thoroughly entertained. I really liked it, and remembered watching this film as a young dude in the 90s. I decided to revisit it and laugh at it a bit. I was surprised when I watched it. Was it great? Not even close. But I had the same feeling when I watched it the first time, that it's no worse than an episode of the 90s Goosebumps tv show. I have seen a lot... A LOT of bad horror films. I love horror and I appreciate even the bad ones. This is nowhere near the worst film ever made. The sound quality is great. The camera work is better than you'd think. The acting is a whole other issue, though. I thought the dad did a good job. And I liked the guy who ran the shop, and the queen goblin lady was over the top, but good. People give this film too much credit in the \"worst film\" category. It's not good, but it's far from the worst film ever made. But it's entertaining and entirely watchable. I would go to one of the screenings or parties or whatever that people throw for this movie and re-watch it in a heartbeat.\n\nNot a great film. But nowhere near the worst film ever. Give it a go."

Good acting will not be allowed, even for those of you who can actually act. As to the script, turn your manuscripts upside down and read then backwards. A total of $7.35 will go towards costumes and special effects. Not a penny more. The most expensive item in making the movie was the damn motor home. If we had it to do over we should have used pup-tents, and saved the extra money to buy beer for the crew. Unfortunately, as it is, there isn't enough money to buy beer.\n\nAll in all, it's a really horrible movie and I hope saying that hasn't violated the 'contain spoilers', clause, because horrible is the only thing good about it."

You either get it or you don't. You either see all the wonderful awfulness in Ed Wood's movies or you just see crap and get bored. Well, there are so MANY other Ed Woods out there - like Al Adamson, Arthur Marks, etc. But TROLL 2 rises to the top - directed by an Italian who sometimes uses the screen name Drake Floyd - they shot it in Utah using local \"talent\". Now let's talk about the \"talent\" - this is without a doubt - the worst acting I have ever seen captured on film - and it is a battle of suckiness between the teenage daughter and the evil villainess. They both reach levels of overacting and facial expressions that makes one fall to the floor. The film is a mess - a disturbed little boy who keeps seeing his dead grandfather while nobody else does - is worried that goblins are trying to kill him and his family - the family goes away on a vacation to Nilsbog (get it - goblins spelled backwards)where all the townsfolk act strange and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-like - seems people are fed plant stuff that actually turns them into plants and then the goblins eat the people/plants - and they actually try to throw in some Stone Henge plot b.s. The goblins are just dwarfs wearing the worst paper mache masks you ever saw. The other stunning thing about this movie is that acting is awful across the board. We loved it - we howled with delight at every bad line of script, ever piece of eye bulging and scenery-chewing - so if you enjoy cinematic cheese - seek this baby out. You won't be sorry.

I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just mention that it slowly crept to the bottom of the barrel with pace and content and dug itself into the slime when it became clear that something was missing.

The actors are awful and obviously no where near professionals, the special effects are goofy, the writing is perplexing and alien, the story is strange and oddly anti vegetarian, the camera-work is clunky and awkward (the cameraman really needs to lay off tapping the zoom in/zoom out button every few seconds), and the end result is a messy, bubbling cauldron of so bad it's strange surrealism. Every detail is so off and some moments are so pointless and confusing that they defy explanation. It is obvious the creators of this film are borderline insane and have no idea how movies work, but that's the beauty of it. That's why it is so successfully awful and so bizarrely funny, because of the obliviousness of a distinctly foreign filmmaker attempting to make an American monster movie and failing with miserable hilarity. It's an experience, no doubt, and is the only film I can say truly deserves both a 1 and a 10 star rating."

The director must have been tone deaf among other things, or he was actually trying to make the worse film possible. The delivery of dialogue is almost painful to listen to, the mother especially.\n\nMy friends think it's so bad that its funny, I just think this film is utterly vile, and for the most part unwatchable, I rarely have to get-up to get away from a film for purely its technical matters, such as dialogue, lighting and such, but this one is definitely one of them.\n\nThe special effects are an utter joke, but some of the more observant may recognize the same goblin costumes from other low budget fantasy films, one of which was based on the myth of Siegfried, but the title escapes me at the moment.\n\nWatch at your own risk, some may laugh at the film's utter lack of merit, others may just cringe and squirm uncomfortably, unable to watch out of a sheer sense of embarrassment."

        "review_detailed_main": "'kay, it's like this... Grandpa Seth comes back from the dead to tell his grandson Joshua Waites a bedtime story about goblins, which is really lucky because Josh and his family are going to spend a vacation in the deceptively-named town of Nilbog, in some other family's house. Along the way they sing mom's favorite song \"Row Row Row Your Boat\" and Josh gets out to pee but ends up talking to a homeless man instead, who is Grandpa Seth in disguise. His family have no problem with this. They are also followed by Holly's boyfriend Elliott and his two mates, who sleep in the same bed without their shirts on.\n\nGrandpa Seth stops time so Joshua can pee on their food. Sadly that's all the food left for them and they didn't bring any, so dad and Josh have to go into town the next day to buy some. Joshua accidentally stumbles into a church where the goblins look like people and try to make him eat ice-cream. Elliott's mate is pursued by goblins but because they are NOT people-shaped they can't catch him so they throw a spear at him. He enters the house of Frankenfurter's understudy Creedence Leonore Gielgud, who turns him into a tree. The other friend gets sick off vitamin A enriched milk and stumbles into Creedence's house but he can't move the pot his friend is in so she drowns him in popcorn by eating a corn cob with him. Or something - I'm going by memory and I didn't concentrate hard enough while I was watching this.\n\nMeanwhile the townsfolk (in people suits again) stand and stare at the Waites menacingly until they barricade themselves into the house. They try coaxing them out again by throwing sandwiches on the porch in a threatening manner. Joshua takes charge by performing a s\u00e9ance (he must have done a few of them) which involves lighting every candle they could find. The goblins chase them into Creedence's house where a rock from Stonehenge has somehow materialized. I think I've skipped bits. Do you care? Grandpa Seth returns from the dead one last time to give Joshua a triple-decker bologna sandwich which makes the goblins scream in agony when they watch him eat it. The Waites family kill Creedence and the goblins by concentrating on Stonehenge with their hands. Elliott becomes part of the family just for being there. There's a surprise twist at the end, because nobody expects something random to happen at the end of THIS movie. Academy Award nominations, sadly, did not follow."

        "review_detailed_main": "Out of all the movies I have seen which have been dubbed \"worst\" movie of all time, Troll 2 (1990) is by far the most fun. While Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) has its charm and The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961) has its mercifully short run time, Troll 2 has everything going for it if it wanted to be a parody of 1980's creature features. Everything about it is brimming with cheesiness and over the top goofiness, from the acting, the special effects and even the story itself.\n\nTroll 2 begins with a family poised to swap houses with a family from a faraway town called Nilbog, so they can get in some vacation time. Joshua (Michael Stephenson) is still reeling from the recent death of his grandfather and sees his ghost constantly. Meanwhile Holly (Connie Young) the older sister, is trying to have some fun with her boyfriend (Jason Wright) but keeps getting interrupted by his interchangeable trio of friends. When the family travels to Nilbog, with the teenage boys following behind in a camper, Joshua picks up on some ominous signs in and around their new vacation home and discovers there are goblins trying to eat them.\n\nThe principle unintended laughter is directed towards the lackluster special effects by D. Christopher Salmon and Co. many times during the movie the goblins that appear on the screen look like little people frocked with dirty sheets and topped off with paper mache masks. Not to be outdone however, Actress Deborah Reed chews the scenery like a starving child on a cracker as the goblin queen. Every facial expression and emotion is carried through her off-kilter eyebrow movements and phony Eastern European accent and played to those in the cheap seats. There was more ham in her performance than a bologna sandwich.\n\nEvery other actor fails spectacularly to bring any life out of their characters though it didn't help that they were propped by a horrid script written by Claudio Fragasso and Rossella Drudi. The dialogue was ridiculously stilted and there were enough plot holes to strain spaghetti through the celluloid. Yet despite the filmmaker's blatant incompetence not once was I bored watching Troll 2.\n\nIn fact I would rather watch Troll 2 again then sit through the original and tangentially related prequel Troll (1986). That movie made the fatal mistake of being boring and forgetful while Troll 2 is an entertaining train wreck of biblical proportions from start to finish.\n\nThose curious to see Troll 2 need not be worried by its unseemly reputation. There is no need for a Mystery Theater 3000 (1988-1999) dubbing since the hilarity is up-close and holds your attention. A must watch for film buffs and a fun filled Saturday Z-Movie night for the rest of us. Just make sure no one you invite to your Troll party is a vegetarian.\n\nhttp://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

It's a 10/10 good bad movie, along the lines of other great titles such as The Room and Samurai Cop (which I recommend). The hammy acting, the practical effects, unintentionally hilarious scenes and the many quotable lines make for such a fun time.\n\nYou may have heard about this movie and it's talked about for a reason. To sum up, I highly recommend.\n\nThe movie is all about a family leaving their house in the city to try leading a farmer life in a small town called Nilbog. That's where shenanigans ensue involving some nasty little monsters. This is the base set up, but the dynamic between the characters, hammy acting, like mentioned before, and the dialogue are what help give this movie a different flavor. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but being a GOOD BAD flick, you can expect to get a good laugh. ;-)"

I grew up watching \"B\" movies in the 50's , but I would classify this one as a \"D\", and that's putting it kindly. So I would recommend it for sheer amazement and disbelief. If you like this one you might like \"Tourist Trap\", and I just read they are remaking \"Motel Hotel\". I guess I often wondered why none of the cast in Troll 2 were never seen again. You know you're in trouble when your effeminate sounding father announces you're going to your \"timeshare\" in \"Nilbog\" I think Troll was better, especially the little toadstool/lampshade guy."

As to exactly why they do this is never really made that clear, (I doubt anyone cares anyway). Anywhow, after some painful drawn-out scenes, including a disturbing dialog exchange between Mom and Dad, the family eventually set off for their new home - a town called \"Nilbog\".\n\nLike a teen-novel, we see things from the youngest kid's unheard and somewhat ignored point-of-view. His performance is as good as it was ever going to be, but nevertheless it is very trying and more than occasionally annoying. Being the only member of the family with the ability to see his grandfather's ghost, he is viewed as unbelievable and hysterical by his naive and idiotic family.\n\nThe film forces us to wade through the messy plot and inexcusable deus ex machinas as they are lumped on to one another. By the end, the whole plot has become unglued, the characters unwelcome, and worst of all the good and evil voices of the film are watered-down - nothing is suspenseful, frightening or even remotely original, (again like a poor teen-novel).\n\nThe worst crime this film commits is that it undermines it's own invention. The trolls of the title, I suppose, are the goblins in the film. They are never dangerous or threatening. In fact, their powers seem to weaken throughout the film (I suppose this was one lazy and easy way of giving the \"good-guys\" their strength). For example, towards the end of the film, there is a siege-type situation in the family are trapped in their own house, surrounded by the goblin/townspeople. Exactly why the townspeople (who vastly outnumber the family) don't just enter the house and kill them all is illogical, incredible and frustrating.\n\nRegular viewers should ignore this film, while C or D grade enthusiasts will only give mixed responses at best."

I can't say worst, because I genuinely love everything about this movie, so let me just say that it displays some of the most nonsensical writing, acting, music, effects, etc., etc., in film history. One individual from the documentary Best Worst Film sums it up perfectly, basically saying that what makes the movie so enjoyable is precisely that it is so bad, but that it is still so obviously pure. The movie was not made cynically, or just to turn a quick buck. The people involved actually believed in what they were making. This movie, for me, is along the same lines as Jaws: the Revenge, Escape from New York, or They Live. It goes so far past bad that it become good again. Truly good. And one of the most absolutely entertaining cinematic experiences you can possibly have."

Troll II contains some unforgettable scenes: the popular dinner table set piece, Grandpa Seth's lesson in fire-starting, the priests' sermon on meat, etc.\n\nAlso, entertaining characters such as the child hero Joshua, his deceased-but-back-to-save-the-day Grandpa Seth, Creedence the local witch, the sexy Holly, the air-head Elliot and his boys, the generous Sheriff Gene Freak, Grandpa Seth's friend who used to live in Hell (whom, by the way, taught him a very useful trick), and of course the goblins themselves.\n\nThe films' use of foreshadowing is, also, very effective (eg, On the way to Nilbog Diane exclaims, with sandwich in hand, \"Speaking of hungry, WANT SOME ,JOSHUA?\". Also, look for the big bowl of apples in the middle of the table during the dinner scene).\n\nThe above may sound silly, but it's different and in every respect of the word: FUN! While being a clever spoof, the film also provides chills of it's own; younger viewers beware.\n\nSo, if you're watching Troll II and find yourself saying \"I can't...I can't move(!), why?\", it's probably because you're having a good time."

And it has Creedence the Druid. Creedence the Druid sets a standard for over-the-top-screamingly-godawful acting that may never be exceeded unless they make Manos 2: The Reckoning with Richard Simmons as Torgo.\n\nAnd you only THINK that nothing could top the mutant sheep fetus in Godmonster of Indian Flats for flaky plot points. How about - vegetarian shape-shifting trolls, identifiable in human form by shamrock-shaped warts?\n\nCrappy FX? How about lime jello and green food coloring used as...no, you won't believe it, nor the use of a double baloney sandwich as an offensive weapon.\n\nGotta see this one, folks. This isn't a bad movie because it's incredibly boring, or because MST got hold of it, or because all the major critics hated it.

        "review_detailed_main": "What do you get when you mix bad acting, a horrible script, and a dozen goofy rubber goblin masks? Troll 2. The only rule you must keep in mind while watching is attempt at a movie is: DON'T ASK WHY. If you are confused, just remember that the actors probably were too.\n\nThe first thing you must accept is that the title of this movie is `Troll 2,' but there are no trolls mentioned anywhere, just goblins. The ONLY connection I can make from the first film is that people do turn into green pods. The next piece of garbage to swallow is the idea that the family is taking a vacation through an `exchange program' where they switch homes with someone in the country. The star, a young boy named Josh, has the weight on his shoulders of not only being the hero, but also being the best actor as well. His mother, who seems to only have one facial expression, forces Josh to sing her favorite song (Row, Row, Row Your Boat) during the car ride to Nilbog. The father is an idiot, and the teen sister delivers her lines as if she had just read them before filming the scene and then there's Grandpa Seth, the family ghost who tries to help them. Trailing the family van is the sister's boyfriend, Elliot, and his friends to look for `liberated Nilbog girls.' In one of her best lines, Holly warns Elliot `If my father knew you were here he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them!' Thank God none of these people had much of a film career afterwards.\n\nThe family arrives in the practically deserted and oh-so-clever titled town of Nilbog and meet with the family who they are exchanging homes with. Right away, Josh recognizes that something is wrong and his fears are confirmed when he receives a message from the goblins written on a baseball (???). The family sits down to eat food that looks like it has been covered in mold as Grandpa Seth appears to tell Josh that the food will turn them into goblins food and he will stop time for 30 seconds for Josh to do something. Torn, Josh stands on his chair crying `I must do it!' while unzipping his pants. The angry father carries Josh upstairs to deliver one of his great lines `You can't p**s on hospitality - I won't allow it!' and tightens his belt a loop while challenging his young son to a hunger strike.\n\nElliot's friends (who he sleeps naked with?) head out one by one looking for food, but don't realize that coffee is the devil's drink in Nilbog. Arnold believes that there must be `a logical explanation for all of this,' but the only explanation I can think of is that the script was the result of a drug-induced hallucination. Grandpa Seth can stop time, but just can't seem to find Josh's room in the house, the father falls asleep outside the general store while looking at a cookbook, and Josh overhears the townspeople complaining about the `smelly bladders' of humans. When the family is confronted by the townspeople with more Nilbog food, one of Grandpa Seth's solutions is - of course - to give his young grandson a molotov cocktail! And what about Elliot's friends? Forget about them, it is obvious that the director certainly has towards the end.\n\nOf course, the best part of this movie is the end, which is fairly anti-climatic, but hilarious. Afterwards, the movie pretty much drops off without much explanation to an even more `shocking' ending. Amazingly enough, the director made this 93 minute fiasco seem like an eternity, but don't let any of this deter you. If you love watching bad flicks, don't hesitate to run out to your video store now searching for it. The entertainment you receive from the interesting love scene with corn is worth the rental fee alone. In my opinion this one belongs right up there next to `Manos.'"

The first time I saw it, I simply sat there with my mouth agape at the incomprehensible dialogue, the pathetic acting, the grade-school costuming. However, I may advise you that it does get better with multiple viewings, as you start to see more of the subtle nuances of the badness. For instance, in most other movies I can single out one or a few actors who are not good. In this movie, the best actors are the extras. From the hideous mugging of Joshua, to the bizarre lines of Sheriff Gene Freak, no one comes out unscathed. Especially bad are the mom, who shouts all her lines in a grating monotone, and her daughter, who dances for no reason and has a love/hate relationship with her quasi-homosexual boyfriend. As in, she loves him in one scene, and hates him...in the same scene. But then, I haven't gotten into the goblins.\n\nYes, Troll 2 has no trolls at all. These are goblins (\"spiteful, and impudent\", the 'wise' Grandpa Seth explains), also known as squat burlap-sack-clad midgets with Wal-Mart $2.95 Halloween masks and work gloves. Of course they don human disguises for most of the movie, because this is easier to film. They are led by Deborah Reed as Creedence, who rivals Jon Voight of Anaconda and John Steiner of Sinbad of the Seven Seas for my hilarious overacting award. They are vegetarians who listen to intricate sermons on the evils of meat-by-products, while still loving to eat people, just so long as they're \"purified\" by dry-ice concoctions or green-toothpasted food. Which, by the way, none of the family finds strange in the slightest. Green corn-on-the-cob? Sure, eat it every day. No problem.\n\nI won't spoil the magnificent ending for you here (though many have already) except to say it nullifies the entire struggle against the goblins up to that point. Which I suppose is indicative of this entire movie. It's pointless to the nth degree, but I love it. If you like bad movies, you will too. Heed the advice of Grandpa Seth. They can. They CAN!!!"

Sweet lord I'm gonna get to watch this film!! I pay for it (along with two other lousy movies (Making Contact and The Brain).

Mike is dressed seductivly like the witch trying to seduce Tom with the ear of corn. (If you saw this film you'd get the gag). Oh the possibilities.... I found my jokes flying out ripping this film to shreds.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this for any MST3K at home parties for fans.

The acting is truley appalling, along with the direction, editing, art direction and camera. But there is some shots in their that made me laugh, which helps its cause. I love terrible films, and this is a terrible film. Which does feature the most fantastic skateboarding scene since back to the future. The story is unbelievable! And the goblin's costumes are pathetic! Its great! The film features so many great lines. \"Want some, Joshua!\" I cant be bothered writing a detailed review, but if you enjoy a bad movie and your not a moron that always has their head up their own a**e, you'll enjoy this a lot."

The acting is the absolute worst. The plot is so stupid, you wonder if there was a script, or if they just got out a camera and started filming. The dinner scene, the scene where the kid realizes Nilbog is goblin backwards(which happens after his dad tells him that people in small towns go to bed early in the afternoon, then proceeds to fall asleep on a bench while reading a vegetable cookbook), the scene where the guy runs (literaly) into town to buy milk but ends up eating a green hamburger and turning into a puddle of goo, they are all brilliant.

It is an extraordinarily badly acted movie with excruciatingly terrible special effects and a plot that would make Ed Wood cringe. I'm perplexed by the fact that this movie was never used on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" The one good thing about this movie is that it is so terrible that it's hilarious.

I just see Warwick Davis and pals hobbiling around in Jo Ann Fabric baby pajamas with Walmart masks over their faces. We also have the opening scene, which features absolutely heartripping suspense as Gunter the Nazi Postchild, gets jiggy with some random babe in the woods named Hildegard. She gives him some Vegan concoction, spiked with acid, which transforms her appearance into something closely resembling an Ewok. Suddenly, Gunter finds himself consumed by tiny fury munchkins, all angrily bent on destroying him and conquering the world or something. Really Really bad. Every scene in this movie, sucks. All the actors, suck. It's really funny. If you can find this gem at your local video store, save it for the next party.

        "review_detailed_main": "We can't imagine what circumstances lead to this movie being made. Did somebody lose a bet? Honestly, where did they find these actors, we have a few theories. Theory 1 - These \"actors\" happened to send their \"Win a Starring Roll in Troll 2\" cards back first. Theory 2 - The Casting Director stumbled through K-mart in a drunken stupor slurring \"Who wants to be in a movie\" Theory 3 - when the budget got tight, the Director was forced to employ his babysitter, his paperboy, his hairdresser and his cousin in starring roles. Theory 4 - these people didn't even realize they were being taped.\n\nThere is so much wrong with this filth its hard to know where to begin. Lets start with the ridiculous plot. The family exchange program was just ludicrous. How hurting was this family for a vacation that they would agree to such a ridiculous idea. The food issue was also a bogus idea. The family didn't eat for three days and didn't even seem to notice. They also didn't seem to care that all the food was bright green including the butter on the corn and rolls. While we're on the subject of food, we should mention a scene that should've been left on the cutting room floor. I'm speaking of the scene in which the witch seduces the teenage boy with none other than corn on the cob. The scene proceeds to have minimum wage stage hand throwing handfuls of popcorn from behind the camera.\n\nNow the sister in the movie's acting deserves a paragraph all by itself. It had to be the worst display of acting ever, a few choice words to describe her performance would be - horrible, lurid, loathsome, appalling, nausiating, awful. I think she would've faired better in a high school play that was thrown together in a week. We also found it utterly annoying how Joshua and his sister referred to each other as \"Big Sister\" and \"Little Brother\". Who talks like this? It's almost as if the screenwriter forgot to proof-read or the actors were just told to make up their lines as they went along. Maybe the writers just worked on the script during the 4 days that this movie was being filmed.\n\nFinally the costumes looked like something you would pick-up the day before Halloween at Family Dollar when all the other costumes were gone. To wrap things up there were a lot of things just unnecessary with this film. The gruesome use and abuse of green food-coloring and sweat plagued this film. The ridiculous scenes involving a bologna sandwich and Joshua urinating on the food were just plain stupid. Without giving away the ending we can honestly say it reeks. After watching this \"movie\" we had to take long showers to cleanse ourselves from the memories of Troll 2."

It had many random scenes which made no sense, like the dance sequence which has nothing to do with anything. The corn seduction, which again has nothing to do with anything.

The man by the name of Joe D'Amato, of Anal Perversions of Lolita fame, created this masterpiece that deserves a place alongside the great films of our time.\n\nThe story involves a house exchange program in which a family from the country switches places with a family from the city. Although this occurs often without incident it seems this time something went wrong. It's a good thing that dead Grandpa Seth is around to help out when the sh*t hits the fan with that sage advice for which he's known. Joshua, our hero, tries to warn his family of the threat of attack by the goblins of Nilbog but the family pays no mind. When good old dead Grandpa Seth gives 9 year old Joshua a molotov cocktail to play around with the truth about the goblins becomes apparent. Needless to say that this film achieves a level of genius so far unmatched in the film industry. Joe D'Amato was working on a level in which few of us could hope to understand. But for those of us who believe in the true beauty of film, Troll 2 holds a special place in our heart. And as Grandpa Seth said, \"No I'm not in hell but I knew someone who was there once.\" Genius!"

The first \"Troll\" film I absolutely hated but this is firmly in the \"so bad it's good\" category.\n\nMichael Waits (George Hardy) takes his family on a home swap holiday, so they can experience a rural farming community for the summer. Michael's son Joshua (Michael Stephenson) is contacted by the ghost of his late grandfather (Robert Ormsby) and warned that Goblins have poisoned the food, with the intention of changing the family into a plant like matter which they then consume. Joshua manages to destroy all the food and temporarily save his family, but his sister's boyfriend Elliot (Jason Wright) and his friends - who have decided to follow the family on the holiday - are not so lucky.\n\nDespite their connections being tenuous at best, it's hard not to compare this film with its predecessor, in which case this is a hundred times better. It's certainly a low budget film, and that's evident in the questionable acting and ropey effects - but it leans into this for camp effect and it's fun and both intentionally, though more often unintentionally funny. I have to give some special praise to Deborah Reed, who plays Creedence, the witch who rules over the goblins. She's magnificently over the top and magnetic when she was on screen. I'm not going to lie, I was into her well before her \"glow up\" scene.\n\nThe music is a little strange, it's all synthesiser turns, and I wonder if the band Goblin from the Argento/Romero soundtracks were an inspiration. It doesn't fit subtly with the on-screen actions.\n\nI'm not normally one that goes in for ironic appreciation of anything, but I genuinely enjoyed watching \"Troll 2\" even though it's a failure on every technical level you can imagine."

The acting was probably the worst thing about the whole movie. No one in the movie had any clue how to act. Another terrible thing about this movie is the goblin costumes, ( Thats right, goblins there are no trolls in this movie.) Anyway they look like midgets dressed up in costumes made by second-graders. Not to mention the movies special effects were probably made on of a budget of like $50.00. The music dosen't even match up with whats going on. So if you are considering renting this movie then RECONSIDER. This movie dosen't even deserve to be on the shelves of blockbuster."

Now if everyone who loves this movie like i do rates it 1 we can make it the worst movie of all time... yay. Woah this is sad. If anyone does not love this movie I hate you and I hope you eat some strange green oatmeal!

If this had been serious, it would have been just plain terrible. but the way they made it, it was terrible but so memorable too. There is not a moment in this movie to make anyone think it is good, and it could be the best bad movie ever. I know it's clich\u00e9, but it fits for this trash. The acting, writing, plot, effects, and everything you can think of are horrible. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.

This is has a very good comedic effect.\n\nBesides the poorly written dialog, the movie is pretty trashy and boring. There are a couple stand out appearances that are funny because of the actor or because of the acting. I'm referring to the shopkeeper and the daughter in the movie.\n\nThe film is quite incoherent. The editing and flow is really terrible. This doesn't really carry a comedic effect like the other flaws, its just bad. The camera-work isn't too bad. Not sure why this gets complaints. I guess people just like to complain about every possible thing there is to complain about in a bad movie."

The plot makes Twilight look like Godfather (Yes I really did say that) The choice dialogue is bonkers The character actions are mind boggling! Most of the actors are either over the top or not trying at all Music is repetitive all throughout Lamest confrontation ever Biggest \"What the heck!\" ending ever!\n\nThis movie makes me want to study the writers and analyze what they could have been thinking when designing the script. Every scene has at least 5 things wrong with it from horrendous acting, repeating words twice in the same sentence/paragraph, the timing, the \"action\", the character choices, just everything!! I don't even know how many stars to give this thing, because it's somehow the best worst movie I've ever seen in my life; somehow topping The Room!

Off how, you ask? Kind of peculiar? A bit bizarre? A mind-blowingly awkward sin against common sense? Yeah, that's the one. Troll 2 isn't just another bad movie with bad acting, and zero atmosphere, there's something else going on here. Anyway, Kid is being told a bedtime story, about goblins, by dead-Grandpa, come to think of it, that's what Troll 2 is all about... yeah!! Goblins!! Dead-Grandpa disappears when other family members show up, possibly because kid's acting is the only one he can stand, really, the other family members are really something special. Speaking of Goblins, they've tricked kid's family into temporarily trading houses with another family from a town called Nilbog. Well, nuts to that, kid says. Unfortunately, the family is quite keen on the idea, so it's off to Nilbog to hopefully, not be eaten by Goblins... yeah, Goblins!!\n\nAnd what about Troll 1, you ask? Well, what about it? I haven't seen it, I don't watch much mainstream. This practical joke on celluloid has nothing to do with it, whatever it is, they just picked a money-making title at random. In all my years of searching,Troll 2 is only the third worst movie I've come across. If you care, or don't believe me, or are just insane, check out Zombie '90 (#2) and The Chooper (#1) for experiences still not as strange as this one, but worse, nonetheless. Ultimately, I walked away from this one with a smile. Bewildered to hell and back, but smiling, because when the complete and utter shock wore off, I came to realize, I not only witnessed something too strange for words, but also, something too hilarious for words (almost). If you're looking for a new level, as well as a new type of badness, then this garbage from another dimension might be for you. How would one rate Troll 2? How am I supposed to know? I don't even know what the hell I just watched, so let's just let this one be.\n\nThere are rumors of a sequel entitled Troll 2: Part II... I repeat, Troll 2: Part II. and in case you were wondering, Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards. No, really!"

Sounds good?...Read on.\n\nI'll start my negatives on the acting. This has some of the worst acting I've ever experienced. Every line said has no emotion whatsoever, and it's as though they got these people off the street. The best actor was the little boy who is one of the worst child actors I've ever experienced.\n\nNow onto the effects. They were some of the worst I've ever seen. I guess this was on a $5 dollar budget or something. The trolls were all midgets in fat little suits with really lame looking troll costume heads. In a particularly brainless scene, a girl turned into a witch comes onto a boy and they have an ear of corn in each other's mouth and popcorn starts coming at them(???) They were about as scary as something from an Ed Wood movie!\n\nThe direction was all over the place. The camera-work was awful and shaky and I just hated it! The writing was just as bad as the acting, and this was one of the weirdest, stupidest things ever. I guess there were trolls, and witches and the witches turns people into trees or something(?)\n\nIt was awful, don't see it unless you want to make fun of it, which is why I own this film. It is really hilarious, and would have been better off being released as a comedy. The worst line has to be, \"Grampa Seth is still with us in our hearts, but we must banish him from our minds.\"\n\nPG-13 for lame green blood. 93 mins. 0/100."

In comparison to the film street fighter, this film is something of such greatness, that it could only have been crafted by God or some other omnipotent being. The acting was some of the best work I have seen since The Godfather and the screenplay was scary, witty and brilliantly written.\n\nI have seen the 'conventional' greats like Shawshank redemption and Creep, but no film can stand up to this thing of beauty."

His dialogue might have worked in Italian, but translated to english, it sounds unnatural. And then his expectations of the actors, they're really over-actors for this one. Bizarre moments. Unexpected hilarity. I like the part where the deceased Grandpa says 'I'll distract them with this' holding a fire extinguisher. I'm pretty sure the fact that he was dead and is now alive will be pretty distracting, hahaha. The witch troll lady was a bit much, I found it really hard to watch her scenes, so I fast forwarded whenever she was on there. This movie doesn't surpass The Room for quotable hilarity, but it's still a fun watch."

There are many reasons why to hate this movie (or better yet, don't see this crap!) 1) It has NOTHING to do with Trolls. Only Goblins, there isn't even any mention of Trolls in this movie. Possibly it was in production of 'Goblins' but it was so awful they couldn't even distribute it with it's own name 2) NOTHING to do with the First Troll, which I found quite amusing. Like I said, there was probably not enough money from \"Drake Floyd's\" pocket that he couldn't make it unless he made this a crappy sequel 3) AWFUL acting. It's worse than a middle-school play. The acting is so laughable you won't believe it, I saw that most of the actors weren't really actors at all and those that were real actors were uncredited for being A PRODUCTION Assistant FOR THIS CRAP! 4) DREADFULLY Hideous cinematography. It's constantly shaking and it gets SO annoying AND STOOPID, (a word to describe the entire film) 5) It's so gay, literally. The Grandpa's burning in hell and the older sisters' 'boyfriend' has homosexual friends that are into 'group bi-sex' 6) The music is...oh dear, it gives you the worst mood in the worst way Avoid this movie. If it's on TV, watch it only if you're BORED and I mean BORED. Overall it sucks and I can see why John Carl wasn't credited in this film; HE DIDN'T WANT HIS CAREER RUINED"

        "review_detailed_main": "You can worship La Dolce Vita, Citizen Kane, The Seventh Seal and all the great films of the 20th Century, but can they really measure up to this? Troll 2 is the ultimate cinematic experience in it's complete disregard for anything that has gone before. The film pays absolutely no regard for cinematic convention, eschewing the tried and tested structural values of film-making for a pseudo absurdist approach that leaves the viewer disorientated and confused.\n\nIt is in this state that one can draw all the cathartic and didactic meaning from this film: one the one hand, that nothing makes sense, so why bother living at all, on the other, wasting your time watching films of this nature will instill a feeling of 'Carpe Diem' and make one live their life to the full. The genius of Troll 2 is that literally every single line of dialogue has infinite meaning and none at all simultaneously. Your sanity, reason for existence and destiny are all questioned when watching this film, merely by assessing your own state while viewing.\n\nBut this film is not just brilliant in a metaphorical and symbolic way, the events themselves allow us to question our own frail time on this mortal coil we call life. Take Grampa Seth's transportation through the mirror, a metaphor for the fear of death and it's importance in holding us back from what we want to do. Or Holly's dance sequence, highlighting the frailty of 'woman'. The 'trolls' themselves, goblins who look exactly like us - suggesting that perhaps vegetarian goblins lurk within all our souls. Perhaps the most important moment is the sweetcorn sex scene - the ultimate metaphysical erotic battle between vegetable and human in one scintillating image.\n\nThe script of Troll 2 reads not unlike playwrights such as Shakespeare, or the poetry of Milton. It's multifaceted, almost impenetrable mask of mystique is T S Eliot's legacy on film, combined with the homo-erotic subplots associated with the Elisabethans in the form of Eliot and his friends experiences. The camper van itself is a symbol of youth and dubious sexuality, combined with milk based imagery later on we see the microcosmic journey through existence that is at the essence of humanity.\n\nTroll 2, in short, is the sum of our hopes and fears, what is to be human, depicted perfectly on screen. The final scene illustrates this best of all - for what sums up the fragility of existence more than the words, 'Do you want some, Joshua?'"

It's a fail of such epic proportions I actually wished I had a time machine so I could go back to when this was made and run onto the set swinging a baseball bat yelling, \"Stop doing this! Go home!\"\n\nWords fail me, but let me just describe one scene. A woman dressed like Elvira shows up at an RV in the woods. The guy inside sees her approaching ... on TV. She's carrying an ear of corn. He steps out of the RV and she starts vamping it up, showing her garter belt, licking her lips, etc. The camera zooms in on her ample cleavage. She tucks the corn into her belt and they go inside. She shoves him down on a sofa and crouches over him, waving the corn. \"Aren't you hungry?\" she asks. \"I like popcorn,\" he says. She then puts the corn in her mouth and presses it against his mouth and says with a leer, \"Then let's ... heat it up!\" Immediately, buckets of popcorn are flying around the room.\n\nEverything about this movie screams cheap, stupid and amateur. Not a single line of dialogue rises above idiotic, the characters act by bugging their eyes out and the little trolls or goblins or whatever the hell they are can barely move inside their Teletubby costumes.

I was expecting something more along the lines z-grade trash. Trash it is, especially the material (bonkers plot and terribly inane script) and overbearingly inept performances (leading the way is main the kid with the screwed-up face and the hammy rejected stage-actresses Deborah Reed, and the mother is quite ding-bat too), but for me it wasn't so bad it's funny like it's mentioned\u0085 it's just tiresomely bad and goes for 91 minutes too long.\n\nSome\u0085 no all of the plot details are ridiculous, but some more so than others like very needy boys hanging out with pal (who's the boyfriend of Connie Young's character) and the welcoming town's folk with their fascination for food. Green food and drinks\u0085 and no one bothers to question it.\n\nThe thing that was running through my head (other than can see this get any more stupid\u0085 yes) was this trying to be a comedy (I hope so) or serious horror. Well it's horrifyingly stupid. If I start thinking too much about it, I might have just started sweating out green sludge!

The movie is bad in that there are some really bad actors, there are super cheesy lines, and there are continuity and plot problems. The costumes and masks for the monsters are very poorly made and have fixed expressions, the events do not make sense in a 3rd of the movie, and the actors who try to sound scary or menacing look laughable. This is like something made by high school students who got their hands on good equipment and watched a bunch of decent horror movies.\n\nIt is very easy to see the bad things about this movie because they are obvious but after having watched this film twice I see how there are actually very unusual good aspects in here. I think this film was purposefully made to appear like its a stupid cartoony kid tale but a horror movie in disguise. There are intentional and un-intentional dark humor jokes and there are some parts which are darn creepy. Also strangely there is a pretty decent soundtrack.\n\nI really can't tell if some of the jokes were intentional or not but seeing a kid who screams because he sees green goo and tree branches coming out of his body is funny and scary. Add to that a person who turns into some sort of green pie full of green paste who is eaten by the monsters. These things are funny. Or how about the creepy lady who comes to the unsuspecting family's house to offer them some cake when she makes a comment about Joshua's sister \"appetizing! HAHAHA\" and the mom goes \"WHAT!?\" A lot of that cheese is funny, trust me.\n\nOn the horror side the creepy parts somewhat merge with the humor aspect of the movie. As ridiculous as it sounds but seeing someone be transformed into green good and then devoured by ugly monsters is darn creepy even if its a bad movie like Troll 2. The final scary/creepy kick comes in the very end of the movie so its worth watching till the end.\n\nNot all actors are bad in this film. I think the actor who plays the kid is a very good actor , he looked very genuine. The dad and the grandpa were also really good and interesting characters portrayed by decent actors.\n\nTo me this is definitely a cult-classic, if you are interested in dark humor, bad movies, or like bad 80s horror movies you definitely must watch Troll 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie that's so gloriously bad, it's become a cult classic. Released in 1990, this film has absolutely nothing to do with trolls, which is hilarious in itself It's all about vegetarian goblins trying to turn people into plants so they can eat them. I know, right? What even is that premise?\n\nThe acting is so over-the-top it's like everyone involved was auditioning for a high school play. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and unintentionally funny, making it hard to look away. There's one scene where the characters are just sitting around discussing \"how to be a good vegetarian,\" and it's pure gold. Plus, the goblin costumes are something else, imagine a mix between a rubber Halloween mask and a rejected character from a '90s video game. What's really impressive is how Troll 2 has maintained its charm over the years. It's a perfect pick for a movie night with friends, especially if you love shouting at the screen and laughing at ridiculous plot holes. As a so bad it's good gem, it deserves all the love it's gotten. Just don't expect anything remotely resembling an actual horror film, and you'll have a blast!"

You'll want to share, talk, and laugh quite a bit through this film, you'd be mentally challenged if you didn't.\n\nI'll be seeking out the documentary made by the child star Michael Paul Stephenson too.\n\nAnd I'll be sure to watch again and looking forward to it."

Those who haven't seen too many horror movies usually just think it's badly made, with bad acting, bad effects, etc., and completely miss the surrealist heights it hits. Imagine taking your run-of-the-mill late nite cheapo horror flick and stripping it of any logic or pretense of plausibility, cast a bunch of the MOST unprofessional actors you can find, and rewrite the dialogue at the end of a bad acid trip. No wannabe cult hit, it was apparently made with the best intentions, and we all know what the devil does with those! The director's called it \"an unpretentious childrens' story,\" overlooking the obscenely cruel ending, which jars the relatively light-hearted mood of the first 92 minutes of the film. Not to be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Troll 2' also known as the best worst movie ever is an outrageously odd and fantastically bad fantasy horror film by Italian filmmaker Claudio Fragasso. Ridiculously inept and insanely entertaining in a nonsensical manner. The movie lacks any sort of actual horror or tension and instead transcends into a genre of its own a sort of dark comedy fantasy hybrid filled with awful effects, bad sets, laughably bad acting and terrible dialogue. This has got to be seen to be believed.\n\nThe Plot = A family's vacation to the small town of nilbog turns into a nightmare when they realize the town's inhabited by plant eating goblins.\n\nThe movie is a mind bogglingly strange experience to say the least with its goofy premise and confusing tone which gives you something unique and unlike anything you've ever experienced and even amongst all that chaos and confusion it manages to be a somewhat enjoyable b-movie experience. The weird nature of the production is what makes it so engrossing and watchable.\n\nThe cast performances are not just bad, their surreal ranging from overacting to wooden, everything feels off across the board and yet at the same time oddly fascinating. The standouts include Michael Stephenson as the whiny and insufferable child hero of the flick. George Hardy gives a somewhat serious and stiff performance as the father. Margo Prey gives delightfully strange and delirious performance as the mother. Connie Young gives a very staged and off-kilter performance as the teenage daughter. Robert Ormsby seems to be the only sensible character as the ghostly grandfather (yes, this movie has a ghost in it for some reason). Then finally Deborah Reed goes in the totally opposite direction as the witch with her strange, outlandish, and memorable performance.\n\nOverall 'Troll 2' is a rather oddball flick that goes above and beyond in presenting a mind-blowing experience. But honestly, I can't give this a high rating despite the enjoyment factor."

Be \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" or \"The Room\", you will find that movies like those are very entertaining despite their numerous flaws. Well, this isn't the case here. \"Troll 2\" has everything that makes a movie a \"trash\" exemplar - badly written plot and dialogue, nonsensical motivations, poor acting and bad editing. But if there's one thing that movie is completely devoid of, it is charm. Even when a character seems to be more or less funny, he will make something very distressing - like screaming for an entire fucking minute - and then you will hate him for that. The screenplay is based around pure convenience, there's no buildup or psychological construction (who need that shit, anyway?). Some scenes are cringeworthy, but not in a \"funny\" manner, just very bad ones, while others doesn't advance the plot in any way - but I think i'm being foolish here, as there's fucking nothing to advance. Well, let's talk about the acting now. Oh, fuck it, there's no acting here, just a bunch of people overreacting or not reacting at all about any stuff. Have you ever seen any mexican telenovela? Did you find the acting on it bad? Here it's worse, that's all you need to know. Not even the soundtrack is worthy a listen. Following what seems to be a trend among some \"trash\" classics, the songs doesn't have anything to do with the sequences they accompain. The veredict is that you will laugh here and there while watching this piece of crap, but most of the time you will wonder why this shit lasts so much if the duration is only something like 100 painful minutes."

It does have a surprising amount in common with the first film though as both concern mischievous shape -shifting creatures who enjoy turning humans into plants. Here though, their agenda is far more horrific since they only want to turn humans into plants to eat them since they are vegetarians (!) and yet, 'Troll 2' is never scary, frightening or unsettling in the least. A lot of the blame comes down to the wooden acting, with Connie Young turning in a particularly poor performance with very rehearsed line delivery as the protagonist's older sister. The dialogue in general is bland though and the costumes and makeup for the goblins are cheap-looking. There is admittedly something interesting about the plot regarding being a vegetarian and the possible benefits of eating meat, but this all gets a little mixed up amid such absurdities as the young boy's dead grandfather being able to pause time in order that he can urinate on the food that his family is about to eat (yes, that happens). The mythology at hand is quite hard to nut out too with grandfather coming back in visions, then in real life and then, who knows? More could be said, but in short, it is easy to see why this has become a cult hit among those who like to laugh at its sheer awfulness."

Maybe the ones that say, So bad, it's good, are people in the nutty house. Every time I did try to sit through the movie, the actors make me cringe, not laugh at all. To me comedy does not mean stupid. Comedy to me is actually funny. People have comedy meaning twisted. That is why most comedy movies today are not really funny but more crude, and this is towards the latter in this movie but without the bad words. I have not one good thing to say about this movie at all. I wish I did drink to watch this movie, to take the depression of watching it away. I have to watch a really awesome movie to take this away afterwards.\n\nIt is that bad. I am surprised to see even a few rate it high. Only thing classic of this movie is how bad it is. If you even read the trivia of this movie on this site. It says all extras were turned into leads of the movie. That is why all of it really sucks. They couldn't even get good actors for this movie. No matter how many people say this is entertaining or funny must live in a funny farm. Good luck convincing others that this is funny."

And had it stayed in that college to be viewed at frat parties, it would have been a great movie, and the creators could have been proud. But this should not have been released to the general public. The script is non-descript, but the acting is completely without feeling. It is like the actors are reading their lines from the script, without taking into consideration what is happening around them. The only exception is Deborah Reed, whose acting is borderline comical and I think the borderline comical part of this film is the only entertaining part of it. Any good parts? Well the photography. So do not waster your time on this. Or watch it for the turkey value."

This is a movie that you invite your friends and family over to force them to watch it, until they die laughing.

I had heard about this movie for years, but never watched it until I caught it on Showtime recently. Basically, this family goes to the town of Nilbog (Goblin, backwards) and are stalked by Trolls who want to eat them. In order to consume humans, the Trolls force people to eat a substance that turns them into a green, slime-like substance that the Trolls can digest. Sounds interesting, right? Well, I'm not entirely sure how a movie this atrocious can get made. The acting is worse than any elementary school play that I have ever seen, the Troll masks are literally rubber Halloween masks from Wal-Mart, and the dialog is so corny that Orville Reddenbacher would be proud. It's a good movie to have a drinking game with (everytime someone says I wish Grandpa Seth were here, drink. Every time someone looks directly into the camera, chug). Seriously, you have to watch this at least once to see just how bad it is. This movie gets a definite 1/10."

I can't really say much of the plot 'cause there doesn't seem to be one except for a family going to a creepy half- abandoned country village filled with creepy hillbillies who eat people who turn into green goop after eating their food.

Its just the average \"Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer\" junkies who hate this masterpiece. From Italian masters Joe D'Amato [Buio Omega, Anthropophagous] and Claudio Fragasso [Hell of the Living Dead, Rats, Zombie 3] comes a movie that is so bad in terms of acting, FX, and everything else you can possibly imagine, that is is GOOD! Troll II is a classic! From Grampa Seth telling little Joshua the story of Peter, all the way to the edge of your seat finale with Joshua and his poor mommy, this movie ROCKS! Being a die-hard fan of Italian gore [Fulci, Lenzi, Soavi, D'Amato, etc..] I had to check out this flick. I heard so much bad stuff about it, and i wanted to find out myself how bad it was. I finally managed to find a copy [actually I own 3 VHS copies now] and watched it in awe. Horrible Acting, K-Mart FX, Green food, Cheesy dialog, Banjo Music [UGH!]. I was hooked! They need to bring this bad boy out in the US on DVD. I will buy it! Where else can you hear lines like \"They are eating her, and then they are going to eat me, OH MY GOD!!!\" CLASSIC!\n\nIf you like cheesy movies, then this movie is one of the best. You cant help but being hooked to this movie. Does it suck? Yes. But in the best ways possible! Troll II is a classic!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Troll 2 has been called many things but a good movie is not one of them. It's widely considered one of the best \"so bad it's good\" movies out there. And this is for good reason. It's terrible in every single possible way you can imagine. The acting in terrible. The costumes for the creatures are terrible. The special effects are terrible. And the dialogue is terrible. But out of this piece of putrid garbage grows a beautiful flower that must be seen to be believed.\n\nThe story itself has a rather strange pedigree as well. As it's named and distributed as the sequel to a low budget Italian - American movie called \"Troll\". That too is a bad movie but it has one thing that this movie doesn't, and that's a troll. Yes you heard it here, Troll 2, a movie marketed as the sequel to a movie about a troll has exactly zero trolls in it. Instead we have goblins. Or at least that's what they're supposed to be. They're nothing more than little people in cheap novelty masks and burlap sacks.\n\nAll of that could be forgiven if it wasn't for the godawful acting and dialogue. This was written by an Italian man with no grasp of English syntax. As such when the actors told him that these lines don't actually work and maybe they should change them to something a little more correct, he refused and said the lines must be delivered exactly as written. Years later the director, who still claims this is an unfairly criticized masterpiece, has said this isn't true even if everybody involved in the production says it is.\n\nAnd then there's the acting. This ranges from just pain old bad underacting, to bad normal acting, to bad overacting to chewing the damn scenery and giving an over the top performance that is so full of ham I'm surprised the actress didn't turn into a pig. I'm not kidding. The actress playing the witch gives such a crazy performance it is worth the price of the DVD just to see it. And of course everybody's favorite line from the guy who realizes his fate.\n\nThe plot of the movie is that you have a family of four, or five if you want to count the ghost of the Grandfather and yes he has a major role in this, to dio a house swap with a family from a small farming community. I've never heard of this. You swap homes with another family, live in their home and do their job I guess and they do yours? After all they're going to a farm so I would imagine there's chores and stuff to be done. But anyway this is in the town of Nilbog. The smart ones will immediately see the twist that Nilbog is goblin spelled backwards. Except for the young boy, who's the only one who can see his dead Grandfather, nobody else in the family realizes this. Well the goblins lure people to their village using this method to eat them. But they're not meat eaters. They're vegans. So how do they eat people? By having these people eat their Nilbog food which turns them into green plant mush which the goblins then eat. Yeah, that is seriously the plot and the twist. A twist so lame that even M Night Shyamalan would call it lame.\n\nThere is seriously nothing good about this movie. But it's so entertainingly inept and wrong in every sense of the word that it becomes that holy grail of Grade-Z movies that are \"so bad it's good\". So if you can get past the bad... everything in this give it a watch. You'll thank yourself later."

The Mother is just Genius. how she says \"JOSHWA\" and Not Joshua, that's putting your own personal stamp on a character right there. The boy, Joshua, is just brilliant, every scene he is in he steals, and i am certain that the trailers for \"THERE WILL BE BLOOD\" that say \"CITIZEN KANE SURPASSED\" were stolen from the trailer for this movie for Joshua's performance. (Although, clearly the guy who gets turned into a plant spent months getting his part perfect, i mean the delivery of the line \"OH MY GOD, THEY'RE EATING HER, AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME!\" just shows that this guy has the ability to get such raw emotion through the screen and into your heart. the terror i experienced on his behalf makes the exorcist look like an episode of the muppets.\n\nhowever, the best part, and the element of the movie that still, 18years on remains unsurpassed for me, is the Goblin masks. i think that the Jim Henson workshop have been embarrassed by this little film, who, with an Italian director who can't speak English, and hardly any budget, have managed to make goblins that have defined what one should look like. specifically i mean the one that the sister turns into when they are in the car. clearly the muppets stole the idea of \"BEAKER\" from this goblin.\n\nJim Henson needs to take a long look at himself as i believe he has been truly outdone here by master craftsmen.\n\nthe icing on the cake is Grandpaw Seth, whose every line reduced me to tears.\n\ni scoff now at the Oscars, which seems to be all political.\n\nLets look at who won the Best Picture award in 1990...\"DRIVING MISS DAISY\" Troll 2 not even nominated.\n\nBest Actor? Michael Stephenson for \"JOSHWA\"?? no. Daniel Day Lewis for \"MY LEFT FOOT\"\n\nBest Director? Claudio Fragasso?? No, Oliver Stone.\n\nIts all a conspiracy!! why was this film overlooked?"

This movie is the worst movie ever made, but it is hilarious. It's not supposed to be in theory seeing as its a horror/fairy tale/kid flick, but who knows. For the $20 the producer spent on production (the rest of the budget either does not exist or was spent on cocaine) maybe he wanted to make a cheesy, corner, funny turd movie. I was entertained for the entire movie. The teenage girl in it is wicked hot, and the druid (or whoever she is) is hot when she turns into her young druid Celtic powerful mode. And the corn scene is my favorite scene in all movies ever. This is a must see movie."

Come on folks, one star this movie and get it back down to the bottom of the list again! And if you do watch it, watch the documentary first. It puts it all in perspective and makes the whole thing so much more enjoyable. Wow it says I need ten lines of text! I'm not sure that this movies needs that much of a review, so I'm just going to keep typing until I fill out ten lines. Oh there! Done!"

I'm sure there's a drinking game in this movie somewhere. I know everyone has said this, but why does a movie called \"Troll\" feature goblins? The actors are so bad it's funny. You don't feel empathy for any character because they're so idiotic and unbelievable. I love the way problems are solved in this movie too...like the way the kid gets his family to not eat the evil goblin food.\n\nYou just have to see it to believe it."

Not what the filmmakers intended (if they had, they'd be wicked geniuses), but nonetheless fun and craziness.\n\nHaving said that, hearing from members of the crew and cast involved makes you realize, that actual human beings were involved in the making of this. Most of them aware how bad this is. Which may have lead to a large fan base for this. Have you seen the movie \"The Room\" and subsequently the movie \"Disaster Artist\"? I reckon something similar is the case here. I would even argue that The roon is a touch worse than this, if you'd compare them.\n\nI will be watching the best worst movie documentary too at some point (with quarantine going on, sooner rather than later) and I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy it - I already have some favorite parts of this ... well \"favorite\""

The \"trolls\" in it are actually goblins, (and they say this in the movie). The costumes on the dwarfs/children who play the goblins are basically brown sheets and rubber masks put over them.

Some weird fairy or something helps him out or something and freezes time just before everyone is about to eat. I think the food was supposed to be magical or something. Anyway, the kid urinates all over the food on the table to stop them. I think that was the point that everyone watching decided it was time to go to sleep.\n\nCheesy movies can be fun, but Troll 2 is distilled pain. You will be scarred for life!"

So, the dialogue was translated from Italian into broken English and the cast, mostly Mormons who had never acted, were commanded to say their lines as written, even though they offered to correct the English.\n\nThis info is all over the Internet and on Wikipedia."

        "review_detailed_main": "Wow. Where do I start with this film? The acting, the costumes, the dialogue, the camera work, the cast itself? It's all really, really dire. But here's the thing - it is so bad it's possibly the funniest film I've ever seen. The plot of the film is very weak. I've never seen Troll so I can't compare the two, but I'll be pretty sure it won't involve people turning into a cabbage.\n\nAnother thing to love about this film is the acting throughout. At school we put on a better acted performance. That was in the Nativity play when I was four. At least at that age we didn't know we were bad actors (I was one of the Three Wise Men, which is a vaguely ironic role for a four year old boy). These guys have no excuses. The daughter makes out that she's reading from cue cards all the time.\n\nThe best thing about the film is the costumes of the goblins themselves. Oh yeah, by the way, it's about goblins not trolls. Not one troll in the movie. If ever there was a case of false advertising, this'd be it. Not that I was particularly craving some troll action. Anyway, back to the costumes. Most of the goblins looks the same - paper bag skin and joke shop mask accessories but there is one which doesn't look like the rest and is possibly an extra from the Muppet Show. Just so you know which one I'm on about, it appears in the car on the journey to Nilbog.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how bad this film is, here's a line from the father of the family: \"I'm tightening my belt one loop so I don't feel hunger pains and your mother and sister will have to do the same.\" What? If I ever feel the nauseous pain of starvation, I'll remember to wear a belt.\n\nThe really surreal thing is that this film got an '18' rating over here in the UK. If I'm being honest, there's nothing particularly shocking or gory in this film. The special effects are so abysmal that you'd have to be really gullible to be lulled into thinking this is at all real. I think the age rating here actually suggests the combined I.Q. of the cast, crew and anyone else involved in making this film.\n\nSeriously though, see this film. It's a must watch. I'm rating it not on how much I like it, but on how it ranks in film quality."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is one of the strangest I've seen. Although clearly intended as a horror film, Troll 2 has retrospectively become a comedy due to its noticeably flaws. There are many causes of low quality in filmmaking, and failures in concepts, direction, acting, dialogue, and visual effects can each destroy a film. Troll 2 somehow seems to fail in every area of filmmaking. Firstly, the underlying plot line of vegetarian goblins luring tourists into a random agrarian community and then transforming them into plants for consumption is completely ludicrous. Secondly, the Italian production crew appears to have been morbidly inept; according to the cast, the director spoke little English, and yet refused to allow the actors to correct the glaring grammatical errors and oddly-worded phrases in the script. Thirdly, the majority of the actors in the film were inexperienced locals who had expected to be hired as extras, and the lack of talent is apparent on screen. In fact, the producers unhesitatingly cast a man who had escaped from a mental institution with a large drug cache. Finally, the visual effects are extremely sub-par, with the goblins portrayed as humans in laughably unrealistic rubber masks. As with other \"so-bad-it's-good films\" such as Tommy Wiseau's notorious 2003 film The Room, this movie is so irredeemably problematic that it is almost entertaining to watch."

Finally I have seen I and must say that, this film (perhaps too much intelligent for people of 1989, year in which has been realized) is not a horror, is a demential comedy, intentionally comic, like is made not to understand it. The family of the film is crazy, a likable and ingenuous, smiles and always calm father, a mother with obvious signs of madness or insanity, a small son who speaks and sees the ghost of the dead grandfather. the grandfather is distracted and very strange, arranges many troubles, remaining likable and ironic like the rest of the family. Perhaps the adolescent sister, ago strange dances and has problems with the sexuality of its boy, is gay?. The goblin \" writing\" like the vampire, the Bologna sandwich, used like l' Saint water in order to make to disappear the goblin-vampire. The mother, Queen-witch of the goblin, protect than them like sons, as mother nature protect the earth and the atmosphere of the annihilator man. The priest who ago dialog on the meat, saying a how much is toxic and how much is dangerous to eat it, a dialog from Oscar for the\n\ndemential in the country U.S.A., native land dell' hamburger. All this cannot be accidental, of involuntary, and dumb to think it, the situations in the film are too many behind other, therefore is obvious that they have been intentional thoughts and thus. They wanted makes us to laugh and to think on the things series and there are resolutions in brilliant way. This film is a perfect fable for the children of all the world even if some scenes, make fear, like the transformation in plant of the child, in the dream in machine, but then quickly it is returned to laugh, with the ghost grandfather who, disguised from homeless, with trust in hand says, it to stop itself in order to speak with he. Brilliant. The film has cost least and it makes up and the customs make part of work-ands that today does not exist more. To see told with great irony, much comic, and performance from actors from dumb movie and a lot other anchor, thus much from not being able to be accidental. Who has made and written this film it is a true genius. Now understand the phenomenon. Perhaps some American persons are too much stupid in order to understand all this? But it makes you to see it your sons, a beautiful instructive fable on the life, the good and medical food, the sens of the dead, the love, the scared on diversity."

I thought it was a perfect good flick. Of course, I was just kid. My mind wasn't developed enough to know what a truly good/bad flick was. Now I know. This movie very much deserves it's reputation. How many cheesy flicks have their own documentary ? Not many , that's for sure. Like Rocky Horror , Troll 2 is more than just a movie, it's an experience. I've never been to one myself, but they seem like a lot of fun. To sum it all up, give troll 2 a chance, you won't regret it.

The dialogue is laughable, rather than painful, and it's hilarious to see how inconsistent Holly's character is, especially around Elliot.\n\nThe story revolves around a little kid named Joshua, who is forced to move to Nilbog with his family. Along the journey, his ghostly courageous Grandpa Seth (also my name!) saves him from getting eaten by the goblins. Yes, these goblins are vegetarians and they turn people into plants before they eat them. I swear to God that I'm NOT making this up. Everybody knows the \"Oh My God!!!!\" scene, even if you haven't seen the movie.\n\nWhat makes this movie work is how unintentionally funny it is throughout, which makes it so entertaining. The goblins are anything but scary and try to watch this as a disastrous comedy as opposed to watching a terrifying horror film. Bottom line, this movie is fantastic and I can watch it numerous times, without getting tired of it. Just enjoy it for what it is and don't take it seriously, you'll thank me later!"

A truly terrifying marvel, one of the greatest in history. I would recommend this film to anybody, and I find myself craving a Troll 3, although I am embarrassed to admit I haven't seen Troll 1 (nor can I find any record of it). Honestly the best film in a long time, up there with Titanic, Shawshank Redemption, and of course Sharknado 1 and 2 (not 3, that was a disappointing feat)."

But who is the true one badly in this movie? in the man who poisons the earth, or the goblin that they want to save, it the man? . He knows it to nobody. But this it makes you movie to die from Ridere, to laugh, to laugh\u0085 and to laugh ago well to the health.

There is one scene where the the trolls (read:goblins) throw a party for the family that has a genuinely creepy feel that I think was intended. That alone takes it from a 1 to a 2.\n\nThere is also a joke told in the movie that makes me think they intended this movie to be campy.

It easily out performs most mainstream \"comedies\".\n\nThe story (if you can call it that) centers around an imbecilic family who -- for totally incomprehensible reasons -- decides to move to a town that's inhabited by vegetarian goblins (as part of some bizarre \"exhange\" program). Along the way we get to witness: a witch who seduces a young teen with an ear of corn, goblins eating green pudding, a ghostly grandfather who has power over time & space, people being turned into plants, etc, etc.\n\nWell worth the rental price (only if you like terrible movies).\n\nI gave it a 9 out of 10 stars.

A movie should have good special effects and costumes. They should have natural sounding dialogue. Good music that accents the atmosphere. More important than anything else though, a movie should entertain.\n\n\"Troll 2\" starts in an instant with Grandpa Seth reading young Joshua a story to bed. In his story, there are goblins who can change form to make themselves resemble humans. These goblins would trick humans into eating a green sap, which would turn them into vegetables, because the goblins are vegetarians, and their favorite food is human vegetables. Joshua and his family were prepared to go on vacation to the small town of Nilbog. When they arrive, Joshua quickly discovers that the residents of Nilbog are goblins in disguise. Unfortunately, nobody believes Joshua, so it's up to him to prevent his family from eating the food given to them by the locals.\n\nI think it goes without saying that the plot of this movie is ridiculous. The actors make Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin look like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. The special effects are breathtakingly cheesy. The goblin costumes are suitable, for those going trick or treating. The dialogue is about as natural as a person speaking his second language for the first time. Lastly, the music is shockingly upbeat, it sounds fine, but it completely offsets the creepy tone that the movie is trying to portray. This movie is very bad.\n\nDid this movie do anything right? Believe it or not there was one thing that was done well in this movie. The most important thing about a movie is that it entertains, and this movie is very entertaining. This movie attempted to be a creepy horror, but it became an amusing unintentional comedy. Every poorly acted moment is a burst of laughter. Every time I see those plastered on facial expressions of the goblins I laugh. I can forgive all other flaws with a movie as long as it's entertaining.\n\nThis movie is truly the offspring of a bunch of bad elements that don't work being blended together into something that miraculously does work. People love to watch the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man wreak havoc on New York City. People also love to watch the poorly acted \"Scooby-Doo\" cartoon. When people watch old movies, they look for the wires that hold the UFO's up. People love to find imperfections, and are wired to love garbage. This is the perfect mesh of over the top ridiculum, combined with rancid acting, with corny special effects sprinkled on top. Everything offsets itself so perfectly, I wouldn't ask them to change it at all.\n\nI really did enjoy this film and it's many, many flaws. I actually would recommend this movie, not only to those who get a kick out of watching bad films, but also to those who love to laugh. This is a bad movie, but it's a guilty pleasure. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and it was supposed to be a horror film."

OH, another thing: this film has one of the best scenes of the history of cinema! Quite so! The scene of the popcorn! When the witch-queen enters in the boys' trailer and only one of them is there, 2 days ago without eating, and she offers him a corn, he says \"Well, I like popcorn...\", and she answers \"We'll just have to... heat it up!\" and it begins to burst popcorn until filling the whole trailer. Later, in the movie, the same adolescent, flooded in popcorn, speech: \"No... No... No... No more popcorn!\". That, my friends, it is a superb scene! And I have something to say about the costume design: it was made by LAURA GEMSER! Yes! The black Emmanuele. And it was re-used in another movie: \"Quest for the mighty sword\". This, my dear friends, is priceless. The make-up was done by the same person who did Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2, Maurizio Trani.\n\nThis is an AWESOME movie.\n\nGo and get your copy."

It is almost next to impossible to not sympathize with the character of Diana Waits - there are moments where she comes close to bawling over the loss of her father, whom she makes clear, she is the daughter of, but, luckily, her son Joshua starts singing her favorite song to cheer her up.\n\nLet's not forget that Troll 2 is a horror movie, and will scare the most mature of adults. There are several cheap scares as is usual in any horror movie, but it is also deeply atmospheric in a way that only director Cladio Fragasso can accomplish, and it is safe to say you WILL get goosebumps. It is also very gory, but it is relevant to the story and constructive as is rare in horror movies. In one terrifying scene where the goblins are introduced, I was taken aback by how realistic the goblins were portrayed. A smart choice was the employment of Laura Gemsler, a respected actress in her own right, who designed the goblin's costumes. With what was obviously a sizable budget, these goblins all open their mouths and devour the people they victimize after they turn them into plants, in an unexpectedly frightening twist of fate.\n\nSo watch Troll 2 if you dare. With it's frightening and somber atmosphere, powerful and engaging performances by the whole cast, it will surely be a movie you will never forget."

Troll is about a Troll(Obvioulsly) trying to turn an apartment complex into his world while a boy named HarryPotter (This was made before the Harry Potter novel so their not stealing the name) suspects something.\n\nBut now Troll 2, besides the name this film has no connection with the first film. the film is basically about a boy named Joshua who keeps seeing the ghost of his Grandfather Seth who warns him about the Goblins (Not Troll's) and if anyone eats their food their skin becomes plant matter and are eaten by the Goblins, while his told about them his parents have booked a holiday in a remote town called Nilbog (Goblin spelt the other way) Meanwhile their daughter Holly is in her room working out when her Boyfriend sneaks into her room, and it seems her father hates him and would chop his balls off and eat them. Since Holly doesn't like him spending any time with friends and only be around her.\n\nThe family soon arrive at Nilbog and are given a feast of food with green and blue clay on top, so instead of wondering why Joshua's family decide to eat it when his Grandpa Seth stops time and tells him to do something so thinking quick Joshua pisses on all the food.\n\nWhile in the mobile home Holly's boyfriend and his mates are also enjoying a stay at Nilbog after he told them that the town is full of young women looking for men. so Arnold decides to go out for a walk and sees a young woman running through so he follows her only to find that Goblins are right behind them.\n\nThe two go off into a church to find that the Queen of the Goblins lives there and after the woman drinks from the streaming cup she becomes the a plant like woman and eaten by the Goblins while Arnold becomes a half man half tree.\n\nSoon one of the others decides to go out for supplies and runs into Sheriff Gean Freak (Nice name) and offers him a lift, during the drive the Sheriff offers him a sandwich with a green meat inside it and the guy eats it with no questions asked why it's green.\n\nof course the family soon discover that the town people are Goblins are the only way to kill them is to touch the magic stone but when Grandpa Seth takes Joshua there he fends the Goblins with a baloney sandwich, him and his family touch the magic stone and kills the Goblins.\n\nJoshua, his family and Holly's boyfriend go home and while the father goes to work and the two teenagers decide to go out Josh and his mom go in their house. it's not long before Joshua goes into the bathroom and find green mush in the shower so he runs into the kitchen to find the Goblins eating her Mother with the Goblin's line \"Want some, Joshua?\" Troll 2 is a enjoyable movie if you're into low budget horror films. Written and Directed by Italian horror mastermind Claudio Fraggaso."
