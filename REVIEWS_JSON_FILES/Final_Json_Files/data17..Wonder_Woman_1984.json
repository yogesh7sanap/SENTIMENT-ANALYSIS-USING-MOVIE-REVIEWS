Except a couple of scenes, and hilarious over-the-top acting by Pedro Pascal, I found nothing here. It has \"straight-to-DVD\" written all over it."

But it was a fun film that played with the fish-out-of-water aspect. But this - WW1984 - what in the hell was this? Again, I don't know that much Womder Woman history, but this seemed like a huge conglomeration of crazy story line, special effects, philosophical ramblings... it was a total mess.\n\nGal Gadot and Chris Pine are pleasant, appealing actors, and certainly pleasant to look at. And Kristin Wiig had a great role that I'm sure she had fun with. But overall, this was just a total mess of a movie. And Pedro Pascal...I can't figure out if he was great, or just did one of the most over the top performances in recent memory."

There's a bunch of great outtakes as well.\n\nThe cast is interesting-Pedro Pascal's overacting is a highlight- and Gal Gadot is stunning once again. Kirsten Wiig is also a good addition to the film, but the development of her character could have been more in depth so we can see her transformation being more justified.\n\nOn the contrary, the character of Pedro Pascal is well developed and I was impressed by the tension that he adds in the entire film. I was happy to see him switching between drama and comedy and many points go to him for keeping the film's pace interesting.\n\nBut the film lacks a strong villain and the performance of Gal was a bit dry.\n\nOverall, it's a fun Sunday afternoon superhero flick which should have been 30 min shorter.\n\n6,9/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Don't listen to the people giving this film a 1 or a 2. At that point the film would be unmatchable.\n\nYou also shouldn't listen to those giving this a 10. It isn't perfect.\n\nFor me the movie is right around a 7. I enjoyed it a good amount but it wasn't spectacular or worthy of anything higher than that.\n\nHere are a few things people keep bringing up:\n\nCGI: People keep ragging the cgi. Overall, the cgi is NOT bad. The visuals in this film are actually very good. I will say there are a few moments where the cgi could have been done better, but I'm not going to nitpick and say the entire movie looks bad.\n\nScore: The score is great. It's Hans Zimmer. He does use someone else's score at a crucial moment in the film, but it has been used in many different movies and is fitting here.\n\nActing: The acting overall is very good and you're just hating if you say otherwise. You can argue that the story isn't the best, but I had no problem with the acting whatsoever. Gal kills it yet again as Wonder Woman as does Chris Pine as Steve. Pedro Pascal offers a great performance as the lead villain of the film. My favorite performance of the film was actually Kristen Wiig who I was worried about before since she's usually a comedic actor, but I was thoroughly impressed with her.\n\nPlot: The plot to me was the downfall of this film. It had visuals, acting, music, but the plot felt a little off to me. I was scratching my head at certain points of the movie, but overall it made sense and I had no problem with it. It's a fun superhero movie that you aren't meant to take super seriously."

I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign. I won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...\n\n'...

It was kid friendly and sappy, not the dark DC from recent years but it's Wonder Woman, not the death of Superman. It could have been better but it felt like a fitting sequel. People today are so childish rating this with 1 star, this is at the very least an average film. TV quality is improving on a whole but Sharknado got 3.3 stars. This is far from a 1 star film and worth the time if you enjoyed the first film. Just maybe don't get your hopes too high. You may not enjoy it as much as I did.

Firstly the bad points: 1. The story. This silly \"wish\" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn't have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It's beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax. 2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter. The good points: 1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable. 2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role. 3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting. 4. Watch out for Lynda Carter. The cast is good but they can't save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard. 5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.\n\nThey had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong, smart, funny and, most of all, can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldn't wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84, when she's not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man, right?) she's winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isn't much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled, clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak, campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bale's Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment."

Gal Gadot delivers the energy that Wonder Woman has very well which is why she is perfect for the role. The visuals in this movie are nice. But the action scenes were the best parts of the movie, which leads into my flaws. There are hardly any action scenes in the movie. The first 17 mins are action-packed and then leads to slow and unnecessary exposition over an artifact that grants wishes. Pedro Pascal was okay but I thought his villainous role was a huge miscast. I found him annoying and comical. Kristen Wiig's role as Cheetah was okay as well but I found her character to be a trope as a DC villain (nerd turned into villain). Also an hour and a half later it's just more lazy storytelling with great visuals and well shot and choreographed fight scenes. I also never bought the 80's vibe that it brought because it didn't feel like an 80's movie, it was just telling us that it's set in 1984 because of the fashion, technology, and cars. There are rarely any references to the 80's other than those 3 categories. I didn't hate WW84 but the writing could have been much better. 6/10; C+"

It wears its heart on its sleeve and embraces the cheese of its romance, its plot, and just all of its comic book antics that we don't really see anymore. Whatever you think of the old school comic book films is what I think will either make it or break it for you. You gotta just embrace the tone and run with it, otherwise, this is probably not worth checking out. Everyone seems pretty turned off by it, but I thought it was just good silly fun like the old days!"

First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)' suffers from similar issues as its predecessor. It doesn't make a good first impression, as its opening is honestly pretty rough. Though its initial action scene has a few enjoyable moments, the first sequence that properly showcases the eponymous hero is really unconvincing and is possibly the worst one in the entire affair. Thankfully, then, the second act is considerably better than the first. Once again, a decent chunk of the film is solidly entertaining. It's a little slow (people who prefer to see Diana in her costume might be a bit disappointed), but it's perfectly fine and features quite a few compelling scenes. Perhaps surprisingly, its best elements are its characters and theme. Though it's often heavy-handed, the flick does a good job of exploring its interesting central concept, which is actually rather resonant and gives its characters something to struggle with internally. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig are probably the movie's best aspects; their characters are distinct, unexpected and surprisingly believable. Pascal, especially, is a delight to watch as a charming but greedy businessman whose initially calm exterior slowly breaks down over the course of the story. Unlike its predecessor, the movie manages to successfully - and, I'll add, satisfyingly - see its theme through to its logical conclusion. Unfortunately, the film's quality drops significantly as it moves into its final act. After a fairly forced heel turn, the affair struggles to balance its human (though still overblown) stakes with its superhero action. It feels as though the final, CGI-fuelled fight is only included out of a pressure to confirm to the genre. The finale's actual conclusion brings things back down to a more relatable level, but by then most of the damage is done. Still, it's not a terrible sequence and its conclusion is actually shockingly effective. What isn't shockingly effective is the picture's denouement. This tacked-on ending (clearly a reshoot added due to the piece's pushed-back December release) is genuinely terrible, a Hallmark-esque moment that straight-up seems like a life-affirming commercial for, like, a beer or something. It's so bad that it almost sours the entire feature; you really have to remind yourself that this scene doesn't represent the quality of the overall thing. I mean, there are a few sequences that look, sound and, even, feel 'made for TV' (and one that annoyingly uses John Murphy's theme from 'Sunshine (2007)'), but nothing comes close to the cringe of the last pre-credits scene. So, overall, the film is a mixed bag. It does some things better than its predecessor, such as maintain a consistent theme and provide compelling villains, but it also does some things much worse and, even at its best, generally isn't as entertaining. However, it's not a bad picture, by any means. Frankly, some of the heavy criticism levelled towards is a bit excessive. 6/10."

Kristen Wig gives a great performance, despite claims to the contrary. Some of the CGI is wonderful, some of it looks like it's from 10 years ago for some reason (?) The lasso looks completely different. In a Summer blockbuster, it's blisteringly hard to redeem a villain without a huge bowl of sticky syrup, and this film proves that once more. Still, I think that's the direction they were going in; bright, hopeful and upbeat.\n\nObviously the film was built around the necessity of getting Chris Pine's character into the film, and it shows. Personally, I would have taken a different approach. The wishing stone was a good idea, but I would have suggested changing 40% of the script.\n\nStill, it's very entertaining - even wonderful in parts, and I would definitely watch this again. Patty Jenkins is heading toward a fantastic career, one I aspire to.\n\nVery minor spoiler follows-\n\nIt's a fun film, but it's frustrating to watch Wonder Woman 'lassoed' so to speak, as she gradually loses her powers to the wishing stone. We watch Wonder Woman to see her kick ass, not take bullets - we want to see her dodge them with lightning fast reflexes and flip cars with her bare hands.\n\nStill, you can't really go wrong if you liked the first one, though it doesn't approach the brilliance of the original film."

But it was still an enjoyable and great movie. There was great action, and even a Christopher Reeves Superman feel to it at some points which was nice, but I didn't get the same type of goosebumps (I still got goosebumps in a few scenes) like I did when Diana entering No Man's Land, or fighting Ludendorrf and Ares in the first movie. But this is coming from a guy who thoroughly enjoyed the extra 30 minute smash fest of Superman vs Zod in Man of Steel."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am no expert in comic books myself, but what I expect from a comic book movie is to be striking, visual, stereotypical and above all, consistent with its past and its planned future. WW84 was neither of these! It wasn't awful for a random movie made by students, but it was really bad for a film made by a major studio and starring talented people and having so much material to draw inspiration from.\n\nFirst of all, Gal Gadot had a supporting role in this film. She may save the day at the end (well, sort of), but the main character of the story was Max, the villain. Then every other supporting cast member had a development arc, while Gadot had about half of one if I am being generous. Second, the story pushed in the invisible jet and that Wonder Woman can fly (!?) in a clunky and hard to stomach way. You almost saw the outline of the executive shouting \"she needs to fly in the next movie!!!\". And third I am wondering if this film was misandric or not. Men were consistently portrayed as weak, abusive, violent, lacking impulse control and heartless. If it weren't for three male characters whose only quality was they were not evil - and that includes Steve Trevor and the random guy he inhabited, I would have seriously felt under attack the entire film.\n\nThe result was something that felt like a draft story for a writer class, with bad CGI, improbable deus ex solutions to problems that were hard to swallow in the first place, underwhelming characters, poor action scenes, pointless Trevor appearance, unnecessarily physical solutions to problems that could have been tackled by simply talking to a person on a phone or something and so on. And the ending was about how nice the holiday season is after a catastrophe that affected every person on the planet and almost destroyed the world!\n\nSo no. No! I am not taking it anymore. I am tired of movies that are not made for children but assume I am one, and a dumb one to boot. I want good stories, I want compelling characters, I want people who do their damn jobs!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie that tries to embody the campiness and nostalgia from the old Wonder Woman TV series. Sometimes it succeeds. In other moments, it is a complete failure. The most unnerving moments with this movie are related to the Wonder Woman's super powers, what they are, their limits, and their balance. They feel underpowered just to move the story forward but overpowered at the story's climax scenes. She seems to have a few new super powers that are not explained at all (at least in the movie).\n\nStory-wise, there are moments that could be plot holes or just the result of hasty editions pursuing a light \"Marvel-like\" feeling. The story is a simple one that goes well with the campy felling that they were looking for. Unfortunately, during several scenes, Gal Gadot feels emotionally disconnected from the script. Pedro Pascal seems more engaged and hits his marks but, again, the story is not this movie's forte.\n\nOverall, I have seen worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "When was the last time you saw a proper standalone superhero film? Yeah, I couldn't remember either and as I watched Diana swing from one lightning to another, I experienced that long forgotten feeling of heroic joy. While it certainly didn't live up to the ridiculous hype, it was still a grand spectacle that satisfied my craving for a cinematic experience.\n\nTo my surprise, the narrative of the film was a lot bigger than was shown in the trailer and I mean a lot! Due to her actions, Diana ended up paying quite a hefty price as she battled two intriguing and non generic villains while the events of the film escalated to levels that are uncommon for most superhero movies. With that being said, WW84 did try to poorly juggle too many subplots and as a result couldn't tie them up in a nice way without leaving a multitude of in-your-face plot holes.\n\nI admired that instead of trying to justify the plot elements with pseudo sciene or the word \"quantum\", the movie just admitted that it was magic. Sadly the narrative itself lacked the \"magic\" of the original as it failed to conjure up a single emotional moment, not counting the stunning prologue. Gal Gadot was naturally electrifying but her performance felt timid, as if she was sacred of being a powerful heroine that we loved in Part 1.\n\nAs the film swings between magnificence and disappointment, it satisfies the cinematic superhero craving thanks to the impressive visuals and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack but it fails to create the exhilarating experience due to a flawed narrative and a lack of an emotional touch. If I watched it at home, it would have been a 6/10 so cinema is recommended.\n\nMovies.shmovies on Instagram"

        "review_title": "WONDER WOMAN 1984: I couldn't ask for a better film to watch at an IMAX theater for the last time this year...",
        "review_detailed_main": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\n\nThe superhero genre has been growing exponentially during the last decade, so it's bizarre to go through an entire year with only Birds of Prey and The New Mutants instead of literally dozens of films from both Marvel and DC. Thankfully, Warner Bros. decided to release Wonder Woman 1984 before the year's end, but not without a catch. Most people will only have the possibility of watching one of the few blockbusters of 2020 through HBO Max, a streaming service only available in a couple of countries, while some incredibly lucky moviegoers might have the chance of seeing this visually epic film in theaters, depending on the country's pandemic rules.\n\nFortunately, I'm one of those lucky people who got the opportunity to end 2020 on a positively immersive note by watching Patty Jenkins' latest flick in an almost empty IMAX theater (paradise). If you've been following me for some time, you know I'm a firm believer and defender of the so-called \"theater experience\", and I can't hide the fact that I felt extremely emotional going into one of the best, biggest theaters in Portugal to witness one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020. Until 2017, DCEU struggled to deliver a massively loved installment, and Wonder Woman came to the rescue. It was one of my favorite films of the respective year, so I was obviously excited for its sequel, even more having in mind the circumstances we're all living in.\n\nIn my opinion, this sequel stands close to its predecessor. With a lengthy runtime known for being associated with absolutely epic movies, I was confident that WW84 could deliver a solid film with great villains for a change. Well, Kristen Wigg and Pedro Pascal are definitely two of the indisputable standouts. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham made the right decision in dedicating a significant portion of the screenplay to Barbara Minerva and Max Lord. Their arcs are far from being groundbreaking, but they're a thousand times more effective than the \"CG punch bag\" narrative.\n\nBarbara follows the \"lonely, insignificant, no one cares about me\" archetype, and Wiig does a surprisingly remarkable job in portraying this character, but the script is what really makes her shine. At first, her comedic mannerisms left me a bit dubious about the eventual character's likeness. However, as time flies by, it's almost inevitable to feel sorry for Barbara, making her future motivations understandable and perfectly natural. On the other hand, Max Lord is apparently exploding with conviction, but his life is not as amazing as everyone might think. This time, it's Pedro Pascal who ends up elevating the character, delivering a brilliant performance with just the right amount of over-the-top expressions.\n\nEven though these two are magnificent, Gal Gadot continues to prove that she's one of the best casting choices of the millennium, interpreting Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. I seriously cannot imagine another actress wearing that costume, throwing that Lasso of Truth, incorporating the character's essence as seamless as Gadot. In this movie, she was able to perform highly emotional scenes, nailing every single one. Her chemistry with Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) is palpable on the other side of the world, and their interactions go through every zone of the emotion spectrum. Regarding Steve, I'm not going to spoil how he comes back or anything concerning his arc, but I can safely write that his presence in the film is both necessary and logical.\n\nThe biggest compliment I'll offer this sequel concerns its screenplay and direction. Finally, I can confidently write that the DCEU is capable of producing a well-structured, well-developed story with well-written characters. It doesn't have as much action as the original, but I still didn't feel the 151 minutes. WW84 flows incredibly well due to Jenkins' ability to fill up the runtime (almost) only with important scenes. There's a slight \"over-persistence\" in the attempt at sending a certain message (I'll get there), but story-wise, I sincerely wouldn't take a second out. Even the comic relief moments, particularly with Pine (who plays some sort of parallelism with the first movie's Diana), are welcome and timely.\n\nThe action scenes might be low on quantity, but the few that the audience gets are long, complex, and technically challenging to pull off. The opening sequence alone almost made me tear up due to its epicness. Hans Zimmer's powerful score, Richard Pearson's clean editing, and Matthew Jensen's camera work all work together to present a lengthy, grand, wide view of an Olympics-style obstacle course with young Diana. Throughout the entire film, the action is colorful, vibrant, fun, and entertaining... except for the (supposedly) climactic clash.\n\nWell, to be fair, there are two climaxes during the last thirty minutes since WW84 owns two antagonists to play with. One of them is closed in perfect fashion, with the emotional stakes at their highest. Great job there, no complaints whatsoever. However, the main fight sequence inexplicably contrasts with the rest of the movie's action. The vibrant colors disappear and are replaced by a dull grey, which makes one of the characters involved (who shares the same color tone) hard to notice, transforming an epic final battle into an underwhelming, barely comprehensible collection of awkward cuts, punches, and screams. Gadot's golden suit is way less exciting (and poorly lit) than her original costume, and Barbara's arc ends without real closure.\n\nIn addition to this, Jenkins insists too much on passing to the audience that greed brings horrible consequences. \"Be careful what you wish for\", \"money and power can't buy happiness\", \"be thankful for what you have\", and messages along these lines are repeated continuously (implicitly and explicitly). I admit that it might be a nitpick of mine and that not many people will feel like I did, but I couldn't help but feel that some moments sounded and/or seemed a bit preachy and way too repetitive. Also, it's a bit weird how the official premise mentions Wiig as Cheetah, but this word is not mentioned once in the entire film... Nevertheless, don't be mistaken: I'm thrilled that WW84 is the last flick I watch at a theater this year!\n\nAll in all, Wonder Woman 1984 proves that DC continues on the track of success by delivering a well-structured, well-developed DCEU installment without an absurd amount of overwhelming CGI and/or forgettable villains. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham's impressively layered screenplay makes the lengthy runtime feel adequate not only by offering epic, exciting, technically superb action set pieces, but also due to the remarkably well-written heroes and antagonists. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are outstanding together, but Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal steal the show as the newcomers. With two wonderful \"villains\", WW84 boasts a solid, elaborate narrative that I was lucky to witness on the big screen. Unfortunately, the climactic battle is disappointingly underwhelming and colorless, Barbara's arc ends abruptly without true closure, and Jenkins insists too much on the thematic message of the story. These issues may affect more viewers or not, but one thing's for sure: it's one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year, worthy of being seen on a massive theater.\n\nRating: A-"

It truly bring back the memories of Chris Reeve's Superman (directed by Richard Donner).\n\nFrom its spectacular opening towards the end, WW84 is a joyful rollercoaster ride that (hopefully) will bring all moviegoers back to the cinema. #WW84SavesCinemas"

I already got that.\n\nI do love the fact that this movie is movie is stepping further away from the darkness that began the DC Extended Universe. I loved Man of Steel but I felt it was being too much like the Dark Knight which is not the persona of all the DC superheroes.\n\nWhat is a concept of all the DC superheroes is that they are big and epic. Wonder Woman without a doubt is saving the world in this one, that's the purpose: giving it all to save the world and I felt that from this movie, something that I do not feel in other movies like this, necessary.\n\nLike a good sequel everything is a little better. Both Patty Jinkins and Gal Godat seem more comfortable making this flick. The actions scenes are better I like how Wonder Woman fights in this one. Way better than the last one. At the same time its far more sappier than the last film. Wonder Woman's moral campus and purpose as a hero is never overshadowed by superficial bells and whistles. Not sure how I really feel about that cause I love how Captain America's moral code can be found at the end of his right hook. Not to through shade on how in WW84 Diana takes a defensive strategy, never using her powers in violence no matter how violent the enemy is and only uses her power to stop the enemy with not intensions of destroying. How very Bruce Lee in the philosophy if not the movement.\n\nKristin Wiig as Cheetah was perfect. I first felt like they were trying to mimic something that the old Batman movies did with the bad guys. Her origin resonated with that of Catwoman in Batman Returns with the fun and playful persona of Jamie Foxx's Electro in Amazing Spider-Man 2. Plus, I feel like I've been waiting all my life to watch Wonder Woman go up ageist Cheetah in a movie and WW84 brings it!\n\nLike Batman Returns and Amazing Spider-Man 2 Wonder Woman 1984 boost more than one baddie and after finishing the second season of the Mandalorian I could not wait to see its star Pedro Pascal in anything. Maybe it's my lack of knowledge on Wonder Woman, but I do feel they got to be careful not to run out of Rogues for her to face (She's no Flash who like Batman has an endless supply). Pascal's Max Lord felt like Thanos in human skin and it works well.\n\nI will say I did not think the movie was 80s enough for a movie with 1984 in its title. Though those moments with Steve Trevor as a man out of time are funny I'm very surprise how subtle they kept the whole thing, or rather when it comes to paying homage or using it for humor. I think they had the political atmosphere of 1984 covered.\n\nIf you liked Wonder Woman than WW84 is something to check out. It's...Wonderful!!\n\nThanks HBO Max!!"

They should have cut 30 minutes or more off the run time, but there's still plenty to like. The opening scene of young Diana competing in the Amazon Games and learning a hard lesson is great. Gal Gadot is still spectacular. I also liked the main plot wherein everybody gets their fondest wish and it just about destroys the world. It reminded me of the \"Monsters of the Id\" plot from Forbidden Planet. There's also a guest appearance by Lynda Carter in the closing credits.\n\nI think some of the 1 and 2 ratings are politically motivated because of Gadot making a statement in support of her country, Israel. All the haters are trashing the movie probably without having seen it."

        "review_detailed_main": "IN BRIEF: Despite major story problems and pacing issues, there's enough action and romance taking place in this diverting sequel, and Ms. Gadot is back in her breakout role.\n\nJIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Wonder Woman 84 follows the same fate as most sequels that rarely surpass their successful predecessors. This bloated second installment of the Wonder Woman franchise uses its same winning formula, blending a love story with action-packed set pieces, with mixed results. Long awaited, after many delays due to COVID, this once summer solstice Hollywood blockbuster movie is finally being released at winter solstice in select area and being streamed simultaneously. So much for wishes.\n\nAnd wishing is the main issue at the core of this escapist entertainment. The McGuffin is a powerful dreamstone, an archeological relic that sends the world into chaos by a megalomaniacal businessman, Max Lord, and the ability to grant everyone's singular wish. Make a wish...no genie will appear, and it will be granted, but beware of its consequences! Of course, it becomes Diana Prince's aka Wonder Woman's mission to stop him. Along the way she befriends a mousy co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who will blossom into womanhood, reunites with her dead lover Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), and battles evil with her Lasso of Truth.\n\nGal Gagot reprises her role as our superhero and she is again the film's greatest asset. She makes a commanding figure and handles the physical and emotional duties quite well. Director/ Writer Patty Jenkins helms the production and delivers well staged action scenes and a convincing romance. The main problem with her film is twofold: the film's lackadaisical pacing between combat scenes due to a sketchy script in need of tightening and its two major villains that really lack gleeful comic book menace.\n\nAfter a throwaway prologue that adds little to the story except filler, moviegoers are transported back to the eighties. The screenplay takes forever to set the plot mechanics in gear. Too much time is spent reminiscing on 80's nostalgia (the fashions, hair, music. etc.) and introducing new characters. Somebody show Ms. Jenkins the cutting room and hand the lady a scissors please! Nearly 40 minutes into the movie, we are finally whisked away to adventure-land. Judicious editing and a couple of rewrites should have been her first mission.\n\nAs blockbuster extravaganzas go, kudos to the fine CGI and the stunt-people. Ms. Jenkins provides some nifty action throughout the movie, especially in two key scenes: one involving armored vehicles in a desert setting and another at the White House. However, the climactic battle between the villains is a real letdown with many loose ends about characters and their aftermath just left hanging. (An aside: The make-up department has done an awful job with its resemblance to President Reagan and they made Cheetah, an \"apex predator\", look like something from the stock company of Cats: The Musical. Talk about evil forces!)\n\nChris Pine is cleverly resurrected as WW's favorite aviator and he brings some charm once again to his role in this fish-out-of-water scenario. Ms. Wiig falls back on her comic safety net as the late-blooming Barbara before the actress transforms into a fully dimensional character. Pedro Pascal as Max just has too much comic edge as a perverted Gordon \"Greed is Good\" Gekko type. One never believes his evil side.\n\nWW84 has enough satisfying moments between its long hauls of non-stop exposition. I would wish that the third future installment focuses more on a concise story and improve on its pacing, but I don't wanna waste that request. Hopefully the talented Ms. Gadot will be a major player as well. Alas, one wish per customer. (GRADE: B)"

I think it would have been if Gal Gadot was a better at acting.\n\nAction scenes were as bad as the first movie.\n\nBut overall I don't think the rating is justified. It deserves at least a 6.2 generally."

I felt that it had good character-driven moments rather than just aimless fighting and grunting. The performances were good and kept me engaged. My only downside is a particular scene toward the end which I felt like could have been cut down or cut out entirely but it didn't ruin the movie or anything. I liked the dynamic between Diana and Barbara. The scenes between Steve and Diana felt heartwarming. And even Max (although comically villain-ish at times) showed a man driven mad by power in pretty decent way.\n\nOverall, with certain superhero movies, just go see it yourself and don't pay attention to what others say."

(Of all the \"WTF\" moments of 2020 trailers, this was top of the list.... just HOW? A McGuffin is involved, but no spoilers here!).\n\nIn brief, Patty Jenkins delivers a popcorn blockbuster than has legs (over and above Gadot's perfect specimens!): the Goblet-of-Fire-Potteresque pre-title sequence is thrilling and engaging. And the story builds cleverly through the first half of the movie. Above all, there is a heap of HEART involved here.... this is not your run of the mill supervillain showdown flick. In fact, it's a movie with TWO villains (normally a doom-laden premise for this reviewer... \"Spider Man 3\".... shudder), but here it really works well.\n\nSure, there is a requirement for a suspension of belief, but - hey - it's a DC movie. On a slight downside, the second half of the movie - for me -unfortunately doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first half, blending \"Bruce Almighty\" with \"Superman 2\" and rather over-egging the pudding.\n\nBut in a lockdown morass of B-pics, this sequel is one that is gorgeous to look at (Matthew Jensen's cinematography is superb), gorgeous to listen to (an epic score by Hans Zimmer) and is genuinely engaging. There's also a nice vein of humour running through it... when Kristen Wiig is in a park, a rough sleeper on a bench is reading \"Waiting for Godot\".... or is it \"Waiting for Gadot\"?? It's such a brief scene, I wasn't sure!\n\nAlthough I DEPLORE the Warner's decision to release their material in parallel to streaming, here is a movie that is MAGNIFICENT on the big screen and WELL WORTH you getting out to the cinema to see... assuming that you can find a UK cinema open (I saw this in the excellent Showcase De Lux in Southampton).\n\nOh, and if you are someone who dives for the exit at the first title... resist... there is an excellent and surprising mid-title sequence that will particularly appeal us older folks!\n\n(Please check out the full graphical review on bob-the-movie-man, which will be going live shortly.

And then there is our legend Hans Zimmer who made my ears delightful throughout the movie. Background Score saved this at a very large scale. I can spend so much time just listening to Zimmer's Godly score. Direction and Story felt nowhere near the 1st movie. Gal Gadot didn't get much to do. Kristen Wiig' cheetah also got very low time. VFX works were great. As a DC fan , nowhere near expectations. Its good when you consider as a non superhero movie. Delivers some great message and its not dark like other DCEU movies.

I'm not sure exactly what this sequel brings new to the table.\n\nThere's plenty of heart and hope, much in the vein of the Christopher Reeve Superman films (this film even gives off Superman III vibes, not necessarily a positive). The romance between Diana and Steve is once again the highlight of the film. Their scenes are terrific and you really feel the connection between these two. The film outside of that, is so-so.\n\nMaxwell Lord is pretty generic with his take-over-the-world aspirations and Cheetah is fine, without being particularly noteworthy. The idea of wishes is the center of the story and the film handles it with mixed results. Some of the logic is iffy and there's just some lacking in forward momentum that the first film had. The CGI is also stunningly bad for a film with this budget. Some of Diana's movement look very stiff and awkward. The action scenes are okay, if sparse and not particularly outstanding. The film is also way too long and could've shaved off 45 minutes at least.\n\nThis isn't a bad film, but it just feels like it could've been something more. It also feels like a step back for the DCEU. WW84 is a decent source of joy in these unique times, but don't expect a DC classic."

The action is dull, the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023. If you love Gal Gadot check this movie out, other then that this is a hard pass."

        "review_detailed_main": "The year is 1984. For some reason. Diana(Gadot, asked to carry a lot of the movie on her shoulders, and, sadly for all of us, out of her depth) still misses Steve Trevor(Pine, charming as ever, given less to do than last time). You'd think she misses her people, family, home country, more than the guy she knew for a week 66 years ago, but whatever. One day, he mysteriously returns. And a number of people are having wishes granted. Can something like that happen without serious consequences? And is it possible to include a moral message about that, without getting extremely condescending?\n\nThis is a mess. While I wish it was significantly better, I won't let my disappointment affect this review, I will be entirely honest. The tone is again partially that of the Christopher Reeves(RIP) Superman movies, especially the first two, except for when it's gritty and harsh. Those two approaches clash. A lot of the acting is reminiscent of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, which works a lot of the time there, yet rarely here. The storytelling is sloppy, with countless instances of people somehow guessing where to go(and what to do, and what is happening), superpowers with inconsistent rules and sometimes lasting only one seem never to be mentioned before or after. It seems as though the Golden Lasso can do absolutely anything that they felt like it could at that moment. You have to look pretty hard to find a bigger fan of Patty Jenkins than me. I've watched Monster over two dozen times, before the release of Birds of Prey the first Wonder Woman solo movie was easily my favourite DCEU entry, and honestly I do still think she has more amazing movies in her. I don't think the blame lies entirely on her for the low quality of this film. It appears to me that it was butchered in the editing room, with the unusually long post production allowing for way too many producer notes, as studio people got cold feet about certain aspects of this. That would explain why so many things in this are poorly set up and/or go unresolved.\n\nThis features disturbing material. I recommend it only to the biggest fans of the people who made it. 4/10."

There are definitely some flaws that could have been improved but the theme, message, escapism, cinematography, performance of the actors and actresses(especially Gal Gadot), the beautiful Golden Eagle Armor and the emotional aspect of the movie will keep you interested to watch it and feel amazed or satisfied.

She's mesmerizing and you just can't take your eyes off her. She was excellent in emotional scenes and as always great in the action sequences. Kristen Wigg's transformation from Barbara to Cheetah is mind-blowing. Pedro Pascal played the role of Maxwell Lord to perfection.

        "review_detailed_main": "I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie \"Wonder Woman\" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham.\n\nAnd while \"Wonder Woman 1984\" was definitely a watchable movie, it just wasn't really up to par with the 2017 movie in anyway. Why? Well, simply because the storyline felt way too comical and the villains in the movie weren't really all that interesting or menacing.\n\nThe storyline told in \"Wonder Woman 1984\" just fell short of being all that entertaining. Sure, it was a watchable movie, but it was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable foray into the D.C. world of superheroes. For me, the storyline here felt like something that had been ping ponged around a breakfast table, with the writers just tossing out ideas and settling on something that seemed like something that could be made into a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nOf course it was nice to have Gal Gadot return to portray Diana/Wonder Woman in this 2020 movie, and she was joined with talents such as Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal. I must admit that Pedro Pascal's performance was actually the most brilliant and enjoyable in the movie, and his character was the one with the most appeal in the movie. Mind you, as a villain he just wasn't all there. I mean, it was more of an average Joe come into power situation, so it took away from the usual superpowered villain stuff you'd expect to see in a D.C. movie.\n\nFor me, the whole granting wishes thing concept of the movie just felt out of place, and like something that belonged in a whole different type of movie. It just failed to captivate me, and proved to have little entertainment value in terms of being the focal point of a superhero movie.\n\nVisually then \"Wonder Woman 1984\" was all there, just like the 2017 movie was. So the visual effects team definitely worked their magic with this 2020 movie, no doubt about that.\n\nWhile I have now seen \"Wonder Woman 1984\" once, I doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time, as the storyline just felt out of place and too weak for a movie for Wonder Woman.\n\nMy rating of \"Wonder Woman 1984\", sadly, lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."

        "review_title": "Nowhere Near As Bad As The Worst Reviews",
        "review_detailed_main": "Reading the utter carnage of poor reviews for this film, I can only conclude that they were either written by people with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the superhero genre, or by people with no knowledge of it whatsoever. No middle ground. Now, I can understand Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons combing through the minutia and taking grave exception to the film's cliches, apocryphal inconsistencies and general awfulness. But for everyone else, what were you expecting? The character development of Brando from On The Waterfront? A savvy, tightly woven script written by Charlie Kaufman?\n\nIn truth, WW1984 requires only as much suspension of disbelief as a swathe of other superhero movies, and doesn't brandish nearly as much plot armour as some other, more highly rated films (Yes, X-Men, I'm looking squarely at you). Before viewing, I was most concerned about how the gimmick of the 1984 time setting would effect the mood of gravitas established by its 2017 predecessor. Would the sequel lapse into bathos, like so many films in the MCU? Because when I think of cheesy, this is scriptwriting straight from the Kraft factory. Maintaining consistency of tone was always going to be a bridge too far, I think, and there are indeed a handful of scenes where the eighties schtick is a bit glitchy. But there's nothing that I found particularly grating...knowing full well how it could have been handled.\n\nSo, what did I enjoy about the film? I thought that it was well acted, on the whole. Gal Gadot infuses the WW character with lustre, sincerity and steely resolve. She does a fine job with what is, and must be, a cartoonish script (this is not Citizen Kane, remember). Chris Pine is also very good, and there is no doubting the onscreen chemistry between the two leads (not something to be taken for granted). And I did kinda 'dig' the villain. Pedro Pascal has one hell of a time playing wannabe oil magnate, Max Lord, and at least some attempt was made by the writers to sketch a backstory and endow him with a sense of human fragility. In this respect, I enjoyed him far more than the utterly two dimensional baddie Ludendorff from the first WW film, not to mention David Thewlis's 'ping, I'm actually Ares' moment in the third act (as much as I like Thewlis as an actor).\n\nOne more thing to like about WW1984: it's got some really cool aesthetics. The opening 15 minutes, set in Themyscira, is a visual feast and features some compelling cinematography as the camera - virtual or otherwise - swoops and weaves its way around the island as Amazonian athletes strut their stuff. Another well crafted scene involves an admittedly implausible fragment of plot - as Chris Pine flies a 'borrowed' aircraft through an explosion of fireworks en-route to Cairo to save humanity. Ridiculous? Yes. But beautifully shot nonetheless.\n\nOverall, whilst this film certainly ain't no Ironman or Deadpool, it's no Dr Strange either (if we are to speak of totally unearned character development or abuses of logic and physics). I do think that WW1984 is a solid 7, rating it as one must within the genre it is occupying. To lowball the film with ratings of one is really unfair in my opinion. The hyperbolic claims of 'worst film ever' come, I think, from a place of Fanboy-Dom, where unforgivable blasphemies occur and people cheerlead both for and against their favourite franchises. I would recommend the film as no better or worse than a multitude of other superhero movies. Whilst this is hardly high praise, I can honestly say that I thought the film was quite fun, at times moving, with likeable leads and some solid performances. In short, I was entertained."

The entire thing looks like it was shot on film (after a quick google search I confirmed I was right and my eyes are really trained to notice the difference between film and digital now), so the colors look great and the image really pops. The cinematography was pretty solid throughout, although I thought it didn't look the greatest at times.\n\nThe film has some CGI that's... bad. A lot of the CGI looks great, but some of it just really doesn't work. The characters are all well written, and the main villain of the film, Maxwell Lord, was really interesting to see. I think he got a little over the top near the end of the film, but he was an interesting villain (a lot better than Ares in the original film...). The movie is entertaining throughout, although I thought some of the action scenes did drag on for a little too long. The score by Hans Zimmer is great, and the film keeps a fast pace and there's never a moment where it drags throughout its two and a half hour runtime. Overall, this is a well written and well made sequel to the original film, and although it has its flaws, I'd definitely recommend seeing it if you liked the first. 7/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Jenkins' fast paced direction makes this film an effective comic book movie that leans heavily on wholesomeness and optimism, leaving out any kind of moral ambiguity or nuance for bright colours and popcorn friendly ostentatious action scenes. WW84 is a rare superhero sequel that, for better or rarely worse, carves its own path and finds something joyous, wacky and deeply enjoyable as a result. Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she remains a charismatic presence who wields the lasso with authority. There are some fantastic costumes and some terrific bold performances from a delightful cast specially Pedro Pascal who's talent is being wasted behind the Mandalorian helmet. It's a visually dazzling melodrama that has to hide it's relative disinterest in superpowered showdowns but the movie's in service of a plot that sometimes loses sight of what makes the character so great in the first place. Though the film can't quite reach the heights of the first film, it is still brimming with the same wonder and joy as the previous one beacuse unlike the first the flaws are minor and aren't glaring at you and the movie definitely soars beautifully when it matters the most. Overall, Wonder Woman 1984 is a very hopeful film with hints of sadness and realism especially towards the end and it kinda takes you back into the real world with a much needed message of hope and a sense of optimism, contemplated strongly by the musical score from the legend Hans Zimmer."

Who ever wrote this seems to watched all the old action hero shows from the 70's and 80's and pulled the worst and most wooden parts of the shows and stuck them all in this production. In addition, the ancillary characters too WW are rather poor. Even Chris Pine, who I like in most things, doesn't really fit in the movie. He seems to realize what a stinker he signed up for and kind of, sort of phones in his performance (compared to other roles he's played). There's a reason this made it's appearance in streaming so quickly. So, watch the opening scenes a few times and then just hang it up and call it a night.

Its like a MCU movie without any of the humor, action, quips or even good writing. Just a colorful cheese ride that is one part conflicted nostalgia bait and one part sad romance.\n\nHonestly, Pedro Pascal as a Nicholas Cage-esque Lex Luthor, a time gap Steve, nods to the old TV series and a very special cameo aside it was honestly a poor movie. Even for a sucker for Wonder Woman like me.\n\nRATING: 6/10 (As an obviously biased Wonder Woman fan)"

        "review_title": "A Disappointing Sequel",
        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman 1984, directed by Patty Jenkins, significantly underperforms compared to its predecessor, delivering a sequel that lacks the coherence and emotional depth of the original. Despite its vibrant 1980s setting and a promising premise, the film struggles with a convoluted plot, uneven pacing, and underwhelming character development.\n\nThe story follows Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, living in 1984 Washington, D. C., working at the Smithsonian and performing heroic deeds in secret. The plot centers around the Dreamstone, an artifact that grants wishes but at a significant cost. Diana's wish brings back her deceased lover, Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine, whose return feels forced and undermines Diana's independence, making him a \"masculine crutch\" rather than a supportive character like Peggy Carter in the Captain America films.\n\nGal Gadot continues to shine as Wonder Woman, but even her strong performance cannot save the film from its narrative flaws. The script fails to give Diana the same level of complexity and growth seen in the first film, reducing her to a more passive figure. The return of Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, while charming, dominates the storyline unnecessarily and detracts from Diana's heroism.\n\nKristen Wiig's portrayal of Barbara Minerva/Cheetah and Pedro Pascal's Maxwell Lord add some intrigue but ultimately fall flat. Wiig's transformation from a meek scientist to a powerful villain is one of the more interesting arcs, but it is rushed and lacks depth. Pascal's Maxwell Lord starts strong but becomes increasingly cartoonish, failing to provide a compelling adversary.\n\nThe film's pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition and meandering subplots that detract from the main narrative. Key themes about truth and the consequences of wish fulfillment are lost in the cluttered storyline. The over-reliance on CGI, especially in the climactic battle scenes, makes the action feel less grounded and more cartoonish compared to the original.\n\nVisually, the film has its moments, with vibrant colors and some well-executed action sequences, but these are not enough to compensate for the lack of a cohesive and engaging story. The opening sequence featuring a young Diana in an athletic competition is a standout, but nothing else in the film matches its visual cohesion or emotional impact.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the magic of the original. The film's convoluted plot, underdeveloped characters, and uneven pacing result in a lackluster viewing experience. While Gal Gadot's performance and the nostalgic 1980s aesthetic provide some highlights, they are not enough to overcome the film's significant weaknesses. Wonder Woman 1984 earns a 4 out of 10 for its missed potential and overall execution, leaving fans yearning for the brilliance of the first film."

The dialogue was horrendous. I get that she's a newb writer, but having two other seasoned writers - Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham, there is no excuse for this horrible story. A 5th grader could've written this better.\n\nAs an experienced director, she also failed miserably in her direction of the entire 151 minute runtime. Even the great Hans Zimmer's score was too loud, constant and overbearing. Who green-lit this poor excuse of a superhero movie?\n\nLinda Carter must've cringed cashing her cameo paycheck. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, all going to the poor crew that at least came up with some decent S/VFX."

It has problems in a few areas, but it isn't worth hating and the visuals and action are fun. It also is clearly having a lot of fun with the period and with fashion, which isn't for everyone.\n\nFor my money, among DC films, the trash heap that was Aquaman fully deserved all the 2's and 4's this movie's getting. The fact it currently gets 6.9 is inexplicable to me. It was nonsensical idiocy with no plot or character. WW84 is just clumsily written and directed but at least seems to know what a movie is supposed to be and, y'know, has three discernible acts.\n\nI suspect this movie is getting review bombed because there are obvious parallels to Trump in the male villain. He's a sleazy/trashy conman/businessman who's a loser and a failure and desperately wants more wealth and power and somehow gets it when no one expected it. That said, it's not exactly the story of Trump at each step, it's just taking a character who's similar and telling a morality tale about related themes. But I don't doubt the partisans will take offence.\n\nThis movie just really needed more editing (2.5 hours is too long for what they have) and better direction. The logic of the McGuffin at the centre of the story isn't explained very clearly, but withholding the explanation isn't that interesting or exciting, it's actually pretty clich\u00e9.\n\nNot being clear about what's happening until way too late in the movie muddles the plot and just makes the hero look incompetent because it's not clear what a disadvantage she's at or why. Either explain the threat almost as soon as the McGuffin is in play and have the hero be really, really weak and in danger or reveal the danger of the McGuffin in the third act after the hero solves the mystery and then have them suddenly in danger from it. But this movie tries to do both and ends up just revealing the threat in dribs and drabs so no one knows how much to care about the threat to the hero, because we have no idea how bad it is.\n\nMaybe they were trying to please everyone and have a strong and capable woman but put her at just enough disadvantage that at times she needed a man's help as well? If so, they just succeeded at pleasing no one. She's not the same model of female empowerment anymore, but the guys who have a problem with female empowerment still aren't going to be satisfied and the vast majority of average viewers who aren't that political are just annoyed they have no idea if she supposed to be powerful or weak in any given scene.\n\nAll in all it was entertaining enough that I didn't turn it off, but long and uneven enough that I was checking the runtime around the 2 hour mark."

I think the DP as well as the colorist did a phenomenal job on this film.\n\nOne other thing I enjoyed was Steve (Chris Pine) re-discovering the world. The fish out of water element was a nice re-visit with a flipped script since this was done in WW1 with Diana.\n\nLet's face facts it is comic book movie and the cheese level is pretty high on the scale here, but the underlying message about truth is not just fortune cookie wisdom. It actually has much more meaning in a world like our own today in 2020.\n\nCall it what you want? Call it faith, call it Karma this movie was made for a reason not just to fill the taste buds of comic book fans but to make us all look a little deeper at ourselves and ask... Am I really so bad off? and what Truth can I put forth to make myself better.\n\nWith all the CGI and hyper over stylized action this movie meets the lust of 80's cheese full on, and while it will not be as memorable as the first WW. It is still a decent entry into the series.\n\nBut sit back and appreciate the velveeta fest on display and take the one message the film does deliver.\n\nI chose 4 stars because I felt that the 3 star rating of \"Meh... it passed the time\" is not a true statement of this film, and I don't think it is awesome by any stretch of the definition of the word. However, it is entertaining and out a scale of 1 to 5 it delivers on the scale at a solid 4."

WW 1984, its time-line is set among the Cold War nuclear hysteria, and our heroine Diana Prince (Gadot) does the usual superhero good deeds while remain certain degree of anonymity in Washington D.C.. Still pining for her lost lover, the WWI pilot Steve Trevor (Pine), she alights on a magical wish-granting gem, makes her wish and hey presto! Steve's soul is tossed back into our world (inhabiting another man's body, but in the eyes of his smitten beholder, he is the same old Steve all right), but soon it occurs to her that this miracle has a price to pay, the star-crossed lovers have to brave another adieu when Diana must choose to do the right thing, the emotional crunch is well-wrought, and Pine's soulful blue eyes are too irresistible to take our eyes off, and Gadot also passes muster to act out some real affect other than her acrobatic fighting showmanship.\"\n\nread my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"

        "review_title": "Tedious, bloated, and predictable, with some hilarious gaffes",
        "review_detailed_main": "We were so close. 2020, thanks to the COVID epidemic and its effect on film distribution, was very nearly the first year in ages without a single big-studio capesh-t movie, with the exception of Birds of Prey.\n\nBut the folk at DC got the idea quicker than Marvel (that online streaming, for better or worse, is the future)), announcing that Wonder Woman 1984 would come straight to HBO Max at Christmas but with a few screenings at the same time - a model set for most of Warner Bros.' other releases going forward (not always with the consent of associated studios, apparently). Time will tell if Marvel will do the same with Black Widow; they clearly aren't shy about putting a gazillion other items on Disney+. Logically, DC must be the real feminists.\n\nIf there's one other thing the DC Extended Universe keeps outclassing Marvel on, it's inconsistency - of tone, of style, of lore, the works - and Wonder Woman 2 is no exception. It's downright impressive. Whereas the MCU can only muster up a retcon or two within Captain Marvel and an uncertainty of how many years have truly passed since the \"Battle of New York\" (a question raised by Spider-Man: Homecoming), DC manage to get something wrong with each new installment. Bravissimo!\n\nNext up to \"undo\" for the DCEU is a fact established by Batman v Superman and confirmed by the first Wonder Woman film: that Diana \"Wonder Woman\" Prince went off the grid after World War I, resurfacing only after the Earth's close encounter with Kryptonians. Wonder Woman 1984 decides that \"Nah, she actually did some other stuff during the 80s (that no one remembers) and we picked the 80s because Thor: Ragnarok is one of the Marvel films we haven't aped yet, excluding the trippy bits in Aquaman.\n\nBut the movie isn't as out-there or charmfully old-fashioned as Ragnarok. We do get some synth tracks, some colorful outfits, and vibrant locations that may be at home in a John Hughes film or a Stranger Things season, but this is still, for the most part, just another modern blockbuster - complete with a misogynistic Trump look-alike, this one being played by a Latino actor in what might be the final jab at Trump. After all, Hollywood soon won't have a Trump to regurgitate their jokes about; in a sense, they already don't.\n\nMaybe Warner Bros wishes they had streamed this film even earlier. Maybe the post-election release of this film made them realize just how much they'll miss this. Watching the ham-tacular Pedro Pascal in WW84 really does feel like the end of an era (not that future movies won't make Trump jokes way past their relevance) and it's a touch bittersweet. I'm sure the point still stands that some things haven't changed since the Reagan years (Pascal's Trump caricature is shown to be in control of the US president of the time) but we all know this sort of satire won't be as fun for Hollywood without a Drumpf, even if it succeeds at seeming \"woke\", as is always a plus.\n\nBut uh-oh, then we have the controversial Egypt scenes, which I've gathered aren't doing wonders for the woke points; critics are irked by the idea of Gal Gadot, an Israeli ex-military celeb garbed in American colors, going to Cairo to set things right and save soccer-playing Arabic children from an incoming missile (that her faction fired but let's no try to sort out all the nonsense). In Kyle Kallgren's words, they \"made a scene where a superhero undoes a war crime that the lead actor was likely involved in\". So that's pretty funny.\n\nWhat elevates the movie, in spite of it all, is how likable Gadot's Wonder Woman is - when Gadot's trying. She may be easier to relate to this time around, while retaining the attributes that make her inspiring. She was a demigoddess that became more human; now she's at home among mankind, having to explain modern amenities to a time-traveling Chris Pine (inhabiting the body of someone who gets no say in whether he/they should have sex with Diana).\n\nStill, it's mostly stuff we've seen before - the fish-out-of-water stuff with Pine has been done, the Kristen Wiig character has been done (by Pixar, Marvel, and DC themselves, albeit not always with a furry element), and the ideas surrounding the wish-granting stone have been done (with far more intelligible rules). If it was shorter and more self-aware, I'm sure I wouldn't mind. As it stands, it is a weak film that some of you might have fun with anyway, especially during its idiotic, hideous, sloppily produced action moments.\n\nAnd no matter how hard you insist that this is a comic-book movie and so it isn't meant to be taken that seriously (despite the insisted poignancy and emotional weight of several scenes), nor be realistic, Diana Prince \"swinging\" on lightning bolts with her whip isn't going to look non-stupid. \"It's meant to look cool, though\", someone might say, and the fact that it goes for coolness at the expense of rudimentary realism is what makes it so goofy.\n\nI'm sure there is a possibility she's being helped by her pep-pep Zeus during these moments but that only reminds me of the sad fact that, should Zeus ever appear in the DCEU, we won't get to see a mythologically accurate love life."

Pedro Pascal is a marvelous antagonist in the form of Maxwell Lord. The action sequences are cool to watch when there are any. The villains here are much better than Ares from the first movie, and WW84 has a superior third act to its predecessor. This movie has some great humor, and it never fails to make you laugh when needed. The emotional moments in WW84 are so heartbreaking to watch, it never fails to make the audience cry, or shed a tear. The story here is good, but it drags midway through the movie, and it's not as good as it could've been. The pacing was all over the place, something that bothered me in the movie. Overall, it's a step down from the first movie, but it's not bad like people make it out to be!! P.S. Stay for the credits, it'll be worth it!!"

We may never know how things turned so bad from something originally so promising, as its now unlikely we will ever again see the Diana Prince and her adventures we all feel in love with back in 2017.\n\n1 1/2 wishes out of 5"

It is a fact that the female hero is difficult to film, referring to Captain Marvel next door, is a comprehensive view of WW two movies, are wrapped in the shell of a superhero, the inner essence or human weaknesses. Diana image is always sent to deal with combat, the emotional line is the core of WW, Diana again strong, also can not save his true love Stevie, there is a kind of ancient Greek tragedy."

The storyline was just ridiculous and so far over the top that it all started falling apart very early. There was very little momentum after a promising start, and it was easy to start getting bored. Still - I enjoyed it as a bland fun movie, but with an obvious middle and end."

        "review_title": "WW84 is an underrated and different superhero film, but the character driven plot fits Wonder Woman",
        "review_detailed_main": "Wonder Woman 1984 is the second installment in Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman trilogy. It's very much her movie as she co-wrote the script with Geoff Johns and Dave Callahan, she also directed and produced the movie.\n\nPatty Jenkins is a great director, she showed it with the first Wonder Woman and of course her award winning Monster. I have read multiple reviews that WM84 isn't a good film but I disagree, it's different and not the average superhero film and I'm glad Patty Jenkins and her team made it a character driven film and not about a dark versus light. Instead it's more about the characters and about greed, I found the pacing to be perfect for the character driven story. The overall writing was great, maybe a few things could be improved but I liked it.\n\nThe first installment took place in 1918, and the sequel finds Diana Prince at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C while secretly performing heroic deeds as Wonder Woman. It have been 66 years and in that time she have grown wiser and more mature, also learning new powers and mastering old.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 is much more character driven than the previous film and I'm fine with that, the characters are well written and rightfully cast, great acting from everyone. It's extremely light in tone and the stages in life that Diana/WM is believable and I appreciate a movie like WW84 and Shazam to be this lighthearted. Wonder Woman is truly a hero in this film, saving countless of lives and honestly not hurting a single person. It says says a lot of a person, but she isn't perfect and nor is the other main characters, everyone has flaws and that's why they are realistic and likeable.\n\nPedro Pascal portrays Maxwell \"Max Lord\" Lorenzano, he's a struggling yet charismatic businessman who are famous for TV infomercials, and the founder of Black Gold Cooperative. After spending the majority of his life searching for the mythical Dreamstone, Lord acquires it and uses it for power and personal gain. What you'll see and notice about the film and the story its trying to tell is that it's about greed, fitting then as it is now.\n\nKristen Wiig portrays Barbara Minerva / Cheetah who are an insecure geologist and gemologist who befriends Diana before becoming imbued with mystical abilities that gradually transform her into an apex predator-like superhuman, Cheetah. Seeing Kristen as Cheetah was one of the highlights, she was perfect for the role and made the character justice.\n\nChris Pine returns as Steve Trevor and it was everything I wanted for the character, I'm glad he could come back. Great performance.\n\nThe fight sequences aren't bad, they just aren't exciting and engaging enough. I want to say this though, I have respect and appreciate the work Patty Jenkins placed into the action sequences and lack of violence, it fits with Wonder Woman and the tone of the movie completely. What I love with the action sequences are the choreography and the use of Wonder Woman's powers and skills, Gal Gadot is amazing.\n\nMatthew Jenson was the director of photography and he's an acclaimed cinematographer, his work in this film doesn't go unnoticed. The cinematography is incredible and one of the highlights of the movie, as it's so pleasant for your eyes.\n\nThe musical score by Hans Zimmer is hopeful, powerful and brilliant. Perfect return to the superhero genre.\n\nSome final thoughts about the ending, no spoilers. I found the ending to be perfect, and I'm so glad there weren't a cgi boss that Wonder Woman needed to beat as that would have destroyed the themes and tone of the movie, it's the one thing I disliked about the first film, how there had to be a cgi boss battle. The ending was perfect and they have set up some very nice things for the third installment, I hope Patty Jenkins brings in Donna Troy as a new character."

        "review_detailed_main": "I mean, guys, this movie had a proposal at the beginning: make us swollow down girl power. Ok, I don't like this kind of stuff because everybody has the right to be what they want to be and I don't need a movie to show me that. But at least it had a point at the beginning, and I was ready to take it.\n\nBut as the plot goes on, the movie becomes boring, with empty attempts of comic relief, and worse, it felt like the director took vacation and let everyone take decisions. Seams Patty Jenkins told the actors \"you are great actors, act like you'd want to\". So the VFX supervisors took her exemple and let the VFX team do what they pleased: No sense good-looking CGI (I don't even know that could exist such thing).\n\nThere was a time the movie started giving me too much information, too much supernatural rules like a very bad RPG master who wants to fill up the story.\n\nI WON'T EVEN SAY ABOUT WRITING MISS JENKINS & GEOFF JOHNS!!!\n\nIn short, it's a miserable fail with a big potential. I had everything to redeem the first movie, but writers and director couldn't deliver it. I KNOW there's the fact of COVID-19 and all, but I won't refresh on my opinion. It's sad how a full star production could be so misused.\n\nI feel sad about Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal who are great actors. I feel sad specially for Gal Gadot who took part on the production in addition of being a phenomenal artist. This movie was a disrespect for the main acting team's career."

The pace of the movie seems like there are moments where things aren't explained and others where things are overextended/over explained. But to sit back and watch Gal Gadot in her WW role is amazing. Chris Pine as Steve is exactly how you want him. Handsome, cynical, and ready to defend the one woman who has his heart. Kristen Wiig truly captured the essence of Cheetah and her insecurities. I wish there were more of her and Diana to really show the comic book side of things. But..Pedro Pascal was loving playing Max Lord and it came through. Overall is was truly a great movie. Already watching again... DO WATCH THE END CREDITS!!! It's sooo worth it!! I was jumping up n down seeing my childhood WW show up! Ready to watch again."

Then, things change and we see for five minites adult Wonder Woman saving the they in a shopping mall. Despite some nonsense action scenes with the lasso, it seemed that the movie would have a vintage old-school superhero approach, what could also be very interesting. However, after that, the real film began as what it would be until the end: an embarassing and silly soap opera with poor script, a lot pf shallow self-help and inconsistent superpowers and magic. While both villains are ridiculous, the idea of Diana's dead lover possessing another man was even much worse! Script is not only cheesy as the worst clich\u00e9 romantic comedies, but also quite lazy, as the evil rock of desires makes obvious. Cheetah's uprising, the invisible plane... everything had a bad and unintelligent explanation in the story, or simply was not explained, such as the weird flight (was that Supergirl?! Is that Hawkgirl?! I thought it was a Wonder Moman movie!). To resume: awful blockbuster. Gal Gadot also looks better when she is in superpower action full of CGI than when she is actually acting."

The only link I can see, is this movie had a campy feel, similar to the Superman sequels of the mid-80s."

        "review_detailed_main": "Maybe it's because I'm biased, I admit that I've been a DC comics fan (and it's movies/TV shows based off of their characters) since the 70s. Running home from elementary school to watch Batman with Adam West and waking up early Saturday morning to watch Superman George Reeve. When the Wonder Woman TV show with Linda Carter aired, I was all in and one of the privileged that saw Christopher Reeves wear the red cape with blue suit.\n\nOverall my opinion regarding the DCEU has been mixed, I didn't like Man of Steel as much as the movies from my youth, a \"darker\" Superman just doesn't sit as well with me as the darker Batman does but the attempt to remain faithful to the original look and feel of Krypton was enough for me to look past it. I enjoyed Wonder Woman but didn't much like the WWI setting because it's contrary to the origin story, but suspect that it was in large part to set it apart from the recently released Marvel superhero movie set in the same timeframe, so again, it was enough to get me to look past it.\n\nI genuinely like this movie, plot is new and fresh along with injecting a deeper moral tale to not take short cuts because when you do it will cause you problems down the line. Admittedly, most of my knowledge about Wonder Woman is based off of the 70s tv show and the animated Saturday morning Superfriends or DC animated cartoons of recent years so I'll need to defer to my DC comics colleagues with more knowledge of the source material to provide accuracy details in that department.\n\nI do think it's a decent entry into the DCEU franchise and moving it into it's current direction, which overall I agree with. Aquaman and Shazam both fits nicely in this continuity and soft reboot direction. Action is good, special effects could be better but not distracting and acting is consistent with the previous movie. Not getting the \"Trump\" reference I'm reading in other reviews, but truth is that I put the blame for those criticisms on Hollywood and professional reviewers, not on the individuals who are seeing it. Far too often Hollywood and professional Journalists inject so much political b.s. into the movies that if you see an African American actor playing President it's just assumed that it reflects how that producer views Obama and now if you see a blond funky comb over it's assumed to be Trump. Hollywood and Journalists both need to get a grip and return to Earth.\n\nIf you liked the previous Wonder Woman film or the Aquaman and Shazam movies, you'll like this as well. Again, not as solid, but a good follow-up to the Amazon princess."

Completely unrealistic that she is beating adult women in an olympic thing complete with horse racing and parkour. Then it turns into a goofy moral filled ending of the competition. You are wanting more of her early life story, but then it skips right to adulthood.\n\nThe problem with the rest of the movie is that it has ridiculous amounts of filler. It will spend 10 minutes straight acting as if the main pot line is not there. Stupid things like the mall scene, attacker scene, love story scene, etc. It is like lots of small cut scene movies chopped together. Then you got Pedro Pascal doing the main plot line of the movie the whole time. Pedro is simply not a good villain. It is so laughably bad, but they dragged the movie on for days. It's as if 3 separate movies were made about each main/supporting character and they pieced them together in the editing room. The action scenes randomly appear in the movie, but then they quickly end and go back to the random story lines."

Acting was great. Liked the story honestly. Just tooooo drawn out at times."

        "review_detailed_main": "Look everywhere you see nothing but plethora of 1 star reviews, ranting, complaining and just really boring and non-intelligent rambling.\n\nI don't disagree to majority of the complaint but they're not to the intensity of deserving a 1 star review, a more appropriate be a 6 or 7 stars.\n\nWhat's good about the story of WW84? There are lots actually.\n\n1. I love how the movie explore the aspect of an inner demon, which is ourselves and our desires and wants. Ancient teachers have taught us that to seek answers, look within and to Know Thyself. Why? Because we are our greatest enemies.\n\nThis movie explore the danger of our desires and the harm we unknowingly can hurt our close friends and love ones. I thought this movie is awesome in that regard!\n\nWW84 truly lives to the feminine aspect of looking inward to ourselves, are we truly honest with our selves? Or are we pretending to be someone else we're not just because of fear or ridicule or what others may think? WW84 is an amazing movie to explorer such depth that not few Hollywood movies today do.\n\nAnd WHY AM I THE ONLY WHO SPEAKS OUT ABOUT THIS? I'm sure there are supporters and fans who may be too afraid to speak when they see plethora of negativity.\n\nWELL YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO THE OPPOSITE when you see majority of the \"herd mentality\" like feral pack animals going in one direction, SMACK THE S out of THEM and wake them up. Tell them they are not the Borg, they are not ONE MIND being programmed like zombies and RESISTANCE IS FUTILE is a lie because RESISTANCE always beings about PROGRESS. LOL.\n\n2. There are many positives but I'll just make 2. The solution to our world's biggest problems sometimes DO NOT rely on an single INDIVIDUAL or a single HERO or HEROINE. The greatest message WW84 gives me to and I'm sure millions of fans out there is this MESSAGE - YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL, you may see yourself as just one person and that your thoughts, your actions DO NOT matter. But WW84 is here to tell you, you as an individual - without super powers - your thoughts and actions -DO MATTER!!! Collectively billions of minds added together, if we all believe OUR thoughts, OUR actions matter, then combined the POWER is greater than any single HERO or HEROINE can do. Also WW84 is also trying to say - that LEADERS and HERO/HEROINE greatest task is to EMPOWER the individuals that their voice, their vote matters. That their thoughts and actions matters.\n\nJust these 2 points along makes WW84 a GREAT movie. Plus what's not to like about the beautiful Gal Gadot? The golden armor is just spectacular - really love it. Like Nephilim or Cherubim, the golden arc wings of angelic being of high heavens. Ah - so majestic and beautiful AND powerful.\n\nThink positive guys/gals - for the world need positive thinkers to push society forward."

        "review_detailed_main": "The long anticipated \"WW84\" is finally with us on the big screen and small screen no less, after numerous delays due to the coronavirus we can all finally enjoy seeing DC's blockbuster. But how does it stack up? Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag (but in the best way)! Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot return and it's no secret that they know what they're doing, Gadot has shined from the moment she stepped foot into Wonder Woman's boots and Jenkins clearly has a love for the character (not to mention a talent for directing), aside from Gadot, everyone acting in this film is on their A-Game. Chris Pine returns and continues his wonderful chemistry with Gadot, while newcomers Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig are just performing their hearts out and clearly having a great time. The 80's setting is also a welcome addition, I tend to be a sucker for this period in film and this was no exception. So the acting is great, the direction phenomenal, and the setting fun and colorful. What's the problem? Sadly, the script. While I feel like this movie captures Wonder Woman's spirit it's sadly not very well written. The plot can at times feel zany which is not a problem as it is a superhero film, but the dialogue doesn't help the fact. The entire film feels reminiscent to the 90s Batman movies (With Kristen Wiig's character clearly taking on the Poison Ivy/Riddler role). I wouldn't complain so much but this is coming off the heels of a spectacular first film and that script was actually quite good in terms of story and plot. While one could argue WWI is a darker tone than 1984, it just feels like this movie has a lot going on and the way they speak doesn't I can't keep a straight face. At the end of the day, this is a fun and inviting sequel to its predecessor that has great performances and phenomenal visuals, even if at times it can feel a bit bloated and strange to listen to. I'd gladly watch this film again, but I'd be lying if I admitted the first wasn't better. Also stay tuned for the after credits, for quite a fun surprise."

I always thought that the first movie was a bit overrated, I liked it, but everyone was going gaga over it. I don't think this movie was one bit better or worse than the first one, I actually thought this one had a better villain. Yes, it's full of self righteousness and yes the opening mall scene was very cheezy, but overall I enjoyed it for what it was and I don't think it makes me feel any better or worse about the franchise as a whole."

They tried to take what was good from the first movie but just ended up producing some crappy cheap fast-food version. McWonder Woman. I feel sorry for the actors.

I just don't think every thing needed to be explained, we the viewers can get messages through the actions of characters. I adore Gal Gadot and I think Gal did a solid job as Wonder Woman. She embodies the principles of Diana Prince. I loved most of the action sequences in the movie but they were too far and too few. I can only speak for myself but when I watch a superhero movie I want to see the superhero using their powers most of the time and it wasn't enough of that in this movie. With all this said I really hope to see a third film. As I said before I like Gal and I think she does a good job as Wonder Woman so I have faith, with better material she can deliver an amazing performance."

The extras felt like they were told to ham it up. It held up every awful stereotype. The relationships felt like most of the people met that day, and were uncomfortable around each other. It was not even fun. It had a couple of decent nonsensical action scenes, but the constant shift in her powers, and the overuse of the lasso were unflattering. I am embarrassed for everyone involved in the decision making for this film. The first movie was so good - and this was no just a bad sequel, but the worst superhero movie I have ever seen - and I have seen almost all of them. I often get accused of being too easy on certain films. I would maintain, the above is STILL going easy on this film. Horrendous on every level."

The effects and overall production just felt a little shoddy. There are parts where Gadot is swinging from her lasso where it looked like circa-1984 green screen work.\n\nThe writing is kind of a mess and doesn't feel very inspired. We just kind of skip from one thing to another and there's little cohesion from scene to scene. There are a lot of obviously unlikely or impossible things happening without any attempt to justify them. Yes, this is kind of typical of a lot of movies, but here it's so unabashed and they're not even trying to employ misdirection or anything to make it less obvious.\n\nI would say overall it does manage to be at least a little entertaining though. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig are the stand-outs here. I think both do a good job with what they're given. Yes, the acting overall in the film is a little substandard, but I wouldn't say there are no redeeming performances.\n\nSo, yeah, this was a little bit of a disappointment after the first film (which wasn't perfect either), but I think the poorly-expressed vitriol you see being directed at it is rather hyperbolic."

But I enjoyed it very much, its a not regular routine type of super hero movie, this carries a very strong message and also it shows how a hero can make difference through their words and good deeds, the actual meaning of a hero. Yes this doesn't stand upto to part 1 and didn't connect emotionally as much it did in the last act of its predecessor. Having said that this definitely a good movie, children will love it and learn from it as well. Trust me this will get more praises when times passes. Yes the action could have been a lot better, the over usage of Laso of truth was bummer."

When the main events unfold, it's quite a mess, and the characters keep running around like headless chicken. The action is not impressive, nothing new to see. Many things don't make any sense and I don't even want to start thinking about plotholes... Quite a mess of a movie, it does have some good moments, but it's definitely not a good movie."

It was one of the thousands of films that were advanced because of the Pandemic, but fortunately it was released in 2020, even with controversy, as it will be simultaneous with streaming, something new for the industry.\n\nGal Gadot manages to act and stand out here than in the first film. The two villains are well developed, the story of the two holds you back. The sequel is better than the first film. Well, here it is lighter, upward, high spirits, even with the problems that the humanity of the film faces, and we also in real life, the film brings a speech of optimism and hope. Inspiring us to be better as humanity!\n\nIt has the '80s vibe, but with the look, technologies and ambitions of the time. But, I missed the songs of the time, which was the best time to have a soundtrack. In the trailers, they put \"New Order - Blue Monday\" and it was one of the things that took me to see the movie.\n\nIt also has fan service and references according to the mythology of the heroine in the comics. And that post-credits scene was sensational, it made me tear up and vibrate, and look, I didn't even accompany this person in her time!"
