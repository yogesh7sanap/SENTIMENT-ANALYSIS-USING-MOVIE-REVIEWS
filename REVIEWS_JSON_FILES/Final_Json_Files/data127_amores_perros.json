        "review_detailed_main": "There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles. Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.\n\nEl Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function. With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments. Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.\n\nThese two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman. If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left, happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.\n\nThere is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.\n\nExcept for the director. Like Paul Thomas Anderson in 'Magnolia', although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments. These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.\n\nHe is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn't need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.\n\nMoral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair. The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.\n\n'Amores perros' shares the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like 'Chopper' or 'Bleeder'. But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists' psychosis, here it's part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys.\n\nThe three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.\n\n'Amores perros' is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist."

        "review_detailed_main": "Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, \"Amores Perros\" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget."

I`m not talking about politics. maybe you haven`t lived violence as near as i have, but im gonna tell you something, that is the main reason i voted 9 this movie: Amores perros is not fiction. Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensive models that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes, we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we have houses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as you think. Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Your\u00e8 seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you"

        "review_detailed_main": "This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.\n\nThree different stories in today's Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers.\n\nDirecting is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's debut feature film 'Amores Perros' to me is one of the most remarkable film debuts there is in terms of direction and as an overall film. While he hasn't made a bad film (his weakest 'Babel' is still very good), even if some of his films are very divisive, 'Amores Perros' to me is his best.\n\nIt is a long film but don't let that put you off, 'Amores Perros' makes the most of the running time and rarely does it feel drawn out or overlong. The middle act is quite as good as the rest of the film, the pacing drags a bit but not enough to bring the film down too much. The first story is absorbing but even better is the magnificent last one. Even if they are purposely not likable the characters are compellingly real.\n\nVisually, 'Amores Perros' is a very well made film. Very atmospherically lit, edited and designed. Not a fan of the hand held camera technique but it's very cleverly used here, with an intriguing documentary-like style, and is not abused. It's beautifully scored too.\n\nScripting is complex and absorbing, and the way 'Amores Perros', exploring love, desire, desperation and traumas, is told and constructed allows for many disturbing, shocking, suspenseful and moving moments. It's very thought-provoking too and has real immediacy, as well as hard-hitting emotional power, vast emotional range and is uniquely twisted. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction is exemplary, even early on his style is well established.\n\nActing is very good, especially Emilio Echevarr\u00eda.\n\nOverall, a masterful feature film debut and a masterpiece in its own right. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

        "review_detailed_main": "I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Bu\u00f1uel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').\n\nBeing surrounded by terrible Mexican movies, 'Amores Perros' was so refreshing and remarkably above every expectation that everybody could have about a first-time director (even though he was well-known for his wonderful work at advertising (changing the way ads were made in Mexico) and as a radio DJ in a WFM radio station that contributed to change radio in Mexico, too, along with Rock 101. Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu (in cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga) creates such a complex yet flawless history based on three individual ones that converge not only in the dantesque (reference to Dante Alighieri's style, The Divine Comedy) car accident, but in their perception and description of how love can be harsh, as well as life itself, of how love can get to be a bitch, a struggle.\n\nFirst Story ('Octavio y Susana') is about Octavio's (Garcia Bernal) obsession with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche), but it's also about the violence, about an illusion, about betrayal, about loss. This is also reflected in the character of Octavio's dog, Cofi in a parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny, having lost everything, he'll have to redefine his life. This parallelism also occurs in the second story('Daniel y Valeria'), an almost surreal one, where Ritchie being trapped underneath the condo's floor represents how it's owner Valeria (Goya Toledo) is trapped in a relation with Daniel that grows sicker as her injury (caused by the car accident) gets worse. The removal of the gigantic advertising of 'Enchant', the scent campaign that she used to be the image for, from the view of her balcony represents their decline: Daniel (Avaro Guerrero) left behind his marriage for this superficial mirage kind of dream, and she will have to make a whole redefinition of her life after losing everything. The dog-character parallelism with the main characters of this film can also be noticed in the third story ('El Chivo y Maru'), where 'El Chivo' (Emilio Echevaria), a former College teacher that left it all, family included, to become some guerrilla terrorist (is there a symbolism for Subcommander Marcos, from EZLN?), and now finds, by losing it all (all of his dogs being killed), but finding a new reason, new company just before a hit-man-type mission where he sets a confrontation between two brothers in such a biblical style the chance that none of the characters from the rest of the stories had: redemption. That's when he decides to retrieve some of the things he has lost, like Maru (Lourdes Echevarria -Emilio's actual daughter in real life), by at least apologizing to her, and redeeming himself finding a new life. It's clear that he'll stop being a homeless, because by the end of the movie he's got plenty of money. This story is one step ahead of the other two, cause after the loss they are all victims of, 'El Chivo' is the only one who gets that chance to start from scratch once again. Huge merit to Emilio Echevarria's performance for making believable the only character that was in risk of not being plausible of the film. Because of the relation within the characters, their dogs and their own love personal story, the title is, too a big success (both in Spanish and in English).\n\nOf the episodic narrative structure of the movie (a few critics in the Cannes Film Festival compared it with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), it can be said that besides making it more beautiful and complex, it's also necessary. One can't figure a way to resolve the situation other than this one. The thrill, the shock would never be the same. For example, if each one was a short film instead, it wouldn't work the same way as the whole movie.\n\nIn the film, Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu allows himself to appear a few times: in the editorial where Daniel works, for example, verifying a magazine cover; having some of the TV spots he made in the 90's when he was a publicist shown in the movie; and in the last scene, 'El Chivo' names the dog he rescued (formerly known as Cofi) as 'El Negro', I\u00f1arritu's nickname."

        "review_detailed_main": "Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.\n\nThe more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the first-time watch, but with an examining view the next time you see it; you're driven into a vision, a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one, which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs, it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners:\n\n1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dog-fighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life, so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.\n\n2' In the second story, beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fianc\u00e9 to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time, the puppy gets used to live a super-luxury pet life; which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fianc\u00e9's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete; thus stays stuck there and began to squawk, since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone, having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end, as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.\n\n3' In the last story, the grim hit-man El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi, after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life, he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dog-fighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home, Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hit-man. As Cofi killed innocent dogs; El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself ugly,dirty and strange among the people; like his dog feeling himself ugly,dirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs, when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet, he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves, cuts his beard and hair, gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life; his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.\n\nThe vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person, who can guide and who can help us, is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices, we build the essence of our character: Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences; we always face the risk, fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality, we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of self-search. Here in Amores Perros, the 3 main characters are used by their self-search reflection on their dogs.\n\nDoesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\"? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs; it is a movie that has no characters, but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening, there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So, a person doesn't have a soul(or a character) if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives.\n\nIf we don't believe in this vision, certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion."

Not to denigrate his work, of course. After all, the ability to trust your actors and let them work is key to being a great director.

        "review_detailed_main": "'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.\n\nIn a single moment in time, several lives in Mexico City will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. The film divides itself into three separate segments: representing the past, present, and future. Octavio is searching for recognition and love, but looks in the wrong places. It's a desire that drives him, leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. Valerie, whose life is most impacted by the car accident, finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and self-destructing. El Chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter, and the void it's left in his life. He finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street, and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. Together, the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. They will find themselves connected by a single thread: love. And the hell that can be unleashed with it.\n\nWhen I finished watching 'Amores Perros', one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'Babel' couldn't have been this good. Where 'Babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs, 'Amores Perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. It's a visceral and gritty film, so raw and intense. You may think you've seen it all, but 'Perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. You may find it difficult not to look away at times. I\u00f1arritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust', and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing, it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. I\u00f1arritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish, which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous, even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark, fierce, and relentless, but nothing short of greatness.\n\n'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses, all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is, as always, brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in, but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo, and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film, but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie, a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting, if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances, too many to cover, but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.\n\n'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running, which tops two-and-a-half hours. It's all a very human and primal film, which can be attributed to I\u00f1arritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutli-faceted story with electric performances, 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in film-making, this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions, and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love."

        "review_title": "A Car Crash, Canines and Consequences Examined in I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Viscerally Powerful Feature Film Debut",
        "review_detailed_main": "If like me, you were dazzled by this year's \"Babel\", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to \"Babel\", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\"), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: \"Love's a Bitch\"), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like \"Babel\", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.\n\nThe first plot line, \"Octavio and Susana\", is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio, his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood, and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story, \"Daniel and Valeria\", focuses on Daniel, a married, guilt-ridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident, and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story, \"El Chivo and Maru\", is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs, he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner, both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a non-linear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.\n\nUnbelievably, this powderkeg of a film represents I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's feature film debut as a director, and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of \"Pulp Fiction\". He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarr\u00eda the standout as the grizzled El Chivo, a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor; and as Susana and Ramiro, Vanessa Bauche and Marco P\u00e9rez provide powerful support. Together, they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria, fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement, while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the put-upon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with \"The Motorcycle Diaries\", \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Babel\", Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.\n\nThe 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative, often meticulous commentary track by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Arriaga (spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English). There are three quick featurettes. The first is a six-minute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are, I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard, making-of featurette, about fifteen minutes long. Even though I\u00f1\u00e1rritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it, there is good behind-the-scenes footage, including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes, totaling about fifteen minutes, which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack, which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rock-rap tracks."

        "review_detailed_main": "Of course I watched Pulp Fiction and when I first saw this movie, it was on TV on local station. Later bought DVD, and watched movie a couple of times and realized, in some way, that this film is even better than Pulp Fiction. It's more human than any US multi-plot-anachrono-psycho-thriller film that I ever watched. Acting is very intense, young Bernal and old Emilio especially, and the cohesion of the different-class stories is excellent. Also I must say that the tempo of a movie and soundtracks of the song are doing just in a right way. Comparing \"Crush\" to this masterpiece is like comparing Coldplay to Radiohead in rock music. Although I never saw a Mexican film before (only their moronic love-story series), I felt like I was right there in Mexico city, while watching. Brutal scenes for the first time in my life, make film more realistic, instead of making distance from the real life. Everybody is so edgy in this movie, but in a natural way. Great atmosphere, great film indeed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Becoming one of the most well-regarded and unique filmmakers of the modern era, Mexican born director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu started his career off in exemplary fashion with his Oscar nominated and critically praised multi-narrative drama Amores Perros, a hard-hitting experience that was a sign of things to come for the future Oscar winner.\n\nSpanning three separate stories, all interconnected through an horrific car crash and a shared bond with a four legged friend, Amores Perros is both an unflinching look at love and life in Mexico, as our various flawed individuals (all of whom aren't likable as such but remain humanistic in their behaviors and decision making) find their lives unraveling around them to various degrees.\n\nOur first introduction to this world is through Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal's Octavia and his pursuit of Vanessa Bauche's Susana, a pursuit that leads him into the dangerous and horrific world of dog fighting, as we are then welcomed into the world of Goya Toledo's supermodel Valeria and then Emilio Echevarr\u00eda vagrant El Chivo, a man more at home with dogs than his own kind.\n\nThere's barely an ounce of respite from the unending relentlessness of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's examinations of the harsh realities of love and life in the troubled country of his birth, championed by Guillermo Arriaga's rugged script (a partnership that would spawn 21 Grams and Babel also) and D.O.P Rodrigo Prieto's documentary like filming style, giving Amores Perros a rough and raw veneer but also one that has been clearly designed for the purpose at hand.\n\nNot many films before or since I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's exercise in consistent bombardment of life's troubles have managed to capture the frenetic nature of every day life and every day struggles, particularly south of the border, with the films first 60 minutes in particular hugely impressive, even more so when you consider this was the directors first feature film effort.\n\nFilled with abundant energy and intrigue around Octavia and Susana's potentially elopement, Amores Perros never truly reaches its early heights again as Valeria's story strand in particular suffers from a sense of over indulgence and El Chivo's more over the top story strand taking some time to get use to.\n\nThere's no doubt there's elements of each stories importance and emotional resonance but it's a shame Amores Perros couldn't maintain the early pace it sets, a facet I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was able to iron out with his future efforts, most notably in Birdman and The Revenant, films that managed to combine all the best elements of the director in one cohesive package.\n\nFinal Say -\n\nA tough watch that set the tone for Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's impressive and still growing in stature career, Amores Perros is rough around the edges and suffers from some middling moments in its middle and latter sections but when it punches, it punches hard.\n\n4 chocolate treats out 5"

        "review_detailed_main": "The first ninety minutes of so of Amores Perros is magnificent. It would maybe even qualify as one of the greatest films of all time. Gael Garcia Bernal is incredible, perhaps his best role, and the cinematography complements the plot perfectly, full of dark and dirty shots. The dog fighting is intense and particularly well shot. The characters are real, the acting is believable and nuanced, the plot goes at a fast pace and I was gripped.\n\nThen the film changes course completely, to a film about a model and her unfaithful boyfriend who get caught up in the car crash. And the film dies right there. It becomes boring, stilted, uninteresting, and I found myself drifting away several times. The characters didn't intrigue me, the storyline was weak, and even when they brought the old man with the dogs and the beard into play it wasn't enough to save it. Watching the model cry 'Richie' over and over again while her dog was stuck under the floorboards bored the tears out of me, and it's a subplot and dialogue line that went on for nearly half an hour.\n\nThey had something really special here and ruined it. This should have been edited down and the latter plot lines should have become minor distractions if they were included at all. It's such a waste of the groundwork laid early on; a masterpiece turned into an average film. I only watched on in the hope I'd see the conclusion to the initial plot. Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Motorcycle Diaries and La Mala Educacian are all better than this as far as the classic Gael Garcia Bernal films go."

The movie is awesome, Amores Perros puts the viewer right in the movie, if you get into it and are not distracted it almost feels like your in the place watching these dog fights! It is a realistic look at the lives of 3 people who all have in common a love for dogs. Even though one of the characters (Octavio) puts his dog through vicious dog fights the man still loves his dog. The director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does a great job of putting you the viewer right in the heart of Mexico. The opening scene sets it off and right from the get go the movie gets your attention, slows down a bit in the middle but gets going again towards the end. If your a fan of movies that almost seem like the story is really happening then buy this flick, don't rent it go to best buy or wherever and pick up this movie it is a classic for sure! If you like Inarritu's film 21 grams as i did, then your guaranteed to like this one as long as you don't mind reading subtitles."

        "review_detailed_main": "Director Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu heralded the Mexican New Wave cinema with Amores Perros.\n\nBetween 2010 to 2020. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Guillermo del Toro have won 5 Best Director Oscars between them.\n\nAmores Perros in some ways has a beginning reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs. It has a dog bleeding profusely in the back of a car instead of Mr Orange who has just been shot.\n\nThe rest of the film has a jumbled narrative. A bit like Pulp Fiction. However that is where the similarities end.\n\nA car crash in the streets of Mexico links three set of stories.\n\nThe first story is about Octavio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) who lusts after his sister in law Susana. She is married to his older brother Ramiro who brutalises her. Already pregnant with a second child. Octavio enters the world of dog fights to earn enough money to run away with her.\n\nLuckily the dog he has is a beast who beats all comers. However a rival hoodlum does not like Octavio, his older brother and the dog. That is the catalyst which leads to the car chase and the eventual crash.\n\nThe second story concerns rising model Valeria. She has just moved into a luxury apartment with her older married lover. Disaster strikes as she is badly injured in a car crash. When she arrives home with a severely injured leg. Her dog disappears under the floorboards.\n\nThe third story concerns El Chivo. He is in the periphery of society and has a tangential role in the first two parts of the story.\n\nHe is a tramp who roams the streets with his cart and a pack of dogs. He rushes to aid Octavia in the aftermath of the car accident.\n\nIt also turns out that El Chivo was once a well respected academic. A family man who became a revolutionary and was then jailed. After leaving prison, he became a hitman but now sees things differently when he reads news that his ex wife has died.\n\nThis is a full throated movie. It is a visceral study of the working class and the underclass of Mexico.\n\nThe dog fighting scenes although short can be off putting for some. Octavio is one of the nicer people in the movie. Ramiro is not only rough with his wife. Despite working in a supermarket he is also a violent robber.\n\nAlthough Valeria represents the aspirational celebrity strata. Her story is an allegory.\n\nThe dog being lost underneath the floorboards that is crawling with rats shows how easy it is to slide down. Valeria loses modelling work and her lover wants to get back with his wife. Being with an injured scarred model was not the life he was hoping for.\n\nThe more intriguing story was that of El Chivo and his transformation. His realisation that he should had been there for his family.\n\nDespite the harshness of life there is a moral undertone to Amores Perros. It is a confident gritty full feature debut by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. The film could had done with being tighter especially with the middle story.\n\nThe interlinked narrative was used again by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in Babel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Will someone please tell me what all the fuss is about? If the presence of gore is the gauge of cinematic skill, then yes, AMORES PERROS is a masterpiece. But surely one first-time director's fascination with maimed dogs and Mexicanismo does not a 21st-century film template make. Granted, it's a somewhat cleverly crafted story, but this blood-guts-passion trip through Mexico City fails to make any real point or leave the audience with much to ponder. (Though I did find myself contemplating how they managed to locate all those dead-dog body doubles for the live dogs...)\n\nAMORES PERROS, which the film translates as \"Love is a Bitch,\" might be better rendered \"Love is Like a Dog,\" or \"Some of These People Actually LOVE Dogs,\" or \"If You Love Your Dog, Don't See This Movie.\" It opens with a truly gruesome car crash in which blood and guts swirl around liberally. If you happen to walk in late, never fear: the scene will replay twice more. With this event as the anchor, the film flashes back and forward on the lives directly and tangentially involved--what led up to this bloody wreck and how it affects all concerned.\n\nDriving the offending vehicle is Octavio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), brother of the abusive Ramiro (Marco P\u00e9rez) and lover-in-waiting of his wife, Susana (Vanessa Bauche). Octavio's role is basically to hang around the house panting at his sister-in-law, until he decides to make money by entering Ramiro's vicious mastiff in dog fights. The car he's slammed into conveys supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), whose successful career ends on impact. She is mistress to Daniel (\u00c1lvaro Guerrero), who's gone middle-age crazy and separated from his wife to live with Valeria 24/7. The supermodel's true love, however, is her moplike Lhasa apso, Richie.\n\nThe triptych's third panel focuses on El Chivo (Emilio Echevarr\u00eda), a former revolutionary. Imprisoned while his daughter was born, he has never met her, though he's remained obsessed with images of her for more than 20 years. He moons over her while alternately practicing his assassination skills and living with his own pack of canines.\n\nAMORES PERROS is the debut film of director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez In\u00e1rritu, a Mexican DJ who's apparently seen PULP FICTION a few times. While it doesn't slavishly imitate Tarantino, it noticeably cops a few of his moves. Like a bad case of coffee nerves, the film functions best at high velocity and on razor's edge. There's plenty of speeded-up action, trick cuts, and always the threat of imminent gore. With many scenes rife with tension, AMORES often strays into telenovela territory, though it's tough to tell if the melodrama is intentional.\n\nYet, strangely enough, after all this adrenaline puts us on red alert, we are thrust into an extremely tedious middle portion, in which Valeria's dog gets trapped beneath floorboards and the hapless couple can't reckon how to retrieve him. Richie whines night after night, Valeria whines night after night, fights ensue, she stages a minirevolt from her wheelchair--and we're left with a yawning, \"And your point is....\"\n\nIs love a bitch? Sure. Do people treat their loves like dogs? Sometimes. Is this a rich metaphor that bears 2 1/2 hours of graphically violent exploration? Not really. Does this represent, as raves the NEW YORK TIMES, \"the first classic of the new decade\"? I'd hate to think so."

It might be big & bold (LoA Goodfellas Jaws GWTW French-Connection King-Kong JFK Contact Dances-With-Wolves Fugitive TGTBATU Aliens T1-T2JD) artful (Red-Shoes B&C Last-Picture Red-Balloon This-Sporting-Life American-Graffiti Third-Man) or kooky as all get out (Gun-Crazy Mad-Max Fargo Strangelove Boogie-Nights Some-Like-It Bride Millers-Crossing Madeinusa). Their common trait, captivating, of course, but as some titles suggest, uniqueness, films like you've never seen before. That's Amores Perros: grande, negrito, art\u00edstico and tad loco. Director Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu & writer Guillermo Arriaga create a visceral Mexi-noir to open the d\u00e9but de si\u00e8cle, a movie that, at this writing, has not been topped. When a synopsis mentions mangled metal (cars), an assassin walking about and dog that destroys every canine in its path, you can expect violence to play a big part, and it does, yet, with stories so engrossing, the not-all-too-graphic brutality does something different than mere shock & loss. Most great films work humor into the script (\"Prowler needs a jump!\"), yet, AP makes no pretense, the closest it comes, the careening camera of Rodrigo Prieto (Barbie) with accompaniment of Gustavo Santaolalla (Babel) in follow of Ramiro (P\u00e9rez) and chum, El Jaibo (Obstab) during their surreal stick-up spree.\n\nThe Oscars & Globes played politics in 2001, tabbing wuxia class, Crouching-Tiger best foreign film, but BAFTA, Fantas, Belgian & Tokyo were dazzled and let the world know, each awarding Amores their highest prize. As poignant as it is powerful, just musing on a scene can make this critic cry. Watch this incredible movie and you'll learn why (4/4)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fans of this kind of jump-cut editing will no doubt compare Amores Perros to Pulp Fiction, and that is a fair assessment of this film. Set in a hot, dry climate pulsating with malevolence, Amores Perros features a similar array of simmering malcontents, wealth, poverty, violence and sex. Where it differs from Tarantino's film is in the strong emotional draw of the characters.\n\nGael Garc\u00eda Bernal performs wonderfully (as always) as the unlucky Octavio, and he gets a lot of the screen time in Amores Perros, but the real hero here is Emilio Echevarr\u00eda, who pulls off one of the most astonishing on-screen transformations in recent memory. His wordless performance alone is worth watching the 2 and a half hour film for.\n\nInterconnecting the three stories is the theme of dogs. All of the characters bestow a kind of love upon the animals which is not bestowed upon the humans. When they die, as most of them do, we are saddened beyond the brief shock of a human death or, as is the case, a terrible car crash. Dogs are the redeemers, too, of every story.\n\nThis is a long film, and slow moving. Whatever you might hear about it it is much less violent than most Hollywood films, which revel in casual slaughter. The car crash is horrific, and makes me want to drive at 5 miles per hour in a Volvo for the rest of my life, but generally this is not a violent movie.\n\nShot in beautiful, trembling, leached colour, it is an achingly beautiful film to watch. With the strong performances and literate screenplay it makes a very fine movie. Probably will become a classic in a few years. Oh, and it knocks the socks off Pulp Fiction..."

The first thing you will notice is how great the acting is, with the performer never intruding on the role, like is currently happening in Hollywood films."

The film maker is so honest in his film making. I think it takes a lot to give such a BRILLIANT cinema. This film tells three different story at the same time. Past, Present and Future is the judgment running in all the three tales.\n\nThe performances are very natural and awesome at the same time. Gael Garcia is the best amongst all. Vanessa Bauche is also good. The camera work and technical aspects will be remembered through this film always, As they give a noticing turn to Cinema History. This film is according to me the years best reviewed film.\n\nThis film MUST be kept in the film making museum (If Exists) so that different film makers learns different things and levels of film making. A film that is a Classic. And Classics are never RE CREATED. Be it 21 Grams OR Babel (Of course i've not seen BABEL yet)."

Alas, I must confess that while this movie might make some people gasp who have been on\n\nHollywood film-food for too many years, there is hardly anything that lifts this flick beyond what independent cinema has had on the menu for decades. Yes, the plot is all about human tragedies; yes, it incorporates first rate feelings such as love or loss; yes, it keeps you watching for more than 90 mins of your life BUT... What is the message? What new light does it cast on any aspect of our lives? While Amores Perros is certainly worth seeing, its impact vanishes within a day or two (unless you're some dogfight perv in which case you've definitely found your movie). Rather like some other latin american movies (I'm thinking of Y tu mama tambien, for example) this movie has great actors, great direction but lacks depth, meaning and relevance. All in all, Amores Perros is alright but so are hundreds of other movies. Don't get me wrong: IT IS A GOOD MOVIE but just don't expect a once-in-a-century-masterpiece (as hinted at in other people's comments on this page). Go see it if you've got the time or simply go bowling. Choose the latter if you want to lift your spirits."

        "review_detailed_main": "Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is one of my favourite directors working today. Birdman became one of my all-time favourite films and The Revenant is a masterclass in filmmaking so I decided to see his first feature film which didn't disappoint at the slightest.\n\nAmores Perros (a clever pun) follows three different stories, all involving dogs, that interconnect with one another by a car accident.\n\nFor a lot of people this film will be very challenging due to the violence and dogfighting scenes but once you go past that, you realise how brilliant this film is. First of all, the style of the film is beautiful. I don't like the use of handheld cam but I\u00f1\u00e1rritu uses it in a way that makes this film look wholly realistic. The cinematography is especially good as we witness Mexico City through three different social classes. It has a very dark and grim feeling to it and the accompaniment of gruesome dogfighting will make anyone want to turn it off\n\nIt's not the aesthetics that make this film glorious but rather its stories and interesting narrative. It's hard to make each story as compelling as the other but writer Guillermo Ariaga manages to include a lot of meaning into every one and link them in a very beautiful way. The film deals with a lot of themes and its use of dogs serve as a tool for fleshing out the characters in each story. This is one of those films that require multiple viewings in order to fully understand what I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Ariaga are trying to say. I think Amores Perros explores the human nature and shows us how humans can be selfish, disloyal and violent. The actors involved in each story give very good performances and are extremely believable in their roles.\n\nThis is a difficult film to sit through but I enjoyed the experience. It's astounding how this is I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's first film as there's so much skill involved. Amores Perros is something I would like to watch again and figure out the deeper meaning behind each story and its characters."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for \u00a38. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.\n\nWhen Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.\n\nThe movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you.\n\nAnother good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good."

The \"problem\" with Amores Perros (also with 21 Grams and Babel) is you just can't ignore it. Or, to put it better, you'd feel some kind of terminal guilt (appropriately\u0085) if you did. The three intertwining stories revolve ambitiously and high-poweredly around the theme of fatalism, on \"love's a bitch\" (more or less the title), on \"brother against brother\" religious motifs, on Kieslowski, Poe, a bit of Mexican-period Bunuel, and on a to-the-point requiem on Viva La Revolucion. In short however, this is a salute to the idea of \"God laughing when people make plans\". (To be honest, God laughs when people make movies about God). In any case, the only one laughing in Inarritu's humorless universe could be God, though I don't really see why He'd be so pleased in seeing his creatures miserable as hell (\u0085). Obviously this is a vengeful divine presence overlooking the production of Amores Perros, a production stately (while recalling Mr. Babenko's 1981 Pixote) and, occasionally, inspiringly unpleasant. Undoubtedly a masterpiece for those who get their ideological kicks in non-American speaking filmmaking, an intriguing torture for the rest."

        "review_detailed_main": "From the very first second of \"Amores Perros\", something happens. You get sucked into the movie and your eyes become aroused with the incredible direction. The movie is an awe-inspiring set of plots joined together in an amazing editing process that draws attention to every cinematic aspect possible in movie-making. This is a movie that I saw with very high expectations and ended up getting way more than I bargained for. From the stellar camera-work to the flawless cinematography, the movie is almost a friendly gesture in proper film-making.\n\nThe movie begins with a car chase. A kind of reminder of the movie Reservoir Dogs (especially with a dog in the back seat!), but quickly becomes something else. The swinging camera throws you back and forth and you actually feel as though you're about to lose control. A car chases from behind and then begins to shoot. You almost duck to avoid the bullets. The car gets closer and you press your foot against the ground hoping that the chased car will go faster. A bus comes out of nowhere and you hold your head hoping the car won't crash into it. It doesn't and it turns outrunning the chasing car, until finally the car crashes into another car. Inside the car we're introduced to Gael Garc\u00eda (Octavio), who's later shown as a money hungry young man who uses his strong dog to fight and kill other dogs for money. He protects and seduces his sister-in-law, attempting to allude her away from her crazy husband. The car in which Octavio crashes into is Valeria (Goya Toledo), a supermodel who breaks her legs during the accident and eventually becomes an amputee. She struggles between living as a cripple, her husband who's had a history of being a disloyal husband, and her dog stuck under her floor. A homeless person passes by as the accident happens on his way to kill a man for a good price. He sees the accident and rescues the dog in Octavio's car, shelters him and breeds him. These three stories are connected by one single crash (this may be why so many people hate Paul Haggis' version), and their life is a fitting perspective of the movie name (Life's a Bitch).\n\nThe dogs in the movie are a strong motif that celebrate life, and undertake a more tragic idea of fate. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu knows that this isn't a story with three different short stories. He quietly connects them with subtlety, all the while reminding us that they are a result of something completely different: the tragedy that is life. Alejandro portrays class struggle in a realistic way. He shows us that the dirt poor will do anything for money, the working class will be happy but will go that extra mile to please someone, and the high class will always be unhappy unless they keep getting more and more. In one beautiful scene, the homeless guy - El Chivo (Emilio Echevarr\u00eda) calls his daughter and tells her that life is unfair, that he didn't have money so he got arrested and couldn't face her until now. The message of the whole movie is so thought-provoking it almost makes you choke. The whole system of life is just one big circle and everyone is somehow struggling with the same problem.\n\nOctavio is the fifth wheel in the movie. He becomes the reason for Valeria's accident, and El Chivo's sudden decision to not kill the man and finally face his own daughter. Within reason, Octavio is the central character. And although we never really know what happens to him after the accident (aside that his brother dies and he once again gets turned down by his sister-in-law and leaves), we almost know that the result will not be good. The same is the result with Valeria's story: we see her husband struck with anger as he finds out she is now an amputee, but we don't know if he will leave her or not. Especially because his former wife is begging him to come home. The only story we feel any optimism for is El Chivo's. Ironically, he's always been the one who has the word 'unfair' stamped on his forehead.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" is as deep as it is cinematically beautiful. It shares a very interesting idea and thought about the world, and challenges us with eye-squinting visuals. Performances that leave your jaw dropped, and one hell of a thrill ride. One of the most suitable titles for a movie, it defines new cinema in a completely strict manner. Aside from that, it's a good thing there's a disclaimer saying \"no dogs were harmed\", otherwise it would have been hated by the critics."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is so good I feel compelled to comment.The only film I've ever seen that even vaguely reminds me of this is El Topo,a Spanish made film from the 70's. While I could feel a little of Clockwork Orange, the message of Amores Perros is more evolved and less tangential.Through 3 separate stories, the filmmakers of this well-acted and craftily produced challenge-to-our-senses convey the same unavoidable truth: no one escapes the price for their actions.\n\nIn grand allegory and shocking visual depictions, specifically of horrific and incredibly insensitive (to us) dog-fight settings, we are forced to accept this undeniable part of our existence. Each one of the characters undergoes severe inner and outer turmoil within the framework and context of their own life.\n\nThe lower economic class is pervasively plagued with stereotypes and dead-ends. The limitations of the ghetto become apparent in the predisposed perceptions and corresponding acting-out of roles we see. Young women are wantonly lusted after in this undeniably male-dominated society, yet the mothers of these same men are devalued to the point almost of non-humanity. Their own self-worth and lack of virtue is just as meaninglessly predicated. These men display absolutely no sense of loyalty or appreciation for anything but immediate gratification; even among brothers. Morality becomes secondary to the law of the street; easily replaced with a clear \"take what you can get\" system of belief.\n\nThe altering sociologic strata of the settings portrays a cross-cultural inevitability that everything catches up with us sooner or later. A successful businessman who leaves his wife and children for a beautiful woman finds he has stretched himself to the limit,and feels trapped by his own sense of responsibility. In another vignette a man who befriends dogs rather than humans rockets into reality upon the discovery of a quasi-victimless crime. With an inability to punish what he sees as the equivalent of brainwashing in dogs, he feels compelled to face the shame and the pain of confronting his own regretful past. An eternally optimistic young man who characteristically replaces hope with the facts, suffers incredible disillusionment through the impossibility of his dream.\n\nNot all suffering in this movie comes at the hands of one's own mistakes or misdeeds. Accidents and unfortunate twists-of-fate play themselves in award winning manner.\n\nThe violence and pain of this movie happen in the mind as much as on the screen. With such redeeming value as the movie has, you may be able to force yourself to watch for 3 hours.It's not easy to do.\n\nAs difficult as it is to witness the message of the film, the graphic illustrations are blatant and without apology. Perfectly fitted for the subject it addresses. No matter; it's not nearly as bad as what we experience in our own most dire moments. The film's horrors simply occur in concentratated form.\n\nI was left with a feeling that our time without struggle should be cherished. And as a result,I came away accepting the easily mouthed, yet painfully experienced, tenet that our darkest hours serve us by providing relativity to our lives."

In Mexico there are many ways to earn money for survival in some cases or for lucrative purposes in others. There fights among animals are arranged regularly. In Mexico the so-called Palenques are famous where the people go to see fights between cocks, but also fights of dogs are organized in places less formal than Palenques. In both fights the people bet, some small money but others high sums. The film goes around this issue of fights between dogs, where obviously you have always a persistent dog champion, highly susceptible to be killed by other means in order to take it away. But the film is in fact about the misery of the humans, no matter if they are poor or rich. Amores Perros is an exceptional film, and a sample of the quality of several new-era films in Latin America, which may compete easily in their plots and depth with other films made in Europe and USA."

All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with \"Bitch\" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis. I more or less preferred them in the order they played out, though even the first story has its flaws (am I really supposed to have much sympathy for a guy who participates in dog fights?)."

It knocks the breath out of you the way \"Mystic River\" does (maybe even more so). The plot centers on a car wreck in Mexico City and how it affects several people. The people are from every walk of life - there's a doctor and a homeless man - but they're all desperate, with a capital \"D\". And everything in their gut-wrenching lives all relates somehow to their dogs.\n\nThis is a very accomplished piece of cinema. Among other things, it introduced the world to Gael Garcia Bernal, who went on to play Che Guevara in \"The Motorcycle Diaries\". And director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went on to make the equally gut-wrenching \"21 Grams\" in the USA. Despite the unrest that has dominated Mexico, they have always turned out some good movies. Hollywood should take a cue from them."

        "review_detailed_main": "Although the film had a unique quality all of its own, both stylistically and structurally it felt like a cross between the 3 Colours trilogy and Pulp Fiction - and for me that was a positive thing, because both of these were great works of filmmaking, and the idea of 3 linked stories, if done well, can be far more satisfying and entertaining than a straightforward movie. In fact, I don't know why it isn't done more often. But 'Amores Perros' definitely transcended its sources, and the crucial role of the dogs as a mirror for the humans at a stroke gave this file an originality and depth to make it stand out. For me, two of the most moving scenes were when Richie is finally rescued from beneath the floorboards, and then when El Chivu comes home to discover what 'Blackie' has done to the rest of his dogs, which in retrospect, was probably the film's key moment. In fact, despite all the canine gore, I think that dog lovers (myself included) get more out of the film than those indifferent to them, as there's more emotional involvement.\n\nI also loved the contrasts of the different sections, from the frantic pace of the first story set in the lower end of Mexican society, to the more measured, 3-Colours style approach of the story of Daniel and Valeria, to the final segment which blended the two. I felt this approach worked perfectly, and unlike some of the comments here, I don't think any story went on too long - in fact, this was one of those films that was so good that (a bit like Traffic), I would have been happy for it to carry on another half hour. The characters were all utterly believable, and one of the joys of a film like this is gradually being shown how they all link together, even if they don't know each other, and understanding how one action leads to a whole chain of events which touches the lives of everyone. In fact, ultimately, 'Blackie' is responsible for everything that happens in this film!\n\nA real pleasure to watch - if you want a film that has your brain chewing over it for hours afterwards, go - and enjoy!"

        "review_detailed_main": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)\n\nThere are a lot of dogs in this movie. And there are some dog-fighting scenes that dog lovers may not want to see. Be forewared, a lot of dog blood is spilled.\n\nAnd why? Does director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has some kind of obsession with dogs? I don't know but according to something I read at IMDb there's a blurb at the beginning of the film stating that no animals were harmed in making the film. I played the DVD back, but I couldn't find the statement. I wonder. They sure looked harmed, and at any rate must have been sedated for some of the scenes. There is a short documentary called Los perros de'Amores perros (2000) that explains it all for those who are worrying about the dogs. Personally I'm not too worried because I very much doubt that Inarritu would make a film involving so many dogs and allow them to be hurt.\n\nAnyway, this is a violent movie with a lot of the violence happening to the dogs. It was Inarritu's first film, or at least his first big film. He has since made, most notably, 21 Grams (2003). As in 21 Grams, there are three stories here, connected only by chance and the dogs. The opening scene is a car chase in which, we later learn, the three stories collide. There was also an accident in 21 Grams that help to hold the stories together.\n\nHere we have (1) the story of Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is in love with his older brother's wife, Susana (Vanessa Bache); (2) the story of El Chivo (Emilio Chevarria), one-time guerilla fighter, now a hit man who dresses and behaves like a homeless person; and (3) the story of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who leaves his wife and children for a lanky runway model, Valeria (Goya Toledo). All three stories include dogs. Octavio's dog Cofi becomes a big winner at the dog fights and makes money for Octavio which he gives to Susana to save so that they can run away together. El Chivo lives with four dogs, and Valeria has a little dog Richie that somehow (I can't figure out how) gets stuck under the floor and put upon by rats after it chases a ball through a hole in the floor.\n\nPresumably this film shows us the violence that is endemic in Mexican society, perhaps inherited from the Aztecs and the Conquistadors, who were pretty bloody in their time. Or perhaps Inarritu knows that violence plays with the young American audiences that go to the theaters, and what he has is a nice commingling of purpose. One thing for sure, Inarritu knows how to make a film that engages the audience with not just violence but the clash of character and aspiration. A lot of the credit for the success of this film must go to the outstanding cast, in particular Emilio Chevarria and Gael Garcia Bernal.\n\nBest, most original scene: when El Chivo leaves the two men tied up with the gun equal distance between them, just out of reach.\n\nBottom line: not for the squeamish."

Most professional critics have been too simple-minded to compare this film to anything other than \"Pulp Fiction\", to which it has absolutely no thematic connection. I'm pleased to see that several reviewers on this page have noted the true influence at work here - the late, great director Krzysztof Kieslowski and his screenwriting partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz, to whose magnificent \"Dekalog\" and \"Trois Couleurs: Bleu, Blanc, Rouge\" \"Amores Perros\" is indebted. Which is an acknowledgement, not a criticism. \"Amores Perros\" tells a trio of interwoven tales questioning man, God, faith, family, and love through a stunning combination of expert direction, writing, editing, cinematography, scoring, sound, and acting, creating a truly classic work that needs no comparisons. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Guillermo Arriago have created a masterwork. Bravo!

        "review_detailed_main": "Beware: certainly not suited for animal lovers, because of lots of explicit cruel violence being commited upon dogs.\n\nI cant help but feeling that the spirit and the cohesion of this movie are lacking. The unknown actors are good, but not THAT good that they can carry a movie by themselves. These unknown actors are lacking charisma, and that flaw unfortunately cant be solved by telling 3 different stories either, which all evolve around 3 doglovers who will sacrifice and discard any human relationship, if they must choose between human love and the love they feel for their dogs. Bizarre and somewhat unrealistic story, yet executed in a very profound and vivacious way.\n\nInarritu is one of my all time favorite directors and Amores Perros (Love is a b**ch) is his debut, which unfortunately he didnt wrote himself. All his other famous and worldwide awarded classics (Babel, Biutiful, Birdman) he DID write himself. And the difference is noticeable in a bad way, because there are just too many (3) different storylines in Amores Perros, which lasts for a whopping 2 and a half hours and overstretches it's attention span in my opinion. I just got bored when suddenly the second storyline started and all the characters I had become familiar with, were abondoned. It is as if a whole new movie suddenly started, although there is a (thin) connection in the end which brings all 3 stories together.\n\nBUT, if you do like a caleidoscope of stories and if you do like bleak portraits of egoistical doglovers, then this could be a really worthwhile picture for you. The acting is good, the photography is very vivacious and in your face and the 3 different stories individually all stand their ground, although I would have been satisifed with just watching one story, instead of 3.\n\nMy advice would be to skip this movie and start watching director Inarritu other terrific classics, which he al wrote, produced and directed himself: \"Birdman\", \"Biutiful\" and \"Babel\". All these 3 movies have become instant modern classics and are from this very same director who just didnt get it quite right yet with his debut called Amores Perros. But director Inarritu does excell in all his other pictures! Remember that name: director Inarritu..."

The rest of my time with Amores Perros was spent wondering why none of these people have caller ID, wondering whether this movie set some kind of record for most fake dead dogs in a film, wondering who El Chivo reminded me of (Il Duce from Boondock Saints), wondering why they just didn't cover the darn hole (who leaves gaping holes in the middle of their apartment floor?), and trying to think up a name for the dog (never came up with anything I liked more than Lost Dog). Mostly, I was just bored. \n\nI've read other people describe this as a powerful movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much for me.

If there is a \"winner,\" it is El Chivo, as he physically fares the best of the lot of the other characters, however his game is a null sum--there is still no happy ending for him.\n\nThe theme of the film is what separates it from it's Hollywood counterparts where the protagonist(s) always win. Individually, three stories vary greatly in quality: the first (Octavio y Susana) is fast and frenetic with excellent camera shots and editing. The second (Daniel y Valeria) is much slower and is too long for its own good--however it does develop the theme of karmic payback quite well. The third (El Chivo y Maru) is arguably the best, in large part due to the acting of El Chivo and how it ties up all the other stories.\n\nThis film is a breath of fresh air for Mexican cinema, especially in light of some of the dreck I've seen recently (Santitos and La Otra Conquista come to mind). Film has changed...we can't expect Mexico to produce Pedro Infante and Maria Felix-style movies anymore. Self-important \"artistic\" work ain't gonna cut it either. \"Amores Perros\" is a fine step in the right direction and one of the best films of the year."

Apparently, this is the movie that started it all for Inarritu. At first I didn't like it. My back pressed against my chair with anxiety, the movie and its characters made me uneasy. I was ridden with the sense that something bad was going to happen and I hated it. Then I realized, ah...yes, this is what he wants. It's the same feeling I had watching the other two movies (which I unfortunately watched first). Slow deliberate suspense and apprehension. Not from action or mystery, but from plain human emotions. The second story was boring and in the end nothing really happens so I was nervous for nothing. How long was the dog in the floor for? I lost track of time.\n\nAt one point I had to let go and succumb to the emotion he wanted me to feel. I cried. That was when I began to understand it.

In the world of \"Amores Perros,\" it's eat or be eaten, a message that maybe lends itself well to gritty, grungy stylistics but isn't much of a hook on which to hang a compelling narrative.\n\nHowever, this movie scores in the way it tells its story, cutting back and forth between three narratives that build on one another in surprising ways. It's the same approach Inarritu uses in his first English-language film, \"21 Grams,\" and it's actually used to better effect there, but it works here as well. His narratives are tangled webs rather than straight paths from point A to point B, and its a storytelling device that seems appropriate for the Internet age and the complicated ways in which we now process information. However, Inarritu should be cautious, as this approach used solely for its own sake can seem gimmicky, and it will lose its novel appeal if he uses it for every movie he makes.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but I think Inarritu is a young filmmaker to watch. \"21 Grams\" is more satisfying, and there's a pervading feeling of redemption to take away from that movie rather than the gloomy sense of doom \"Amores Perros\" offers, evidence that Inarritu is moving in the right direction.\n\nGrade: B-"

The actors are quite good, the film is shot well but it drags, especially in the middle portion of the film which is unfortunate as the characters from the middle story are the most likable.\n\nThe violent backdrop of dogfighting is extremely hard to watch for dog and animal lovers, some of the scenes are just too close to the bone. In my opinion I think that it departed from drama and art and crossed the line into senseless and horrific violence.\n\nThe actual mixing of the stories was very jarred which seemed to weaken the film and there seemed to be too many plot points unresolved by the end of the film.\n\nI scored the film 5 out of 10, due to it's problems with pacing, plot and un-likable characters. I wouldn't recommend this film to any animal lovers but those who liked the film 'Crash' might enjoy it."

The script is smart. No easy answers here. As many have noted, vicious dog fights play a big role, but there's no preaching about the sport. It just is. And we see, inevitably, that the handlers are no less animals themselves. It's the dogs' world."

The dogs are allegories, of course, for all that is wrong with the world (and Mexico in particular) but this is a multi-layered, beautifully acted, jerkily (and grittily) shot film by a director who knows exactly what he wants to say and how to say it. Some images are startling (blood flows like spitting butter over a griddle in a restaurant shooting) and heart-rending (an unrecognised old man waves uncertainly to his long-lost daughter through her bedroom window after years of no contact). But there is also humour and love amid the constant betrayals and carnage. And, also, there are the dogs."

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in which we follow three stories about three separate people, joined together by a car crash and the significance of dogs in their lives and their respective stories.\n\nNot quite as experimental technique-wise as I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's later films, but still very well shot and the actors give really good performances.\n\nThe three stories are told roughly in order. Every main character is focused in turn, although the film cuts away every now and then to follow the other two as well. This makes the film feel a bit chopped. Towards the end, when you've gotten to know all the characters, it matters less. Even still, I think it's a bit weird how the second story happens mostly after the events of the stories told around it. The third catches up near the end, but only at the very end. I'm not sure whether I would have liked the film with less cuts to other stories, or with more.\n\nIf I had to pick a favourite story, it'd be the third one. It follows an old hobo, who also happen to be a hitman. Weird character in many ways, but that's what makes him interesting. The first story, about a young man who gets pulled into dog fighting to support his brother's wife, is not bad at all either. The second story, about a fashion model who breaks her leg, is fine on its own, but pales in comparison to the other two.\n\nThe stories are all rather grim. They're about cheating, dishonesty and the lack of loyalty towards those closest to us. Dogs are in the film as an example of what us humans definitely are not.\n\nAnd as a sidenote, keep away from this film if you're a dog lover. The imagery is both brutal and graphic.\n\nNot sure what to think about the characters. They all have their numerous bad sides. There are no good people in this film, at least not on the foreground. Even still, the main characters earn our sympathy. They do horrible, reprehensible things, but it's hard to hate them. Points for great storytelling, if nothing else.\n\nIf you liked, for example, The Revenant, you'll probably like this one as well. It's not quite as good, but it feels very similar. But, I must emphasize this. Do not watch this movie if you cannot stand dogs being hurt."

Since then, not many more Mexican films gained much international or even national success. I hope \"Amores Perros\" reverses that. Most of the important points about the film have already been made. I will just add it is a very realistic portrayal of life in urban Mexico, especially the constant friction between social classes and the sexes that is so tangible on the streets. Also the incredible strains on family life in an environment where everyone is trying to get ahead is also apparent.\n\nI saw the film twice, once in the cinema and once at home on cassette. The version I saw at home was subtitled very loosely, I think you have to know Mexican idioms very well to get some of the meanings in the conversations. Many Mexican slang words have a double or even triple meaning, even the title \"Amores Perros\" is impossible to translate. So maybe some people miss parts of the story or subtexts because of that."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Amores perros\" is not a bad film by any means. There were moments where I was genuinely interested in the plot and its message, and direction wise there was a good number of times where the director's and actor's abilities shined brightly. But there were also flaws that stuck out too strongly for me to strongly recommend this film.\n\nOne of the first things that came to mind was that I have seen and heard the message and format of this film over and over again, in numerous pictures. I think those who compared it to Pulp Fiction, in terms of structure, are correct in pointing this out. But when one is concerned about seeing the same thing done again, usually, this means to me that the originality level on certain levels leaves something to be desired. Film makers \"borrow\" ideas all of the time, from other film makers it is more of what the \"newblood\" add to the mold created by past directors/writers, etc. that allows those who have seen the older films to enjoy the efforts of younger directors. This the director of \"Amorres perros'\" first film, so I think the potential is there.\n\nThis relates to one of the other problems that I had, which was the length. Sometimes it is necessary or enjoyable to watch the in between scenes, when there is some level of suspense, etc. that builds. But when it is used, in what seems to be more of a...\"look how cool this shot is\" it comes off as a bit pretentious at times. This was the notion I got occasionally...when the music levels were raised and the camera followed a character. At over 3hrs running time, Mr. Gonzalez could have been a bit more merciful towards the audience, especially when over 30 minutes seemed devoted to this in between scenes. The first and last stories were the strongest but by that point I was waiting for the picture to end.\n\nOther issues I had were flaws with the plot. There were characters who we were completely left in the dark about (the man shot in the restaurant early on...was that a hired hit or just he eliminating the step-father?). Other characters who we were somehow supposed to care about (the dogfighting owner's brother) just didn't fly. The logic of leaving the dog under the floorboards for days!? There just wasn't enough background of how some characters came to be who they were. We were just thrown into their tragic events and strong emotions which came out of them, and supposed to understand everything. What I mean by that is that there are many REASONS, other than one tragic accident as an adult that causes one to break down. Maybe this is too strong of a demand, but I believe the director could have done a better job of developing them.\n\nThere were some very strong performances, some scenes were excellent and the connection to how other animals behave is on point. I just think that there were still too many problems to really enjoy the film, and I was disappointed because many believe this to be better than \"Crouching Tiger,\" which I did not think it was. I suspect, though, that the director's next film will be an improvement...there is too much potential."

The editing in this film is incredible, balancing all of the characters and events into a fast-flowing and fast-changing plot that shows us the lives of Mexico and how they all fall apart. Love and loyalty, symbolised by the poor dogs in the film, propel but also ensnare the characters. Overall, this is a unique film with a variety of perspectives."

But the second time I felt freer just to watch all that was unfolding in the lives of the characters and I loved it. Being a sucker for redemption, I liked seeing the changes that occurred in the life of El Chivo, and also that it was far from being a trite overnight transformation; he was still on a journey...

Story 2: DANIEL (\u00c1lvaro Guerrero) leaves his structured family for his new love, the famous actress VAL\u00c9RIA (Goya Toledo) where everything goes well until the accident that unites the three stories) story 3: EL CHIVO (Em\u00edlio Echevarr\u00eda) a beggar who in principle went crazy after 20 years in prison without seeing his daughter grow up and commits murders for money, caretaker of several dogs had the \"offer\" to kill the partner of a mastermind GUSTAVO (Rodrigo Murray) a coward who wanted his partner and half brother dead. I\u00d1ARRITU begins in a frantic way with a foreshadowing of the accident that will interconnect the three stories, all of them with very deep characters, very well acted with a lot of feeling as I see in all Mexican cinema. We have story 2 (less convincing due to the pet disappearing for almost a week under the floor of the new couple's new house, even so we have the drama and transformation from their love to aggression due to routine problems. It's worth putting a continuity gap here where it is The shot of the night establishment in the rain is shown and then they arrive home during the day in the sun. But everything is compensated with story 3 where at the same time we want to know about the kidnapping and death, we want to know if he will find his daughter and we are left wondering what happened to OCTAVIO and SUZANA from the other story, where the beggar becomes rich and puts the mastermind's cowardly fear in check in front of his victim, where the beggar who had and cared for several dogs ends up with only the bravest one, where the man who was a ghost for more than two decades manages to free himself and start living... a film that launched I\u00d1ARRITU's career, splendid direction, handheld camera, putting us very close to the feelings of the characters.

It successfully interweaves several stories (as has become quite common in the past decade, e.g., Dahl, Tarantino, Tykwer, McKellar, Egoyan) as it tells a story of desperation and struggle in Mexico City. Combining the adrenaline rush of Pulp Fiction with the camera angles and slower views of street scenes that reminded me of Kieslowski, the director gives us a tale of how a single event can dramatically transform one's life (the loss of a leg for a fashion model, the loss of his beloved pets for a worned man in poverty). Whereas the dogs early in the film symbolize what is wrong with the characters, the dogs later catalyze or at least symbolize many of the emotional transformations for the characters and it might even be able to said that the animals inspire the adults to embrace a more responsible attitude towards others, reminding me of the role of children on selfish adults in many recent Iranian films. The acting of Amores Perros shouldn't be ignored (and may be overlooked as the acting was so effective that the actors seemed like they WERE their characters so to speak...the greatest compliment for actors). Bernal, for one, was simply outstanding. I often judge acting on the range of emotions conveyed. Bernal did it all. This gifted director is one to watch for in the future."

        "review_detailed_main": "Dogs, known to many as \"man's best friend\" are loved across the world and act as another household member for many people. Another expression that is often used is \"You're no better than an animal\", which is one of the crucial metaphors of Amores Perros. The main question Amores Perros asks is \"are we any better than animals?\" A lot of people think Amores Perros is a film to automatically despise because they suspect animal cruelty (though no animals were harmed) and the film's graphic portrayal of animal cruelty is both excruciatingly realistic and fearfully being an allegory for human violence.\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Inarritu proves to be one of the most outstanding modern directors in the business. From the deserved critical-acclaim and general success of Amores Perros he's managed to hit main-stream audiences with the excellent 21 Grams. Though it remains no match for the almighty bravo-film-making that is Amores Perros\u0085 The film centres on dogs and creates three stories leading up and showing the consequences of a horrific car crash. The film observes and studies people dealing with love, guilt, sorrow, betrayal, anguish, vengeance, poverty, violence and regret. The contrasts between the rich and poor, the parallels between dogs and humans and the general cruelty humans put open one-an-other to gain something they can't grasp. Ultimately the film is a study of the many affects of love and what causes a hatred or violence to develop.\n\nThe film captures the urban jungle perfectly and visually looks very dark, yet edged with tinges of yellowy light echoing character's facial emotions. Each story holds it's only meaning and own visual style. All three stories work in different ways and varied levels because it helps open up to different character's worlds yet with the added similarities that they're all fighting for love. It's a thrill-ride that does remains reminiscent of very few films baring its raw originality of hardcore, relationship driven drama.\n\nThe film's gritty style does not except any substitutes as it viscously attacks the viewer with a sharp presence. The almost unflinching camera technique capturing the cruelly embedded imagery fiercely exposing the character's harsh and yet somewhat understandable emotions. You can tell than Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu loves his characters, even in their most despicable moments and the script authentically captures the humane realism needed for the neo-realistic staging. The sense of finding cinematic art in suffering can be held by the viewer, the film's content can always be accepted for the context it needs to be shown with. The film's harsh nature is even there in the title Amores Perros, literally translating to \"Love's A Bitch\". The film also has some biblical subtext, the fact that the film shows a life fuelled by wrong-doings meets nasty ends.\n\nIf anybody was to dislike Amores Perros is would be either because they can't handle some of the horrific animal-related imagery or they don't like the film's narrative structure. The film is technically inspiring and the relentless fast-paced filming will not stop from the action-packed opening. The film's acting remains powerful, passionate and the painfully tremendous emotions being flung from every corner of the vivid spectre. Young prodigy Gael Garcia Bernal gives a defining and genuine performance of a tortured soul that had lost innocence in the culture he has been forced into. The heavy Mexican music pumps up the heat in many scenes helping to create the strong sequences of fast and stylistic editing.\n\nOne of the greatest films to come out of Latin American cinema, a must-see for any film fan. A brilliant film."

It tries to harrow us with sheer length (two and a half hours is a long time under the circumstances), and in this it succeeds: after the truly horrible bit (in part three - you know the scene I'm referring to), I found myself taking an interest in the story at last, perhaps from a lack of anything better to do. But it's too little, too late. The three stories have nothing to do with one another (they coincide spatially at one point - big deal), and they're simply laid before us, without art, like three uncut, rotting slabs of reality TV. If this film were a physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying, \"Move along, nothing to see here.\" And they'd be right."

By contrast most other films of the last few years seem bland and antiseptic. The film places the viewer right in the heart of urban Mexico, and amidst this teeming environment the characters' lives play out - full of immanent (and often eruptive) violence and feeling. The film has one of those episodic structures familiar from \"Traffic\", \"Short Cuts\" and \"Magnolia\". Yet it is a superior work to all of these films, not only because it feels less contrived, but also because it is blessedly free of the kind of characters who spend far too long hand-wringing and feeling sorry for themselves. Refreshingly, \"Amores Perros\" is not concerned to dissect \"dysfunctional\" people or \"dysfunctional\" social systems. It pulls off that rare trick of seeming to issue from right inside the worlds it portrays, rather than standing apart from them. This may well be an illusion, but that of course is what makes the achievement of \"Amores Perros\" all the more impressive. (It is also one of the only films I have ever seen that uses animals to signify in a way that is neither sentimental nor monstrous.) 10/10"

But I believe, as the saying said \"Who doesn't risk, doesn't win\" that its for sure a difficult business, but it isn't impossible. Actually, the more you risk, with this I mean a equal balance between what you feel and what you think, the more you get. Amores Perros did this step, they risk for something never done in Mexican Film History, and they did it right, I'm not saying that it wasn't done before, It was in movies like Los Olvidados of Bu\u00f1uel or Y Tu Mama Tambi\u00e9n of Cuar\u00f3n afterward. It's a walkabout in a dark pad, but when you see the light you get to see a beautiful movies as it is Amores Perros, you get inspiration for uncommon project and thoughts.\n\nJach"

        "review_detailed_main": "Amores Perros is called by some \"the Mexican Pulp Fiction\" because of its plot structure. That's actually all they have in common: Tarantino's masterpiece is a terrific film, but, as the title suggests, a little hyperbolic in its depiction of street life; Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu's debut, on the other hand, deals with real people, and in a painful way.\n\nThe title literally translates as \"dear dogs\". A bit ironic, since most dogs in this film are damaged on some level. Not that their owners are having a good time, either: the protagonists are linked by a car accident, around which I\u00f1arritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga construct three separate stories.\n\nThe first episode features a raw, astounding Gael Garcia Bernal as Octavio, a young man in love with his sister-in-law. He's trying to leave Mexico City with her, but has no money, hence his decision to enter his dog in a combat, shown at the beginning of the film in one of the most gruesome scenes ever shot by any director. The combat goes badly, and he runs away, only to cause the collision the whole story revolves around.\n\nAnother segment focuses on Daniel and Valeria, a couple trying to find a new spark in their relationship. Pity she's lost a leg in the aforementioned car accident. In addition, their dog has fallen through a hole in the floor, causing a lot of despair in the already sad Valeria.\n\nThe last part is about El Chivo (the superb Emilio Echevarria), a tramp who takes care of stray dogs, especially those who have been mistreated, and witnesses the accident. Having saved Octavio's dog from the car wreck, he considers doing one last job (he used to be a hit-man, you see) before eventually seeking redemption.\n\nAs debuts go, I\u00f1arritu's is quite impressive, given how well he controls the interconnected stories and characters and keeps the same pace throughout the picture. Amores Perros showed he was a name to keep in mind among South American filmmakers, something he confirmed with the beautiful, harrowing 21 Grams. Watch the two movies on a double bill and you'll be rewarded by some of the most powerful cinema of recent times."

The three main stories are jointed and disjointed as in Pulp Fiction (although not so twisted and not so stylish), and the prevailing topic is disloyalty of people vs. loyalty of animals - shown through dogs (whose depiction is apparently too painful for Westerners) - followed by greed and jaundice.\n\nThe stories are not of equal intensity, I found No 1 the most catchy, followed by No 3 and No 2, but No 3 demonstrates the best acting and profundity typical to Spanish / Latin-American films (Emilio Echevarr\u00eda as El Chivo, above all). Well, all male leading actors are distinguishable, while female ones spent much less time on screen and had to play less elaborated characters. Anyway, directing and cinematography are good, and events seem realistic, not specifically created. But as for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's trilogy of death, I have to admit that I find the other - 21 Grams and Babel - stronger and more interesting. But, without doubt, Amores perros is a strong film worth watching, and pondering on and over."

I'm glad that my view of the world is neither so black nor so bleak. The acting is capable. The production is effective (if gloomy.) The juxtaposition of three stories around one car crash is an interesting (if unoriginal) concept. But the script is a morbid repudiation of the human race. There are more likeable characters in a Wagner opera. It probably is a good topic for discussion at film appreciation classes. But it is too dark, too morbid and too cynical to qualify as a great work."

        "review_detailed_main": "Be warned: dog lovers of the world should avoid this movie simply because most of the graphic violence in this film is visited upon those animals. Sure, it's only a movie, but it looks so real...\n\nHaving seen 21Grams (2003) and read the reviews of Babel (2006) \u0096 I hope to see the latter soon \u0096 there's no doubt that this writer/director (Inarritu) follows a set formula when constructing his works. That's no criticism \u0096 simply a fact: if there is an overarching theme in his movies it's that of chaos; or, perhaps chance is a better word.\n\nWe all know that the world \u0096 our own individual world \u0096 is governed, in part, by random elements: what if I'd arrived two minutes earlier...?; what if I'd turned left, not right, that day...?; what would have happened if I'd said yes, instead of no...? There are so many instances of how lives change, for better or worse, when we make choices, as we must.\n\nLife's a bitch, no? Well, almost. So, yes, often bad things do happen to good and bad alike, but sometimes, things do work out for the best, even for the worst of us. It's that sort of scenario that Inarritu explores as he intertwines the lives of three sets of people over a period of a few months \u0096 a used-to-be revolutionary who's down on his luck, down in the dumps, and down on humans; a couple of brothers trying to scratch a living in the poorest sections of the city \u0096 one's a store checkout dude masquerading as a bank robber, the other's trying to make a zillion pesos by dog-fighting \u0096 the human ones and the real nasty bull terriers; and last, there's the husband with the seven-year itch who's after the super-life with a super-model who has super-sex appeal.\n\nAs the viewer, we enter these slices of high and low life with the bone crunching (literally) collision at a city street intersection. What a doozie! However, like 21 Grams (and no doubt, Babel) we've dropped in half way through the narrative, so once again we have to sort out what's in the past, what's in the future and what's happening now... Now, of course, Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) was doing disjointed narratives long before Inarritu arrived on the scene \u0096 like, 1992 -- but the latter director is, I think, even more demanding for the viewer. However, Amores Perros is less of a chore than 21 Grams.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however: this is well-crafted cinematography, worthy of the Oscar nominations it received. It's visceral, it's vibrant, it's vicious, it's vaaanderful, darhling \u0096 everything that drama and action fans want to see. I liked it \u0096 particularly the irony of Chivo's (Emilio Echevarria) rescue of the Rottweiler fighting dog from certain death; and, if you are familiar with The Conversation (1974), then you'll just love the scenes of the husband with the seven-year itch (Alvaro Guerrero) tearing up the wooden floor of the apartment he'd just bought for his super-model lover \u0096 but he's not looking for electronic bugs; just for a while, it's real creepy stuff...\n\nBut, life goes on, and when the final scene fades, you can easily visualize how each of the characters \u0096 those who are still alive \u0096 will carry on: everything changes but nothing changes, fundamentally. If you've seen Crash (2004), if you like Tarantino, if 21 Grams (2003) entertained you, then you should see this film. But, like I said \u0096 if you love dogs, you might want to reconsider..."

A master's hand is felt in all details, in a way the plot is going on, in the director's choice of colors, in all.. The movie is not very original as it has some allusions with Kitano's Dolls (especially the second novel about a model), with Tarantino's Pulp fiction (in the way the novels are connected with each other - this time mosaic, heroes not familiar with each other but influence on each other's lives - many reminders).

But after hearing so many glowing recommendations, I finally got around to renting it on DVD.\n\nSet in Mexico and focusing on three separate yet interwoven stories, the film uses a terrible car crash as a jumping off point.\n\nIn the first segment a young man, Octavio, (played by the superb Gael Garcia) is in love with his abusive brother's wife. He wants to raise enough money for them to run away together so he uses his beloved dog 'Cofi' and gets involved in the violent world of dog fighting. The second act tells the tale of a supermodel whose lover leaves his wife and daughters to set up home with her. She is devoted to her terrior 'Richie' and is devastated when he disappears through a hole in the floor and doesn't return. Throughout both of these segments we catch glimpses of a transient, scruffy character who is perpetually surrounded by a pack of adoring dogs, and we finally learn his story in the third and final act.\n\nAt three hours, the structure of the film is impressive, especially as it begins at a frenetic pace and then slows down somewhat - but it leads us to a satisfying conclusion. The soundtrack in particular is brilliant, as is the acting, writing, photography and design.\n\n'Amores Perros' is as the title states, a film about love, and all types of love. Blind love, foolish love, familial love, co-dependant love, unrequited love, parental love, thwarted love, sexual love - it's all there and played out through the love the principal characters have for their pet dogs. In one way the film examines the human 'animal instinct', the human capacity for violence and our deep seated need for survival. It is a huge, sprawling piece which is exhilarating, visceral, violent, heartbreaking, funny, passionate, vibrant and urgent.\n\nFilms like this don't come along very often. You really should see it."

It has all the qualities of an independent film with the polished quality of a mainstream film that had a considerable budget to work with. The acting was good (7.5-8), the cinematography was great (8.5), the score and soundtrack was great and really added to the film (9). The story was what really bothered me; it's extremely difficult for me to sympathize with any of the characters because, with the exception of one, all the bad things that happen to the characters happen because of poor, selfish choices that they make. It's a little like Requiem for a Dream in that respect, but it's not quite as fatalistic. I'd give the story a 6. The dialogue is reasonable, but throughout the film i just couldn't bring myself to really care about any of the characters. Overall it's a good movie and definitely worth watching at least once, but i don't think it will be making its way into my collection."

Divine justice: hopefully one day in future *AMORES PERROS* will appear in movies history as one of the best directors debuts. Nothing in common with \"Pulp Fiction\", highly original and depth, *AMORES PERROS* deserves a remarkable place in film history, aside with generational masterpieces, lets cross fingers for I\u00f1arritu's future works."

At the beginning I didn't find the movie very promising, as the only thing I saw were dogfights. But once the movie progressed and the other stories started unfolding it became an impressive movie. The stories are told separately but in a way in which the other stories tag along and relate to each other. I can't really say which of the two movies I find better, Amores Perros or 21 Grams, I find them both equally good. Amores Perros stands out because of the character development and the way the stories are related to each other, film-making at its best.\n\n9 out of 10."

        "review_detailed_main": "For all those who see the comment that states this is a \"pretentious indie film\" ... well this is the other side of that (bizarre) comment.\n\nAmores Perros is one of my top ten films. It shows a fragmented display of human kind in an apparent lawless section of society. It allows the viewer to get just close enough to some of the (flawed) characters, then wretches them away ... and submerges the viewer into another (flawed) story. There are obvious biblical themes (Cain and Abel) which will be apparent to viewers before the themes are (post modernly) announced by one of the stars. It is, perhaps, a validation and verbalization of what the viewer is thinking in watching this powerful example of love and tragedy.\n\nFor those unaware of the structure of Amores Perros, it is an example of temporal distortion. This, however, doesn't distract from the deep relationships the viewer has with the characters. The flawed lovers, the scarred beauty, the family man who has fled his nest and the complex hit-man. The obvious motif - of canine relationship with man/woman - serves as a connection between seemingly unconnected characters and perhaps demonstrates the base level violence that the characters are a part of.\n\nAmores Perros is a complex film that rewards the viewer. In basic terms, it will make you cry and make you feel. It is not pretentious. It is, in fact, quite beautiful. Apologies for the pretentious nature of this review, but I figured the undereducated \"pretentious indi film\" review called for some of these comments! Basically, Amores Perros it is a great flick!!!!!!"

Maybe all the publicity and the box office will have a determinant weight in the final decision, but the members of the Academy know much about when a film have too much feeling and heart by itself and there is were my expectation resides, because a good picture is the message of humanity, not the supernatural scenes based upon a legend.

I have just purchased the DVD and plan to watch it with as many of my friends as possible because the reactions of the people I watched it with originally were varied to the point that I was unsure if we'd been watching the same movie. The intensity is augmented by the grainy footage and sense of speed (especially apparent in the opening scene). Also the way in which the director dealt with time and space worked beautifully. The characters are surprisingly profound, and even the dogs seem to develop as characters (maybe it's just that I have a rottweiler). All in all a worthwhile if difficult film from a young talented director"

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie starts out with a car chase that winds up in an accident, an accident that links the lives of three people. The stories of these three, before and after the accident, is told by way of an intricate plot structure. Deft time sequencing and inter-cutting of each story with the others keeps you on your toes - you have to pay close attention. In each story the accident is seen from the perspective of each of the three main characters - it must have been filmed using multiple cameras. The film editors deserve recognition for putting this film together.\n\nThere is some pretty strong stuff here. The auto accident is gruesomely realistic and shocks every time it is shown. The dog fighting scenes will turn the stomach of most - in fact if you know someone who does not react to those scenes, you may want to give them wide berth. There are several ruthless murders, and a graphic stabbing.\n\nThe acting is first-rate. Gael Garcia Bernal is a dynamic and charismatic actor and Emilio Echevarria is great as an ex-guerrilla who has become a homeless man. He is wonderful in an extended solo scene where he is recording an emotional phone message.\n\nThe second story about an ad man and a classy model was the weakest. The biggest problem I had with it was the hole in the floor. For one thing a hardwood floor would never collapse in the manner shown. Any decent construction would have a plywood sub-floor, and this was a high-end apartment; in any event oak flooring would never behave that way. If they could not afford to have the hole fixed, they could have at least nailed a $10 piece of plywood over it. Who would live with a dangerous hole in the floor like this? And, if the dog was so important to them, why wouldn't they be a little more proactive in getting him out of the hole?\n\nThe musical score, by Gustavo Santaolalla, augments without intruding. As dazzling as the presentation is, I sometimes had the feeling of being too aware of the brilliant technique at the expense of the stories which show that, regardless of societal class, love drives people to take actions that have profound and often unexpected consequences."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie starts with a car chase ending in a horrific crash. The crash serves as a pivot for three interconnected stories. The first is Octavio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal). He lives with his mother, his older brother, and sister-in-law Susana. He lusts for his brother's wife and wants to run away with her. A local hoodlum dog fights and one day, he sends his dog at Octavio's dog Cofi. It nearly kills the hoodlum's dog. Octavio takes Cofi into the world of dogfights to earn the money needed to escape with Susana. The second is the model Valeria who barely survives the car crash with a severely injured leg. The third is El Chivo who roams the streets with his cart. At his run-down home, he takes care of his pack of dogs. Then he's hired to track down a guy.\n\nThis is brought to us by director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu who would eventually direct other interconnected story lines movies such as Babel and 21 Grams. He's got a style and he's good at it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the first story with Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal. It could be a great movie all by itself. It's gritty. It's compelling.\n\nThe second story starts slow. Then it takes a weird turn. I don't want to spoil it, but it builds into something poetic. It's quite a special little short story. The third story is probably the least compelling of the three. The dog part of story appeal to me the most. I'm not terribly interested in El Chivo, but it's a good enough to finish off the trifecta."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie has generated a lot of polemic in all the places it has showed, in some countries like England cuz of the dog fights and in LatinAmerica cuz nobody (not even the mexicans) thought that there was able to do a good movie with few money (the movie cost was 2 million dollars), and that started a lot of envies, but this movie shows 2 things: 1.-there's only one thing that warranties succes, and that thing is talent. 2.-there's a lot of talent in countries like Argentina, Brazil or Mexico, no matter if the USA don't care about it.\n\nThe movie talks about 3 stories that mix in a car accident in Mexico City and about the way that accident afected all the people that lived it, after that the stories never really meet again, in the beginning it shows a little bit of inexperience, but as the time passes the movie becomes really good, better that a lot of the crap that happens in Hollywood\n\nThe 1st. story is about Octavio, a guy that enters his dog into fights for having money and scape with the wife of his brother, this is the part that some people don't resist, if you pass the first 30 minutes you will be ok. This story is the most commercial of the film.\n\nThe 2nd. one is the shortest, it was the sacrified when the director had to reedit the movie cuz it was too long, here is where I\u00f1arritu and Arriaga experiment the most with a lot of metaphores, mainly where the dog is lost in the floor of the building.\n\nThe 3rd. is the crudest of all, is about El Chivo, a guy that lost his family 20 years ago and lives doing jobs of killing people, he has 2 conflicts, the first one is to try to recover the love of his daughter Maru, a character that doesn't say one word, but still one of the most important of the movie, the other one is a job to kill a guy, the he discovers that who wants to kill him is his brother, and he puts them face to face, in the Cain VS Abel scene.\n\nThe movie has wrongly been compared with American Beauty or Traffic, but this movie has been done before that movies, and it has nothing to do with Pulp Fiction, yes, there's some violence in the movie, but it's different, in american movies violence is for having fun, in \"Amores Perros\" it is a circunstance, what that kind of people live daily. It was nominated to the Oscar as Best Foreing Movie, is obvious that it was never gonna win, is something like Central Station (BRA) VS Life is Beautiful (ITA) in 1999, but it was not fair to disqualify it the way they did in the USA just cuz they hadn't watched it, and if the oscars were fair the movie should have been nominated to best edition.\n\nThe movie in general makes a lot of analogies with the dogs, and shows how the director talks about the lost of humanity saying that we can see a hurted dog and a hurted man and we help first the dog. I think that this is 'cause of the answer, we help a dog and he's gonna be always loyal, but humans are not that way.\n\nIt's a very good movie, the NYTimes named it as the first classic of this decade, I do believe they're right, CTHD is a very good movie, but this one too, and if you like to watch movies with something more that a lot of explosions and that make you think, and mainly feel, this is a movie you can't lose."

In the first part you will see people who struggle for survival, then richness with different problems and in the third part a broken man. But there is one thing that brings them all together, the plain force of love and one car accident. I loved every minute of that movie and I think it is a must seen. The movie is sometimes compared to Pulp Fiction, but I don't think that both movies are comparable. Amores Perros shows violence as plain and simple as it is, and in Pulp Fiction Violence is shown in a somewhat aesthetic way."

        "review_detailed_main": "AMORES PERROS / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)\n\nI've never seen a movie like \"Amores Perros,\" and there's good reason for that. Few filmmakers would touch this kind of material, not because of the subject matter-it doesn't cover anything overly controversial-but because it is so dismal. I don't mind movies with depressing themes. \"Requiem for a Dream\" ranked as my favorite film of 2000. But there's a difference between grim and unpleasant, and this movie is as repulsive as they come.\n\nHow unpleasant? Because of the film's graphic dogfight scenes, The Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals filed a complaint to the British Board of Film Classification. Now, a disclaimer stating that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie comes at the beginning instead of being buried in the end credits. This is to assure audiences in advance that the dogs aren't tearing each other to shreds.\n\nThis might be reassuring if the movie wasn't so well made. Movies should convince us of the content, and \"Amores Perros\" does. The dogfights look so real, the animals might as well be ripping the flesh off each other's backs. We don't want to submit ourselves to such horrific images.\n\nMany praised this movie for its relentless audacity and perverse nature. Why? Just because an artist takes risks doesn't mean he deserves acclaim. We all should encourage filmmakers to try new things and explore unique subjects. But sometimes an experiment fails. This is one of those times.\n\nThe movie opens with a car chase. Two lowlifes dodge heavy traffic, escaping several dangerous thugs. As the passengers shout obscenities, a dog bleeds to death in the back seat. The scene concludes when the driver smashes into another vehicle at high speeds. This accident forever changes the lives of those involved.\n\nWe cut to a scene where more lowlifes gamble at a dogfight. Their dog tears the other dog to pieces. Soon afterward, we are happy to learn that another dog has killed their beast. What kind of movie evokes this kind of pleasure?\n\nDirector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu inventively structured his film by overlapping and intersecting several narratives. Throughout the 153 minutes (!), we meet the characters who were in the car crash. Although the film does get progressively interesting as each of three scenarios reveal something new about the story as a whole, the gritty nature of the production makes it anything but fun to watch.\n\nIn English, the title means \"Love's a Bitch.\" This movie doesn't justify those words. It certainly shows the downside (way down) of life, but it wouldn't know love-or emotion in general-if it bit it in the nose. It's about behavior beyond reason. Reaction without impulse. For a movie to portray separation from love, it needs to know what love really is.\n\nWhen two people have sex, it's raw and cold. Yet an uplifting melody fills the soundtrack. \"Amores Perros\" doesn't know a thing about passion. This director obviously has a big grudge against the world. If filming his aggression helps him work out these issues, that's fine. But why expose the rest of the world to this brutal therapy?\n\nPerhaps I'm too hard on the film. It's engaging at points. Its themes gradually take solid form. It's obvious Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a talented, fearless filmmaker. The movie leaves us with a lot to chew on. By the end, we are oddly touched and amazed how everything fits together, but we don't know what to make of it all."

I have seen movies from all around the world so I don't care about the language.\n\nAnyway, when I started to watch this movie I thought: \"A Mexican movie, that's interesting!\". Well, it turned out to be something else. When the first hour had passed I wished the movie was over. I felt like it's been two hours at least! The beginning was actually quite ok because of the action but then the pace slowed down and the movie got REALLY boring. The characters just kept on talking and talking and...aaargghh!!! The story went absolutely nowhere!\n\nIn Amores Perros there's several stories told at the same time. I guess they tried to rip off the idea of Pulp Fiction but it just doesn't work. The stories have nothing to do with each other. And the beginning? Once again the same thing repeated: they show what happens later and then picture cuts back to a situation that happened earlier. A bit used idea don't you think?\n\nWhat is the basic idea of this film? It's a movie about dogs. It's a movie about people loving their pets. Who the hell wants to see a movie about dogs?! I don't! I can not comprehend why this movie gets an 8.2 rating from you!\n\nIn conclusion, Amores Perros is WAY too long, WAY too slow and the plot is WAY too idiotic to raise my interest. 2/10 is my rating."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film seems in the style of pulp fiction or resevoir dogs, but with some spice added due to its Mexican setting. Its camera work is quite 'wobbly' as is the fashion, but this film isn't a hollywood blockbuster, and so it isn't such an obvious plattitude in this arty and slightly alternative film.\n\nAmores Perros lengthy and not all chronologically ordered. It meanders between the stories with gradual clues as to their convergence and significance. I enjoyed the theme of poverty and morality to the film. It does show a realistic, if alternative, portrait of life for some people, and the emotions involved in their struggles. The bad guys get what they deserve in this film, although as the title suggests, 'love is a bitch' and it mustn't be relied on to deliver happy endings. Poverty and hardship are central to the film, and the supermodel's misfortunes help illustrate how nobody is immune from a fall.\n\nIts not a film that you will 'love' due partly to its vicious and violent nature (the dog fighting seems especially vivid). Neither is it one you should watch with your parents in the room - as i did! However it will provoke a strong emotional response as films should. Other plus points are the well chosen soundtrack, and powerful atmospheric filming. Amores Perros is a genuinely powerful, and an emotionally and visually impressive movie - recommended."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amores Perros is a Spanish film with a great reputation that I happened to have on DVD from the college library. I'd heard a lot of good things about Amores Perros, but I hadn't heard much about the plot, which was a good thing. Half the fun of this movie realizations that you get about the plot as the movie goes on. You get more and more information about each of the characters until right at the end it all makes sense. All I will say about the plot is that it has three separate story lines that meet at a car crash then go off on their own again. And all of them have to do with dogs. Beyond that, watch the movie for yourself. The movie's title is translated to \"Love's a Bitch\", and that is a very good representation of the themes in the movie. Love is involved in each storyline, and in each one it goes sour, or has dire consequences on the character. In the end, no one is satisfied, and pretty much everyone ends up worse off than they were at the beginning. This is absolutely brutal film-making, and it will make you wonder about the absolute futility of life portrayed here. There is very good acting all around, and all of the characters are believable. The camera-work, although it doesn't the stylish techniques that contributed so much to Requiem For A Dream, is very sturdy and never boring, although action movie fans may not like its artful touches and close-ups. In fact, action movie fans won't like this movie at all. Despite dog fighting scenes, this is definitely not an action-oriented film. However, it is a very powerful, if depressing, story, with loads of originality, film-making skill, and good acting. In Spanish with subtitles. -DenBez"

But if someone gets anything out of this film then perhaps some countries wouldn't be looking to invade others. Violence begets violence, (that's my preaching not the movie BTW).\n\nI found the movie relentlessly negative. Perhaps in my younger, angrier days I would have got more from it. But where Magnolia gave a message of hope in it's narrative, Amores perros only shows the consequence of negative actions. Which is interesting in a documentry sort of way but I can't recommend it."

Having seen Gael Garcia Bernal in Los Diaros de Motocicleta, I was very interested in seeing his previous work. I rented this out of the Foreign Film section of Blockbuster with little prior knowledge except for his presence.\n\nAmores Perros is a multiple story line flick, which I'm a fan of to begin with. It often leaves the viewer with questions throughout film, as personal histories of characters are usually not revealed until later in the movie. Sometimes these movies can be harder to follow if the director doesn't know what he's doing, but this one rarely tripped me up.\n\nThe director plays with the time frame, notedly repeating the opening car crash (that shouldn't be a spoiler) several times as the story permits. The characters are well-realized and multi-dimensional, and the acting is excellent. I can see why it won millions of awards.\n\nWhile I definitely got a Tarantino vibe watching this (a consequence of every non-chronological movie I seem to see nowadays) this movie isn't nearly as violent (except for dogs) or deliberately funny, though the banter between some of the characters can be. This film is definitely a straight up drama. There is a lot of Spanish swearing, most of which I recognized after taking five years of Spanish class, and I got a big kick out of it. But that's just me.\n\nGreat film; can't wait to see Inarritu's other work. Director definitely has talent and vision.\n\nAnd there are a lot of dead dogs."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yes, it seems like a whole ten years' worth of materials, experience and effort from Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. A hint: Don't go to see this film hungry, but not too full either, as your stomach will need room for emotional churns. Its Web site claims the film encompasses: betrayal, anxiety, death, sin, selfishness, pain, hope. It's true: AMORES PERROS has it all.\n\nFrom the very beginning before the start of the film, you see a statement about the filmmakers have in no way ill-treated or harmed any animals depicted in this photoplay. Well, it's still NFE (not for everyone). The director is forward and direct in his depiction of life, people and dogs as they are - he's bold and makes no apology to the faint-hearted. The dog fight scenes can be hard to take even though the camera did not show any direct shots of dogs actually fighting each other. But the atmosphere and build-up around the events felt so 'real' in delivery that warning to those who are squeamish just might need to look away or cover their ears momentarily. The sound effects by sound designer Martin Hernandez are truly well done, especially subtle for the second segment, when you can hear but cannot see the little pet dog\u0085\n\nIt's quite a way of telling his story, or stories, in three segments. It's ingenious how the main characters in each of the segments somehow have their fate unknowingly intertwined. You actually get to see them as passing background persons whom you'd catch a glimpse of or note as follow-up scenes in another segment than their own. Flashback retelling of events, and fast forward repeating to the cars a-crashing scene (the fateful connection point of the characters from each of the segments) come across as more mind challenging than \"Memento\", with layers of humanity and tight emotional entanglements. It's kind of like Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski telling his stories in three films: \"Trois Couleurs: Bleu 1993; Blanc 1994; Rouge 1994.\" Director-producer I\u00f1\u00e1rritu did all three stories in one film, 2 hrs. 27 mins. worth. He insightfully linked them all with a strong character thread that is present in all segments. El Chivo is played by Emilio Echevarria, who delivered the role with deep sensitivity, vulnerability and sense of resignation to life's unfairness - yes, \"Love's a bitch\", and life is, too. What you want to have happened, happens not. Let it go. Hence the ending is practically philosophical. The imagery we see heading towards the horizon beyond might just suggest rebirth\u0085\n\nScriptwriter Guillermo Arriaga has provided a storyline with facets of life and characters: two pairs of brothers in conflict, two cases of infidelity triangles, the bond between a father and his daughter, mother and sons or mother and 'son' of a pet dog, the inseparable relationship between man and dog. Segment 1: Octavio and Susana (and Ramiro, and Cofi the dog; glimpses of Daniel's family, Valeria's billboard, and El Chivo) - the energy is highly charged in this beginning story, where it revolves around the 'slums' of the city where money is hard to come by without involvement of gansterhood, gambling of lives, be it man, woman, or a dog's, and swearing (in Spanish, subtitled). Segment 2: Daniel and Valeria (and Ritchie the dog\u0085) - this story may seem 'trite' and happens not in the slums, yet both characters are pretty much in a slum of emotions. It's the helpless love attraction (rich or poor) which is such a 'Bitch\" as Octavio has towards Susana. Segment 3: \"El Chivo and Maru\" (and Gustavo, Mauricio, and Cofi; glimpses of Ramiro and Susana; follow-up on Octavio and Susana) - culmination point of the film, where we get down to know El Chivo up close - how he came to pass, what he did and is doing, and where he's going in life\u0085\n\nAMORES PERROS certainly shows plentiful the lack of love and understanding between brothers, family members, man and woman, man and dog.\n\nBravo! to the filmmakers of AMORES PERROS. Esfuerzo magnifico! Thank you to the distribution of this film by Lions Gate Films."

Here it doesn't seem to do it particularly well.\n\nThe two main themes were dogs and love. The first story concerns a guy who uses dogfighting to get cash to try and convince his brother's wife to elope with him. He has quite a caring and generous character (one of the leads in Y Tu Madre Tambien?), in contrast to his brother who is a wife-beating criminal. However, for some reason the young mother ultimately feels loyal to her husband... The second story concerns a model who has finally gotten together with a family man she has been having an affair with, only to get involved in a horrible car accident. She then obsesses on the fact that her dog has gotten under the floorboards as she tries to come to terms with her injuries, in a quite well observed psychological breakdown which eventually results in her leg having to be amputated and her dreams of resuming her modelling career coming to an end. The third story is about a man who left his family to become a guerilla and was then locked up in jail for his terrorist activities. He has now become a tramp who is hired out as a hitman by a corrupt cop. His lack of morality towards humans is in stark contrast to his feeling s for stray dogs who he protects and looks after. When he takes in the fighting dog from the first story and it massacres his own dogs, it seemed to me that it symbolised who he was, i.e. someone that has become a cold-hearted killer without realising. He then decides to turn his life around by contacting his daughter and leaving her some of his ill-gotten gains.\n\nNo character in this movie was ultimately likeable, the lovesick brother was pitiable in his desperation to be with his sister-in-law but his morals were lacking. The model shows no sympathy for the family she has wrecked, only self pity at her misfortunes. The tramp/guerilla has brought all of his troubles on himself and killed many people.\n\nThis movie made me think but not change any of my ideas."

Along the 3 stories, the fate of the dogs became a metaphor of the lives of their owners. A very good film, strong, honest and of a new kind of directors in Mexico. The soundtrack is fantastic (specially a song from Nacha Pop, called \"Lucha de gigantes\") and we must thank the Director for showing us a different view of Mexico very far away from the \"taco\", the \"indio\" and the \"narco\" movie. I still don't know why they translate the movie title as \"Love is a bitch\". It doesn\u00b4t make any sense to me and seems to be very poor related with the movie, but that's life..."

Suddenly you are on the streets of Mexico, smelling the air of jeopardy and constant risk - risk for the sake of living, being loved. Life isn't a game that one can quit - once you've taken responsibility you have to keep on going deeper. It's about the issues of integrity, moral choices and sacrifices that have to be made. Those must be essential - like dogs'. They don't think if it's right or wrong - they follow the natural feeling of being honest whether in love, loyalty or death.\n\nSo far I watched the movie twice and both times enjoyed a lot. The director and actors made a great job at exposing the characters at best - they're real to the extent when you love and loath them. Everything is pointing out for the happiness but here is another test crossing out the rest. And the music background does its part, fits perfectly in the action.\n\nAbsolutely loved it! I'm giving it 9 out of 10 just for the hope Inarittu would try to reach higher for another masterpiece."

I love movies, I\u00b4ve tried to really catch the efforts of the staff and actors, directors,etc. this elements in Amores Perros really mix well during ALL the movie.\n\nThe contrasted film is a very effective method for creating at atmosphere, just like Three Kings (even as it was not used during all the movie) or Saving Private Ryan. The Actors were so natural that you\u00b4ve just buy the whole thing, the handle of the camera was well used and supporting through the whole movie, the dog fight scenes were so real .\n\nThe sour taste of what is to live in Mexico City is displayed here, you can walk half hour and pass from a very lujurious neighborhood to a miserable site, that is the thing that catch most mexicans, the Irony of living here and pride that one man was able of translate that to film"

        "review_detailed_main": "A major traffic accident connects three sets of diverse lives in modern day Mexico City.\n\nLife is rough and tough on the streets of Mexico City and you have to do what you have to do to get by. Sometimes dogs are the only friends you have. Even life for those that have made it is no bed of roses.\n\nThis film is violent, crudely sexual, vulgar, sweaty, cramped and focuses on people that you are glad you are only encountering on the big/small screen; but ultimately it overcomes all its self-made handicaps by being so cleverly made and acted. Indeed you feel you are watching life itself.\n\n(A heated-up and condensed version of life itself - but true nevertheless.)\n\nDirector Inarritu a has clearly been watching modern classics such as Pulp Fiction and Traffic, but thankfully has also seen Accident, from which he borrows certain structures and devices. Indeed the real brilliance of the film comes in the way that what you think you have people tagged, and then find that you haven't quite got it right.\n\nThe problem with world cinema is that it often plays the game of dumping the ingredients in the stewpot and letting the audience put together the meal themselves. Here we have structure and purpose. Indeed this is the best structured film I have seen in years - I love the way it unfolds. Even the use of music - from a wide range of sources - seems spot on.\n\n(I found the story of the model and her lost dog to be equally as valid as the rest of the story and provided relief from the darker elements.)\n\nDespite its length, there is no real spare fat on the bone and, if anything, the film gets stronger as it works towards its climax - which is both smart and cinematic.\n\nI recommend this film to anyone that wants to see serious adult cinema in a unique setting. The dog fighting scenes are quite tough and if they were faked, then they were faked very well. I found them very hard to watch and they probably go on too long - we would get the message by cutting them in half. Nevertheless a modern classic and proof that cinema still can deliver surprises from the most unlikely quarters."

That it upset my stomach should say quite a bit, as I have watched \"Last House on the Left\" more times than I can count. The only redeeming feature of the film is its innovative storytelling. All the characters are doomed and unsympathetic. At no time did I truly understand the characters, nor did I want to. This has got to be the most joyless piece of cinema I have ever seen. In general I love foreign film, but not this tripe dressed up as art. I have read other's comments and find it shocking that this sort of ultraviolence and cruelty to animals is acceptable. I give it a 1 out of 10, only because of the narrative element I mentioned earlier."

It showed levels of Mexican society, other than the corrupt general in the drug trade, and the simple honest poor peasant. We Americans mostly think of Mexico as the desert border, Tijuana or a resort that the Love Boat stops at. But through this triptych like story, we see the dichotomy of Mexico City, in much of the same ways we used to see the extremes of New York City in some of the better 70's movies. As long as those dog sequences were truly monitored by the humane society, I have nothing but good things to say about this powerful movie."

The stories of which the movie consists are linked gloriously but somehow these stories are not so shocking. I don't want to spoil the movie by giving details here but bitter love stories are usually way more painful than these (\"Chasing Amy\" is a great example of this). For a film which is based on a brilliant idea of combined stories about love and dogs, i would expect more bitter stories but the only bitter thing was the dog corpses seen anytime on the movie. To conclude, it's a pity that \"Amores Perros\" is not capable of being a classic though it has the capacity to be."

Nothing is more distant from the truth.\n\nThe movie indeed lasts for two and a half hours. However, it never becomes boring. It must be said that Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu started his career as a DJ. This fact is candidly reflected in this movie. There is tempo within the movie. It moves on. When it is finished, you do not have the impression that you have been sitting down on that couch of yours for one hundred and fifty minutes.\n\nEveryone will agree on the fact that splitting up a story helps increasing the tempo. The movie is split up in three parts. The first part, about Octavio and Susana tells us an emotional, though realistic love story. The second part tells us a love story, a lot different from the first one however. The third part tells us the story about el Chivo, a bum in Mexico City, in whose life love has played an important role as well.\n\nDogs play an important part in all three pieces of the movie, this, in combination with the love explains the title. Amores Perros (=Love Dogs) Along with the nice beat of the music, the separation of the movie into three parts delivers us a very well paced film. Pace becomes more and more important these days, especially for the younger generation. I know there are people who are absolutely not of the opinion that pace is one of the most contributing traits of a film, but it is. This reflects what cinema will be like in the 21st century.\n\n9 and a half out of 10."

Well done. I just hoped to see more new styles created by Mexican film industry, in a way that isn't subordinate to American or European film fashions - something even newer and more extraordinary so to make Hollywood/Europeans be the copycat for few decades would be wonderful to see :)\n\nThe undercurrent in the film, what's the symbolism of phone calls that hangs-up? (distance? fate?) It happened in two stories, and there is considerable reuse of the phone scenes to warrant some design in the metaphor of the phone. The dog trapped under the floor board, what does that mean? I mean it is extremely unusual people to leave their pet trapped for so long, what does it represent in terms of their relationships or maybe personal baggage, or that their relationship is going through mazes in the dark with rats lurking? What does the floorboard breaking on the first day represent - breaking the surface?\n\nThat's all the questions I have right now. Good night."

Living in Mexico, I can say I saw it almost before everybody (except maybe the people who saw it at Cannes Festival). I've seen it 4 times at date (2 at the movie theater). And I keep saying the same. It's a GOOD DAMN TERRIFIC MOVIE. Maybe \"latin\" cultures (people always try to make a difference between people) are a lot different from english-speakers one. But I think this movie is indeed an international masterpiece that can be enjoyed by everybody. I've seen some reviews, and a lot goes straight to the \"violence\" issue, or the \"Dog's cruelty\" one. FIRST OF ALL, Mexico is not a cannibal paradise, so it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to think that the dogs are, indeed, forced to hurt themselves to make it \"reallistic\". SECOND, THIS IS NOT A COMERCIAL HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. If you watched it and didn\u00b4t liked it because you thought so, sorry, but I understand your dissapointment. AMORES PERROS (It's litteral translation isn't \"Love's a bitch\", but \"Cruel love's stories\"... a spanish word puzzle) it's not a masterpiece just because it's in a \"Foreign language\" for non-spanish speakers, but it is because its HUGE EMOTIONAL CONTENT. It's not a movie for cheering you up. It's not a DISNEY'S OPTIMISTIC MOVIE. It's a sad movie, in fact. But it is great because it reflects life. People use to think about a movie as an exagerated and beautiful reflect of life. It's OBVIOUS a Spielberg movies is not a reallistic story about life. Amores Perros isn't, in fact, a documentary. But it reflects the sordid and cruel image of life. And it does it with an absolute precision. I can understand a lot of people could not like it, but say it's a bad movie is to denny a masterful management of opposite emotions, wishes, dreams, and a part of human nature. The three stories reflects a frustrated wish of redemption, but powerfull as almost no movie ever.\n\nIf you like something else than the typical \"hero saves world and gets the chick\", you MUST watch this movie. It's not a Tarantino's management of characters and graphic violence (that, in fact, Amores Perros have with plenty), but a psychological violence that, in most cases, it's worse than physical violence. Lots of people in Mexico hated this movie. A lot more loved it. But know you're not going to watch a \"happy ending\" story, but a very complex masterpiece with a lot of meanings that, without a doubt, will make you think about a lot of things. If you consider a movie like a \"spending time stuff\", you better watch Spiderman."

The violence maybe maybe too much for some but they have to realize that it is not at all exaggerated or glamourized. The fact that the director shows this violence doesn't mean he enjoys it. He is merely using it as the backdrop for our 'love stories' that show the bad aspects of love. The tag line 'If you don't see this movie, don't worry, you'll live it anyway' stands. Unlike some stupid dolt who posted a review here and took the tag line too literally, most of us can recognize the basic dilemas: loving someone else's partner, loving someone who will never love you, being in a superficial relationship, having to leave your family for something that you may know is wrong, trying to fix the world and realizing you can't. If some still don't believe such violence is real, and that people do fight dogs, people do rob banks, stab others, go to guerillas and shed blood by the bucket in fatal car accidents, then read the following example which is directly related to the movie. In an interview, the director told a story about how him and his crew were assaulted by a juvenile gang just outside the house where they held the dogfights who claimed they were filming in their territory. The crew decided to call in security guards who know how to talk to gangs because if they had called the cops, the gang would have killed them and the cops. In the end the guards found out that the gang claimed they where filming in their turf and that all they had to do was ask their permission. The crew asked and the gang granted it, no money down. Maybe in the US and Canada one is not as related with this type of behavior and may be led to believe that the director was just glamourizing. Well, I have lived in Mexico City and I have seen much worse things in the biggest and most violent city in the world. Back to the movie, the story is excellent, the characters may not be likeable but are entirely real, the acting is the best I've ever seen, specially by 'El Chivo', and the technique is superb. Forget comparisons to Pulp Fiction this movie stands on its own and it's more creative. If you haven't seen this movie, then go. If you have and didn't like it then just tell me this: most people liked it, thus the 8.5 rating (which I believe should be higher) do you, in your small little world, honestly think you are right and everybody else is wrong? Its okay if you don't like it but just think about it, go see it again and actually read the subtitles. P.S. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was much inferior to this movie and it didn't deserve to win the Oscar. Amores Perros all the way!!!! (like it or not.)"

The first story of the movie is brilliant and beautifully crafted, every scene has the necessary elements that take you right into the other. But after the first act, the story begins to drop...and it drops fast. I think it was Hitchcock that said: \"The length of a movie should be relative to the size of the human bladder.\" Taking this into consideration, I Think \"El Negro\" (Alejandro Gonzalez) has a bladder the size of Manhattan. Personally, and I read the script before the movie came out, I think that act 2 is weak, with a very weak plot, act 3 is very good, but unfortunately too long. I want to make clear that these were my exact comments when I read the script, when I finally had the opportunity to see the movie I understood what Alejandro was trying to do...bring closure to the whole thing. But with a third act that lasts 45 minutes I think the overall story structure suffers. But that is just my personal opinion (I think Goldman and McKee might agree with me), this doesn't mean the movie is bad...au contraire! I think it is one of the best films done in Mexico in the past decade. I will put it up there with Dos Crimenes and Danzon. Congratulations to Alejandro, to Rodrigo and to Alta Vista for finally doing this! This is what the Mexican movie industry needs to put us back where we belong!"

The middle story is the weakest of the three, but Inarritu generates considerable tension from the simple premise of a dog trapped under the floor board. Although the acting is good all around, the final story features a particularly notable performance by Echevarria as a man who leaves his family to join the revolution and ends up a lonesome hobo. However, the main attraction is Inarritu's fresh and invigorating style of film-making."

For me , the director of the film has done his work excellent, especially when you know that this is one of his first films ever, he brings everything in screen on a very high level. The only thing that's a bit strange in certain scenes are the flash backs and flash forwards ( this happens especially with the car accident that you see three times, but every time through the eyes of another person) Conclusion: A very good film which is highly recommended to see! On every school they must see this film, and certain bad things in the society of the world.\n\nJens"

        "review_detailed_main": "Only in America would a gritty movie with tons of violence, sex, and language be allowed in but the foreign title must be used because the translated title is `Love's a Bitch'. While grittier films have come out of America, Mexico's Amores Perros still is something that I have never seen before. Although it has been called the Mexican Pulp Fiction, I fail to see the connection except that both deal with lowlifes and jump around with time. Other than that, there are no real similarities.\n\nLike Pulp Fiction, though, it's divided up into segments. The first deals with Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is madly in love with his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche) so he uses their dog Cofi to fight for money to run away with. Second is Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) whose marriage to model Valeria (Goya Toledo) is jeopardized when their dog Richie falls underneath their apartment. Last is former guerillia El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) who is assigned to murder someone, and also finds a wounded dog to take care of.\n\nAll three stories are brought together by a car crash, each in a separate way. And all three stories show how important dogs are to people. In all of them, the owner of the dog is more concerned about the canine than other people. It could be showing the alienation of culture, but it could just be showing us three stories of people down on their luck in Mexico City.\n\nI am a big animal lover, and it was rather painful to watch so many dogfights and dogs in peril, but at least barely any of the fighting was shown. It seems at times like Amores Perros goes for shock value, with the sudden fights and the gritty feel and the strong animal gore, to make us choose how we feel. Also, the music sways us, although it's quite good. In the case of movies like this, sometimes the music can hurt it, but not here.\n\nAmores Perros is one of those movies that have you feeling all mixed up inside, like you don't know how to feel, but that feeling goes away soon after the movie is done. You think it will leave a lasting impression on you, but it doesn't. I wish I could write more on this movie, but it's one of those movies that's hard to really talk about. See it if you'd like to see something different, and maybe you'll have another impression of it than what I had.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nRated R for violence/gore, language and sexuality."

This must be a technical masterpiece in both cases, two different ways to bring something brilliant, unusual, exciting, riveting. Rough, brutal, taut stories and characters too. The red string seems to be the dog story. It is of course a social drama, not a thriller nor a crime movie. An analysis of the Mexican way of life in a big metropol, where wealth is so close to the most atrocious poverty. And poverty means violence and despair. Not for all audiences, but a prize winning feature, worth an Academy Award."

        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't as blown away by this film as some other people, but still I think this was a pretty nice film. It has three stories that are connected by a car accident and I will review and rate them separately.\n\nThe first story is about a guy who's in love with his sister in law and fights dogfights to earn money to take her away from his brother who abuses her. She however sees nothing in his plans. It's very well acted and depressing. You really feel the depression of poverty and unanswered love. However I thought the main characters were a little too far from my bed to really identify with. Some witty dialogue may have prevented this, but in this part you don't see any intelligent characters (except perhaps the guy with the cool Escher T-shirt, but he plays a very minor role, so I wouldn't know). I give this part 7/10.\n\nThe second story was really boring and I didn't like it at all. A guy left his wife and children to live with a model. Then the drama comes: they lose their dog under the floor and she gets into a car crash and loses her beauty by it. A lot of time is lost on this silly problem of getting the stupid dog out under the floor. There are a few interesting scenes, but on the whole this part isn't deep at all. 5/10 for this part.\n\nThe third part however is really brilliant and makes up for the whole film. It's about a hitman who lives on the streets. In younger years he was a terrorist who wanted to change the system by blowing up buildings and killing police officers. Now he just kills rich people for money. I won't give away the end but I'm really glad this was the last part, because that way the feeling of the last scenes will stick with you the longest. 9/10 for the beautiful conclusion."

Just like 21 grams and Babel, Amores Perros has a non-linear structure, just like a puzzle. The movie tries to decipher the contemporary Mexican society, interweaving two worlds- the world of the poor, dealing with hunger, anger and street violence , and another world- the capitalist one dealing with models, TV shows, about phones, and so on and so forth. El Chivo, the ex-guerrilla, is the character who connects the two different worlds. He gave up a wealthy life as a bourgeois when he joined the Sandanistas because he wanted to create a better world for the poor.\n\nAlthough the film's distribution was delayed in certain countries owing to the violence in the dog-fighting scenes, I believe those were absolutely necessary because they act as metaphors for the rotten Mexican society and also show the way in which human relationships work ( the violence of love).\n\nThe dogs are the embodiment of their owners, showing the cancerous kernel, displaying the dog-eat-dog attitude of the modern Mexican society."

The characters sometimes pop up in each others stories, but this is in no way to make it conventional and the acting is superb to match. Sometimes hard to swallow (some animal lovers will find horror in the dog fight scenes), but overall a unique achievement in the new millenium of film, inparticular for Mexican film.

        "review_detailed_main": "Whereas Magnolia could be described as a symphony of human hardship and frailty ending in an emotional catharsis, this is more like a sonata in three parts, each with a completely different tone and tempo, but all sharing some common ground.\n\nThe first movement is about a guy who craves his brother's wife, so he uses his dog to make money in dog fights so he can support and run away with her. His brother is a wildly unstable criminal, and he crosses paths with some angry people in the dog-fighting underworld as well.\n\nThe flaw with this section is that everybody is so animalistic and savage, you don't care what happens with any of them.\n\nIn this movement, the dog kills to support a human's love.\n\nThe second movement features a man who leaves his family for a super-model, but when she has an accident and deteriorates, it snaps the superficial bonds between them.\n\nThe flaw here is that once again, you don't care much for such superficial, empty people.\n\nIn this movement, a man puts his priorities back in order after a near fatality, symbolized by his finally attempting to save a dog trapped and dying under his floorboards.\n\nThe third movement tells the tale of a crusty extremist revolutionary, now a wino-cum-hired assassin who longs for his family and daughter again.\n\nThis is by far the best episode with immense depth of character and deserves to be in its own movie.\n\nIn this movement, a killer dog mirrors the man's ruined, violent life and awakens him to find redemption and humanity again.\n\nThe much talked about Pulp Fiction-like structure is used very well, showing us a God-like view of a pivotal accident and how it changes lives both before and after the event.\n\nSummary: Both intensely fascinating and unsatisfying, more authentic than Magnolia but not as cohesive. A mixed bag.\n\nSide note: It's depressing to see how so many people can watch violent movies where humans get abused and killed, and suddenly get squeamish when dogs are 'abused' using special effects."

He murders for money, lives in a dirty room with lots of dirtier dogs and detects the cruelty of human (First biblical murder )and also wants back to his family.\n\nA Very Long Film, sometimes the passages witch the Model and the awful pronounced RIICHIIE is alil bit to long, but what makes this film so great: Different people with different problems cross their ways without knowing and this technically hard scene with the car accident is the melting pot of this three social \"layers\".\n\nExcuse my bad English please :)"

It is totally pointless! I don't care how many critics liked it, the film just flat out sucks. It attempts to be Pulp Fiction for 2000, yet it has no witty dialogue, no funny lines, no great cast of actors, and not even close to the same quality of music. It's overly long, there is way too much swearing without any purpose, too many gratuitous sex scenes, and too much violence. I love films with a lot more violence than Amores Perros, but in those movies it was appropriate and necessary, making for an interesting plot at least. There was nothing at all interesting about Amores Perros. It bored me to tears. I cannot even believe I threw away 2.5 hours of my life watching that steaming pile of dung. I'd rather watch the grass grow for the same amount of time."

I can see the similarities between the two, both having a motor vehicle accident as a plot linking device, and I have to say it is really difficult to say which is better. They are both great but I think I would vote for the this one as it is even more hard edged than 21 grams. Maybe because it is Mexican and not American it was a little more convincing. The scenes involving the dog fights are a bit gross but the cuteness of the guy who plays Octavio is a bonus.My one major criticism would be the thing with the dog trapped under the floor goes on a little too long, I get it was a symbol of their 'lost' relationship but enough already."

        "review_detailed_main": "Seldom does a movie come along that is so mind bogglingly great that it makes you just want to stand up and shout to the world how incredible the cinematic experience you just witnessed was. Amores Perros is one of those films. It's a Spanish film from auteur director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and it intertwines three stories, all with themes of love and loss. The three stories connect through a horrific car crash that changes the lives of all the characters permanently. The first story is about Octavio who is obsessed with his sister-in-law Susana. He wants to run away with her so he enters his dog into the dog fighting arena to raise the money. The second story is about supermodel Valeria who has just moved in to a new apartment with her lover, Daniel. Her story opens with the car crash, and we witness her difficult physical and mental deterioration. The third story is about El Chivo, an assassin who cares for Octavio's dog that was wounded in the crash. Chivo is on a quest to put his life back in order by setting things straight with the daughter he abandoned so many years ago. All three stories are equally excellent in their construction and despite the film clocking in at 2 and a half hours, you never want it to end.\n\nThis is a truly beautiful film. It is harsh and it is brutal, but it really makes you feel. You develop a sincere connection to these characters, and watching their stories unfold is moving, as well as gut wrenching at times. Too often the themes of love are sugarcoated and beautified for no discernible reason other than to please the viewer. In Amores Perros, love is expressed just as brutally as any other darker theme would be. It makes this film much more believable and much more memorable than your typical romance. This is evident even in the films title which translates to \"Love's a bitch\" in English.\n\nIt's always amazing when such harsh and violent characters are portrayed on screen, but you grow so close to them all the same. The characters in this film are murderers, gamblers, and thugs, yet they are all connected through their love for someone or something, which makes them all so human. They aren't ideal humans in any way, but they are realistic, believable, and compelling. We are also treated to a great diversity in this film as far as characters are concerned. The characters span the social classes, from rich upper class, to poorer middle class, to the homeless. This makes each story very different in content, but thematically they are the same.\n\nIf you're a dog person you should still see this movie, but be weary. Dogs are a central part of this film, which is appropriate seeing as they are one of the most loyal and loving creatures on the planet. But I already said this film is brutal, and dogs are part of the reason why. There are some grotesque depictions of dog violence that will make you shudder, as well as tug violently on your heart strings. Love in its purest form comes from dogs, and they teach the characters in this film many things about life whether they know it or not. Being a dog lover I had a difficult time with this film, but none of the violence is meaningless and it all furthers the strong thematic points of the film. The violence is brutal and tear jerking, but also very important.\n\nJust to make the film even better, Inarritu directs his debut film in a very sincere stylistic way. The film is not sugarcoated in any way, and the direction makes that clear. The direction is fast paced, brutal, and chaotic. But it is also masterfully done with a lot of respect towards the subject matter taking place on the screen. The direction is consistent in its in your face punchy style that keeps the film incredibly exciting no matter what is going on. This whole film feels so real and so human in every brutal way possible. It's something absolutely incredible, and not something we see enough of in film. The film is in no way exploitive. In fact it is just the opposite. It's a film with a meaning, a purpose, and a lot of feeling.\n\nAmores Perros is simply unforgettable. It is an intense and passionate movie experience with a beautiful array of fascinating characters that all go through such harrowing and gripping events. This is an incredible film. There's no two ways about it. It is stunning in its aesthetic wonder as well as its thematic significance and its brutally compelling storyline. See this film."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amores Perros is a gritty Mexican trilogy beautifully woven together and features fascinating characters, great first-time direction by Inarritu, and an underlying sense of raw comedy, not to mention one of the best introductions of any film I have ever seen. The first story is centered on a young man that is in love with his stepsister and decides to convince her to run away with him from her abusive, thieving husband by bringing her money he won from the world of underground dog fighting. The second story is of a man that leaves his wife and kids in order to live a dream life with a supermodel. And the final story is centered on a homeless, ex-politician hitman whose only goals in life are survival by any means and to reveal to his grown daughter who her real father is. This segmented, subtitled film is horrifically violent at times, depressing, shocking, and even part comical, yet the bleak, bloody, and raw tone of the film suppresses your laughter. You struggle to force yourself to continue being drawn into the terrible yet fascinating multiple worlds of the characters, as Inarritu shows how his stories collide by one brutal car accident. This was definitely one of the best films of 2001, and should appeal to any audience. Although graphically violent, there is no unnecessary footage purely for shock value, and I think this film is so powerful it should be seen by all, even those easily offended by violence. WONDERFUL MOVIE!"

The movie shows the characters, their wishes and desires, experiences and problems. Without going into spoilers, the well written plot is about people who deal with great change and loss in their lives, and does so with great effect.\n\nThe acting is very well done. Never over the top and always genuine. The Spanish speech and subtitles did not bother me at all, and it shouldn't put people off from seeing this movie. The characters are never one-dimensional and the editing keeps the movie at the right pace. Although I do feel the movie could have been more effective with a 15 minute shorter duration.\n\nIf you like films about life, films that move you and get you thinking, then you will enjoy this film."

That said it's also a brilliant movie.\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Inniratu's hold-no-prisoners, in your face style nicely suits the wonderful screenplay by Mexican born Guilermo Arragia. Characters in this movie don't necessarily find the redemption they are looking for but they're journey is nevertheless powerful and stunning.\n\nThe film basically center's on a group of characters all of whom have fallen in love, lost it or are becoming dissatisfied with it. For example a political hit-man named El Chivo lives like a hermit with his motley gang of dogs. He carries deep emotional baggage and desperately wants to reach out to his estranged family.\n\nThe movie's script is absolutely flawless although its hard to keep up when we move at such a breakneck speed. That said this truly is one of the best movies of recent years. The ending is especially powerful, and will haunt you till after the credits have rolled.\n\nSo what more is there to say? Go out and watch this movie! William Friedkin loved it, so why shouldn't you?"

This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, \"Amores Perros\" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget."

In one story, protagonist caves into lust and doesn't care whether God laughs at his plans; contrastingly, in the third plot beleaguered veteran, an assassin, tries to see clearly even though he jests earlier in the movie that if God wishes him to see everything blurry, he will do so.\n\nJust as having all the key ingredients, fresh and appropriate, doesn't guarantee an exquisite dish, so having appropriate cast, relevant production values and stellar writing doesn't promise a great viewing. This is where a director's worth really shows. While viewing the first part, the viewer feels adventurous, hopeful and eerily guilt. These feeling give way to feeling of irritation, nagging and loss of hope, during the second part ; one again feels hopeful, furthers his understanding of life and human nature, and acknowledges importance of moving on after viewing the third and final part of the movie. Innaritu's genius has an effect. It lies not in showing what life is, but in making the audience feel it. For English audience, who know little about fame of Mexican actors, the movie may sometimes feel like a well-directed and edited documentary, with close up shot spreading throughout the movie and realistic portrayal.\n\nYou neither appreciate what most characters do, nor condemn them; because u realize love's a bitch!!!"

And I reply to a recent post when I say that Cofi is no mere Rottweiler; he's an embodiment, a living metaphor. So yes, he can beat a top-of-the-line fighting pit bull. Like in many other \"underdog\" stories, the winner isn't always the sure-thing.\n\nI find it interesting that some people who've posted here don't like the middle story. Why does Valeria and Daniel not speak to them? I found their story to be the most damning of \"love.\"\n\nAnd that's what this movie is, a conceptual story that presents us with fragments of the whole, variations of love and love themes to illuminate and make us think. Let's face it, intellect is a weak point in many movies -but not this one. See for yourself.

Combining three separate stories into one horrific car crash we see elements of the script reminiscent of Tarantino. Set on the streets of Mexico City we are given a close look at how three people go about their everyday lives. Octavio (Bernal) is a young man who is in conflict with a a number of people such as his brother and rival dog fighter - the dog fighting scenes are so realistic they must be real. We are shown a young woman named Valeria; she is a beautiful model who is entering into a complex relationship. And finally there is El Chivo 'The Goat', a once lone hit-man for the government. His story is again involved with the heartbreak of love and how he copes with it. Together all three individuals show immense struggle to overcome great adversity and try to resolve their problems that seemingly go on and on. The grittiness of this film complements the compassionate love that smothers each character. An intelligent film, with fast paced Mexican rap (Control Machete) and Nacha pop, which is subtle music of acoustic rock ballad, we find a very intriguing and emotional story. It may seem like a very bleak and cold film but it does have a lot of life, which you should expect from such a populated city as Mexco City. This film is a must see for all fans of foreign cinema, but for those who have not tasted more European cinema then this film will definitely leave the sweetest taste."

It is very disturbing to see the aftermath of dogs portrayed as dead (presumably on a sedative that rendered them unconscious) tongues hanging out with red splashed about their bodies, but there is no torn flesh nor tearing of flesh shown. At no time does the film become a \"slasher\" film. What it suggests is very emotional and sad, but it is done in a way that I felt was tasteful (if a dogfight can be tasteful) and certainly viewable. I didn't feel I had to close my eyes to avoid being offended. I have great respect for the makers of this film. I won't go on about that because others here have covered the bases. I will only say, that it is an excellent film about love and how painful and disturbing it can be. Bravo!"

        "review_detailed_main": "If you watch this film today chances are you'll come to it having already seen Alejandro Inarritu's more recent, famous English work like 'Birman' (2014) and 'The Revenant' (2015), both of which rank as modern classics. Having already seen both of the above I was interested to know what Inarritu's Mexican films were like and I was not disappointed. 'Amores Perros' or 'Love's a Bitch,' the title being a pun on both love itself and dogs, both of which feature prominently.\n\nThe basic premise of the film is a now well established and copied trope of a central, connecting event through which a variety of stories are spun off, usually in cities. In 'Amores Perros' a car crash brings our three main stories together and a variety of love and situations, types of love and good and bad outcomes. The most interesting is the final and climatic arc of the El Chivo character, who is dotted throughout the first two stories in a mysterious and half taunting method, drawing us closer to the finale and his piece.\n\nThere is a tendency in films like this to fall into melodrama but Innarritu maintains the realism of his picture well. The brutality of the interconnected stories too, also feel realistic. The only real problem with it is some now very dated music for the soundtrack which sticks the film in its late 90s/early noughties feel. There is also a danger that such films attempt to say too much about life in too little time or too much. Whilst Amores Perros runs for about two and a half hours at no point does it feel too long nor does the film feel like Inarritu is attempting to say all he can about love, life, cruelty and the world.\n\nThe role of dogs in their human masters and abuser's affairs is a clever little motif that helps draw the stories together. They, as much as the human cast, deserve applause. For the most part the characters we are privileged and horrified to be privy to their lives feel real, honest and actual people. There is sympathy yes, but never too much and the ugliness of humanity is made clear without falling victim to dull nihilism.\n\nEven the shaky, gritty camera-work feels fresh despite its 2000 release date. Whereas action films since the Bourne series and its various descendants have killed shaky cameras before repeatedly desecrating their graves and using their corpses the setting and context of Inarritu's work means that the cinematography works well.\n\nAll in all whilst it's not a perfect film 'Amores Perros' does what any good drama should do, deliver dramatic situations, sequences, stories and make us feel for the characters in equal parts pity and disgust."

The entire cast is nothing short of excellent.\n\nTechnically this is not a masterpiece. Cinematography is not great, nor is the film's score, which I felt was confusing along the lines of Aranofsky's \"Requiem\".\n\nI thought it was quite difficult to get through the film's plus 150-minute runtime, as it revolves around a lot og brutal violence and difficult feelings. In spite of this, I was invested in believable characters, excited about the story telling and the director's vision of exhibiting the evil of possessive love in humanity. Recommended."

        "review_title": "The flawed nature of the human being",
        "review_detailed_main": "The title of this wonderfully crafted film allures to dogs and, in fact, dogs do make a sort of assistance to the human stories being told. Three in fact, that at one point or another interconnect. By now we have become familiar with Alejandro Gonz\u00e1les I\u00f1arittu's style of inter wining lives and the effect that these connections have, however he hasn't done this better than he did with Amores Perros. This being his film debut one can see that he was meant for big things, as most of his movies have shown by their critical success.\n\nSo with this film we get a first chapter which involves a young man who seems to be both enjoying his new found way of earning money, while also struggling to cope with his brother's wife's pushing him away. This first part involves some of the more graphic scenes, which may be tough to watch for some viewers, especially if you're dog person like I am. In short this was a good start to the movie that ends with the car accident that links the three parts together. After that we get the aftermath of this tragedy, through the eyes of Valeria, an aspiring model who is confined to a wheelchair, spending most of her time at the newly acquired apartment by her lover, a former family man who left his wife & children. Slowly she starts to lose it, as her dog gets trapped in a whole hole on the house floor and she sees her career fade away. This middle segment of the film sees a more emotional backdrop, as it shows the audience the difficulty some people have coping with problems such as the one the model goes through. Finally we are introduced to an old, bearded man who was always in the background during those other stories and is now the central focus of the film at this time. His story is one of regretful decisions and a bipolar dynamic that follows him, as he shows a nurturing side by taking care of dogs, while also being a near sadistic hit-man. In the end we see him set up a conflict between two brothers and attempts to connect with his estranged daughter.\n\nUpon concluding this film, I found myself rationalizing about how this movie is an excellent look into the flaws of humans in comparison to, say the dogs, which are as much a part of the movie as humans, You see, dogs in this movie are nothing more than loyal companions that only serve to accomplish their owner's goals. In the first story, Octavio, the young man, trains his dog to be vicious and fight other dogs to the death. In the second story, although to a much lesser extent, the dog gets trapped because he was playing with her owner, therefore being good company. And in the final story the dogs are obviously a big part of the old man's life. Now by saying this, I don't mean that dogs are perfect, because either by their own instincts or by human influence, they can be savages, as is show by their fights and when the dog in the first story kills all the other dogs owned by the old man. What's I'm trying to say here is that the darker side of a human being is explored here, and in my opinion in great fashion. Amores Perros is a tough movie to watch, yet it's a great way to go deep into the most harsh things about human life, something that we have to fight in order to carry on living, be that as a poor man or a successful person.\n\nRating: 8,5/10"

Whether you want to believe in it or not, Alejandro Gonzalez is hell bent to make you see that bad karma is alive and well in society today.\n\nThis story, which involves three different stories, are all ingeniously connected with one another. And without giving any spoilers, it is important to know that karma is present in all three tales. If you do something bad in your life, you will pay dearly down the road in one way or another.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film, and not just because the director and I share the same name, but because it was powerful, colorful, and the acting was superb. Above all that the screenplay was one of the best I've seen in a long while.\n\nIf Love is for the Dogs (as the title suggests), then this critics' tail is wagging for more movies like this. Highly recommendable."

        "review_detailed_main": "Regardless of the Spanish subtitles, the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has climbed into my favourite directors of all time list with this wonderful dramatic masterpiece. A friend mentioned his work in Babel (2006) and how great that was. I hadn't seen his earlier films including this one which is now nine years old. As I went back to Amores Perros, It caught my eyes as a work of art. From the moment it started, Alejandro uses many film techniques which intervene the characters and certain parts of the plot with each other. I personally love the alternative film making in some films and this is shown well with Amores Perros.\n\nAs part of the death trilogy now. Alejandro's first film truly shines out to be the best of the three. The film traces three different characters who really have nothing to do with each other until the end, where a car crash takes place and we see the different characters reactions and relation somehow to the accident. As the plot unfolds so do the characters such as Octavio, who changes due to love. The overall understanding of what Amores Perros stands for could in fact be the English title; Love's a Bitch. Which is quite accurate when considering the symbolism in this film. Dogs are used throughout, which somehow resembles the bitch in the title. The overall title meaning could certainly link the relationship of dogs and people together and that how unjustly it may seem, that people show emotions in everything they do. In Amores Perros, we could consider, the tragedy of a close friend, the fight with the brother, love of the sister in law and even the companion between life of a dog and human beings. The overall message is that life is sometimes cruel when dealing with any relationship in life.\n\nThe overall review comes down to whether you like a strong drama, and if you haven't seen this film. My word would be to rent out the three films of the trilogy together: Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel. All three films are brilliant and have similar film styles, but different stories. It's great to see such a director make his debut film a classic. Well done Alejandro. And a good praise to the main star Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal for giving a remarkable performance.\n\nGo see this film!"

As difficult as it was, the director has stated it was all clever editing and tranquilizing drugs. No dogs were harmed in the filming. A top dog trainer was on the set and used his own dogs in this production."

Oh yeah, right, I always rob banks, take my dog to secret rooms for violent fighting, carry guns in my pockets and stab people. Sorry, this is not something I plan to live, Mr. director and writer. And this is also why films often bother me: There's a cultural assumption out there that film is somehow \"like real life\" or representing history validly and this simply not so. And this film does not portray \"love\" as I understand it. Love to me is about nuturing and support. What I see portrayed in this film is people living out dysfunctional family patterns unconsciously and hurting each other in the process. True, this is \"like real life\", but hopefully we seek out support or help before we turn to some of the extremes that these characters do. All of the characters in this film inflict violence on themselves and others around them because they are unable to confront these deep patterns. I think I would have liked the film more (or at least empathized with some of the characters more) if at some point recognition of these dysfunctional patterns was made conscious. The director/writer never does this. I liked the ambient soundtrack. Similar to the Cliff Martinez stuff in Steven Soderbergh's films. The film was well shot. I cried in a few scenes. I didn't like the macho-ness of the male characters. Susanna's character also really bothered me. I got a little bored in some parts. Overall, an OK film. Not \"outstanding\", sorry to say."

All the characters are constantly looking for something, this kind of loneliness, sadness and strong action is something you find travelling in Mexico. The class of super-rich people who CRASHES with the two guys from very poor families, the constant aim to get a lot of money and get out of the s**t, the genuine sound track (taken from local music bands) that reflects the ultimate styles... I feel this movie will open a new school of cinema in Mexico, sort of realism. I find lot of similarities with the style of the movie Black Cat, White Cat from Emir Kusturica. Despite the fact that Mexico is in America, I think this kind of cinema closer to the European style, rather than the US style. Last thing: don't forget to learn some mexican swearword before watching the movie."

There is no message, only the reality of these wounded personalities.\" - apart from that I believe Amores Perros has the narrative complexity and dexterity to hold a message, even if it is only for those willing to create a message themselves.\n\nFrom a technical front, the cinematography and score are enough to carry the heavy dense narrative but not enough to dazzle or excite.\n\nThe acting is consistently incredible from all members of cast, showing true and powerful dedication to their craft and to the film.\n\nThe pacing sags in the centre but is quickly lifted for the conclusion.

Although the film is well cast and artistically and technically excellent, it is somewhat overwrought and inclined to wear on the audience at it's dramatic tales are pounded into us as opposed to making us yearn for more. One question every auteur should be prepared to answer when asked by an audience is \"why should we care?\" \"Amores...\" works well on most levels but it's not likely Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is prepared to answer the question."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Amores Perros\" is a rare breed (no pun intended) in Mexican film. It is filled with amazing performances and incredible dialogue. The movie contains three story lines that are interconnected by one event (This is why I like to call it the Mexican Pulp Fiction). The three stories have very different subjects but the three of them are amazing in their own way and somehow compliment each other.\n\nI love the way I\u00f1arritu (who later directed \"Birdman\" and \"The Revenant\") gives out some backstory of the characters without having to literally explain and let the actors and camera do its work.\n\nIn my opinion, the movie gets better each act. Starting with the first act about a poor and disjointed family, moving on with the story of a model that got injured, and finally ending with the story of a homeless man with a very interesting turn of events.\n\nThe third act is the greatest in my opinion because the characters have so much more backstory and interesting pasts.\n\nI do not give this film a 10/10 because I do feel that the ending, although very strong for the third act, does not give a closure to the second and first act specially, that is left kind of open. Still, you should definitely see this film."

Second story was the most exasperating. Third was also too boring. I don't even want to discuss the stories. This film was 154 minutes long which is very long time. And, too top it all everything is quite predictable, the only difference is that it takes quite a time to watch on the screen what we already know.\n\nThis is also one of the over-rated foreign movies, which doesn't live up to the high ratings. I'll recommend to skip it. But, anyways if you want to waste 150 minutes of your life,and you don't have anything to do that may worth your while, I can't stop you."

Each story line and character were so carefully drawn that I remained mesmerized as I experienced the overlapping and out of order narrative. I also felt as though I had been transported to worlds-within-a-world that I had never experienced before. The story is filled with infinite sadness, but leaves one with the feeling of true life authenticity, of having touched some things personal in my own life. Days after seeing the film, my mind is still filled with vivid images and my heart aches from the emotions. This is one of the few films I would give a solid 10.

The film goes back and forth in time, to intrigue the viewer and to show how what starts as small decisions or actions can have drastic consequences. The film shows characters that run the gammut of Mexican society, from the life and mysterious past of an older street person, to members of a poor/lower middle class Mexican family, to a wealthy succesful family man and beautiful young model. The main theory or life lesson being espoused is however, is said by the movie's title.\n\nThe movie shows shocking scenes of dogfighting, which is a core element of one of the stories, and which starts the avalanche of events in all the character's lives. These scenes are real (not computer generated effects), and animal lovers may be appalled by them, but the film also seems to say that the only true unconditional love people can get is from dogs.\n\nIn closing, the film does not spell out any deep answers to life, but says that you take your chances! Life and love isn't easy or pretty, and that you can be dealt a bad hand no matter what your economic or social standing is. Life isn't a book or movie with their typical, cliched happy endings, and that is what elevates this film above the rank of pure film entertainment. This is powerful, unconventional filmmaking as an artistic and social statement, and should be seen!"

        "review_title": "Love parallels violence in Inarritu's \"Amores Perros\"",
        "review_detailed_main": "Love parallels violence. \"Amores Perros\" is a typical Spanish movie; However, it's a captivating film that can be appreciated across the world. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu captures the subject of love with a complex approach and addresses the different stages common in love. In other words, the film makes the statement that \"love is laborious\". The reoccurring theme of how love parallels violence can be seen through the intertwining story lines.\n\nThe first plot focuses on a dysfunctional family that includes Octavio, his brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife, Susana. Octavio is in love with Susana & decides to save Susana from Ramiro's abuse; he achieves this by making money from dog fighting. When jealousy overcomes Octavio, he attempts to murder Ramiro in order to prove his love for Susana, & further proves the strong theme of love & violence.\n\nDaniel is a magazine editor who leaves his family for Valeria, a famous actress-model. Their bliss turns to misery when Valeria is severely injured in a car crash (driven by Octavio) and her beloved dog Richie suffers an undignified death. Again, love has been transformed into violence and hatred as Valeria's accident escalates her hostility towards Daniel. Her deep depression ruins her relationship with Daniel & ends her life.\n\nIn the third, El Chivo is a bum/assassin who cares for street dogs and has left his family to become a terrorist. During a 'job', he rediscovers his former self, and realizes the mistake he has made by leaving his family. His love for his family & daughter overwhelms him & he changes his life around & gives the money he made from his 'jobs' to his daughter, and goes on with his life.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" is a film that can be watched by audiences who can appreciate and identify the many aspects love brings. Each characters' love for one another is often masked by their hatred & violence. This is a solid film that presents many different lifestyles, and ties all characters together in one event. The problems that accumulate because of the car accident help establish the difficulties that love presents."

Basically, the movie is about people who suffer because of love. The fact that the character's live turns dark as soon as we are introduced to them makes it a little hard to empathize with them. Personally, I am more affected by drama in movies if it destroys something that is beautiful. Therefore, I think the fact that this movie is so dark actually limits how sad it can be. Nevertheless, I can appreciate how much talent there is in this film. I recommend it watching it and judging it by yourself."

Yet it contains enough tense nearly surreal moments to make us stop and think: the dog under the floor, the two brothers chained trying to reach a gun first to take each other out, the moon-like landscape of the urban periphery. Great cinema talking about the violence and desolation of everyday life."

Yes, the film is very effective, it is deftly acted, photographed and constructed, and most of its production is first rate. The script, with a few slips due to overreach--in this case one might one say overkill--is engaging. Yet, I have artistic objections to a director that sets out, as aggressively as he can, to shock me, and that is monotonous and repetitive in that fierce pursuit. Nowhere does he permit poetic, lyric, or humorous relief to change and modulate the tone. His only other resource is mild melodrama, when the dejected killer cries to his lost daughter over the phone. Not enough, and not by a long shot. Compared to its most famous predecessor, \"Los Olvidados\" by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, \"Amores Perros\" leaves quite a lot to be desired. Bu\u00f1uel could be cruel, but his humor and lyricism were superb. In Latin America, and specially in Colombia, my country, we see blood all the time in television newscasts. Awful things happen here, yes, (as well as in Sweden occasionally), but realism proves in this case to be a bad aesthetic convention. It permits no catharsis. I rated it with a 7. \"Los Olvidados\" would get a 9 or a 10."

After close analysis of the car crash and the three stories that relate to it in the film I found little to like and in my opinion it is just sensationalism. The dog fighting is nauseating in itself, and no artistic excuses can excuse it. In a quiet scene in the second part of the film where an injured woman searches for her dog beneath open floorboards and screams and struggles away at the sight of rats is relaxing to see compared with the rest. No more spoilers. As for the jerky camera throughout a large part of the film it had a nausea of its own, or was it just excited pleasure erotic or otherwise to attract the viewers into their own excitement at so much ' machismo ' indulgence ? I suggest viewers to watch Bunuel's ' Los Olvidados ' for the great Mexican film, which this is not."

He lets his beloved dog fight dogfights so that he can flee with his sister-in-law from his brutal brother and his misunderstanding mother. The second and the third story were very interesting too and they had their tragedy, the model lost her leg because she tried to find her dog which jumped in a hole in the floor. The bum lost his family and is an assassin. At the end he also looses his dogs and he has nobody except \"negro\" his new doog.\n\nThe movie was really good and very hard to describe. If I were you I would go and watch the movie - real nice"

A fa\u00e7ade of decadent modern urban life not unlike that of Los Angeles (including similar cultural and linguistic features).......an underlying set of violent themes paired with parallel expressions of love and longing.......recurrent traces of a fatalistic view of life.......the whole Machismo thing coupled with degrading portraits of women who can't get it together.......the pattern of crooked cops playing both sides against the middle.......and not the least gruesome scenes of dogfights (could have been cockfights, for that matter).\n\nIn short, all the things we love least about our neighbors to the south. No cheerful Mariachis on this flick.\n\nYet it can be said that this is no more the real Mexico than Hollywood (or South Central L.A., for that matter) is the real U.S.A. But the locale does fit the script nicely, and it comes within an expertly crafted film. In spite of it's being a bit too long, and having a few loose story threads, I liked Amores Perros far more than the disjointed Lynch and Tarantino stuff that also uses non-linear structures."

What followed was absolutely life-changing.\n\nFrom the first second of the movie, as the camera opens up on a passing black road as seen from a fast-moving car, I was subjected to a visual and narrative style of realism which I still have yet to see ever again. Nothing feels forced, every line and every expression fits, and no angle is wasted. The scenes are there, they're in your face, and they won't leave. It's frightening, and wonderfully intoxicating.\n\nIt would seem an exaggeration to call this film perfection, but this is as close to my ideal movie as I have ever seen. \"Running Scared\" comes very close, but it had too much violence for the sake of violence, and \"No Country for Old Men\" (a recent favorite) is excellent, but fundamentally different. For me, nothing explodes with meaning and frustration like the problems which the characters attempt to wrench themselves out of.\n\nI dearly hope that one day I will see a film that can top the voice with which this movie speaks to me. But I do not anticipate that happening for a very long time. This movie is worth watching because I found that it changed the way I saw the world forever. You may not find that, of course, but I would at least give it a try: at the worst, you may find that they camera is \"too shaky\" or something. But that would be your loss."

        "review_title": "Every dog has his day...",
        "review_detailed_main": "Three separate stories connected by a horrific car accident and an unexpected involvement of dogs in each of them. Why dogs?\n\nMaybe because dogs are men's best friends while men are wolves to men. It's as if men were seeking in dogs that kind of indisputable loyalty they don't find in their fellow beings. Some men deserve that loyalty more than others but they aren't always the best rewarded, hence the film's English title, and its spellbinding, furious and almost dizzyingly emotional directing. \"Amores Perros\" marks Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's debut and only a passion project could make him reach such a level of cinematic excellence immediately. That, and one hell of a talent as a storyteller.\n\nNow, is this a tribute to the canine species? We watch them so many times suffering, whimpering, being mauled, shot, massacred during painfully gruesome dogfighting sequences that they steal our empathy and let us observe the human protagonists with more neutral eyes. Indeed, while playing an intermediary role between protagonists and leitmotifs, dogs are only factors in complex relationships' equations, highlighting the best or unveiling the worst. At the end, even the most ruthless dog is innocent and the greatest harms are always from one human to another.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" embraces the unpredictability and irony of life, the way harmony lies on fragile foundations that hubris, ego, disloyalty or sin can immediately break, no matter which class you belong to. From Octavio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), a rebellious street-smart kid in love with his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche), to upper-class magazine editor Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who abandons his family to live with the stunningly beautiful supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), and finally, El Chico Many (Emilio Echevarria) a vagrant with a terrible past. These characters operate in gray areas of morality only redeemed by love (for a person and for a dog), ironically the source of all troubles.\n\nOctavio wants to leave Mexico with Susana, tired of seeing her mistreated by Ramiro (Marco P\u00e9rez) but that he's better than his bank-robbing and violent brother doesn't say much, you wonder whether he truly loves Susana or hates his brothers' guts. He sees an opportunity in Cofi, their Rottweiler who kills one of the dogfighting champ, making an enemy out of his master, Javocho, a local thug. One thing leading to another, Cofi becomes a sensation and earns a lot of money that would allow to start a new life. The incident that takes us back to the initial car crash resonates as immanent justice but how about Valeria who didn't deserve it?\n\nObviously, this is a woman who's far beyond the sordidness we've witnessed before: she's beautiful, young, loves her poodle Richie, but she did cause a man to leave his family. She probably thought she was worth it. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu shows us Daniel's boring routine with his nagging wife and noisy daughters in a way that any man would accept the idea of leaving this for a woman like Valeria: she's beautiful, she has a great body, her legs made even longer in a sublime ad poster that covers a whole building. When they reunite in a brand-new apartment (with a view on the ad), nothing can spoil their happiness. Except for a hole in the floorboard where Richie vanishes. Richie's disappearance poisons the life of a couple already undermined by handicap and unemployment. Quite a Karmic turn for Daniel.\n\nThat might be my favorite part of the film because it's the most minimalist but it speaks thousand statements about the way things can go wrong when you take them for granted and how some dreams you build can be derailed by a few ironic twists. One day, you have it all, and then you lose everything. That's the story set in the present (Octavio's was in the past) but the film seems to provide a light of hope with El Chico, a man who apparently lost everything until we learn his trend and the person that counts the most for him. The man is only a witness to the accident and his role is rather interesting, he's the only one who manages to learn a lesson from the dog he saves and if he doesn't redeem himself, the act he puts at the end when he confronts two brothers who wanted to kill each other by chaining them to a wall with a gun between them, is a right closure. Let men be wolves to men, he won't be part of it anymore.\n\nThe film was compared to \"Reservoir Dogs\" for a few similar scenes, men chained in a remote place, the back passenger bleeding in a speeding car, the word \"Dog\" itself or \"Pulp Fiction\", for the non-linear narrative. For my part, I could see another connection with a film from the same year \"Requiem for a Dream\" (Burneil and Leto could be twins) and the film does show people who lost meanings to their lives, dignity, love, and even a body part. But the film is more than a product of many influences, it's a standalone original and stylish movie and a remarkable example of Hyperlink Cinema that made I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's reputation, culminating with the humanistic \"Babel\".\n\nIt's so challenging to make movies with various destinies that affect each other, because that's the way life is, for the best or the worst, and we might have affected a few lives ourselves without noticing... not every influence is as notable as a car accident. But I\u00f1\u00e1rritu goes for the punchy way and shows these ramifications with a slightly cynical approach though he's no cynic. In fact, his statement about life is that no matter what we plan, we're only humans whose flaws precede us and if we're lucky enough, we can avoid mistakes, but whatever happens will happen because unlike dogs, we have a tendency to be blinded by our own loyalty to flawed plans. As Susana tells Octavio :\"if you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans\"."

        "review_title": "A ruthless debut leading to a legendary trilogy",
        "review_detailed_main": "An astonishing film from Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, \"Amores Perros\" packs a complex emotional wallop that rivals \"Traffic\" or Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" -- and the fact that it's I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's first film makes it even more remarkable. Its dark and disturbing--an almost surrealist tone that escalates it high above the usual film laced with carnage. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu doesn't present Mexico City as a tourist attraction with exotic locales. Written by Guillermo Arriaga, the film lies in the belly of the underworld--a rat's-eye view of a city undergoing economic upheaval. The political angle doesn't exactly leap off the screen, and it doesn't have to. But circumstances are dire--an environment where only the strong survive.\n\nStructured as a triptych, \"Amores Perros\" opens with a speeding car racing through the streets. Its backseat cargo is a wounded dog -- not the last you'll see, either. Its driver is a shrieking mess of blood, sweat and tears. His name is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), and his car is making a getaway from a dogfight gone deadly. But before we get a whiff of what precipitated it, there's a crash. A narrative rewind then takes us back a few days, to when Octavio has hatched a plan to run off with his brother's girlfriend. \"Amores Perros\" interlaces three distinct tales around this single event, and then plays fast and loose with structure and narrative to fill in the befores and afters.\n\nThere's slum kid Octavio (Bernal), who, with a friend, enters his hulking rottweiler Cofi in the local dog fights. He's also in love with his abusive brother Ramiro's (P\u00e9rez) wife (Bauche), and begs her to come away with him to the coast to open up a storefront using his dog fight winnings. Then there's the gorgeous model Valeria (Toledo) and her magazine editor lover Daniel (Guerrero) -- the aforementioned car crash acts as a terrible proving ground (for better or worse) for their romance. Finally, there's a disheveled vagrant -- El Chivo, the goat -- played by legendary Mexican character actor Echevarr\u00eda, who collects the city's homeless canines and occasionally moonlights as a hit-man.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" at 154 minutes is a heavy, prolonged story-- rich with characters and atmosphere. His characters are people with feelings and motives. They want love, money, and revenge. They not only love their dogs--but desperately depend on them. And it is clear that the lower classes are better at survival than the wealthy, whose confidence comes from their possessions, not their fortitude. It is the work of a born filmmaker-- you can sense his passion as he plunges into melodrama, coincidence, sensation, and violence.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" has much more going on in its multi-layered plot--but the less viewers know going in, the better off they're likely to be. Forewarning however: The film's portrayal of the brutal world of back alley dogfighting, and a way of life in their culture, is utterly realistic, appalling, and difficult to watch. Those averse to the sight of dead and dying canines should at the very least be prepared to cover their eyes. As with everything else in his film, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's camera doesn't flinch from the mundane cruelties of the street. Entirely apart from the remarkable narrative, \"Amores Perros\" is a triumph on virtually every conceivable front. Rodriego Prieto's cinematography is unique to each storyline.\n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu feverishly works to earn the existentialist melodrama that closes the film. He's daring you: Can you see beneath life's luridness? Admittedly, this violent, ruthless film is not going to be to everyone's taste. But for those willing to submit to its unrelenting misery, will be rewarded substantially."

It is engrossing and deeply affective. The dog theme, which loosely ties the three plot lines, is very effective at grounding the grander observations about lust, greed, corruption and fallen idealism. A climactic focal point of all three story lines, a car accident, is at the film's core. \"If you want to make Him (God) laugh, make plans.\" One of the characters delivers this line, a quotation from her grandmother, as though she were also watching the film with the audience. It sent a chill right down my spine. I was aware of the film's length, 153 minutes, but it was an awareness based in feeling full, nearly uncomfortably so. There is much to be taken from the stories and much to observe while the film is running. It is dense and deep. I will see this film again. I am sure there is hidden treasure I missed this first time. I highly recommend this film to the you, if you enjoy making your mind work at the movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "The film has been called the \"Mexican Pulp Fiction\", because it contains three distinct stories. In my humble opinion, Amores Perros is something more than that (and to avoid misunderstandings I really enjoy Tarantino's movies).\n\nIt is one of the few films in which I liked every scene or idea, a flawless work. The three stories are nicely connected to each other and the performances of all actors and actresses are fantastic. Alejandro Inarritu realistically outlines the situation of Mexican society, but his film transcends any border between the states. All in all, Amores Perros is a clever, disturbing, must-see work of art."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes great cinema is not always based on things that are easy to watch and digest. Ameros Perros is such movie where the viewer will get to witness painful things and through that pain come the art of realization. Maybe there is no other pleasant way to tell this story without making it less effective. Whichever it is the final result is a staggering piece of true cinema.\n\nAmores Perros is directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, and is the first movie of the death trilogy followed by 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). Though there is no relativity in plot between these movies the sublime and underlying similarity in style of storytelling is what binds them together. Here in Amores Perros there are 3 parallel story lines that seem very different to each other on surface but speak of a common theme all together. And at one point the characters of each story line overlaps and meets ones another at a common symbolic incident. This incident is what binds the stories together however not largely dependent on each other's success. This is one reason I called this point symbolic than crucial.\n\nStory line one follows the most painful to watch material. It's about a young man from the city low class who turns to fighting his dog in underground dog fights to earn money for his plans to get away with his unconventional girlfriend. Here you may come across the ugly trade of dog fights and the fate of dogs that goes in to them. For dog lovers this section is nightmare. Story line two is about a super model who faces an unfortunate road accident. The drama between her illegal partner and her struggle to survive takes a very different mood and rhythm from the previous story. Yet she also has a pet dog that keeps her company. The key character of story line three is a hit man. Beaten up by life and mistakes he did in the past he lives with a bunch of dogs and almost homeless. However he struggles to put things right by his daughter and for some reasons he is pushed away from his dreams.\n\nAs you may realize these three story lines are far from being common. But they are beautifully connected by dogs. The dog is a symbol of loyalty at each story and the people are symbols of disloyalty and unfaithfulness. This combination works perfectly and Amores Perros gives the viewer heavy breathing. Powerful performances, wonderful cinematography and music ads spice on top of each other without making a single story lines prominent over each other. It seems like the director has done a perfect job in phasing out the sequences and laying out a perfect ending as well. While I highly recommend this I would like to recommend 21 Grams and Babel too if you have not seeing them already. They complete one of the most satisfying trilogies of contemporary cinema."

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start off by saying that if you are in any way a bleeding heart or squeamish when it comes to brutality towards animals, dogs especially, (or just seeing loads of blood) then I suggest that you steer well clear of this film. Although there is a disclaimer saying that no animals were harmed during this film - it's still pretty graphic.\n\nThis film is heartbreaking in its realism and more than a little \"Robert Altman-ish\" in its portrayal of 3 stories literally colliding (with a brilliantly executed car chase) and intersecting.\n\nThe first story is of Octavio and Susana. Octavio discovers the fighting abilities of his brother's rottweiler, Cofi, and starts fighting him - in a bid to raise money to elope with his brother's young wife, Susana.\n\nThe second story follows Luis and Valeria. Luis leaves his wife and family to set up house with his model girlfriend Valeria, and her beloved dog Richie. Richie chases a ball into a hole in the floor and for much of the remainder of the story can be heard scuttling around the house, or is that just the rats?\n\nThe third story concerns a former revolutionary El Chivu who abandoned his family years ago and now longs to connect with his estranged daughter. He's a street bum who looks after a pack of dogs and who has become a hitman for hire.\n\nThe three stories are connected by the car chase and resultant accident. The photography was clever - the use of hand held cameras used to wonderful effect. The stories, each in their own right, are haunting - blowing out of the water, completely, the Hollywood myth of 'happy ever after'. This is a true, gritty and heartbreaking film well worth the watch, and the 2 and a half hour length."

        "review_detailed_main": "Embarrassingly derivative of other works, Amores Perros had me wondering if perhaps the filmmakers name was not perhaps a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh or Quentin Tarantino. Others may enjoy the director's technical proficiency, but they would have to have the capacity to ignore the hack-like vibe at this film's core. At times, the re-hashed vibrancy of the film had me hoping it might actually be a comment on the aforementioned filmmakers' tradition of stylized pomp, that it might pull away from its pure film-making pizazz -- but, no. Instead of substance, there lay another sequence of pure, exhilarating kinetic energy. The problem with that energy is that it focuses on characters so disagreeable, engaged in activities so repellent, that I simply could not are very much about them. However grim the outcome, the shallow characterizations made it difficult to tie any semblance of emotional commitment to them. The actors try, but ultimately fail, to flesh themselves out. The way the script functions, the inhabitants of this world are doomed to be seen as archetypes, rather than authentic humans, in instance after instance of harrowing circumstance. Then there's the overlong running time which the film struggles (and fails) to justify. Having to put up with the unrelentingly nihilistic subject matter is like repeated lashings in the face with a wet shoelace -- having to endure Amores Perros' length seems an excessive punishment to an already forgiving audience. Two-and-a- half-hours may be an acceptable running time for films that have the weight of history behind them, but this is ultimately a student exercise in how to use style to convey mood. For all its kinetic, stylized energy, this is just a one-note tragedy; a violent, expensive Spanish soap opera with an excessive running time."

Superbly acted all round, but especially noteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, a political dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in the making I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity of most current Hollywood \"product\", and to my mind ranks with a small handful of movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun') that are truly memorable and with genuine substance. This one is a winner and essential viewing for all movie lovers. A future classic."

He played a key role here.\n\nThis film is actually three stories locked together by a single crash. It is a film about rich and poor - about class. It shows the underbelly of Mexican society: those who fight dogs for money. It is painful to see in that regard as it features many dead animals. But, the fact that some have to resort to this to survive is also painful.\n\nIt also show the creme of Mexican society: a top model (Goya Toledo) who is also in the crash. her life revolves around beauty, which leads to a superficiality and breaking up a marriage. Her dog gets trapped under a floor and this leads to tragic consequences for her.\n\nEmilio Echevarr\u00eda (Babel, Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n) plays both sides. He was from the creme of society, but gave up his family and wealth to become a guerrilla, as he felt that was doing what was right for them. Now, losing everything, he roams the streets with his dogs.\n\nThe theme of riches and poverty, and family is strong in this film as is, of course, the love of dogs. It is all interwoven in a film that never bores you. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is a master of storytelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Amores Perros' tells three stories that interconnect. The first story is called 'Octavio and Susana'. Susana is married to Ramiro, who works at a supermarket. To provide for them he robs stores. Ramiro's brother, Octavio, lives with them. When Susana accidentally lets Ramiro's dog Cofi out, Cofi kills Poncho - a fighter dog owned by Jarocho. Realizing Cofi's capabilities, Octavio starts dog fighting with Cofi. (Many of these scenes will be too sensitive for dog lovers, as it was for me, even if shown merely for a few seconds). Octavio is secretly in love with Susana and - with Susana being ill-treated by Ramiro - Octavio asks Susana to run away with him. There are a few unexpected twists, though.\n\nThe second story is called 'Daniel and Valeria'. Caught in a loveless marriage, Daniel is having an affair with model Valeria. When he eventually leaves his wife and buys an apartment for him and Valeria so they can finally be together, a car accident leaves Valeria seriously injured, causing her sponsors to cancel her modelling contract. With tension rising between them - being aggravated by Valeria's dog being stuck under the floor boards! - their newfound freedom proves to be anything but the happy life they were hoping for.\n\nThe third story is 'El Chivo and Maru'. El Chivo might look like a hobo - with a love for dogs - but there is more to him than meets the eye. We discover him and his wife separated years ago, telling their daughter, Maru, he was dead, but now El Chivo is trying to make contact with Maru again. As it turns out, El Chivo is a hitman, and pursuing his next target.\n\nAll these stories and characters interlink throughout the film. Prepare yourself, though, this is no feel-good movie. On the contrary, it is quite depressing, but it is a good film. Each story takes unexpected turns, and the film captured my attention from beginning to end."

Each struggle with love and loss, illusion vs. reality, as well as loneliness/isolation.\n\nAlejandro Gonzales Innaritu is a brilliant director and producer. Amores Perros is a film that can be viewed multiple times and interpreted slightly differently each time. The script is also so well written that the characters do and say just enough to tell the story, but leave enough vagueness to make you question the depth of their character and their motivations.\n\nEach story is accompanied by a parallel story involving man's best friend, el perro, the dog. All characters are accompanied by dogs, who mirror their life experiences in some aspect, as well as physical appearance (if you look closely enough). A perfect fit for the Spanish and English titles of the movie. You can tell every single little detail of this movie has been well thought out and carefully crafted. An excellent watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "A movie that stands out in Mexico. What a surprise. I totally agree with it being an intelligent attempt to reach super production levels, of course, stealing ideas of Film Noir with no remorse. This comes as proof that Mexico, if attempting to ever reach a deeper level in cinema, have to rely in items that sell : Cruelty, blood, gore, etc... commercial items. nowhere good enough for a well-crafted story. \"If you can't develop a good story, splash the screen with blood and gore and thee shall triumph\" seems to be Inarritu's philosophy. He was great at radio, he should stick to that gift.\n\nDefinitely it's a good movie compared with all the trash Mexico renders year after year, but this is also proof that if you are influential in the industry and have connections, it doesn't matter if you have a tad of talent, Inarritu is living proof.\n\nThere are amazing talents in Mexico, but if they're stories are well crafted, it doesn't matter if they haven't sold their souls to our monopoly (people in mexico know who I'm talking about). For international movies, Amores perros is but another piece of film noir gore rendering tape.\n\nSexo Pudor y lagrimas, another example but of a different kind. in general I don't think Mexico will ever acquire the level we once had with comedy films like those with Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Joaquin Pardave, just to mention some. This is a shame, I'm twenty-six and can see that already.\n\nMexico, wake up, we're still swimming in mud when it comes to film industry. Let's wait and see what other piece of c**p is rendered by our corrupted industry. Even more of a shame it s to acknowledge that this movie will become a school that will finish killing every instinct of a good movie with young filmmakers who get to break into Mexican cinema.\n\nAny objections, there you have my e-mail address so be my guest, I welcome all feedback."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amores perros is the first feature film from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, one of my favourite directors. Birdman is one of my favourite films, and I really love his depressing style, I use style for lack of a better term. I don't think this film is as good as birdman, but I think this is my second favourite film of his. I loved almost everything about it.\n\nThree different stories are told in amores perros all representing different elements of life. My favourite storyline involved Octavio, a young man similar age to me, who falls in love with his brother's wife. I won't say too much as this film is very plot driven, all I'll say is please don't get put off by a love triangle. Another story I loved followed an old man, El Chivo or Emilio Echevarr\u00eda. His story is extremely emotionally powerful which I really appreciated. The weakest story is still great, but it is easily the worst in my opinion. It follows a young model, Valeria, and her new boyfriend Daniel. I don't want to get into details about it as the elements I don't enjoy are curtail to the plot.\n\nThe presentation is great for the most part but a few moments were presented cheesily. These moments are mostly in Valeria's story, but they pop up here and there in the other stories as well. This is such a big issue to me because of how well presented most of this film is. There are also a few conveniences.\n\nTechnically this is a pretty good film. The sound mixing was awesome, but the sound design was a bit lacking. The cinematography was fantastic, I loved how the shooting style changed when the storyline changed, during Octavio's story the camera is hand-held, everything is shot very close up and the editing is very choppy. During Valeria's story the camera was steady, more wide shots were used and the shots were longer as well. It's a real testament to the writing and editing to make a 2 hour 34 minute film feel completely engaging the entire time. I also loved the use of reflections, I don't know why I love the use of reflections in films but I do, I loved it in black swan and I love it in amores perros.\n\nGael Garcia Bernal was brilliant and he's quite hot near the end of the film if I do say so myself. All the performances were actually really great, I loved Gael the most though, and like I said, I relate to his character the most as well so maybe that's why I think everything to do with his character are the best parts of the film.\n\nSo many themes are explored, helped by telling multiple stories from different walks of life. This is a really dense movie that I would love to analyse one day. There's just so much going on and so much that I know I haven't picked up on. Some of the main themes explored are Selfishness, how one's actions can effect others, death, abusive relationships, parenthood, manipulation, animal cruelty and love. I could go on, in fact I will go on after my inevitable rewatches.\n\nI highly recommend amores perros to anyone who can deal with a lot of dogs being killed. Other than that this is one of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's best and most accessible films."

I prefer to believe that in parts of the world that are hotbeds for activism - and specifically where there is a dense population with a marked class divide, all those qualities that are picked out as deliberate efforts to make a political statement are actually just part of the social geography. We might wonder at the abjection during the first story and rue its contrast to the affluence of the second, but at the end of it all, the characters were all caught in circumstances that had little to do with politics and almost everything to do with emotional consequences. Amores Perros wasn't making a point, in my opinion, it was just telling three different stories about tough love in Mexico and linking them and telling them very cleverly.\n\nLoved It."

Life with the opportunity to make money and settle with a girl, life as a married man settling with his mistress and life as an old man with regrets, lots of love and disdain he didn't actually decided what to do with.\n\nThe only flaw I could find in this movie is thus the fact those 3 stories are not really related. It's more 3 separated stories than three chapter making a full-fledged tale. Now I\u00f1\u00e1rritu shoots all this wonderfully, everything is so well tuned-in, accurately acted and edited together, that you can't but be fascinated by the flow of images and the variety of emotions they come to display.\n\nDid I\u00f1\u00e1rritu topped himself with Amores Perros? 21 Grams and Babel also explore and (over)use the possibilities of disjointed story lines. What's more, pathos became THE emotion to put behind the shop window, so on the whole it looks like a lot of talent going on the cheap and easy ploy, instead of trying harder to give us better and better movies each time."

        "review_detailed_main": "This may be a great film, but I simply could not stomach the dog fighting aspect of the story and had to stop watching after 30 min. This is really saying something since I have watched countless \"bad\" movies and read bad books, and always finish them despite not really enjoying the experience. Maybe if I could have held on, I would have been able to take something way from the movie in total, but as a dog owner who has lost dogs to natural causes, seeing cruelty towards dogs was too unsettling to permit me to continue watching.\n\nWhile the dog fighting is simulated and the director cuts away from it quickly, it is still very disturbing, especially in the impression it leaves. Having read the plot synopsis, the dog fighting plays a lesser role in the other 2 vignettes of the movie, but I would not recommend anyone with a dog to even try and watch this. Certainly dog fighting is a problem, and it is more culturally accepted outside of the USA. I don't need it depicted on the screen however, even as a vehicle to carry a different storyline. My suggestion, especially for anyone who loves animals, is to read a plot summary and not put yourself through the film. Maybe pick another of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's films as an alternative."

The story is real and violent, Tarantino goes for violence, but it is more movie violence. this film has moments that are truly hard to watch,anybody who loves dogs will feel truly appalled at times. The use of dogs in the film is crucial, they play an important part in the films ultimate message. I don't reveal any plot points, one should experience this film not knowing what to expect, all i can say is that it is one of those films that will stay with you long after you leave the theater."

Classified as a thriller, but in my opinion, the elements of the thriller are negligible in relation to the drama, a story so convincing and powerful that the film is, for the most part, painful to watch. Great, somewhat complicated directing, and excellent characterization for whom both the high-quality script and the superb performances of the cast are equally deserving. Although the film's theme and genre are not my cup of tea, it has left quite a strong impression and definitely deserves cult status and awards won.

Acting, script and directing by a great Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu were all top notch. The movie is pretty bloody and gritty and the times, and it never started to be predictable or boring.\n\nOverall, \"Amores Perros\" is a very good movie.

How do I have to see it? Inspired by Tarantino or the kind of movies that inspires Tarantino? Who knows but it certainly has the Tarantino-effect. What first looks like a mess (all different shoots that can't be combined at first) falls into one piece, the perfect puzzle and let me tell you this : most of the Hollywoodscenarists better watch some movies like these, they can learn a lot. It has no sense to tell the story, just see it as a modern fairy tale in where the rich and the poor find each other in a world of crime. Sole reason why I disliked the movie a bit was because of the many cruel views of bleeding dogs (dogfighting is a bit the focal point in here), but that apart I can say : what a brilliant movie, give us more of these!!!"

        "review_title": "The beginning of the Rennaissance of Mexican cinema!",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"You and your plans. You know what my grandmother used to say? If you want to make God laugh... tell Him your plans.\"\n\nAmores Perros was Mexican director, Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu's directorial debut, and he really entered with a bang winning several awards for this acclaimed film. Along with the success of Guillermo del Toro (El Espinazo del Diablo) and Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien), these trio of directors began the renaissance movement in Mexico during the beginning of the century. Today they are all directing big budget movies in Hollywood, but it wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for this gem of a movie that put Mexican cinema in the international map again. Gael Garcia Bernal was also a revelation in this film and has become a well known actor after his performance here and in Y Tu Mama Tambien. Having watched I\u00f1arritu's later films, 21 Grams and Babel, I kind of knew what to expect from Amores Perros. He has a way of interconnecting several stories and playing with linear chronological events, and Amores Perros seems to be the film that started this trait. I wish I would've seen this film before the others because this feels like a more complete film, but I have grown a bit tired of the director's stylish and depressing vision of the world. This is still a great film with some powerful scenes, although the movie does suffer from being a little too long (150 minutes) and I thought one of the stories (Valeria and Daniel's) wasn't up to the same level of the other two and I could have done without it. Having said that I still believe this is one of his best films and definitely Mexico's best film. It deserves all the awards it has received and should've won an Oscar for best foreign picture if it didn't have to compete against Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The script from Guillermo Arriaga was also gripping and realistic. In my opinion I\u00f1arritu's best work has been done alongside Arriaga.\n\nThe film centers on three interconnected stories that overlap with each other in a terrible car accident. The first story focuses on Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche), with whom he's secretly in love. His brother, Ramiro (Marco Perez) treats her terribly, but Octavio promises to take care of her if she runs away with him. In order to make money, Octavio gets involved with dog fighting, since his dog happens to be a great fighter. When one of the dog fights goes wrong, Octavio has to escape from a group of gang leaders that eventually cause the traffic accident. The second story (and my least favorite one) centers on the relationship between a successful model, Valeria (Goya Toledo) and magazine editor named Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who has abandoned his family to live with her. And finally the third story introduces us to a bum named El Chivo (Emilio Echeverr\u00eda) who also works as a contracted killer. All these characters also seem to have special relationships with their dogs.\n\nAs the title suggests dogs do play a very important role in this film, not only because the accident is produced in the first place due to a dog fight, but because I\u00f1arritu compares the violence in dog fights with the brutality and savagery of humanity. There are several themes and layers to this film, but I\u00f1arritu knows his craft and delivers a very brutal and realistic film. Amores Perros is an ambitious movie with several scenes that will stick with you and some powerful performances from Gael Garcia Bernal and Emilio Echeverr\u00eda. I\u00f1arritu is very familiar with the brutality in human nature and isn't afraid to show the dark side of humanity along with the search for true love. Amores Perros is an emotionally involving movie with a gripping humanistic story, but I think I\u00f1arritu should shift gears for his next movie and focus on another aspect of humanity instead. This film was fresh and innovative, but his tricks have grown old after 21 Grams, Babel, and Biutiful."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was talking with someone a while ago, saying how Babel is a bland film which offers far too little for its length beyond schematic critique to a rather obvious conception of contemporary flaws. How 21 Grams overwhelmed me as too depressive for its own sake and had its own air of artificiality. I mean, that's an obvious problem you might get when trying to string together stories and embody them in an integral whole. The someone I mentioned above was quite dismissive of my thoughts, claiming the genius of Inarritu was indubitable in both films, and asked me the most obvious question of all: \"Why do yo go to see Inarritu films if you dislike them so?\". My answer was inevitably superficial, for I said \"Because I like to believe\".\n\nIt's funny in a way, this feeling of going back int time; he remains absolutely the same, his work is just as loaded with bold, significant statements, but only in Amores perros have I encountered the authenticity I crave. Maybe it's got something to do with faces, with the fact that his last two movies employ famous faces to which I cannot relate the gritty realism which Inarritu tries to convey. Not that I'm saying Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Sean Penn or Benicio Del Toro are bad actors; it's just that their well known.\n\nAmores perros is a gritty, realistic and authentic film which dissects the sour, bi-polar reality of contemporary society. Segmented as all of Inarritu's films in several stories, it introduces each of them in similar style with the oh-so-beautifully- romanticized Hable Con Ella (2002), with a black screen bolstering two character names in large typeface. The three stories are vaguely interrelated, tangentially. They portray the fate of an impoverished, lower class working family in Mexico, a love story between a model and a magazine editor and the in-between tale starring a homeless assassin, ex-teacher, ex-rebel, ex-convict. Inarritu's social conviction of inequity and unfair distribution are quite obvious, but his view does not infer the well-being of the upper class. The dogs, central motive of the film in some regards, are used as a means to gain wealth in the ghettos of Mexico, while in the central districts they obsessively plague a distinctly alienated and paranoid layer of society.\n\nInarritu's films are so pedantic in matters of style and structure, that they offer great ability of insight. I do not necessarily enjoy this, as it goes into an awkward level of schematic realism which I despise. While it is bearable in Amores perros, it is not in his second and third ventures. The Mexican director also has a rather morbid proclivity towards worst case scenarios, taking the already dim reality portrayed and bending it to extreme levels. Again, while I managed to live with it in Amores perros, I could not in Babel and 21 Grams. Straining reality too much does not make reality more real - on the contrary.\n\nThere exist therefore several reasons why I shy away from Innaritu's approach to film-making. I like to avoid the overwhelming and insurmountable abstractions of class. Perhaps that's white privilege talking, but I'm not trying to deny the existence of social structures and challenges, just pointing out that their artistic representation treads a fine line between bleak and unbearably bleak - for its own sake and shock value, more so than any insightful commentary. Amores perros gets the balance right and I recommend it wholeheartedly to all cynics - for I was one myself."

The triptych narrative tells the story of several individuals who are thrust into dramatic situations brought upon by the seemingly inconsequential act of a dog named Cofi. The plot is intense, thrilling, harsh, violent, thought provoking, poetic, innovative and cathartic.

I personally felt that what Octavio was doing absolutely wrong and appreciate the way Susana did. She kept telling Octavio that she loves her husband no matter what!. Daniel's character was just perfect for the setting. El Chivo's character was the one which made more deep message for me. Valeria - the model's change after the accident and her crazy attraction for her pet dog - is very chilling because of the way the story was set. Amores Perros has meaning for any one. It makes one introspect. A must watch and my rating 10/10."

However, slowly the connections between these three stories become clear through the director's clever use of flashbacks. The way the three stories interconnect is ingenious and as the story dramatically unfolded it left me stunned.\n\nThis riveting film kept me glued to my seat and that says a lot; it is quite long at two and a half hours.\n\nI found the performances by all the actors outstanding, the hand-held cinematography some of the best I have ever seen, whilst the pulsating musical score that fitted the mood of the film was just perfect.\n\nI rarely give a full score to films, but in this case I award it an outstanding 10/10."

The acting was great and some of the camera work was pretty nifty as well. The film is basically in three parts. The first is perhaps the most violent and is probably my favourite. The second is arguably the weakest and yet has a couple of laugh-out moments and is very tragic. The third is very intriguing and basically brings the story together.

The impossibility only swells or is brought to life after the accident when their \"love\" is exposed, vulnerable and uncertain. Acting is impeccable; viewers will be on edge for all 154 minutes of the film. Editing is superb; fast cuts and contrasts of colors bring to light the constant battle for a peace and equilibrium that cannot exist: they just remain contrasted. This movie is a must-see for its artistic achievements in story and presentation."

Alejandro Gonzales Inarittu shows us the brutality yet beauty of Mexico city in this 3 part story that should absolutely be viewed more than once to get the clues of how everything starts to connect with each other. You will be surprised when watching it more than once."

        "review_detailed_main": "The structure of Amores Perros does remind one of Pulp Fiction, but this film has a lot more substance than Pulp Fiction. It also reminded me of Red, by Kieslowsi. Luckily, this movie is good and original and provocative in its own right. The acting is magnificent, particularly Mr. Echeverria as El Chivo. The cinematography and camera work by Rodrigo Prieto is awesome, the production design by Brigitte Broch perfect, the direction excellent, the music great. Technically dazzling. The animal training is probably the best I've ever seen, unless a lot of dogs died during the making of this movie ;). However, I felt that the writing was a weak spot. It was effective, and in some moments, even inspired, but not particularly rich or nuanced. And if only the episode of Richi the dog would have been shorter... it went on too long. Yet Amores Perros is a richly rewarding experience. Its darkness is extremely refreshing. It has a strong point of view that does not pander to the audience and it sticks with it to the end. The audience may be discomforted by the rawness of this movie but if you stick with it, you will be moved by it. Felicidades Negro! Si lees esto por favor mandame un e-mail que tengo algo para ti."

        "review_detailed_main": "Amores Perros-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Written by: Guillermo Arriaga Jordan, Starring: Emilio Echevarria, Gael Garcia Bernal, Goya Toledo, Alvaro Guerrero, Vanessa Bauche, Jorge Salinas.\n\nInarritu's breakthrough feature detailing the lives of three people that become intertwined in Mexico City each connected with their dogs. A helpless romantic and street thug (Bernal) gets into the business of dog fighting. A supermodel (Toledo)'s pooch gets stuck under the floorboards of the apartment she shares with her lover and a hit-man (Echevarria) rescues a rotweiler while completing his newest assignment.\n\nThe best part about the picture is how well Inarritu and Arriaga show the stories and how each effects the next or the previously mentioned. They connect the stories loosely without getting the characters too associated with each other, henceforth showing us the irony of life connections. They bring the characters together in an intricate way that confuses us because of its simplicity. Inarritu points out that we overthink a lot and the way he brings everything together with the intricacy he does is something that is left out of Hollywood films.\n\nEach of the characters is written in a manner that brings them to light in a way that does not expose neither hero nor villain. Echevarria's character can easily be interpreted as a villain at first glance but his sentimental reactions to certain situations make us think about it more in depth. Toledo's character is the most normal and seems to have normal problems, which makes her a protagonist in some eyes, but her flaws are too many and her character is clingy and gets annoying. Bernal's character is a street punk involved in dog fighting and gang violence, but his reasons are out of love for a girl.\n\nThere is no hero and there is no villain, that is what gives the film its dynamite. There is something to love and something to hate about each character. Who we side with is not important because each character has something to add to our own set of moral values. The grittiness and the violence likely will not appeal to everyone, but Inarritu is a respectful director who understands the life of his characters and their situations but does not judge them. He respectfully leaves that for us to decide and does not contradict any of his well-established credibility."

In a sense, the good guy wins. It's just that throughout the film you would never come to relate to him as the good guy, nor with the bad guys as being the bad guys. And that is the beauty of this film: it lures you into relating with people, such that you see the world through their own eyes, and understand how they perceive their actions as being right. It's only after the credits roll down, and you consider what you've just seen, and how it all interlinks that you come to understand the deep moral undertones of this film, and who was really representing the good, the bad and the ugly."

It makes you feel uncomfortable a lot of the time and you get stressed with the characters when the story calls for it. This film shows just some of the everyday chaos people can go through in Mexico City, and the dogs change with the people who own them. The people are only as good or as corrupt as the people who care for them; keeping that in mind, Amores Perros makes for an impactful experience that doesn't leave the viewers unaffected.\n\nThis film is simply worth a watch. It's not a rosie-painted Hollywood flick; this is international art-house cinema that has a lot to say about human circumstance and city life of the underprivileged."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie was very shocking but at the same astounding. It gives it audience an inside view of the corruption and the life's of different people that live in Mexico. The translation of the title Amores perro's would be funny which is dogs love but then again translated in a different meaning it would be Life's a bitch. Very interesting title one would think. I feel like the movie is not only about how life a bitch but through several characters in the film but we get to experience how people in different classes live. If you actually pay attention closely, all the characters, in the film have dogs, as pets. Which, to me, tells me, why perhaps the tile is what it is AMORES PERROS. A dog's life is pretty simple but compare to a persons, it complicated and I feel like having both together it helps balance out each other out. Even though each of the characters has a certain problem, they always have their dogs to which they turn to comfort. Another thing I noticed was that even though the dogs were never in the best conditions, they never turn against their owners. Although like people they turn against their own kind, which make it another main plot in the film. Throughout the movie we see how these characters, instead of turning to their love ones in tough circumstance, they stab each other in the back, and for example Octavio falls for Susan his brother wife and then turn against him. Secondly Valeria falls for a man that is taken and he return against his wife and children. Finally we have Chivo who paid to kill a business man whom later we discover that his own brother is who wants him dead. We live in a world where people have no limit to their own selfishness to achieve one own personal goal. However, what makes this film even more mesmerizing is how each of these characters interacts with the others life somehow."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Amores Perros\", which literally translated means \"Tough Loves\" or \"Love is a Bitch\" is a play on words in my opinion. The term \"perro\" although it literally means dog, in Mexico it is used to depict a tough situation or to describe a ruthless person. This is a reoccurring theme throughout the movie as every character faces corrupt people or difficult situations which give the audience a sense that at least in the movie story, life is indeed a bitch. The intertwining of this \"life is tough\" theme with the inclusion of dogs in every story is how the title becomes so meaningful and such a creative and artistic definition of the movie itself.\n\nThe movie portrays three different stories, seemingly unrelated until the scene of the car crash. In each story the theme is one of love and human relations, but not typical \"happy ending\" kind of relations. There is infidelity, domestic violence, money problems, and treason within the relationships portrayed in the movie. As the director explains in the short \"Making of Amores Perros\", this movie shows that everybody encounters suffering; the rich, the powerful, the poor and even the famous hurt.\n\nThe plot of the movie is quite complex, and with each scene the director gives the viewer a little more information but always retaining some key elements. This provokes the undivided attention of the viewer as this is not a movie you can watch casually. The way the stories link together via the car accident is excellent, not only in the context of the plot, but also in the filming techniques and the different points of view (POV) utilized to film that scene. The film utilizes very artistic and unique filming techniques, from the scenes in which the POV is that of the dog, Cofi, to the hand-held camera shots that make the movie feel more \"real\".\n\nI highly recommend this movie because of the complex and entertaining plot, the great acting by the entire cast, the innovative filming techniques, and perhaps most importantly, because it paints a very accurate picture of the complexities of life in Mexico City."

The three micro-stories (Octavio and Susana, Daniel and Valeria, El Chivo y Maru) are all connected by a single car crash, but it takes the whole movie to piece together the puzzle of how they are all connected. I think that the reason I like this movie so much is the raw emotion that is portrayed. It is definitely not an easy one to watch, and at times I had to close my eyes because I simply couldn't stand the images that flooded the screen, but I couldn't stop watching. It's just so real \u2013 the love, the frustrations, the disappointment, the small moments of happiness. Even with all the unfortunate events, the film doesn't leave you empty or depressed. I'm not quite sure why, but there is a sense that yes, life and love are difficult, but that it is okay to struggle and hurt and cry."

        "review_detailed_main": "As this film opens Octavio and his friend Jorge are driving through Mexico City with a seriously injured dog on the back sea of their car. They are being chased by armed men in a pick up before crashing into a car driven by model Valeria. The crash is witnessed by 'El Chivo' an apparently homeless man.\n\nThe film that follows is broken down into three sections. The first, set prior to the crash, shows how Octavio got involved with dog fighting and plans to use the money he earns to run away with his sister in law. In the second section we see Valeria moving into a flat owned by her lover; he has just abandoned his wife and family. Following the accident she is badly injured and shortly after she returns home with her leg in a brace her dog disappears into a hole in the living room floor... she can hear it moving about but can't see where it has gone. Finally in the third sequence we follow 'El Chivo' and learn that he is an ex-revolutionary who now works as a hitman who lives with various stray dogs he has rescued.\n\nThis film certainly won't be for everybody due to the scenes of animal cruelty. It must be stated that these scenes don't contain real cruelty but they look realistic and are likely to disturb even if you aren't a dog lover. The central story is clearly linked by the dog motif and interestingly contrasts the lives of three different people in Mexico City; the successful; the working poor and the homeless. While not obviously stated there is also a theme of disloyalty; many key characters are having affairs and few seem to worry about others feelings... only the killer El Chivo is really sympathetic as he cares for his dogs and hopes to atone for abandoning his now adult daughter when she was two. The film isn't plot heavy, it could be said there is little plot to speak of; instead we get a character driven story. It is as though we've been invited to watch their lives for a little while either side of a life changing event. The cast did a really impressive job making me believe I was watching real people; this was helped by the superb direction of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for anybody looking for a gritty slice of life drama.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the film in Spanish with English subtitles."

        "review_detailed_main": "Get ready to Fast Forward. The first 50 minutes are great in every way. Then, we get thrown into nonsense about some stupid super-model & her ridiculous dog Richie & her dim-witted married lover. Everything that happens in the next 45 minutes is NONSENSE. They both have fine-to-great jobs but they can't seem to afford or understand how to do anything half-way intelligently. The can't even a afford a decent doctor. If Mexicans are this stupid & their doctors that bad, no wonder many Mexicans prefer to live in a US prison than to live in Mexico City. The only defense you can make for the middle episode is that it must be a surreal statement on the stupidity of the very concept of a \"super-model\". Unfortunately, it is surreal how bad it is & how amateurishly heavy-handed the symbolism is. If they re-release this film with the entire 2nd episode removed, I might give this 8 or 9 stars. It may seem harsh to give it only 2 when only 1/3rd of the film stinks, but when you release a film with 45 minutes of NONSENSE in the middle, you lose credibility & respect."

The stories are interconnected brilliantly and woven together to put together this masterpiece. Some people might find few scenes disturbing so viewer discretion is advised. For all its sensationalism, however, this is also a very moral film, with all its characters inexorably heading towards the fates they bring upon themselves - it's a brilliant portrait of the dog beneath the human skin. The movie is very well supported by all the actors be their role only be with out uttering a word. On the technical front the slick editing and the camera work is amazing. A must watch."

        "review_title": "A Bitchin' Film!",
        "review_detailed_main": "This Mexican film, apparently set in the state of Pueblo, tells three modern stories of life in a nation and world where money increasingly serves as the arbiter of `success.' The threads involve such disparate elements as dog-fighting, bank robbery, high-fashion modeling, magazine editing, and daytime TV. These are tied together by dogs, a high-speed car crash, and the character of El Chivo, a former Marxist guerilla who abandoned an upper middle class existence to fight the grimy war for social justice, but ultimately had to settle for the occasional contract hit on a member of the capitalist elite. Amores Perros is translated on screen as \"Love's a Bitch,\" but the title is also a homonym of \"Amor Esperas,\" roughly \"Love Hopes.\" This must be intentional, but I found little honest hopefulness in this film. Whether in the barrio or uptown, we are presented a relentlessly dog-eat-dog world seldom touched by elevating elements like religion, art, or family celebrations. It is a world of diversions, such as sex, television, renting a movie, or buying a new car. Ever-present dogs alternately comfort or snatch up the remains (when they're not killing each other).\n\nThe acting is uniformly excellent, and the film's gritty feel and directorial style follow a path blazed by Steven Soderbergh -- most impressive for first-time director Alejandro Gonzales I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. One place where inexperience manifests is the film's length -- it didn't have to be 2.5 hours long. Otherwise, if you can stand more than a bit of violence -- and the bloody aftermath of violence with the (faked) dog-fighting -- this is a beautifully rendered and sobering view of human relations in a desperately poor country at the start of the New Millenium."

        "review_detailed_main": "Melancholy and tragedy have always formed the core of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's oeuvre, or so I've been told. This assertion arises from my own experience with his filmography. His films delved into profound themes while immersing audiences in visceral experiences, thanks in part to Inarritu's collaboration with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.\n\nInarritu's debut, Amores Perros, brims with confidence and a profound empathy for its characters. It fearlessly delves into their struggles with dashed expectations and social disconnection. While the film's narrative hinges on a car crash that intertwines the lives of its characters, each character's story stands as a separate entity, offering opportunities for individual analysis that deconstructs their essence. Inarritu and his writers give each character ample screen time to convey the relationships that drive their lives, underscoring their significance to the narrative and the profound impact of their experiences.\n\nInarritu aimed to depict the crushing weight of life's challenges and our resilience in the face of adversity. Amores Perros explores themes of unrequited love, regret, and personal loss, infusing the film with emotional depth and avoiding narrative stagnation by offering diverse perspectives on its central themes.\n\nWhile I didn't personally connect with the characters on an empathetic level, I admired the film's ability to evoke passionate emotions, even if it leaned towards pessimism. I remained intrigued by the characters' journeys, curious to see how they would navigate their circumstances and whether they would succumb to life's hardships or find the strength to overcome them. Amores Perros may not be a flawless masterpiece, but it marked a significant breakthrough for Inarritu, showcasing his confident and impactful storytelling early in his career. It stands as a testament to the beauty and power of his evolving filmography."

Pretty damn twisted don't you think? So why was it acceptable to do that to the dogs in Amores perros? Dogs are very much like children they love and look up to their trusted caretakers. Yet the trusting dogs in this film are being abused for the entertainment of humans, not to mention their lives were at risk. How is this ethical for any living creature?\n\n\"No animals were harmed in the making of this movie\"? By whose definition? However dogs were in fact tranquilized for the death scenes. Although the dogs were \"unharmed\", tranquilization is not allowed under the AHA (American Humane Association)Guidelines for the Safety of All Animals in Filmed Media. AHA believes that tranquilization of an animal is a risk that they do not recommend for the purposes of film-making. Also, AHA's Guidelines are not utilized in Mexico. For these reasons, AHA has rated the film \"Questionable\". If this type of treatment is inappropriate for a human being (brutally being tossed around in the back seat of a car while tranquilized) it should not be done to animals either."

        "review_detailed_main": "There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles. Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.\n\nEl Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function. With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments. Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.\n\nThese two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman. If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left, happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.\n\nThere is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious."

The premise of the film is to present the story of 3 characters intertwined by a particular event; we see how this event has changed their lives over the years and how they remember with feelings the actions that led to it, whether good motives, vain or simple daily decisions, now must live with their hard experience. In Spanish we use the slang ''Perro'' to refer to something hard, difficult or complex, and the film portrays very well the meaning of its title through the beautiful narrative and history it possesses, realistic, emotional and in touch with the modernity of 2000. A unique and interesting work that presents one of the best cinematographic works of Latin America."

        "review_title": "A film as open-ended and enigmatic as its title",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Amores Perros\" is a three-vignette film that's not so much concerned about creating a harmonic epiphany among its three plot lines, but rather it aims for compelling stories with a brutally honest portrayal of life, love, sin and redemption. Getting a unified message out of the film is about as difficult as translating its title.\n\nLiterally translated the title doesn't make much sense, but \"amores\" translates to loved ones or while \"perros\" literally means dogs but is also an obvious pejorative for lowly people such as criminals. The title can also be broken into \"Amor es Perros\" which means \"Love's a Bitch.\" All of these are fitting for the film and their multitude is appropriate considering the open- ended nature of the truths the film preaches.\n\nDirector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga give us three stories from Mexico City that are biblical in nature, each named for the two focal characters of the given story. All the stories deal with violence in some way, crime, love and lastly, each has a vital connection to dogs. Each story is as complicated as human beings ought to be portrayed in film. The characters are people of great love and passion, but with great capacity for error and sin. The dogs in their lives serve as instigators of conflict, distractions, sources of comfort and more, taking the emotion of these difficult stories to the next level.\n\n\"Octavio y Susana\" is about Susana, a young married woman with a baby who lives with her abusive criminal husband, Ramiro, and her brother-in-law Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), who keeps asking her to run away with him. Octavio trains the family dog, Cofi, to fight and wins money that he uses to support her and convince her to leave Ramiro.\n\n\"Valeria y Daniel\" is about a supermodel, Valeria, who is having an affair with Daniel, a businessman married with children. Daniel buys them an apartment announcing he's leaving his wife when a horrible car accident caused by the characters of the first story puts Valeria in a wheelchair. Both the incident and the disappearance of their dog, Ritchie, under the floorboards of the apartment tears at their relationship.\n\n\"El Chivo y Maru\" is given to us in bits and pieces throughout the first two but eventually gets its own focus at the end. El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) is the film's most complicated character. Seen in the beginning as a homeless man with a half dozen dogs who also doubles as an assassin, we learn that he left his wife and daughter to be a guerrilla fighter and landed in prison for 20 years, at which point he wanted his daughter to believe he was dead. After he was let out, the man who captured him gave him a place to stay and employed him as an assassin. During the story he tries to carry out a job while gathering the courage to see his daughter again.\n\nThe summaries might be long, but grasping the compelling circumstances, complication and depth of each story is essential to understanding what \"Amores Perros\" is trying to do. The stories are meant to show us the many facets of life and human nature. The film is not trying to find that one common denominator, but the several. We're supposed to experience internally somehow that connection that makes all of the film's difficult stories clear, not be lectured on it by the filmmakers.\n\n\"Amores Perros\" is not a film for people looking for cathartic satisfaction from movies. There is no moment of feeling \"at one\" with the film or that pleasant feeling when you feel all the loose ends are tied up. It's also one that animal-lovers should be careful with. There's a lot of suggested animal violence -- dogs that appear to be bloody and or dying. It's a tragic and beautiful (in the literary sense) comparison to the brutality of human nature in the film, but it's not one that's easy to handle.\n\nMost people, however, will appreciate the great storytelling and intensely interesting characters and events in this 2.5-hour film.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

No, it was the film that was the problem. 3 vaguely connected stories which other than the 1st one, I found simply boring. The only positive were the young actors in the first story who gave credible performances which went well with the decent storyline.\n\nI am not easily offended but found the treatment of animals in this film difficult to watch. I've read the \"defence\" of this - that there were vets on sight and the dogs were \"only\" drugged to look like they were dead, so only in fact sleeping. But what on earth are we doing drugging dogs for human entertainment? I found it completely excessive and frankly surprising that such treatment of animals is allowed.\n\nBut overall, I go back to the original point which is that the stories had too little of a connection to make them relevant to each other and that all but the first lacked, in my opinion, a decent storyline. So it was 2.5 hours of long, unpleasant viewing."

It could've been done in a better way, and therefore in my opinion it's not justified to show something so graphic for 90% of your movie when it's not even clever. I could've tolerated this movie if it was shorter but the way it drags on is what truly makes it insufferable for me. Listen if you like this movie then great, I really don't care, but this is my opinion and I'm never watching this again. It felt like a huge waste of time, especially because all the characters were so unlikeable and hard to empathize with at all. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone because everything it attempts to execute can be found done more creatively and effectively in other films.
