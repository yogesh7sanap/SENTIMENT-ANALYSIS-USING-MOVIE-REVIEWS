        "review_detailed_main": "We have always been taught that God is our father always fear God. But this movie say God is our best friend so love the Almighty. Excellent movie with hilarious content.\n\nMovie is story of small Gujarati businessman Kanji Bhai superbly played by Paresh who doesn't believe in God. His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.\n\nAkshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too.\n\nMovie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.\n\nGod is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans. Do not donate big amount to temples just help the poor and God will be happy. Don't waste your time searching god here and there instead search in humanity. Be fearless and love the God.\n\nMust watch"

Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie"

        "review_detailed_main": "WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,\n\nSo all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating"

Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.\n\nFirst half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message.

This film not only entertains but also enlightens people mind.You are bound to ask certain questions to yourself after watching the film. It thought provoking and your mindset may change after watching the movie. Everything is said in such a gentle and comic manner that the film does not bore a bit. As per acting is concerned well,u can say nothing to the performances by all the character but to applaud and appreciate. Paresh Rawal in the protagonist''s role has been out of the world,superstar Akshay Kumar portrayed the role of Sri Krishna outstandingly,Mithun,Chakravarty,Govind Ramdeo were just fantastic and all other supportive characters lend tremendous support. The main plus point of the film is its novelty in the story,its acting,its direction and the plot.. You are surely getting amazed after seeing such brilliant film and if u miss this then surely you are missing the best Indian film ever. I can and i think no one can give anything less than 10 to this film."

        "review_title": "Though not a good adaptation but still it is fresh and has a valuable lesson to teach, so do watch it!",
        "review_detailed_main": "First clearing the air about its inspired status, the team clearly accepts its sources in a detailed caption in the titles, making it all official this time which needs to be appreciated. The caption said that the film is based on a Gujarati play, 'Kanji Virrudh Kanji' or 'Krishan Vs Kanhaiya', which was adapted from the original film \"The Man Who Sued God\" (2001) and then there were two more lines written below it which I couldn't read as it stayed for only less than 2 seconds on the screen. Still it was good to see that the right kind of credits were given to the original creator of the idea as it should be.\n\nAs an Adaptation of the original film \"The Man Who Sued God\" (2001) The film is actually developed from the basic idea introduced in this lesser known Australian venture featuring Billy Connolly in the lead. And if one has seen the same then he is sure going to give a mixed response to OMG as it somehow reduces the impact generated by the original. Reason being, that in the English film the proceedings just keep moving in and out of the court and that's it. There are no separate tracks of various God-men and there is no Real GOD coming into Billy Connolly's home to make it filmy.\n\nIn the original we only have a case filed by Billy against the God (involving the Church) catching the phrase \"Damages caused by the ACTS OF GOD\" in the Insurance Company's papers and then its all about the court and arguments given for or against the claim filed the applicant. In short, the film has everything focused on the logical points brought forward by the lawyers along with a beautiful insertion of \"A Sign from the GOD himself\" coming into the court-room towards the end, which serves as a pleasant surprise for the viewers.\n\nPlus the original had a brilliant culmination wherein Billy takes his case back, sighting a drastic conclusion for the society whether he wins or loses, which is sadly not there in this Hindi adaptation. Yet OMG scores decently on its own merit with its Indianised version of the concept which remains highly recommended even if you have watched the original flick or play.\n\nAs an individual film making a new breakthrough in Hindi Cinema. Looking upon OMG as an individual film for viewers who haven't seen the original English film or the Gujarat play, it is no doubt an appreciable attempt by the makers giving us something fresh and new which we have been loudly craving for. Moreover it can also be called a daring attempt by the team, considering our society's conservative state of mind which always gets active when it comes to RELIGION. So in that terms the film successfully manages to make us aware of the so called \"Religious Markets\" strongly functioning around us like big super-malls with different names and titles.\n\nDirector Umesh Shukla and his writing team adds many good entertaining punches which are able to make you think and laugh at the same time. Hence as it progresses, the viewer largely feels entertained as well as tickled regarding his individual religious beliefs, which I personally consider nothing short of an achievement by the entire team. But at the same time the film has its flaws too. It takes too much time to come to the point and then tries to add too many elements into the narration which were not required.\n\nFurther, its main publicized theme talking about the GOD himself coming on the earth, seems to be of no use in its basic storyline. So it thankfully remains far away from the Sanjeev Kumar classic YEHI HAI ZINDAGI (1977). In other words, Askhay posing as KRISHNA (and that too on a modified bike like BATMAN) does nothing substantial in the film and is just added to give an extra edge to the project commercially. OMG also loses its grip towards the climax with some overstretched references of Paresh reaching the hospital and then THE GOD giving him the healing touch, which in turn seems to be added just to satisfy the religious sentiments of the viewers emotionally.\n\nPerformance wise OMG is one of those few films which has its script as the biggest performer in its more than 2 hours of duration. However regarding the cast, Paresh Rawal is as always first rate carrying the entire film on his experienced shoulders, well supported by his entire cast namely Om Puri, Mahesh Manjrekar & Govind Namdeo. Akshay Kumar making his entry just before the intermission looks cute but the scene stealer in the second half remains Mithun Chakraborty as a Spiritual Leader (like never seen before). In reality the few Spiritual Icons shown in the film are based on some highly famous Guru's presently active in the country which you can easily judge without taking any names. Musically OMG doesn't have much scope but even then the producers have added an item song \"Go Govinda Go\" to en-cash the festival season featuring Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha dancing to the beat energetically. Cinematography and Background Score just serve the purpose well making a decent impact along with the minimal special effects used to showcase The GOD.\n\nIn the last century, New Age Indian Spiritual Masters like J. KRISHNAMURTHY and OSHO kept saying this for many years throughout their life but very few heard them resulting in the present chaos in the country and world over. So here is OH MY GOD giving the same message to the people once again but deep inside I also know that the situation is never going to change for the very reason that,\n\n\"We all are taught to be GOD FEARING and not GOD LOVING people by our so called Religious Teachers!\""

As mentioned in Geeta its all about karma. Rather then spending time and bribing god you should do good to make him happy. I come from a Hindu sikh family and this movie did not hurt any of my sentiments or my views. It was very well written and director knew that Paresh rawal would be the best person to start with. Akshay kumar was perfect actor to play the modern Krishna he conveyed the message very well. I have written very few reviews on IMDb, because a very few movies makes go that far.

The strong content of the movie, acting skills of Paresh Rawal,Mithun Chakravarty,Om puri and others have made the movie a tremendous success despite some needless commercialization-tricks and a few weak dialogues. Yes, it is true that the concept of the story is not what we call \"original\" but the importance to point out our narrow perspective as to religious customs was necessary and the movie is successful in that sense. Although the character depicting \"GOD\" was unnecessary and probably was there to make a balance. But the movie has genuinely picked the \"villains\" as these religion-traders are everywhere twisting the original education of religion at their own will, for their own benefit. I would recommend this movie if you too hold humanity above religious fundamentalism."

        "review_detailed_main": "If I'm honest with you people, I struggled to imagine how this adaptation would turn out as a feature film. Thus, I felt it would be most appropriate to go in with strictly moderate expectations. In the end, I'm pleased to report I came away very satisfied.\n\nThe film itself, directed by Umesh Shukla, is an adaptation of an Indian play, which itself was an adaptation of 'The Man Who Sued God'. The plot however has incorporated various Indian elements, and the film on the whole has a very desi feel, and doesn't at all resort to insulting religion. It was wise investment by actor turned producer Akshay Kumar.\n\nParesh Rawal plays Kanji Bhai, an atheist who is also a moderately respected shop owner who goes about his business in the typical middle-class way, until disaster strikes that is. Kanji, after being rejected by the Insurance company decides to start a court case in order to try and prove that his shop was in fact destroyed by divine intervention, but no lawyer is willing to take his case. On top of that, his family strongly disapproves of his decision. Om Puri now enters, followed by Akshay Kumar. Things get very interesting This film belongs to Paresh Rawal, who so effortlessly carries the film for more than 2 hours. His comic timing is to his usually high standards. Akshay Kumar and him make the on screen goings on memorable and entertaining, once again post the Hera Pheri films\n\nOf the supporting cast, Mithun Chakraborty impresses the most. The character of a swami (holy man) comes so naturally to him. Meanwhile, Mahesh Manjrekar also leaves his mark as the opposing lawyer, as does Om Puri.\n\nThe main highlight for me is how the courtroom scenes are dealt with. You get engaged in the drama, and the inclusion of humor makes them even more enjoyable.\n\nA problem is that the screenplay builds the picture very slowly for the first 15 minutes or so. You might get a tad restless here, but be patient. The remainder of the film will more than compensate, I'm sure.\n\nI'm unsure of the purpose of the song 'Go Govinda', which takes up a good few minutes. It looks out of place. The choreography is top notch, however, and the Prabhudeva-Sonakshi duo light up the screen to keep you entertained.\n\nThe cinematography is both good and consistent with the purpose of the film - it wants people like you and me to be able to relate to it easily.\n\nI should tell you that, as a theist, I didn't at all feel offended by the premise of the film. A small point, but important nonetheless.\n\nOverall this is an entertainer that urges you to think, and is quite right in its message.\n\n7/10"

In Bollywood, people wearing tilak are always shown as villans, why? The makers of movie did not do their research did not deeply understand the concept of guru and the god. They should atleast spend an year or two with these enlightened masters and then make their judgements. Just showing what appears from the outside and influencing young minds is not right\n\nAnd coming to the movie stars, how are they earning money? Most of them are addicted to drugs. They are so miserable and havent understood any concept of god, gurus or the universe and earn money by showing our own culture in a wrong light. Please deeply understand why one should do idol worship before making such movies and influencing people in a wrong way especially youngsters."

India is a place where most people believe in visiting temples, donating money (and/or hair!) and performing rituals to please the Gods. The movie not only questions these practices but also leaves you questioning your own faith.\n\nThe movie is not anti-religion or atheistic. On the contrary, it presents a strong opinion about the existence of God. It is probably Paresh Rawal's finest performance since Hera Pheri (2000).\n\nThe premise is unique - A shopkeeper sues \"God\" when an insurance company denies his claim for his broken shop during an earthquake because earthquake is classified as an \"Act of God\" and hence not covered in the policy. The court then summons religious powerhouses from across the country as the case is accepted and argued in court.\n\nMithun Chakraborty is outstanding as the evil/sissy God man. Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant as the shyster. Akshay Kumar as \"Krishna\" is likable for a change. It's definitely a must see for all age groups. Go get entertained and enlightened!"

I think such because both movies have same plot, more or less. But OMG depicted this kind of plot before the PK, hence it is better. Plus, OMG had Paresh Rawal, who is senior than Aamir Khan in every way. PK got the attention of people because of only Aamir Khan. But this should not be the thing that a viewer should look for in a movie. She/he should look for the content in the movie which PK derived from the Oh My God and basically, PK is the combination of Koi Mil Gaya and Oh My God, more or less."

After watching the movie, your view about God will surely change a bit. Some of the dialogue are perfect. Towards the end of movie Mithun says, \"They are not God loving people, they are God fearing people.\" Just watch the movie and you feel some senses changed."

The movie is adapted from a famous Gujarati play Kanji vs. Kanji, which also had Paresh Rawal in the lead role.\n\nThe story flow is gripping and you wouldn't want to miss even a single second of movie. With a unique case of a human suing GOD, the direction has been brilliant to keep the story in context and make sense at the same time. While words won't be able to describe Paresh Rawal's acting brilliance, the movie also witnessed impressive performances from Mithun Chakraborty, Govind Namdev and Akshay Kumar. Om Puri, as always, was impeccable even in a brief role.\n\nHowever, the major highlight of the movie is its war against commercialization of religion in the country. The extent of monetary and non-monetary waste to please GOD, not out of love but out of FEAR, has been depicted at various points of time in the movie. It is this fear, that dharma-gurus take advantage of and make billions out of it. And as long as this fear is there to stay, the blind beliefs are also there to stay. While Kanji is an atheist, he is well aware of this and also takes advantage of it in his own way to run his business of God idols. However, he questions this foolishness in the society and the searches the answers as well.\n\nIn the nutshell, the movie offers a food for thought at the end and, of course, a brilliant movie experience as well."

OMG has hit the bullseye on the matter that how the business of religion is growing in India and people are made fool all over the country...the movie has a deep message. deep message which will shake you to the core if you will watch the movie carefully.It has shown that how gullible people are these days when it comes to religion. its not just about Hindu the movie has shown that its in every religion. The so called baba and peer fakir etc how they make people fool that is what trying to showed.\n\nacting in the movie is dominated by Paresh Rawal. the man has executed the pain of a common man really well. he had played the role of an atheist who has a very skeptic view towards religion and god.he is really good in this movie too as always. there is Akshay Kumar too in the movie but I'm sorry to say I'm not impressed with his performance of god. lots of small characters too played by Mithun Chakraborty,om puri,Govind Namdeo, they acted really well.\n\ni will not make this review long. i can speak more about the movie as i liked the idea of suing god :D in the end i will highly suggest you to watch this movie if you are sick and tired of other Indian movies you will feel this movie refreshing. the most important thing i feel about this movie that it is a movie which can be watched with whole family; yes,with whole family.I'm really happy to say that because I'm not able to say that about most of the movies these days. to my friends who are from outside India i can say that you guys will also like this movie but maybe not get the message. In the end i will say after finishing the movie just think for 10 minutes what you have seen and i bet u will be a different person after watching this. have a nice day and enjoy the movie.\n\np.s. its my first review at IMDb. please support me I'm sorry for any kind of mistakes. -vivek"

Akshay Kumar hams as usual and supporting actors like Mithun and Govind Namdeo give a very distasteful take on known Hindu religious figures.\n\nHaving said that, it does have some moments and plot-wise is definitely better than the formulaic masala flicks of the likes of Shahrukh and Salman Khan that we have been subjected to of late."

This movie also shows how the people so called themselves as \"Workers of God\" dis-guide the common man and their business activities on the name of God. Corruption and religion are related very well. Comedy is equally added to concentrate on a serious topic of corruption. Dialogues are superbly written and presented very effectively. The Movie has potential to grab the audience through out the movie. All over its a great movie for such a Country like India where people are more superstitious than their belief in work.

Besides,how the masses neglect truth in the name of appeasing God & blindly rely on priests for same is clearly depicted.It is indeed a hilarious comedy movie which clarifies the unholy nexus between priests & politicians to loot the masses in the name of God.The movie can leave u with a completely different understanding of Almighty. A sharp witted,well directed movie. Akshay Kumar as modern day Krishna,Paresh Rawal as Kanjibhai & Mithun Chakraborty as the leader of business minded priests have done their roles with sheer perfection.Best movie of 2012 along with Barfi.My rating:10/10."

I also never donate to churches more, and I have never failed to help the poor. I believe that If a person is doing good things in life, good things will happen to him also. Also, if God exists, he is not in the statues, he is there in humans.. Good concept..\n\nAbout acting, Parwesh Rawal was simply superb, he stealed the show. The producers tried to sell the movie with Akshay's starcast in the previews and all, but Parwesh was the real star. Akshay kumar was also brilliant as God.\n\nFirst when I heard about the story about the lead character going to court against God, and Akshay kumar coming as God and all, I thought the film will be another loser. But, after reading some of the reviews, I went to watch this and believe me, its Awesome awesome awesome. So friends, Don't miss this, This is a must watch film.. WATCH IT AND FOLLOW THIS.. Don't SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON STATUES AND ALL.. HELP THE POOR WITH THAT..\n\nI also seen one reviewer saying that its copy of \"Man who sued the God\".. Ya, they are showing this in the starting of OMG also. So, don't tell like a cheap copy.. Now all are doing the remakes, but the directors of the OMG presented this well to suit the Indian audience.

Running out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God.\n\nWhat happens next is hilarious. Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri), a poor Muslim lawyer. Qureshi, a disabled man, helps filing the case as Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company, as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj (Govind Namdeo), Gopi Maiyya (Poonam Jhawer) and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy (Mithun Chakraborthy) summoning them to the court as representatives of God on earth.\n\nFinally we see Kanji who ends up in front of a group of fundamentalists who try to kill him but he is saved by Krishna Vasudev Yadav (Akshay Kumar) who plays the role of GOD in this film.\n\nEventually we see Krishna Vasudev Yadav giving advice to Kanji in that all of mankind's problems have a solution. That solution is the Bhagwat Gita, The Holy Bible and the Holy Qur'an. Krishna insists Kanji go over these books.\n\nFind out what happens next when you watch this film with family, friends or by yourself. If you have hi-speed internet you can watch it Online. Or rent the DVD or go to the Cinema when the price is just about right for you.\n\nThere is a topic raised by Mr. P. Rawal in that a lot of milk, oil and food is wasted on Hindu ceremonies, which could have been used to feed the poor. I STRONGLY AGREE WITH MR. RAWAL.\n\nI also have a slight problem as to the casting of Akshaye Bhatia(or Akshaye Kumar) as the divine Lord Krishna. Hritik Roshan would have better suited in the role.\n\nGovind Namdeo is AWESOME as well as my 80's action hero Mithun Chakraborty.\n\nThere is a good song \"Go Govinda\" starring Prabhu Deva, a dancer whom I respect.\n\nIf you feel like buying the film, do so. It would be wise to wait a year because as you know new films are coming out at such a rate that the old ones will be sold at half-price and that's when you buy them."

Akshay Kumar plays the same personality he always does, which does not fit the god character, but it was not horrible. Some of the dialogues are very simple yet powerful and make us rethink how we blindly follow religious in our culture, and what the true meaning of religion is.

If it is indeed an act of God, then God is responsible for the act, and should be held liable through his many agents (Hindu priests, Christian pastor, etc). Either they accept responsibility and settle his claim OR they dispute the act of God clause, which should get the insurance companies to pay up.\n\nBut Kanji's lawsuit triggers political reactions and crowd anger. Kanji is chased by angry mobs when he is saved by the sudden appearance of Krishna Vasudev Yadav, who is a modern incarnation of the Hindu God Krishna. In this universe, God exists, but is also mad at the charlatans who misguide people in the name of religion, and therefore supports Kanji's efforts.\n\nThe movie is well scripted, well acted, and has a very funny, at the same time social aspect to it. It ends up being a pro-theistic, but anti-religion film, and I'm very pleasantly surprised that it did well in India. It's supposed to be based on a Gujrati play, but seems to be a remake of the 2001 Australian movie 'The Man who sued God\"; a funnier, more entertaining, theistic version of it.\n\nOverall, a superb movie."

Akshay has always been a splendid actor but this was a role of a lifetime and he proved to me that the character really does live in the heart. He touched my heart with his perfect dialogues. Paresh Rawal is just amazing. There really is no word to sum him up. Everything about him was perfect! My perspective on religion has started to look different, although i still believe in the power of God. He is right: be fearless people; Most people are not god-loving people, they are god-fearing people. I am really proud of actually watching this film.

It's a movie that's made to open you eyes, and your minds towards the truth. When Akshay and Paresh team up, you can always expect good.\n\nI would suggest this movie to anyone and everyone. We've had every genre of movies of late (Akshay himself, is following this with a \"Khiladi\" flick). This is a more thought-provoking one. If you know someone who is not too happy with oneself/The Almighty, take him/her to the movie and you will be thanked.\n\n(The movie is meant to convey a message, and like most moral stories, do not go in, expecting to see a very realistic film.

Another movie which i saw today which can be placed at the top of this list is \"oh my god\". Firstly hats of to akshay and paresh for making such a bold film. Most of the time people don't try to attempt this kind of cinema as they think people's sentiments will be hurt . BUT OMG IS MADE in such a way that it not only entertains you but give you the real inside of religious faiths people have in India and what actually happens on the name of religion, without hurting anyone's feeling.\n\nPerformance wise.... Brilliant Acting by paresh raw al , he portrays the role of a shopkeeper with ease and his court room scenes r just brilliant . Akshay kumar has little to do in the movie but he does justice to his role . I cannot imagine lord Krishna being played by someone else oder than akshay.. But the real surprise is Mithun chakraborty he makes u laugh just with his expressions :-) . On the whole omg is a movie which cannot be missed , it is a movie with a message that makes you think even after the movie is over. Hardly Bollywood makes sensible movies so don't miss this one.... 10/10"

Kanji is a person, who even does not fear God and even puts God on ill usage, for his benefit. After disaster, Kanji lodges complaint against God as he does not get benefit of insurance due to act of God. The notice is sent to all bigger baba's. He first goes through a lot of resistance, but eventually people turn out in his favour. People from other religions also join him. Thus notice is sent to every religious head.\n\nCinematography was awesome. Paresh as Kanji acted well. The build up of the movie and the execution was superb.\n\nIt's a matter of great controversy that, whatever things people do like doing abhishek, lighting candles, chaddars, etc. Do they come out to be beneficial? The answer to this lies in the quest to understand what turns out to create a pleasant atmosphere in bigger picture. I mean no poverty, equal status to lives, peace of mind, respecting life, creating a better world. This can be achieved by investment of wealth in proper direction i.e for poor.\n\nVarious religious heads need to understand the method that creates pleasant atmosphere from micro level to major only matters. If we put something in front of God, it should not go waste. Every bit of thing we keep in front of God should be utilized for good in some or other way. Eatables should be utilized for animals if not humans. There should not be any harm done to any form of life. Example Lead in kumkum has been killing animal life in water, which challenges the concept of respecting life. Things of this sort, should not happen.\n\nA movie highly recommended.\n\nI do kept pace with kanjilal at the ending scene, one of the instances that made me feel special.\n\nRating: 9.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "A man sues God because he thinks God is responsible for his loss. A gripping comic drama about the battle of a loner atheist for whom God is futile simply because according to him the way we happen to perceive God is ludicrous and especially because of the institutions, ashrams who swindle money in the very name of God.\n\nThis movie, in a way, keh-ke-leti's of all those babas, sadhus, saints, institutions that munch money from the innocent public unwavering with their faith, in name of god and questions the notion of donation, lavish physical gifts to temples, churchs, mosques. It very much appealed to me because I have always been the same kind of devotee who believes. OMG, also mocks the mass phenomena that takes the community by storm once an airy larger than life notion is shown about a particular person.\n\nNot for once, this movie slows down, it is always a joy ride from start till end. Umesh Shukla deserves applaud for binding this movie so well given the explosive content he has carried out masterfully and the best dialogues, screenplay I have seen in Bollywood since a long time.\n\nIt's not often you get to see a movie that challenges your opinion, defies your perception and literally shakes your age-old, orthodoxian beliefs from the core.\n\nOn the acting part, let me admit, I was a bit sceptic because there was logic defying combination of Paresh-Akshay again.\n\nBut, Paresh Rawal is phenomenal in his portrayal as a Gujju businessman he single 'handily' carries the whole movie on his shoulders with ease. Easily the best role he'd done amongst his last ten movies. Akshay Kumar great to see him back with sense, though I thought he overdone his role a bit at few places. Govind Namdeo is terrific with his role as Siddheshwar baba.\n\nWell, yes there are flaws in movie, like Paresh Rawal questions the unscrupulous ways of babas, swamis and in start he makes money by selling statues with fake proposition about their origin. But that's explicable given that God gets even with him ;)\n\nOverall, a wonderful movie with a special memo to masses, God isn't anywhere\u0085God is everywhere. 9/10"

Akshay kumar and paresh rawal were show stealer but its mithun da for whom you should be amazed after. a brilliant screenplay and well directed film takes you on a laugh ride and also make you think at the same time. akshay's screen presence is less but very effective. none other than him can carry the mod god persona.hats off. 10/10"

His caliber is well known anyway. Mithun Chakraborty as the effeminate Godman must be a really plucky actor to pull this role off with ease. He doesn't overdo his reactions and his antics bring a chuckle for sure. Akshay Kumar has a very likable cameo as Lord Krishna. The way he bonds with Kanji in his house is beautiful. The bike which he uses is a killer though his intro stunts on the bike are poorly executed but we can live with that.\n\nSo overall the movie is a Good Watch and Highly Recommended.\n\nMy Ratings -\n\n10/10"

For atheists in India, it is time to come out of closet. We do have a hope. Watching Paresh Rawal was pleasant. No trace of overacting and all the dialog were written intelligently.

He himself can solve the problems of the world without becoming human being.\n\nFurthermore, Lord Krishna came down to this world shows that they made this movie in favour of Hindu religion which I find insulting to other religions.\n\nThat is the reason why I find PK as a much better movie than this one because PK movie didn't try to show that one religion is more true or more superior than another religion."

One belongs to the likes of masses, masala entertainers (Rowdy Rathore, Ek tha Tiger) while others that matter the grey matter (a full list of them that begun with PST and Kahani and now unstopped at OMG!! Coming to OMG now..rather than writing a full review, i will mention its gist just like the acronym it is:\n\n1. Another non-chocolaty main protagonist - Paresh Kanjilal Rawal. He is known for putting life in whatever character he dones and this one is no different.\n\n2. \"Religion is the opium of masses\" and more so in a diverse nation like ours where the opium comes in different flavours. Making an eye- opener on such a sensitive topic is not as easy as it seems to be. It might appear preachy in patches but nevertheless its like a lecture we get from our parents after we err; and one leaves the cinema-hall with the same guilt. The movie tends to redefine 'God' and 'Religion'.\n\n3. Akshay as God might not sound like a believable bet but as the film progresses and by the time it ends one starts looking beyond AK to feel the real Krishna.\n\n4. Mithunda (doning looks and mannerisms of Sri Sri) is the surprise package of the movie. His performance as the diplomatic yet feminish religious guru was seriously - kya baat..kya baat...kya baat!!! Govind Namdev tickled through his loudness.\n\n5. Other supporting cast seems to be an ensemble of deja-vu characters from TV ads, nevertheless, endearing and non-starry.\n\n6. Music is well woven in the movie. Though some people find Go Govinda out of place, I feel, it does add some pace and rhythm to the story. A couple of others like \"Main to nahin\" and \"Hare Rama\" move intertwined with the movie.\n\nIn all, OMG is a brave attempt from Hindi Film Industry targeting to make people understand real meaning of God, making a call to shun all material and ritual practices and try to find God out of statues. GO FOR IT GUYS!!"

Akshay Kumar is good. Mithun Da has done a very surprising character. He adds very minute mannerism to enhance the character. Music by Himesh Reshammia suits the mood of film.

Absolutely delightful performances from Gobind Namdeo and Mithunda.\n\nThe 2nd best I would consider Akshay, in the role of Krishna - though a marginally longer screen time and a few more antics would be welcome. Of course, this effort washes away the ill will and the mental torture endured while watching JOKER.\n\nAnd of course, the cherry on the icing was Paresh Rawal in the role of Kanjibhai. Its been quite a while he has had a chance to top up Baburao Ganpatrao Aapte's character from Hera Pheri. Hats off to him!!\n\nGo enjoy this movie on the weekend with family and kids (I know my kids loved the movie)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Through the movie - Oh My God, its director (also the writer) Umesh Shukla has conveyed a beautiful message that we should believe in God but not in blind superstitions The exploitation of innocent people by persons who claim themselves to be God-men is depicted in a beautiful way. The highlight of the film is that there is a perfect mix of comedy and philosophy and it completely involves each and every one in the movie till the end.\n\nThe story revolves around a middle class atheist shopkeeper - Kanji Lalji Mehta (played by Paresh Rawal) who loses his shop owing to an earthquake. Kanji then goes to claim his insurance but the insurance agents reject his claim saying that his shop was destroyed in an earthquake which is supposed to be 'Act of God' and hence he can't claim the insurance. Being deprived of his income and running out of options, Kanji finally files a lawsuit against God and demands the religious heads who acquire money in the name of God to bear his insurance loss. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as the religious heads and the trio of persons who claim themselves to be God men - Siddheswar Maharaj (played by Govind Namadeo), Gopi Maiyya (played by Poonam Jhawer) and Leeladhar Swamy (played by Mithun Chakraborty) get involved in the story and this lawsuit of God becomes an issue of national interest. The religious heads try to kill Kanji and thats where Lord Krishna(played by Akshay Kumar) comes to his rescue and the remaining movie is a depiction of how He helps Kanji in his legal fight with the religious heads and the message He wants to convey the entire world through Kanji. Totally, the movie re-emphasizes the old proverb - 'GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES' through a plot filled with humour and sarcasm.\n\nComing to the performance of the actors, it was an outstanding performance from Paresh Rawal in the lead role and Mithun Chakraborty was also equally good in the negative role. As usual, Akshay Kumar was impressive with his role as a modern God. Other aspects such as dialogues, screenplay and background music were also good and I definitely say that it is a must watch movie for each and everyone. Finally, I would say that in this era where nine out of ten films are purely commercial, it is our duty to encourage these kind of movies which would boost the confidence of directors like Umesh Shukla and help them to come up with more innovative movies in the future which would be a blessing for Bollywood."

This lack of quality leads to the majority of American religious films to be called \"bad\" even if the viewers widely agree with the films' messages.\n\nUntil watching OMG, I had never considered that other countries might have their own bad religious films, so I appreciate the movie opening my eyes to that. So the message is certainly a good one (to an extent), and the movie is certainly a bad one. The plot was decent if not predictable, and the acting served its purpose even though it was never particularly convincing. The only part that was truly awful was the screenplay. The writers had clearly never been in any sort of courtroom before, nearly all of the main character's points used flawed logic arguments, and none of his interrogators could come up with even the simplest counterpoints. I don't necessarily blame the writers because the heart of the message can eventually be argued as truth (again, to an extent), but truly convincing the viewers would require a debate lasting far longer than any movie's runtime. However, the producer is definitely to blame for attempting to tackle such a massive concept in such a short film."

A businessman who never believes in god, blames god for his lose. And drag the GOD in the court. The argument in the court is truth. The bitter truth of religion and the marketing of god. Paresh rawal reveals everything about business of religion. Our society should accept this type of movies. Cause this type of movies can improve the society of India.\n\nPlease people go for this movie. Change your mind, change your taste. This movie deserves 10 star.

This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message."

One such scene where people flock into the temples to offer prasad to Krishna Idol indicates how much people can have blind- faith in religious activity. Hats off to the director to give a film which no one has ever attempted. Based on the popular play , OMG throws surprise with every scene and is sure to be lauded for its daring story. Screenplay is tight along with crispy dialogues. Paresh Rawal is the soul of the film. He carries the role of Kanjibhai as if it has been tailor-made for him. Akshaye Kumar does decent job in special appearance.\n\nOverall . OMG is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated for its wonderful message"

Akshay Kumar is hilarious in the role of God. Mithun Chakraborty once again proves his acting skills this time as a gay God Man! All in all, a real time pass movie with a message.

Maybe because there is a different god they serve, which promotes this. I sincerely believe it is intentional disrespect..through music, movies and television shows that has extended itself into the minds of children and their common language. (including texting, internet rants, etc.) A bad example is being set by lazy, scared and Godless people in positions which condone this. Personally I don't, and it doesn't matter what the movie reaction is. Im sure it would be a problem if it were all of a sudden to say \"aint that a jew\" to express anything but praise..and jews or any people offended are no where near the goodness of God."

On the name of faith, logic disappears. This problem was verbalised in a play which I show in Detroilt last year, acted by Paresh Rawal. Although play was raising issues about organised religion in India, it had got lost in its own argument. When same play is transferred into screenplay it has iron out all confusion and presented problem in a systemic way without destroying the fundamental question. This comedy has a serious question and we need to change our behaviour. As film it was entertaining with brilliant performance from Paresh Rawal. He seems a bit tired. Enjoyed Akshay Kumar as God. ."

        "review_detailed_main": "Preachy? Yes. Loud? Yes. Has blemishes? Yes. Despite some minor hiccups, OMG makes some strong points and leaves a huge impact on the viewer and some of their viewpoints.\n\nPlus, the movie talks about possibly the most universal topic out there - God and his existence. However, OMG is not all about God and his existence. In fact, an atheist suing God is merely a backdrop. OMG talks about much more controversial things here. OMG shamelessly discusses the commercialization of religion, especially in India. It may not have done it with full intelligence, however, it's a brave film with a mark.\n\nKanjibhai Mehta is an atheist who runs a shop that sells Hindu idols and \"murti's\". He is an open atheist and believes religion is nothing more than a business. A natural disaster causes only his shop to be destroyed. Kanji is shocked when the insurance company tells him that they cannot recover the losses because the disaster was an \"act of God\". This leads Kanji to sue this \"God\" character. Along his journey, Kanji is supported by a mysterious man named Krishna.\n\nThere are many hard hitting scenes in the movie. The scene with Paresh selling the murti's, the scenes during the yatra. Not to forget Akhay's scenes with Paresh. The court scenes are outrageous.\n\nThere are some problems here and there. The main one being that the film at times gets preachy. Also, Akki's intro is a bit stretched. Also, the last 10 minutes of the movie are also a bit stretched.\n\nOMG does shed some light into the commercialization of religion in the country of India. The film exploits the truth here for sure.\n\nThe music is meaningful and fairly enjoyable. Mere Nishan is my pick of the lot.\n\nThe dialogue is brilliant. Writing is excellent for the most part. Umesh Shukla's direction is extraordinary. Props to him for making such a brave film that too without hurting any sentiments.\n\nPerformances are also complimentary. Akshay Kumar is there in a special appearance and impresses. Especially in the last few minutes. Mithun is good but acts a little weird at times. Govind Namdeo is good. Om Puri is good. Rest of the cast is good.\n\nOMG surely stands on the shoulders of Paresh Rawal. To say he's a fine actor would not live up to the level of talent this man truly has. Rawal sinks his teeth into the role and is nothing short of perfect. Astounding! Overall, it's a film that will make you laugh, make you think and eventually spark a debate. Highly Recommended!"

A must watch.\n\nThe acting is superb and the story line would work so well in the US. I hope someone remakes this in the US. I think it would be a big hit.

Kanji decides to sue God, through His earthly spokespersons, to get the money owed. Surprisingly, Lord Krishna (Akshay Kumar) takes human form, and comes Kanji's aid.\n\nThis somewhat controversial comedy-drama provides thought-provoking points about religion. The final two-fold message is positive, though. Firstly, that God is everywhere, and temples and idols are not necessary. Secondly, people should not fear God, but love Him as a friend.\n\nRawal is fantastic in his role, both humorous and serious. Kumar's small but important part is played with gentleness and even godliness. Mithun Chakraborty played a minor character with perfection. The music is mainly incidental and background (with the exception of one item number) and some of it is quite beautiful. Overall, if one is willing to have religion examined in skeptical ways, this is a fine movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "With all the cheesy bullshit , crappy items songs with meaningless sung and acted upon by moronic half clothed seductress that appeal the thousands of dimwitted people across India and Pakistan , copied and unoriginal action sequences and extremely poor performances and irrelevantly common continued repetitive love and romance stories looming around the and spread across every Indian and Pakistani cinemas and films. Its the utter decline and breakdown of the film industry which is gradually loosing its credibility and the growing inconsistencies in originality and concept. Actors and actress of the Indian Cinema have lost purpose and actually and quite simply become money grubbing whores and douche bags. It is hard to accept the reality as it grows day by day and good Indian films are in rare numbers and extremely hard to find.\n\nIt is highly unlikely to find any worthy cinemas but when I did a bit of a survey , I actually ended up being suggested a worthy film and that someone was my highly philosophical Grandfather. The Film was nothing short of a Logical , Religious and Philosophical Masterpiece. A truly worthy film back from 2012 . More like an Underrated Great Film. That only reached to a select few through word of mouth. Why was it so unpopular among the people? Because It felt short of bad-ass and amazing baby-face actors, it had felt short of babes and seductresses , perhaps even no admirable guns blazing all out war action sequences that people so deeply crave for. What was it either of them ? No because It had none of them.\n\nA Remarkably, excelsior and praise worthy performance by Veteran actors such as Paresh Rawal, Mithun Chikraborty and Akshay Kumar. A moving , original , purely unique and heart warming emotional concept and screenplay although a remake of the Australlian film \"The Man who sued God (2001)\" but trust me it has been made to perfectionism. An almost flawless film which takes a Middle class man who carries completely no belief in Baghwaan or God who ends loosing up his only idols and antiques shop by an earthquake considered as an Act of God with no-one eager to help him and no option left ; he in an act of defiance and attain what is rightly insured to him , challenges and sues God in court creating havoc and religious chaos throughout the nation and the religious community. All Hell breaks in one of the most remarkable Indian films of all time. The Best Part : The Dialogues are truly moving, worthy, full of potential and enigmatic to the core of its deliverers. Truly an OMG Film of 2012!"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"OMG: Oh My God!\" directed by Umesh Shukla, is a thought-provoking satirical comedy that boldly tackles the complex themes of religion, faith, and the commercialization of spirituality. Released in 2012, the film stands out for its unique narrative and compelling performances, particularly by Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar.\n\nPlot and Execution:\n\nThe story revolves around Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal), an atheist and a sharp-witted antique shop owner who sells religious artifacts. His life takes a dramatic turn when an earthquake destroys his shop, and the insurance company refuses to cover the damages, labeling it an \"Act of God.\" Enraged and desperate, Kanji decides to sue God, setting off a chain of events that challenge the very foundation of organized religion and blind faith.\n\nEnter Lord Krishna (Akshay Kumar), who appears in human form to guide Kanji through his quest for justice and self-discovery. What follows is a series of witty, insightful, and often humorous exchanges that question religious dogmas and highlight the essence of true faith.\n\nStrengths:\n\nPerformances:\n\nParesh Rawal as Kanji Mehta delivers a stellar performance, seamlessly blending humor, sarcasm, and earnestness. His portrayal of a common man challenging age-old religious practices is both convincing and relatable.\n\nAkshay Kumar as Lord Krishna brings charm and charisma to the role, playing a modern, suave deity who guides Kanji with wisdom and wit. His calm demeanor and subtle humor add a refreshing touch to the film.\n\nMithun Chakraborty as Leeladhar Swamy, a self-styled godman, is memorable for his exaggerated yet impactful performance, representing the hypocritical aspects of organized religion.\n\nDirection and Script:\n\nUmesh Shukla's direction is commendable, maintaining a delicate balance between humor and serious social commentary. The screenplay, co-written by Bhavesh Mandalia and Umesh Shukla, is sharp, witty, and thought-provoking, addressing sensitive issues without being preachy.\n\nThemes and Social Commentary:\n\nThe film courageously addresses the commercialization of religion and blind faith. It encourages viewers to differentiate between genuine spirituality and exploitative religious practices, making a strong case for rational thinking and personal belief.\n\nThe dialogues are a major highlight, filled with clever wordplay and insightful observations that provoke thought and laughter in equal measure.\n\nCinematography and Editing:\n\nSethu Sriram's cinematography captures the essence of Mumbai and the varied locales effectively, enhancing the narrative. The visual representation of the divine intervention scenes is subtle yet impactful.\n\nThe editing by Tushar Shivan ensures a smooth narrative flow, keeping the audience engaged without unnecessary distractions.\n\nMusic and Sound:\n\nHimesh Reshammiya and Meet Bros Anjjan's music complements the film's tone well, with songs like \"Go Go Govinda\" adding a festive and lively touch to the proceedings. The background score supports the narrative effectively without overpowering the dialogues.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPredictability:\n\nGiven its satirical nature, the film's resolution can seem predictable to some viewers. The underdog triumphing over established norms is a common trope, but the execution in \"OMG\" keeps it fresh and engaging.\n\nPacing:\n\nAt times, the film's pacing feels uneven, particularly in the second half where some scenes could have been trimmed for a tighter narrative. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise well-constructed film.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"OMG: Oh My God!\" is a rare gem in Hindi cinema that combines humor, drama, and social commentary in a seamless narrative. Paresh Rawal's outstanding performance and Akshay Kumar's charismatic portrayal of Lord Krishna elevate the film, making it a must-watch. The film's bold take on religion and faith, combined with its clever dialogues and thought-provoking themes, make it an enduring and relevant piece of cinema.\n\nFor those seeking an entertaining film that also challenges societal norms and encourages introspection, \"OMG: Oh My God!\" is an excellent choice. It is a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, leaving a lasting impact on its audience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh My God is based on successful gujarati play Kanji Viruddh Kanji. Oh My God is a story of Kanjibhai who does not believe in god. One day Kanjibhai's shop gets destroyed in earthquake. Then Kanjibhai complains about God in court.\n\nParesh Rawal is absolutely splendid as a Kanjibhai and his arguments about reality of religion will make you think for a while. Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.\n\nFirst half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message. Story is perfectly directed by Umesh Shukla and he deserve a big cheer.\n\nOh My God is a must watch film for everyone because intelligent Kanjibhai and modern lord Krishna cant be missed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Very bad movie, stupid story, I don't know how they worship idols!! Are these people really conscious??? I can't believe what I'm seeing! The stories are over. You are really working on the ridiculous. I wasted my time on something very ridiculous. I hope you make films without your idols and failed beliefs. Leave them behind. Stay away from the films. Focus on the stories, directing, and quality of acting.\n\nYou learn from the Americans in making films. You do not reach the Americans. You are the last people in this field. All of them surpassed you. Korean, Spanish and Turkish cinema has become better than you. Why? Because they focused on the quality of acting and the diversification of film stories. Every work is a new story. There are no similar works. As for you, they are completely opposite."
