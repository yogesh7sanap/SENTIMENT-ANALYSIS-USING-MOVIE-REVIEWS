        "review_detailed_main": "After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense\u0085 and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne\u0085 the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority\u2014forget the Bane you saw in \"BATMAN & ROBIN\". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.\n\n**** (out of four)"

This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master."

        "review_detailed_main": "Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.\n\nIt's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.\n\nIt's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.\n\nChristian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.\n\nI can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.\n\nA decade on, and this film is still fabulous.\n\n10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, \"The Dark Knight Rises\"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.\n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.\n\nIn conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10\""

        "review_detailed_main": "I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.\n\nI am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy. I liked DKR, it's a good movie, but it could have been much better.\n\nSo rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.\n\nIt's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling, just like Nolan's Inception, but not as efficient. And in doing so, it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.\n\nBatman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters - Batman / Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.\n\nThe Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. So effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.\n\nBut Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling - efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle - characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.\n\nBane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.\n\nThere's no dilemma, choices, moral battles, hope, chaos or fear - things that make characters and plot interesting and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of \"Occupy WallStreet\" is very weak and, at best, is closer to London riots with its looting and arson. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.\n\nBut maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR - too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs, it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time.\n\nDark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies on Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy.\n\nAnd for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails.\n\n6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with this one. At 3.30 in the morning, I was tired. Just getting out of it, I've never been so awake.\n\nPerhaps what set this film apart from his other films was that it had a genuine emotional heartbeat. I felt that this was a flaw of Nolan's other films - the vision of emotion was there, but it was hollow. In this I bought it. I felt it, hero and villain alike.\n\nChristian Bale was typically brilliant as Batman, and I felt that Bruce Wayne was more heavily embraced in this final installment. Bale added emotional depth to the character - a plot point that I think went astray in The Dark Knight - picking up from the development made in Batman Begins.\n\nTom Hardy as Bane was quite simply, terrifying. No longer a dunderhead \"enforcer\", but one of the criminal masterminds behind \"Gotham's Reckoning\", coupled with a physical dominance strong enough to send shivers down your spine.\n\nAnne Hathaway as Selina Kyle defied my expectations. Hands up who was not entirely convinced that that girl from the Princess Diaries could handle an intensely physical role like Catwoman. But here I am, hugely impressed. She added immeasurably to the value of the film.\n\nMarion Cotillard fulfilled the role of Miranda Tate admirably, though I suspect this was the most underdeveloped character of the film - though after watching, I can see why.\n\nThe unsung hero of The Dark Knight Rises is Michael Caine as Alfred. A heartfelt performance that helps drive the emotional content of the film, helping Nolan sell his most well-rounded film to date. Caine's performance in both presence and absence.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is consistently proving himself to be a big player in the Hollywood game. His role as officer Blake felt like there could've been more, but it may just have come all a bit much. It was a great performance, and Levitt sunk his teeth into role.\n\nIf you can, go see this in IMAX. If any film was to sell the format to skeptics, The Dark Knight Rises would be IT. I'm happy Nolan stuck to his guns and shot in 2D. 3D would have been unnecessary.\n\nI suppose at this point, I have to turn my focus on Nolan. If he ever reads this... aspiring filmmaker to filmmaker, I've never been so envious, jealous in all my life. It's a film that leaves me floundering, wondering what I could possibly do to get anywhere near this ballpark. Well done. I think an Oscar Nomination is in order.\n\nFrom here, I'm not sure what to expect of the future. Does our imagination carry us forward, or do the studios? Time will tell.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.\n\nThe film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became \"Catwoman\", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain \"Bane\" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.\n\nThe colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.\n\nSorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."

        "review_detailed_main": "The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.\n\nThis movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?\n\nIn the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see \"good acting\". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.\n\nThe score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.\n\nI didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.\n\nI thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.\n\nSo anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."

In an industry where very few sequels have been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that would build on its predecessor.\n\nThe movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in \"The Dark Knight\" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.\n\nAll things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series, there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else continues this series if Nolan decides not to.\n\nTDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected."

        "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Dark Knight Rises",
        "review_detailed_main": "There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.\n\nWhen Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.\n\nAnd Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.\n\nWhile Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.\n\nAnd not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.\n\nWith how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.\n\nBecause you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."

        "review_title": "I loved It",
        "review_detailed_main": "I'm going to start off by saying that this was probably one of my most anticipated movies of all time. I went in the theater hoping for a masterpiece. I actually expected this movie to jump into my top five of all time. It didn't disappoint, I loved it.\n\nThe opening scene had me questioning what exactly was going on. Movies that make you think about the smallest details of the plot are my favorite. In the scene the audience is introduced to the new villain, Bane. As a kid watching cartoons I always thought that bane was a mindless hulk-like bad guy. In this movie he has a true to the comic's portrayal. He's smart, he has a plan, and he'll stop at nothing to put it into action. Much like Dark Knight, the Villain is a major standout. He has such an intimidating presence on screen. Tom Hardy put so much work into the physicality of the character. The first fight between Bane and Batman is one of the moments that they had to get right. Luckily it's one of my favorite moments in the entire film! In the scene they don't use too much sound, just Bane's taunts as he fights, truly frightening. His voice is so interesting. It's something you'll really remember about the film. After the film my friends and I couldn't help but do Bane impressions. He has so many quotable lines that he will probably be one of my favorite villains of all time. You might be wondering if he outperformed the Joker from Dark Knight. The answer is no, not quite. He's so different of a character it's hard to compare, but Joker was just too hard to beat. Christian Bale's performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne was amazing. This was easily his best performance as Batman. The story takes place eight years after the end of Dark Knight so Bruce is feeling the ill effects of being batman. He uses a cane now, and he has a little grey hair. This is a story about Bruce Wayne coming back, and doing anything he can for his city. Bruce and Alfred have some amazing scenes where you forget your watching acting. The emotion they both convey when they're together is stunning. Michel Cane doesn't have as much screen time as he does in the other movies, but he's so good in the ones he's in you won't forget his performance. Morgan Freeman is back. He has some particularly funny scenes with Bruce. They feel like old friends yet again. You really can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young police officer Blake. He has some great character development during the course of the movie. I was cheering for him the whole time. If you come out of this movie saying \"I just wish it had better acting\" I'd question your sanity. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was one big worry I had about the movie going in. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. She did a great job of portraying the playful vigilante. She actually had okay chemistry with Christian Bale. Catwoman wasn't forced into the story, her character made sense within the plot. She didn't ruin the movie, which was all I was asking for. Plus, she actually looked like she could fight. She wasn't doing the \"I'm a woman who can beat up ten men with one hand tied behind my back\" routine. It was such a relief that they didn't try to do something annoying like Black Widow from Avengers.\n\nThe story was fantastic. It's amazing that Christopher Nolan wasn't planning on doing this movie before he made Batman Begins. There are so many callbacks and references to that movie I would strongly recommend watching that one again before you see this one. I kept saying \"Oh I remember when he said that!\" or thinking \"That ties in perfectly\". This one had plenty of twists and turns. Multiple times I was questioning what was true and what was a clever ruse. If there are any negatives, you might say there are some plot leaps. Not holes mind you, but something upon thinking about it you might consider a little unbelievable. With such huge story and scope I'm surprised there aren't more mistakes. The scale of this movie is far bigger than in either of the first two Batman movies. Bane has a plan for all of Gotham and batman has to stop an entire city of villains. The entire trilogy comes to a very fitting finish. I absolutely loved the ending. I was very satisfied how everything tied together. I especially loved the conclusion of Bruce's story, perfect. When I came out of the theater I couldn't wait to discuss the amazing things that happened in the end. This is a movie where the more you watch it the more you'll understand and enjoy it.\n\nOf course, in the conclusion to a trilogy like this one you would expect to be dazzled by the special effects. They were quite impressive. The new batwing has some pretty amazing aerial maneuvers. You definitely get your money's worth with the cinematography. The opening and ending scenes especially stand out. There was an extremely cool Bat Pod driving scene that, as soon as it was over, I wanted to watch it again.\n\nIt can't tell you enough that this was an amazing movie. It was certainly the best of the year. If you're wondering if it's better than The Dark Knight I honestly can't say. Time will tell. It could be better, and that's some of the highest praise I can give it.\n\nEdit: Time did tell. It didn't hold up. Still good. Nowhere near Dark Knight tkubas1.wordpress.com."

        "review_title": "Really Good End to Nolan's Great Trilogy",
        "review_detailed_main": "'The Dark Knight Rises' is the third and final instalment in Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking trilogy that reshaped the superhero genre as we know it. The main cast return as well as some newcomers. Tom Hardy as 'Bane', Anne Hathaway as 'Selina', Joseph Gordon-Levitt as 'Blake' and Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda'. The new additions are fantastic, especially Tom Hardy. He brings a menacing presence to the character and finally incorporates the main part of his comic counterpart, his brains. For sure Bane is incredibly strong, but he is also an unbelievable strategist that can systematically wear down Batman whilst also using his strength to defeat him. Hardy displays all of this perfectly despite us barely seeing his face, the mask he wears makes him more frightening and is used as an interesting plot device later in the film. A lot of people criticised the voice that Hardy uses for this character, but personally I love it, I think adds to the mystery of the figure. The best acting comes from Michael Caine as 'Alfred Pennyworth'. Nolan really fleshes out Alfred and Bruce's relationship in this film and Caine plays the reluctant mentor figure perfectly. One of his final scenes really shows off his acting, the regret that Alfred pours out and it's heartbreaking. Whilst all of the other actors are great, Caine excels in this movie compared to 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. The writing is brilliant, so many twists and turns and a sensational ending that really brings the trilogy full circle and has a great ending to Bruce's arc. The dialogue is excellent, in particular the many Bane monologues that add another layer onto his great character. The fight choreography improves massively and is loads better than the last two films. Hanz Zimmers score is superb and works in all scenes that it features in. Also, the cinematography is beautiful, Wally Pfister, who has worked with Nolan throughout the trilogy, really peaks in this picture. However, this movie isn't perfect, Bane's final demise is very underwhelming, especially for a character that makes as much of an impact as he does. Finally the twist at the end with Blake feels tacked on and is inaccurate to the source material. Overall, I love this movie, for sure it doesn't live up to the heights of 'The Dark Knight' but it is still exceptional and was a stunning way to end this unbelievable series of films.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Let me start by saying, that I am an avid Nolan admirer. Up until now I haven't seen a bad Nolan film. All of his movies would be in my top movies list if I had one, I consider him a genius. After seeing the final act of his Batman I have started to reconsider.\n\nThe movie was filled with moments where I found myself thinking \"This is not believable\" and after the first hour I asked myself \"Is this it?\". Gladly after the first hour things did become more meaningful. The \"fall\" of the dark knight was awesome, Bane was a tough guy and the Batman did suffer. It was great. Even Anne Hathaway came trough crushing all my negative preconceptions. Other than that, the movie certainly didn't deliver.\n\nIn the end they ruined Banes character. Batman's training in this film was far from believable. There were lot of little stories and story structures going on, which didn't work when added together. I mean they worked but comparing to the previous films of Nolan they certainly did not deliver. In many scenes I thought \"This is something that just could not happen\", the things in this film just didn't work. And I don't mean Batman doing his stunts, of course they are unrealistic, I mean all the little things that left me bothered.\n\nOn the other hand when it comes to Batman's stunts there were little, the end conclusion left me thinking \"was this the great finale of BATMAN?\". Isn't Batman supposed to do something cooler than fly a plane or ride a motorcycle? Isn't Batman supposed to be an acrobat who beats everyone in a cool, cunning and mysterious ways? Here he was the operator of an army plane. In the previous films he was Batman, in this film he doesn't really come off as Batman. His only a random commando wearing a Batman suit. This is something I could not forgive Nolan for.\n\nIf the scenes we're actually believable I would've propably considered forgiving him this error, but these two errors together are just too much for me to say this is an impressive movie. You might be able to go as far to say this is good, but it is not impressive. This is a shame, because the guy who did this has done nothing but impressive movies. For some other director this movie could be a good stepping stone for something better, an acceptable movie that did have its moments, but for Nolan it is an utter failure. There we're times in this movie when he got me and I was impressed. The movie did in certain scenes raise my emotion and hit me where it should've, but as a whole taking into account all the bad things it cannot be regarded as a movie above others.\n\nI was let down with this movie. With all of his previous movies that I have seen in the theathre I have gone in with enormous expectations, like the kind of hyped mind you should never walk in with and every single time I have walked out with my expectations blown away by the grandness of what I have just seen. This time I walked in with the same expectations and came out disappointed. The only question in my mind being \"How was he able to not see these flaws in this movie, I thought he was a genius who could not fail\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.\n\nIt's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.\n\nAs usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clich\u00e9s (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.\n\nThe cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."

Even though its just couple of hours since I finished watching it.\n\nSure, TDK had its flaws, but then, it was such a marvelous noir saga, a treatise in crime drama that left us begging for more at the end. The phrase \"page-turner\" is often applied to engrossing books, but that could work just as well for the magnificent film. To this day, I cannot take my eyes off whenever I see TDK and by the time that ravishing interrogation scene between Batman and Joker is on, nothing is likely to stir me from my seat. By choosing to make the titular character undergo a perception shift, a massive (and ultimately successful) gamble was taken. And who can forget the late, great Heath Ledger's spectacular performance?\n\nTDKR is not a bad movie per se. Seen alone, it has the ideal ingredients for a summer blockbuster: an A-list cast, monumental action sequences, modern themes of terrorism and official ineptitude, as well as intricate sub-plots which mesh well together at the end. There is more than a passing reference to the predecessors, especially Batman Begins (which, in my humble opinion, is an enormously underrated flick). And it works to a great extent.\n\nWhere this film fails as TDK succeeded is in the amount of layering. Some sub-plots were so complex that I was left confused as to where I was before that particular sequence (case in point: Blake's impromptu reconnaissance of a dockyard). Others were left frustratingly hanging in thin air. The plot also seems slow paced at first. While the first sequence is downright awesome, what follows afterward is distinctly underwhelming. Above all else, Batman is renowned to be a master strategist. Here, he ends up getting deceived not once, but twice at Catwoman's hands. You mean to tell me that eight years is good enough to make a superbly trained, marine-worthy, genius escape artist-cum-detective become dull? Really?\n\nI won't go ahead and slate Nolan more here, simply because he gave me the privilege of watching two of the best superhero movies ever filmed in Batman Begins and TDK. The glass is always half-full in my eyes, and I'll admit that Hathaway and Gordon-Levitt were both perfect selections for their roles. I'm not too sure of Tom Hardy, since his performance is more physical than metaphorical but given his task was to exude a ruthless menace, he did his job. The rest of the familiar supporting cast are brilliant as before, especially with Caine showing his human side that we always suspected was well alive beneath that stiff British upper lip exterior and dry wit. I read somewhere that this is not a Batman movie, but a Bruce Wayne movie. And I fully agree. Having to reconcile (with unflattering results) with a life without Batman, Bruce is alone even as a social presence and a corporate figure. It is a true challenge but then again, Christian Bale turned in a remarkable performance in both BB and TDK (he held his own in those scenes where Ledger was not present). And in TDKR, he leaves an indelible mark on a role that would probably be the benchmark.\n\nBatman Begins was all about \"Fear\" while \"Chaos\" was a running theme in TDK. TDKR does a great job in being a conclusion to the trilogy, but it is not the best one among the three, probably because there is no strong undercurrent of a theme here."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and the first 2 Dark Knight movies, so I had high expectations for this movie. The Dark Knight Rises is good, but it is nowhere near the level of the other two movies. It has several things that are a bit clich\u00e9 and it also had several plot holes that I found very irritating and distracting. My friend who I saw it with initially thought it was the best out of the trilogy, but after we discussed the plot holes that he missed, he ranked it as the worst of the three movies. Throughout the movie I felt like everything was a bit overdone. It seemed like they were trying so hard to make the \"epic conclusion\" that they forgot to make it realistic or reasonable. One of the things I loved about the first two was how it dealt with Batman in a fairly realistic way. There was a fairly good overview of how he functioned and how he was viewed. In this I thought there was much less dealing with the separation of Bruce Wayne and Batman, which was one of the interesting parts of the first 2. Also, I would describe the main character of The Dark Knight Rises as Bruce Wayne rather than Batman, which I found greatly disappointing. Still a good movie, but not nearly as great as the first 2."

        "review_detailed_main": "-Minor Spoilers- First of all, why hate so much? The movie is not perfect, agreed. It's not the best movie ever, again agreed. However it's one of the best movies, and it's pretty damn good, even if it's not perfect. The plot is good, the action is good, cast is great, acting is great too, and the atmosphere the movie creates is fantastic! Ignore all the hate, and please go enjoy the film. And I don't understand, why are people comparing this movie to TDK? They're by the same director and they're part of the same trilogy, no comparison. TDK is too perfect, and we all know that. So why did ya all have your expectations sky high. Whenever a director releases a movie which is near-perfect, then it is hard for him/her to beat that movie. Sure he/she can make a movie equal to the other one, but to beat it, think again. Thus my expectations for TDKR were high, but not sky high. And guess what? It crossed my expectations, and it was really close to TDK. Tremendous film!\n\nLately I haven't developed an interest in comic book reading, and I really don't enjoy batman or to be honest I don't enjoy much of superhero films at all. Only a few. However I didn't only enjoy this movie as a superhero film, I also enjoyed it itself as a movie. The reason I don't watch many superhero films is because they're very tedious and repetitive, and there's no message. Here is how your everyday superhero film goes \"There is \"Whatever\" man. Some stupid person attempts to outsmart the _____man, and take over the city, and guess what? He fails, and ______ man gets respect for saving the city...the end\". TDKR was out of the ordinary. To be honest, the whole trilogy was \"Out of the box\" thinking, especially this and TDK. Both this and TDK made it to my Top 10 films of all-time, and many movies at this time don't even make it close.\n\nThe movie did have its problems as well, it was not perfect. One of the major concerns was the time. The movie had a near-3hr run time which was more than enough. There were some slow and boring parts at the beginning and middle of the film, but as the movie approached the ending, none of this really mattered. Also I didn't really like how Bane died. He was really bad-ass up until the end, where Catwoman whipped him out in 1 second. I was expecting another fight between Batman and Bane, only to find out something else? It was too fast of a death, and not only that, he was the villain of the film, how can you kill a villain in 1 second? And it was not even Batman who killed him, it was Catwoman? I personally wasn't expecting this at all.\n\n-Major Spoilers- The movie really kept you glued to the screen near the end. I really liked the plot twists and never expected some of them. Though some were predictable, but others weren't, IMO. For example, Batman surviving, and Talia escaping from the prison rather than Bane was pretty unpredictable. On the other hand, John Black turning out to be Robin, and Miranda Tate turning out to be Talia al Ghul was more predictable. I think there were some more plot twists, but I can't really remember, because I saw the full movie once, and that was 3 months back.\n\nAt first I thought Bane was the one who escaped from the prison, and was the son of Henri Ducard, but it turned out that it was Talia, and Bane was just a friend. This was the real shocker for me. I didn't really care much for the other plot twists, but this really shook me hard. I never expected this, in fact I even forgot about this up until the end. Also batman surviving? This was the second most unpredictable twist. At first I thought just maybe he survived, but after the funeral, I was sure that he was dead. Then he appears in Florence? This was pretty shocking as well.\n\nThe second half of the film was the best, because that's when the excitement began. I was very curious about what was going to happen next. After the explosion scenes, the suspense began to rise rapidly. Then the climax came all together very nicely.\n\nMy favourite parts of the film in the first half were the opening \"Plane Hijack\" scene, the \"Stock Exchange\" scene, and \"Bane vs Batman\" fight 1. In the second half my favourite scenes were the \"Football explosion\" scene, \"Bane vs Batman\" fight 2, and the final chase scene. Some of the other fight scenes involving Catwoman and Robin were pretty good too.\n\nFinal thoughts, I didn't expect much of this movie after TDK. TDK was perfect, and I thought this movie would be no where close, but it was pretty damn close. It was really good too. The action was great. The cast, acting, and dialogue were all fantastic. Especially the dialogue between Alfred and Bruce. Gary Oldman did a great job, not to mention that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job as well. Tom Hardy turned out to be a great villain. Even though Bane's voice was kind of confusing, but it was pretty cool. Overall the whole movie includes some great action scenes, and runs a full circle completing TDK legend in an Epic way!\n\nFinal Rating 9/10."

The movie ran about two hours and forty-five minutes give or take, but I never wanted it to end. The story progression never seemed to drag on, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat.

However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, \"The Dark Knight Rises\"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source.a big kiss for Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway i really love them.if i visit USA this will be for visit Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway. thanks for all."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy.\n\nThere's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10."

Is this movie better than The Dark Knight?

        "review_detailed_main": "As a huge fan of superhero movies and undeniably the batman Christopher Nolan has depicted is the favourite of my choice. He is humane yet enigmatic, heroic and self-giving. Chris Nolan has produced superhero movies into a whole different level. The action, acting, sound and other visual effects was absolutely mind-blowing for the previous two productions. He is good at picking the right cast playing the right role like Michael Caine, Gary Oldham and Morgan Freeman who have always been the linchpin behind the success of the movie. I am also in awe of his previous works excluding the batman series such as Momento and The Prestige. So I had high hope and expectation on the Dark Knight Rises of how the director can build up the finale of the Batman trilogy which the world has long anticipated this blockbuster.\n\nJudged by the content of the trailers, lots of people might expect it to be an action intensive film with lots of explosive elements and the elemental conflict between good and evil. If I'm honest, I have already seen most of the action scenes of the movie via the trailers before watching the film which is a saddening thing to hear from an audience's point of view. The entire film was almost three hours long and there were way too much chit chatting with the whole conspiracy by the villain but not getting down into the main point or the action bits. I think those scenes about having trials on the people by the judge whether they were guilty or not was plainly farcical in my opinion and quite cheesy which I never experienced in the previous two batman films.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises has put in a lot of new characters who played a key role in the film including Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing John Blake and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. But the main villain, Bane played by Tom Hardy made me anticipated on how he can use his eyes as his weapon to proceed the acting, to show his wrath towards the corrupted society. I must say I was a bit disappointed at the villain role as the joker simply played too well in The Dark Knight in which Tom Hardy could not exceed the expectation. With those prestigious casts which all of them are great actors, I expected that it would be a sensational experience crafted by those actors. However, the entire film always talking about bits and bobs and never really get to one main theme. The experience was messy and too stuffed in without much focus to cause the audience to fall into the frictional world that Christopher Nolan was trying to present.\n\nIn conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises does not exceed my expectation nor better than the predecessor. I thought it was a let down the way how Christopher Nolan wrap up this impeccable Batman series. I only gave the rating 7/10 because of the two fantastic previous productions he made."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises (2012) The crusader in the mask For the last few years cinematography and special effects took a big step in improving the quality of their own products. That's why every new film set the bar higher and higher, therefor competition is rising. However, this is what exactly people want. Today once again saw this movie and decided to share my point of view, because while it is almost 3 years old, nevertheless with every time watching this film is no less mesmerizing.\n\nIn my opinion the plot of the third part surpassed even the second with loved by all great Heath Ledger as the Joker. It is very interesting and confusing, and if the beginning of the film (as is a rule in the case with Cristofer Nolan) is pretty tight, by the end of it is already impossible to put down. Eight years after the events of the previous part Gotham lives in piece and silence. Police Commissioner James Gordon feels guilty about covering up Harvey Dant's crimes and Dark Knight's disappearing because of that. However, events occurring in the city for the last days cry for help the hero, as well as the beauty who has got into trouble \u2013 Cat Woman. So Batman dares to speak out against the main villain \u2013 Bane. Christopher Nolan - a man who showed how the movie can be removed on comics. Already, it makes him one of the best producers nowadays. As he said, for the first Batman movie the main theme was \"fear\", for the second - \"chaos\", for the last - \"pain\". This pain is more soulful and Bruce Wayne will feel it completely.\n\nChristian Bale \u2013 a man always on his top. For the late 80's and 90's kids he will always be the Dark Knight. Christian Bale is my Batman. He is my hero.\n\nAnne Hathaway - a perfect Cat Woman. She is my favorite actress and she didn't disappoint me. It costs a lot. Joseph Gordon-Levitt played the role of energetic young cop - Blake. It seems this guy have a bright future, because Joseph is showing cool actor's skills. Morgan Freeman,\n\nGary Oldman and Michael Caine showed that \"old\" doesn't mean \"bad\". An incredible full compliance with the allotted roles. Soundtrack. \u00abBasara Deshi\u00bb permeates the entire history by becoming the theme both for Bane and Batman.\n\nI can say with certainty that the film was a success. Nice plot and amazing special effects because of the big budget are doing their job. Strong main villain who are all the time winning good guys causes the audience worry and fear. However, like rays are trying to break through the clouds, good is trying to break through. All this and beautiful Anne Hathaway don't give the audience to look away from the screen. Many of the best characters in the Batman universe, as if in a mirror, reflect the character of the protagonist, or when walking on the razor's edge between justice and revenge, or when caught in a trap of injuries in the past. Loyal fans of comics hardly surprised many plot twists, which is quite natural if we remember how the story developed in detail. For truly impressive how Nolan and his co-authors-screenwriter David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan managed to finish the trilogy of Batman. The film seems to be more emotional than the second part with it's psychological games. Of course, it has a lot of drama and even tragedy as well, but \"Dark Knight Rises\" touches the most. This large-scale painting, remaining harmonious, with great music and very beautiful camera work. However, the scope and action, going beyond imagination, leads to the fact that the scene, each of which is costs more than the budget of any other film, are perceived as ordinary events, while Bruce Wayne looks better in private moments, whether it's the episode where one of the characters finally realizes who is actually a man- bat, or the scene with the advent of a new character. Also there is a problem with the female audience understanding the reality of the plot, because there a lot of moments related to the previous parts. For example, such an important character of the first part and Batman story as Ras'el'Gul, whose name was named in a few episodes of the movie. Everyone should see this picture, are you a child or adult, it does not matter whether you love comics knight in black armor or you don't. Everyone who will leave the cinema will be inspired by something. Your brain processes speed up and you will feel strong and ready for new challenges. No matter where you are, who you are, when you are. What is important is that the message is delivered to you and it's your business what to do with it. Nolan and Co. did what they wanted to do. Created a symbol. Created a hero. My hero.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10 Batmans"

        "review_detailed_main": "The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is set from the very first scene, when we are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy) who crashes a plane that he himself is a passenger to. This is the first time we see the brute strength that he possesses. He is insanely strong through the use of the chemical \"venom\" which is pumped into him through his mask. As we leap into the rest of the story we see right away that director, Christopher Nolan, wasted no time in picking up right where he left off in The Dark Knight, with the death of Harvey Dent, and Batman being the criminal. This film was one of the big blockbusters in summer 2012, and for good reason. This movie brings the classic Batman comic book characters to life, which is evident in the acting, the sets, the script, the plot, and as many know, the dramatic ending. The acting is so well done, as we see emotion poured into each roll. Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne) Michael Cane (Alfred Pennyworth), Tom Hardy (Bane), and Anne Hathaway (Selena Kyle) all dove head first into their roles, leaving nothing behind. They each play a convincing role, identical to the characters that are portrayed in the Batman comics. One of the best examples is the relationship between Batman and Catwoman, because Batman is just, and Catwoman is a thief, but they are romantically involved with each other. The sets of this movie are stunning. Bruce Wayne's mansion and Batcave are just as they are depicted in the original comics. They are all encompassing and eye candy to any Batman lover. As we look back to the 1990's, we see a Batman comic book story arc that is very similar to the plot of TDKR. But Nolan's twist on the storyline is a refreshing change. Some may disagree, but not knowing what is coming next is part of the joy that comes with this film. Nolan keeps some of the key reference points in his film, but adds his own interesting, and modern additions to the film. Take for example, Bane's appearance. In the comics, Bane was unrealistically strong, and in the film he is much more realistically depicted. The only complaint I have with this film is, if Bane is so strong, why does he cover up his muscles with a vest or a coat for the majority of the movie? Show off your strength, be proud! The plot is the main focus point, like it should be. If explosions and fighting is all you want to see, then go see Pacific Rim. I'll say sorry in advance if you have wasted your time with that movie. Getting back on track to the plot, which might take a couple of watch throughs to fully catch all of the detail in this storyline. Throughout this movie, the focus is not on Batman, as one would expect, but on Gotham City itself. Bane brings the city to hell and back, and Batman is sitting on the side lines, bruised and battered, left watching, waiting, and hoping that his beloved city isn't left shattered and destroyed. The script of TDKR was written with pure precision, which allows us, as an audience, to remember key points of the movie through the use of dramatic quotes. Bane has a lot of one-liners that leave you repeating them to your friends after you see the film. Here are a few examples of memorable Bane quotes; \"But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, molded by it.\" \"\u0085when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die.\" Because of Bane's voice, these short, memorable lines only add to the effect Nolan was going for. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how Batman could possibly win? The moment you doubt if the good guy can win, that's when you know the director has succeeded.\n\nThis was a very well done film, and I encourage you to see it several times (it might take a few times to fully grasp the story) and the way this film ends is the perfect way to close out the series. In the end it all comes down to autopilot, back stabbing, and a turn of events by a woman you would not expect, all ending in an unpredictable manner."

        "review_detailed_main": "as much as i am huge fan of the batman in almost every facet of the genre, i am having a hard time getting completely behind this film. it makes the same mistake a lot of sequels do: it tries to pack too much into the story. the reason why the first two films in the trilogy, batman begins and the dark knight, worked so well was because they mostly focused on one central story and villain. in the dark knight rises there are too many new characters and too many story lines to be introduced and told that the film loses focus. sure it has plenty of action which you would expect but nolan strays too far from the source material when it comes to the characters in the film. the cast does a fine job with the script they had to work with and most film goers will probably like this film but i think true fans of the batman who know the history of the characters will wonder what nolan is doing to their batman."

        "review_detailed_main": "What is up with all this haters? Seriously, it makes me want to laugh because they're so ignorant. Some people here are saying: \"Worst Batman film ever\", or: \"I prefer watching Adam West Batman than this mess.\" Wow, just wow. Anyways, enough complaining, this is one of the greatest conclusions in film trilogies history. No worry, this is a spoiler free review. The film is almost 3 hours long and the impressive thing is, the movie is NEVER dull, it's always keeping you interested because if its smart dialog and action. The story is great too. Bruce Wayne has stopped fighting crime as the Batman for 8 years after the Joker wanted to terrorize Gotham. But now a new threat has arrived, Bane. His plan is to burn Gotham to ashes and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.\n\nNow the cast in this movie is really good. Christian Bale is a great Batman as always. Michael Caine deserves an Oscar nomination as best Supporting character for his amazing performance as Alfred Pennyworth. Anne Hathaway really impressed me as Catwoman. She steals any scene she's in. Tom Hardy as Bane is a great villain in this film. My favorite villain since the Joker. Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake delivers a good performance as well. Also Morgan Freeman and Marion Cottillard were good as well.\n\nI love Trilogies, this trilogy is in my top 5 and ranks #2 right behind The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. In conclusion this is an amazing trilogy, the best of superheroes films and the second best trilogy of all time. All I have to say is, thank you Mr. Nolan, thank you. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "This film is spectacular, the closest thing I have seen to perfection in film since the good ol days of filmmaking.\n\nIf you're hoping its better than The Dark Knight, your hopes have been answered. Christopher Nolan somehow outdoes himself once again, delivering a fantastic plot with great action, character development, and direction.\n\nThe writing itself is a wonder. The dialogue in this film is outstanding and perfectly fits each character.\n\nHeath Ledger set a new standard for acting talent in comic book films. TDKR definitely meets that bar, possibly surpassing it. No single performance is better than Ledger's but everyone gives 110% in this and it comes together nicely. Christian Bale gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance in this one, and Tom Hardy is terrifying as Bane. Other regulars such as Caine and Oldman are just as good as ever. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a breath of fresh air and plays his part to perfection. However, I give it to Anne Hathaway for stealing the show. She is seductive, sexy, and dangerous as Catwoman, and becomes the very essence of the femme fatale.\n\nHans Zimmer continues to be my favorite film composer. His score simply blows me away, especially the way he uses the chants from the trailers as Bane's theme. Zimmer promised us an epic score, and delivered.\n\nEditor Lee Smith and Director of Photography Wally Pfister both continue their win streak, as well as production designer Nathan Crowley and Costume designer Lindy Hemming.\n\nAll in all, TDKR is the best of this series. It is emotionally gripping and, at times, gutwrenching. As a current film student, I can honestly say that TDKR possesses all of the essential qualities of an Oscar for Best Picture. If you have seen the previous two Batman movies, you will enjoy this film so much more than you ever have. It truly is a whole new cinematic experience."

It absolutely lived up to my expectations. What was good about the movie? Pretty much everything. The acting was top notch in this movie everyone does a good job in it. The action was great but the movie is great without action. Tom Hardy as Bane is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen. I likes the characters, the story everything. The one gripe that people might have is that it is very dark. But even that is not a real issue. In the end I loved this movie I recommend it to everyone an even though its not as good as The Dark Knight its still an amazing movie."

Performance of each actor in the movie is outstanding.Before I saw the movie I thought that Anne Hathaway wouldn't be as good cat-woman as Michelle Pfeiffer was, but not only was she better, she blew Michelle away. All the special effects are amazing and unbelievable. I have to say I love some of the batman's new toys. I have seen it in V Max theater last night but I am going to see it again in I MAX because Its worth the experience. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes but it felt like 30 minutes and I wanted more. 10 stars is not enough for such a great movie. I recommend to all movie lovers out there to go and see it in cinemas."

        "review_title": "The Dark Knight Rises and Falls (NO SPOILERS)",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises and Falls. I cannot put it in more simpler words than that.\n\nI went in there with my coffers full of hope of having my mind blown out. After all it was Christopher Nolan and I am yet to see a work of his which has under-delivered.\n\nBut I guess everything has a first time.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It's a good movie, not just a great one, and it left me highly confused as to how I should feel about it. TDKR, more than anything, falls under its own weight. With the endless hype and as a follow up to one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, TDKR had a lot riding on its shoulders. Tasked with this,Christopher Nolan has to be lauded for what he has achieved, or should I rather say 'hoped to'?\n\nLet's begin with the basics. The Dark Knight trilogy was not a trilogy to begin with. Batman Begins (BB) and The Dark Knight (TDK) are almost two independent Batman films with little in common in terms of a story arc other than the characters it carries forward. That given, TDKR's greatest flaw was in attempting to connect the first movie to his final one so as to make it feel like one continuous arc. (Think kind of what happened in the final season of LOST) While I understand Nolan's intentions, the forced continuity just killed it.\n\nThis was further amplified by the many plot holes that marred the story. To keep this review spoiler free I will not mention any of them here but it will suffice to say that if you are a fan of the series but are willing to look past your fanboy goggles, the failings are plain to see.\n\nTom Hardy's take on the superstrong Bane was interesting enough to start off with, but as it went on there were just too many similarities with a previous villain (I will not say which one) to actually stand out on his own. Even his motives and methods were too familiar to be regarded as novel. His fights with Batman were epic enough though, and you almost pity Batman for having to face the mini-hulk that Hardy had transformed himself into. His menacing voice coupled with the cold hard stare in his eyes gave him the aura of a truly awful foe, one that must not be triffled with.\n\nBut add to that some cringe worthy dialogues, forgetful action sequences and appalling acting by Marion Cotillard, and I find myself subtracting more from the movie than adding. Nolan needed to make this movie bigger and better than the previous two, and for that he needed a crisis large enough to destroy Batman's world. While he did manage to conjur up a scheme, its immensity and implausibility made it hard to believe. I really wanted to love this movie but far too often found myself shaking my head in dismay as things got grander and larger, until they no more fit into the world.\n\nBut while I might seem to be cursing the movie a lot, remember I did say it is a good movie. And the best thing for me in the movie was - wait for it - Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle.\n\nI will confess that when I had first heard the casting I was more than dismayed. But now I'm forced to eat my own words. Anne Hathaway was brilliant. She might not be your regular comic book version of Selina Kyle, but in Nolan's Dark Knight universe she was the perfect choice to portray Gotham's sexiest vigilante. Everything from her stance to her fight moves and to the way she spouted sassy dialogues was perfect. Given more time and space, I am sure she could have probably stolen the show.\n\nThat however would have been unfair to Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne/Batman. The man has been a constant shining light throughout the series. He is a perfect fit for the role and has carried both versions of his character almost flawlessly. Moving into his third (and final) film in the series, I am glad to say he has not faltered a bit. While BB was about Batman, and TDK about the Joker, this movie was about Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask. As a superhero who is a mere mortal compared to most others out there, TDKR's focus on Bruce Wayne's mortality was totally warranted. This was not a Batman movie. This was a Bruce Wayne movie, with his alter ego guest starring. TDKR plays out like the swansong it is to this great character Bale and Nolan have moulded over the years.\n\nGary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are as dependable as usual. They provided stellar performances as always. Even the newcomer to series - Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a fine performance as the hotheaded cop John Blake. His character was by far one of the most interesting in the movie, developing into interesting dimensions, but alas finally being let down partly by the story and mostly by the limited run time that a movie of this scope can afford to a new character.\n\nAll in all, TDKR is a fine movie, but sadly nothing more. While I thoroughly enjoyed the ending (the last 5-10 minutes) and a bunch of scenes here and there, the action sequenced seemed bland, and the motives for some of the main characters left a lot to be desired. Batman was great as usual, but Bruce Wayne was better. And given the track-record of threequels, TDKR is a comparatively great ending to a great series, even if it is not all that it could have been. Probably the weakest entry to the series but nonetheless a wholesome entertainer on its own merits. Just don't expect to be blown away."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises is a brilliant,excellent and masterful epic conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy. Filled with excellent direction,wonderful performances,great Action and epic storytelling,The Dark Knight Rises is Christopher Nolan at his best.\n\nSet eight years after the events in The Dark Knight,Batman/Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has been a recluse and retired as Batman and Gotham City has been at peace as well as safe and quiet. But when a new threat and terrorist named Bane(Tom Hardy)comes into Gotham City and threatens to destroy and demolish Gotham,Batman must come out of retirement to fight and face Bane and save the city of Gotham from destruction.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises is a powerful and unforgettable conclusion to The Dark Knight Trilogy,it is a film that loved since I saw it in theaters and I cannot understand why the film has gotten a mixed to negative reception with most Batman fans. I guess because this film came out after Nolan's other films The Dark Knight and Inception which raised the bar really high when it comes to filmmaking and were universally loved by everyone and comparing this film with the other two this film can be seen as letdown for most people but not to me. The Dark Knight Rises is an Epic in the truest since of the word because Nolan has created a film that is big not only in length(2 Hours and 45 minutes)but in scope as well bringing everything to higher level whether it's the Action or the storyline. The film was so epic it probably would be longer with an overture like the epics of the 50s and 60s. Most of the time the third film in the trilogy is usually seen as the weakest but Nolan is a smart filmmaker who knows that if you are going to complete a trilogy you have to go out with a huge bang and TDKR goes out with not only a bang but with explosions. What I love about TDK Trilogy is that while all of them are three connected films all them are different in story. If Batman Begins is an origin story and Action/Adventure and The Dark Knight is a Crime Drama then TDKR can be described as a War Film. TDKR is War Film in sense where there are armies rising and gangs are controlling the streets with power,guns and tanks and Gotham is divided like a Civil War between the rich and poor or cops and criminals. With the theme of War and control running throughout the film you pulled into a Dystopian nightmare where Gotham City is being held hostage and not the cops or government can do anything about it and the only person that can do anything about is Batman. In TDKR we see not only the physical but also the mental toll being Batman has had on Bruce Wayne. Bruce has become broken down and a recluse and the damage of being Batman has affected his friendships and relationships or lack there of. Bane is such a great villain because where The Joker in TDK wanted to make people evil and corrupt and wanted to burn Gotham,Bane wants the people of Gotham to take control and take back the city of Gotham from the corrupt and the rich and create a revolution and army and still wants to destroy Gotham City. Bane is villain unlike Batman has ever faced before because Bane can match Batman on no only a physical level but on an intelligence level as well. The Action scenes in the film are amazing and like the first two films are done in a realistic way. Each Action scene is handled with a great deal of suspense and build up and this time it is done on an big scale to match the epic feel of the film. When the Action in the film happens you are glued to the screen and mesmerized. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and it will blow you away with it's filmmaking and craft. The ending will have you cheering and smiling and it is a great conclusion to this film and The Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\nThe cast does an excellent jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent in his final performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing the same depth and intensity to the role. Tom Hardy is simply brilliant and scary as Bane,with using his voice,eyes and body language for the performance. Hardy's performance in my opinion makes Bane one of the best villains in film history. Gary Oldman is great once again as Jim Gordan,with Oldman bringing cynicism and depth to the role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Blake,an idealistic rookie cop. Anne Hathaway is wonderful and sexy as Catwoman/Selina Kyle and has great scenes with Bale. Marion Cotillard does a great job as Miranda,Bruce's other love interest. Morgan Freeman excels once again as Lucius Fox,Batman's weapon maker. Michael Caine is amazing once again as Alfred. Caine's final scenes with Bale are powerful and well-acted. Matthew Modine(Foley)and Ben Mendelsohn(Daggett)give good performances as well.\n\nThe direction by Christopher Nolan is excellent and brilliant,with Nolan always moving the camera and having great shots and camera angles and giving the film an epic feel and Nolan does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction by Nolan.\n\nThe score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and intense and matches the dark and epic tone of the film. A great memorable score by Zimmer.\n\nIn final word,if you love Batman,Christopher Nolan,Comic Book films,Superhero films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Dark Knight Rises,a brilliant,masterful and epic conclusion to an excellent trilogy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Words cannot adequately describe how awesome this movie is! It is everything you thought it would be and much more. Most certainly a beautifully crafted psychological crime thriller and a truly satisfying conclusion that does justice to the trilogy. Batman isn't exactly the cool hero with fancy gadgets nor is he the strongest. His inner strength is tested, he is physically and mentally pushed to his limits and all odds are against him. What an epic finale!\n\nChristian Bale as always is perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane almost steals the show. Unlike Batman's mask where you get to see the emotions through eyes and mouth of the actor, Bane's mask covers his entire mouth, leaving only his eyes in view. Despite an obscured face, actor Tom Hardy seems to have found a way to brilliantly express his emotions physically! He projects Bane's character, the strength, pain, attitude and the darkness by movements and body language alone! Bane is as intellectual as he is strong, which makes him genuinely terrifying. He is easily the most formidable of all Batman villains in the trilogy and simply owned the scenes he was in.\n\nHans Zimmer does an excellent job with the background score that sets the pace of the movie and compliments the visual artistry. The music makes you feel the excitement and energy of the movie. Both Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do justice to their characters. Hathaway is believable as Catwoman. Last but not the least, Michael Caine gives a very effective and heartfelt performance as Alfred.\n\nThe special effects in this movie are so good, that it seems very real. The Batpod, which made its appearance in Dark Knight is back in this movie and it is exceedingly cool. But wait till you see 'The Bat'!\n\nThis movie has a stellar start, will keep you on the edge of your seat with adrenaline-pumping action sequences, intense drama both emotional and dark, has several layers of the story interweaving with frequent curve balls thrown in. But the movie never loses momentum, it ultimately sets you up for a fantastic climax and probably a very unpredictable yet satisfying end. It will keep you guessing till the very last second and that is the magic of Christopher Nolan's amazing masterpiece, The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nI will give this movie 10 out of 10."

Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight rises is easily the most anticipated film of the year and has a lot to live up to with the previous two entries just seeming to get better and better. With the same creative team intact, can Nolan and Bale pull off the ultimate finale to their trilogy and deliver the film we've all been waiting for or will it fall to the dreaded bad third film syndrome that seems to plague most series?\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises continues the journey of Batman eight years after he took the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent. Forced back into action to take on the terrorist Bane, the Dark Knight returns to protect the city that looks at him as an enemy. The Dark Knight was a brilliant film on numerous levels so going in this film already had a big hurdle to overcome. While it may not have completely overshadowed the previous entry, it easily finds its place on equal ground. This final entry to the Nolan series continues to bring these three films together becoming essentially one long film. Rises brings new realm of personal journey to numerous characters old and new. Christian Bale steps back into the role like he never left bringing a new pain that seems to elevate both Wayne and Batman to another level. Most fans will be happy to know that while the growl like voice is still here, it is toned down a bit so not to be quite as off putting. Michael Caine is given a bit more to do taking the character study between Alfred and Wayne that has been building and he delivers more of his motivational and emotional speeches like only he can. Gary Oldman gets a bit more to do as well getting to channel the Gordon we have been waiting for since the beginning. Tom Hardy steps into the role of Bane, a character that is met with mixed emotions. Known in the comics as the villain that broke the bat, has had many incarnations, most of them not all that good and not widely known to those that aren't comic fans. Believe it or not, Nolan has taken a fairly single dimension character and brought to life a destructive force that smashes through this film with no remorse. The big surprise was Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. She seemed to be channeling some of the previous versions, most notably that of the 60's series minus the camp. She really makes this character work bringing the sexiness as well as a more empowered woman aspect to the character. She is easily the best incarnation of this character so far.\n\nThe story is well crafted bringing all the characters together along with the story to create an epic piece of filmmaking. There are numerous levels to the story that worked well for every character giving each of them their own small story without ever making the film feel overcrowded or forced. It takes a bit to get going, but not in a bad way. There are some pretty heavy moments that push this film along, but will keep you away from the action for longer than you may want. Much like the source material this trilogy is a character study of the inner struggles of a man and not so much about the action. Make no mistake there are plenty of action sequences, each bigger than the next. Nolan has slowed the action down a bit, namely during the fight scenes letting the viewer finally get a better glimpse of the Dark Knight in action. Kudos to Nolan as gone are most of the fancy well-choreographed fights and in their place is a brutality that is needed to make the Bane story work.\n\nThis is not only a great film, but a brilliant cap to an already brilliant series. It's a truly amazing experience to see this film come to life and wrap up a series that has continued to get better and better. There are plenty of moments that will make both comic and non-comic fans alike smile and cheer. Nolan has stamped his mark on the Batman universe and has done something almost never thought possible. He has delivered a brilliant Batman trilogy and managed to keep the entire brilliant cast in tact all the way down to members of the Wayne Corp board members. This is a film that will make you cheer and sad that it is coming to an end. As this series comes to an end and the credits role you will find yourself sighing in relief and happiness knowing Nolan pulled it off and wondering what's next for the Batman."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ultimately, this is an excellent film, but after seeing this as part of an all night trilogy viewing, I have to say it is not as good as The Dark Knight.\n\nThe film opens with, strangely for Nolan a quite farcical scene that introduces Bane. I won't spoil it, but please tell me, who takes 3 unknown prisoners on a plane without even looking at their faces? Really??\n\nThe proper story starts, and to chose words like jaded, withdrawn, cynical, tired, lethargic and disconnected, is how we find our hero and Police commissioner. So ultimately this is how the audience is manipulated into feeling too, and so act 1 is ultimately a long \"downer\" as lots of elements are put in place for the last 2 acts. But, after sitting through six hours of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I was left feeling it was too much, and I started getting bored with the overall emotional shade of the film, coupled with the lack of action and the lack of any real story. It was like watching a plate spinner getting 40 plates spinning on pointy poles, necessary for his act, but ultimately boring for his audience.\n\nThe second Act is where our bad guy makes his play and gains the upper hand. One of the strongest sources of praise for The Dark Knight, is the ultimately real-world story telling. But what Bane unleashes on Gotham, takes us back to the more comic book villainy of the first film, which I won't criticise, but for me is not as rewarding as the realism of the second film. All the while our good guys are slow, wrong footed, and creaking under their mental baggage, so we are two thirds through a superhero film, where our superhero has been anything but. Action has been thin on the ground, and we have all been through the ringer, and we are crying for some redeeming pay-off.\n\nAfter the third act, our her is restored, all has been put right. However, ultimately our pay-off for all we have been put through in the first two acts is only satisfying if you can shrug off the memory of what you have just been put through. It's much like childbirth, you need your brain to be swimming with endorphins to blank out the pain of labour, and for me, I didn't get enough endorphins to make the experience totally rewarding.\n\nAdd to this, a slightly facial bad-guy twist, and a groan-worthy sequel shoe-in, I have to say that Nolan has tried to squeeze in far too much, and Batman's saga creeps over the line, rather than ending with a bang, so much so, you will feel convinced that this is not the final part of the story, and we will need another installment to accept that our hero has sailed off into the sunset."

Not merely great, but the \"great-est\" superhero film of all time. The story is iconic and majestic in scope. The script not merely good, it borders on perfection. The performances are nothing less than stunning.\n\nBale and Oldman could not give a bad performance even if you asked them. Hathaway has never looked this good, her height and frame infusing her Catwoman with a vibe never seen before or since. And the almost-invisible Tom Hardy (one of the greatest actors of our age, BTW) makes Bane as interesting a character, if not moreso, than even Darth Vader himself.\n\nSo why did this review take me 5 years? To discover the dissonance between the three parts of the trilogy, which is the only flaw, the Achilles Heel of the boxed set.\n\nOrdinarily a trilogy should be harmonious and consistent. Look at the original Lord of the Rings as the best example. Each part not only stands on its own but, taken in sequence, the story builds, the characters become clearer, everything works to a conclusion.\n\nLike an orchestra reaching a crescendo.\n\nNot so here. The whole is weakened by the sum of the parts. Batman Begins is, frankly, sloppy. Great ideas and even great performances are lost in a weak narrative with a unsatisfying conclusion.\n\nThe Dark Knight has become iconic in its own right but not because of the way it continues the story, but rather because of the amazing one-of-a-kind performance by Ledger.\n\nIt is only when we get to Part 3 that we achieve perfection. This film is not merely better than than the first two, it may be the best film of its genre, ever."

Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"

Everything looks so perfect here, right from the starting, till the end credits roll. Even though i am not an ardent fan of action/superhero movies, I liked the first two installments of the series, so the expectation for this was so huge. And to be frank, i am happy with the outcome. Ii is brilliant in every aspect. Nolan's direction is top-notch and he is the real hero of the movie. I even felt goosebumps in certain sequences. I do not want to reveal the story much, but what i can say is, this one is a must for every movie lover. Such an awesome performance from Tom Hardy! I was just amazed to see him perform Bane. Christian Bale is no less, he is literally perfect reprising his role from the previous two films. The other actors have done good job. But i missed Heath Ledger, may his soul rest in peace. Anyway, what i have to say is, do not miss this film, lest it is a real loss for you. I would like to rate it 8.5/10, And Hats off to Nolan and the entire crew for giving us such a cinematic experience."

It showed Bruce's face behind the Batman mask and did so believably. Like we all know the Joker took the spotlight in the previous film and the first one was more Batman action. So we got a trilogy with a balanced focus between the guise, the seamlessly corrupt and the person behind the guise. Which is nice.\n\nAs a movie about the struggling person behind the mask this was, for me, the most touching out of the three films. And the most hope inducing, seeing Bruce Wayne recollect himself from the pit and rise to stand on his own feet. Re-mustering his courage and will."

The casting is perfect. I was surprised by some of the characters that were added. I would have liked to see the story line continued though. It is a bit of a let down that they didn't incorporate more of the villains.Or even continue the series to include cooperative adventures for multiple DC heroes.It is great that they managed to keep all of the same actors from the previous movies. It irritated me when they changed the actress who played Rachel. I think that this is a good date movie or movie for a family with older children. Of course it is great for a guys night. Make sure you have you popcorn ready."

        "review_detailed_main": "Another achievement by Nolan Bros. and Warner Bros... Thanks to its huge budget available (ca 230 million USD) one could use state-of-the-art technology and employ a dream-team of actors of different generations: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt... And they got the opportunity to have elaborated roles to play, not just appearing in the background; Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth is probably the finest of the great ones. Moreover, it is no comic strip movie, but an epic story of universal values, attitudes and issues, with superhero and sci-fi moments complementing the script, not governing it.\n\nMinuses from me due to length (ca 2,5 hours) and too obvious references/comparisons with characters from other hit movies (e.g. Hannibal, Catwoman, James Bond). But still, the movie is worth watching and recommendable!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Before I get down-voted because I'm not giving 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 10 (the trend most of the users on her seem to be following), I'll list the numbers of things I really enjoyed about the film, and there were plenty.\n\n-The cast Nolan's able to put together to end his trilogy is really something to marvel at. From the veterans of the series (Bale, Freeman, Caine, Oldman) to the new faces (Gordon-Levitt, Cotillard, Hathway, Hardy) each bring their all to their characters, even if a few are somewhat undeveloped (more on that later).\n\n-Action scenes. 'Batman Begins,' while I admire it for it's first look at the gritty take to the comic formula, had some incredible poor and incomprehensible fight scenes, where it was unclear how who punching what or what was happening. In 'The Dark Knight,' the scenes were much more clear, a big improvement. Here, the fighting scenes are at their best. When Baine and Batman throw down, it's some of the most intense fight scenes I've seen in a long time.\n\n-Huge setpieces. I could say that about all of these movies, but in this film especially. Gotham City is beautifully recognized. It's always great to see a huge place like this down naturally, never been plagued by artificial CGI (Nolan uses as little as possible.) Not to mention the number of extras, which number in the thousands.\n\n-The ending. Even if it jumps the shark, the ending to Nolan's epic trilogy is overall fulfilling. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, even if the casual might\n\nNot that that's out of the way, the problems I had with the film. . .\n\n-Bane's voice. When we first meet Bane, on a plane, his voice was nearly unbearable. It sounded like something a ten-year-old would do when playing with audio effects on his computer. The dialogue didn't help, as he spewed out clunky one-liners. Here was Bane, with his terrifying appearance,sounding like a cartoon. It did improve over the ocurse of the movie, but the first introduction to the character was something I almost couldn't shake off.\n\n-Too many character introductions. Maybe this is a criticism of the whole trilogy, but I'll have to put the blame on this one. Too many characters are brought in, with their developments feeling rushed. It almost appears like Nolan adds these new additions to the script at the last minute.\n\nFor the most part, the good outweighs the bad. It's a very entertaining film and, as far as summer blockbusters, it's definitely worth the price of admission.\n\n7/10"

Nolan delivers a spectacular conclusion to the best trilogy I've ever witnessed in the cinemas. Every camera shot, order of scenes, and the dialogue was so meticulously delivered, it sets the bar pretty damn close to perfection.\n\nLets start off with the actors, Christian Bale reprised the role of Batman brilliantly. Failure, redemption, and all the emotions that took part in his character, Bale delivered and did to convincingly. Anne Hathaway, although she had big shoes to fill (pheiffer) did not disappoint. I could see why a younger fresher actress beaten out the likes of Angeline Jolie and Charlize Theron for the role. The Selina Kyle in Nolan's interpretation was cunning, intelligent, beautiful, deadly and yet humane. The veterans (john michael cane, morgan freeman) were fantastic as expected. The real surprise for me was Tom Hardy. The manifestation of Bane. The first thing that came to my mind while I was walking out of the theater was how much fear the character had conveyed. Not only in his own actions but how people reacted to his character. I am sort of tired so I will stop here. I must say though, to all who love bashing movies, save it for another. This movie is one to see. Don't wait for it come out on bluray or download it, go to the theater and watch it. It is not a movie, but an experience."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan does not make simple movie anymore, does he? I was emotionally exhausted right from the start to finish in this captivating 2 hours and 45 minutes of viewing, I barely have time to digest the richness of its storytelling and it lingered in my mind long after experienced it.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is a fitting epic ending to the most compelling, ambitious superhero movie trilogy ever. In term of audaciousness, the closest I can think of is another DC Comics, Watchmen (Snyder, 2009), without a doubt you are looking at the pinnacle of superhero comic movie adaptation in these two. Both have equal brooding style, Watchmen has a superior narrative style because it is benefited from a direct existing material while Nolan's Batman trilogy punches pure entertainment with accessibility to both general audience and comic geeks.\n\nBy the 3rd part of trilogy, gone are the days of the main characters' introduction, where we are straight to the engrossing pay off time.Batman's vehicle evolved from Tumbler who looks like tank to a two-wheels Batpod to The Bat that fly with ease (yes, Lucius Fox confirms that it comes in black colour). The story sets 8 years after the event of The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne went into long hiatus. The newcomer Anne Hathaway plays the role of Catwoman. Under normal circumstances, she and Catwoman do not belongs to the same bracket, but somehow she pull it off with the seductive performance coupled with the touch of insecurity from her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays as a closed aide to Commissioner Gordon. Meanwhile, Marion Cottillard is an important figure in Wayne Enterprise.\n\nThe main villain, Bane is played by Tom Hardy where his presence on the screen is downright menacing. He is physically tough and hulky. He may not be as intimidating as Joker, but somehow I fear for anyone who is near to him because he seems like he would snap the neck of the person standing next be it his henchmen or enemy. I really felt for Batman during one of the brutal knuckle fight with Bane. He absolutely gives Batman a painful thumping. On the grand scale, he masterminded a sinister plan for the downfall of Gotham City. He strikes the people of Gotham with fear, he actually gives the Gotham citizens some faint hope before striking it down with furious vengeance, all before the eyes of a helpless Bruce Wayne. Given the fleshed out background story, it is obvious Bane is the most complex villain in TDK trilogy.\n\nI am pleased that we are now at the second decade of the golden age of superhero comic movie adaptation where there are plenty of choices we are spoilt of. The sky is the limit as far as CGI is concern, nowadays no matter how transcendent the comic is, the cinema medium just easily lift the concept from the comic book panels. While Joss Whedon's The Avengers is fun, loud, a kind of borderline juvenile stuff, TDKR on the other hand is a serious, realistic, brooding, Gothic feel drama. It stings to say this because I am a huge follower of Joss. Let me reiterate that The Dark Knight Rises is an epitome to action-orientated movie; not just limit to superhero comic adaptation genre. Whoever wants to remake a movie about Batman after Christopher Nolan, I wish him/her best of luck.\n\nMy movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/"

        "review_detailed_main": "I would like to suggest that researching anything to deep about this film is a bad idea. Go into it with a clean slate. The experience will be ruined for you if you do not.\n\nREVIEW IN SUMMARY:\n\nThe movie was phenomenal. It never slows, and I was surprised it was over when the time came. If you've disliked the pacing of past Nolan films, you will be fine with this one. This movie has incredible acting, a beautiful story, and is the perfect end to the Trilogy.\n\nFULL REVIEW:\n\nFor starters, the Nolan brothers have created a masterpiece of a script. The themes explored in this film are stirring, and inspiring. The story is beautiful, and full of depth. Those of you looking for a simple mindless thriller will probably find this film to be, \"alright\", but you won't get the hype behind it. You won't understand everyone's obsession with this film. If you haven't liked Nolan's previous work, you won't like this one. It's not about the action, or the simple mindless battles many superhero movies today are all about. It's not as simple as those are. But do not despair, there is more large scale action in this then any of the other Batman films thus far.\n\nBut, it is easy to follow. Even if you haven't seen the other movies in the franchise you will understand it. The other movies add depth, so I suggest you see the other two films before you see this one, but all the same you'll be able to follow it.\n\nChris Nolan tells the story well. It wasn't as choppy and unorganized as some of his past films. This one is by far his best work.\n\nTom Hardy brings an elegance to the villain of Bane that is addicting. Yes, you read right, and elegance. Class. He is a classy villain, whose motivations are understandable, and frighteningly relatable. This is, in my opinion, his best work aside from Warrior.\n\nAs far as comparisons to the Joker go, it's like comparing an apple to an orange. Except when you bight into Bane, and the threat he presents, you'll forget the Joker even existed.\n\nAnne Hathaway won't be disappointing. I know I, like many of you, was worried when we saw that name on the cast list. But she does fine.\n\nThis movie will stir your emotions. Satisfy your need for action. Satisfy your need for Batman. And satisfy your need for insurmountable villains. It will also satisfy those who have read the comics. Although this story does not follow in exactness to any original comic, Nolan cleverly manipulates the characters to fit the comic agenda, in a more \"modern\" or \"realistic\" sense.\n\nThis film is full of surprises. So I suggest you stop reading these reviews, avoid potential spoilers, and go enjoy the show."

Christopher Nolan is the best Director out there, the way he makes you become part of the movie and feel the same feeling of every character you see is just magical, and add to that the fantastic music of Hans Zimmer, not to mention the Perfect Selection of the Actors and Actresses in this movie. Before The Dark Knight all of us used to watch super hero movies and consider them the kind of thing that would never happen in real life but things changed after the epic clash between batman and the Joker, The Dark Knight Rises even make it more reasonable it makes you think that if there was a batman he would be exactly like this. and it is being proved in each scene as you go through the movie, how hard it is to live with the cruelty of bane, how it is really hard to find weapons and devices to use that they use everything they got (unlike other action movies that everyone suddenly have a 100 gun when it is time to fight) it is like what would really happen if Bane came to your city and Batman was to defend it. in other words you can call this movie a masterpiece,if you didn't watch it yet then what are you waiting for?"

The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.\n\nBane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good \"Catwoman\" (I say \"surprisingly\" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.\n\nMy only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.\n\nBut don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a quality Batman film.\n\nThe film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.\n\nGRADE: B+"

        "review_detailed_main": "So let me start out with the negatives. This film was the least great of the three in my opinion. It had some major plot holes and confusion at the ending. But that's also something that made it great, because it is an ending that could be interpreted in different ways. So in one way, it could not be seen as a major plot hole although it has in my book. Anywho, the main antagonist Bane is one of my favorites. Find out in the film to see why, because it sure took me by a bit of surprise. On the other hand, some other appearances were quite obvious to be, but still enjoyable nonetheless. In general Christopher Nolan has made an epic trilogy that surely will stay a classic over the years to follow."

On the other hand it shows Bruce really becoming the hero without mask, he learns that fear is good to have as it makes one stronger and vigilant. The way this story is narrated is surreal. For me this is the peak Batman. The character arcs are shown in way, where you can connect with them, the way it shows that all you need is courage to fight the tyranny and heroes do have flaws too. Such superhero movies are gone now in the era of over preaching content and heavy visuals."

        "review_detailed_main": "Immediately, probably, it should be stipulated that I'm not a fan of superhero films, I'm not a fan of comics, and even from cartoons, I'd rather have chosen \"Tom and Jerry\" than a cartoon about Batman. But despite all the first two films of the trilogy described above, I liked them very much. The reason for this is probably the cool, noir atmosphere of Gotem created by the directors, the fine acting and, of course, the good script stories. Well, after such a long introduction, it is logical to ask the question, what about the third part? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! In the final part of the trilogy there is absolutely nothing that I liked in the first two previous parts of the trilogy. The weakest part of the film is probably the script, and this fact is very surprising, as Christopher in all his works spent a lot of time developing the script (which is only the scenario of \"Memento\"). Think about the reasons why the script in this picture is so weak you can endlessly. It is worth saying that most of the film is trying to build an exhibition, to reveal the main actors, but the author does not get it in the end, half the time is incredibly boring watching. So the script is so drawn and adjusted for the denouement that it's simply impossible not to notice it, it simply contradicts all laws of logic and healthy meaning. The performances of some scenes are very depressing, many battle scenes also give up cretinism, and it is not clear how they can be looked at. Yes, in the end, Christopher prepared his own story twist, but even he did not work and was predictable and boring. And as for the final scenes, I'm sorry, I could not stand it, how much forgiveness do I have to spit on all the laws of physics, science and just common sense, what would come up with this ?! Well, in general, with the plot all. The second question that arose after watching where the atmosphere of Gotham City had gone? Yes, she just took and evaporated not that noir style for which I loved the first two films of the trilogy, now Gotham is an ordinary boring metropolis, which is simply not interesting to watch. Why was this done or why? There are no answers, alas, it's sad. Well, the last point is an actor's game. Yes, I did not expect something outstanding. In principle, there was nothing outstanding on the screen, all that was that good actors gave out a good game and in sum with the above described it looked again extremely boring and not interesting. It's time to sum up and draw some conclusions. This picture is the weakest in the filmography of a good director Christopher Nolan. As it is not surprising, but basically the script was let down, of course, as a result of which the whole film is simply impossible to watch, the atmosphere and appeal were lost as in the two previous parts of the trilogy. Who can recommend this film, well, probably only to fans of superhero cinema and comic book fans. To all other lovers of good cinema, this film is by no means worth watching. I have everything."

This stuff is candy for superhero aficionados, and Nolan manages to balance a large cast without shortchanging anyone. Drawn from his slumber by mysterious cat burglar Selina Kyle, the Batman faces what may be his biggest and most dangerous test yet as Bane wields a nuclear explosive and threatens to detonate. Secrets from the past are revealed, and loose ends tied. Tremendous support from Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mariana Cotilliard, and others. This is a film to make you stand up and cheer. Fun comic fable, perhaps not up to the standard of the prior classic, but does amazing things with it's large budget and well worth viewing."

During the movie I turned to my girlfriend and said \"$20 says she ends up being a bad guy at the end.\" needless to say I got a pat on the head later.\n\nIs the movie good? Yes. Is the movie great? Depends.... it is great for the fans of the movies but in general its not a masterpiece. I feel it deserve a 8 on IMDb at the very best. The fact that its so high rated right now is pretty unrealistic.\n\nEveryone saying Bane was the greatest villain of all time with amazing acting? I disagree... I still think Heath did a better job as the Joker. I feel Bane was a cool character but I don't feel he at all lived up to the hype provided in other reviews.\n\nThe movie is a must see for the year, but it is something you can watch on DVD and still get the same effect. No idea how they spent so much money on this movie... the action wasn't that good."

Is it better than The Dark Knight? That's debatable. It's a very different type of movie.

        "review_title": "The Conclusion We Deserve",
        "review_detailed_main": "The unprecedented fervor surrounding the release of the final Batman film of Christopher Nolan's highly acclaimed trilogy is something we probably should have seen coming. Fans of the films are rabid about the movies getting their just dues, and it's become the (unfortunate) habit of many a fanboy to go ballistic on anyone who is a naysayer. That said, these people are devotees of the series for a reason: each of the two previous offerings have been nothing short of fantastic, and there was no reason to believe that the third\u2014and final\u2014installment, The Dark Knight Rises, would be any different.\n\nThe question that's on everyone's mind, of course, is if it really does meet (and ultimately exceed) the impossibly high standards set by its predecessors. The answer is a resounding \"yes.\" The Dark Knight Rises is incredibly ambitious and incredibly satisfying; it's also the best film of the trilogy.\n\nAllow me to explain why.\n\nIn both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Gotham was in peril. Madmen assailed the city's citizens for varying reasons\u2014some more concrete than others\u2014while a troubled hero in Bruce Wayne sought to use his resources (namely access to incredibly advantageous weaponry and a whole slew of kick-assery he obtained while a brief member of the League of Shadows) to disarm those would see the town destroyed. While his character has always been interesting, Bruce Wayne hasn't been a truly engrossing dramatic figure. That all changes with The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nHere, we see Bruce/Batman's tragedy and redemption come around full circle. At the start of the movie, Wayne is a man crippled by the exploits he's undertaken as the caped crusader. He's a recluse who's holed up in Wayne Manor. As we're allowed to see him move beyond exchanging witty barbs with his longtime butler (and caretaker) Alfred Pennyworth, the emotional pay-dirt finally emerges, and the character\u2014in the words of the late Ra's Al Ghul\u2014becomes more than just a man. He becomes the embodiment of grief; here, it's clear that there's a tangible psychological block that's eating Bruce from the inside out. The first hour of Rises is devoted to mining this pain, and it makes Bale's portrayal of Bruce more accessible than ever.\n\nThen there's the action, which hits its stride about halfway through the production. Once it gets going, it's relentless and, for lack of a better word, harrowing. Everything that's happening in the streets of Gotham has weight behind it, as the city faces a challenge unlike anything that's come before.\n\nI feel like I'm on the verge of spilling the beans about some major plot points, so I'll wind things down by saying that the supporting cast\u2014Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle\u2014are all splendid. They each bring something crucial to their characters, and not a moment of screen time is wasted.\n\nI don't need to tell you this, but if you haven't already purchased your ticket for Nolan's epic conclusion to what will go down as one of the best trilogies in movie history, then you need to get on the ball. After all, this is one of those rare occurrences in cinema\u2014the emergence of a truly great movie that actually lives up to every ounce of hype.\n\nNicely done, Mr. Nolan. You deserve the Oscar nods that are surely coming your way."

From Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Gary Oldman the list goes on and they make this movie well worth it.\n\nYou really feel for Bruce Wayne the most in this movie (because its a batman film) and the ending has the best pay off ever and is very emotional and satisfying. One of the best things about this movie is when you watch it more than once you pick up on things you may have missed which i find more gratifying in a movie, its like watching it all over again and those movies to me are the best, its definitely not a one and done type of movie so you get your moneys worth. This movie definitely deserves the praise it has. Its going to be a long time until someone makes a comic book trilogy as brilliant as this one. Thank you Nolan."

Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.\n\nIn 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most \u2013 bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City \u2013 Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.\n\nBut in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life \u2013 SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word \"light\" a new name.\n\nNow we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synomous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors \u2013 is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.\n\nFor 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale \u2013 you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard \u2013 you guys defined evil. Thank you.\n\nBatman will live in our hearts for years to come."

His allies are few, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to save his city and its people...\n\nOne of the best features of the film is its special effects; also why I enjoyed it so much. They were all amazingly good, with the stadium explosion being one of the top movie scenes this year!\n\nWhat's more, another point I have to mention is the acting; Bale is as convincing as ever, while Hardy is the perfect villain. The rest of the cast, including Anne Hathaway as Catwoman and Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon remains at its finest.\n\nAll in all, I found the film more enjoyable than any other this year.

Was surpirsed to see so many great actors, including old Stargate-star Christopher Judge in the side role. Can't give away much, so I'm not writing any more. I'm just saying, watch it as soon as you can!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films.\n\nAnne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nTaking place eight years after the events of \"The Dark Knight\", the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?\n\nEight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nChristopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nAlthough \"The Dark Knight Rises\" never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is.\n\nR.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.\n\n8.8/10 Score: A- Studio: Warner Bros. Starring: Christain Bale, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman Director/Producer/Writer/Story: Christopher Nolan Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2Hrs. 45Mins.

        "review_detailed_main": "First things first. Bane is not the Joker. While the Joker was chaotic,Baneis a mercenary. Ruthless and destructive. When the prologue was shown during MI4, many had voiced concerns about the muffled voice of Bane.That has been corrected to an extent.For those who don't follow comic books,Bane is the villain who broke the bat. And Tom Hardy has done justification to Bane. Mind you when there is a mask covering your face and you sound as a megaphone, it makes your job a little difficult. But his physical presence and his eyes expresses what needs to be expressed.\n\nBefore you walk into the theatre, ensure that you seen the previous two films from the trilogy as the story of TDKR is interconnected to both and you may feel lost if you haven't seen them. For those who have , it wouldn't harm to review those films again. Whilst The Dark Knight earned respect and love from worldwide audience mostly due to fact that Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. And his character shines way above Batman's or the story itself, TDKR on the other hand relies more on the story and the inter-relationship of the characters.\n\nNolan stands true to his word. It is an EPIC conclusion to the Batman trilogy. it is worthy of multiple viewings and I would suggest an IMAX viewing if possible. The scenes, the canvas are breathtaking. So are all the action scenes and of course Mr.Zimmer on the keyboard. The soundtrack fits right into the scenes and enhances the visual experience. The newly added star cast further adds to that experience and fit right into the master puzzle that Nolan has created while his old allies ensure that the movies moral compass is pointed in the right direction. The movie justifies its length of 165 mins and you won't realise how fast they went.\n\nFor me the experience would have been far more richer had I not seen Inception or any other Nolan films. Let me explain. Many of the movie scenes are executed and directed on the same lines as Inception. And since I understand how Nolan's concept works, I knew all the twist and turns before they were revealed barring one. The element of surprise wasn't there for me. TDKR is a must watch. And it is a just end to the best comic book adapted movie series ever. Enjoyed it and loved it. Rating 8/10."

        "review_title": "A Flawed, Disappointing End to the Trilogy",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with \"Batman Begins\" and continuing in \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug \"safe\" hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.\n\nStill, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.\n\nThe acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.\n\nThe cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.\n\nIf then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle."

        "review_title": "Flawed but Unbroken - A Fitting Finale",
        "review_detailed_main": "Following a movie event like Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) is a dangerous game, but then Nolan is a dangerous player. His curious obsession with masculine identity, psychological schisms and the dark night of the soul gave \"Batman Begins\" (2005) a sense of edgy 'reality' that ingratiated him to critics and a good deal of the public, even if it alienated some hard-core Batfans with its customized and highly Nolan-esque take on the Caped Crusader. When his second installment braved the frontier of openly post-9/11 superhero parables, and in so doing gave the late Heath Ledger platform to truly wow audiences and critics the world over, the British director seemed to have galvanized 'superhero noir' as the new benchmark in comic book film adaptation. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) is his final word on the subject, and while this reviewer feels that it is not a film fit to win over any dissenters or greatly deter any fanatics, it is very largely successful in what it tries to do and its failings are certainly not for a lack of trying.\n\nThe first hour or so of the film is a whirlwind of plot necessities that, despite the running time of 165 minutes, probably needed another half an hour or so to unfold with sensicality. They involve introductions to John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - a rookie cop raised in a city orphanage who apparently \"still believes in the Batman\", even though as far as the audience is concerned he may as well have just moved to Gotham last week \u2013 Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) \u2013 a cat-burglar who is therefore Catwoman \u2013 and Miranda Tate (Marion Cottilard) \u2013 a high society Gothamite monetarily invested in a renewable energy program at Wayne Enterprises that has apparently gone bust, even though it seems to work just fine. Excusing a twist in the tale that seems to be there for its own sake, however, Nolan and his co-screenwriter (also known as his brother Jonathan) do not really abide loose ends, and by the commencement of the film's some hour-long climax all the story elements that feel disparate and murky in the beginning have intertwined and solidified into the kind of philosophically powerhouse narrative that made the first two films so effective.\n\nWhat makes the Nolan films effective is how they appropriated the inalienable tenets of the Batman legend in pursuit of an apocalyptic allegory about the post-9/11 western world. \"Batman Begins\" was a film about fear; the double edged nature of fear's power over a people and how the conquering of fear is invaluable for the pilgrimage of moral valor. \"The Dark Knight\" was a film about Terror, the kind George Bush Jr. declared war against in the early twenty-first century, and about how the greatest tool against Terror is the adherence to moral principles, even if sacrifice and compromise must be allowed for.\n\n\"The Dark Knight Rises\" provides a more accurate depiction of terroristic motives in its central villain of Bane than the \"The Dark Knight\" did with The Joker, because he holds Gotham in contempt for its status as a symbol of American first-world 'imperialism'. There has been some critical backlash against Bane as a Villain Without A Face, but this severely undermines Tom Hardy's performance, which actually achieves remarkable presence through nothing but body-language, vocal theatricality and disturbingly expressive eyes. Even without a face, Hardy effortlessly paints a convincing portrait of one who wants to dismantle the lie of Harvey Dent's legacy and incite Gotham into class-warfare riots. He purports to \"liberate\" Gotham's people, but his ultimate goal is to feed Gotham false hope before destroying the whole darn thing and everyone in it. Bane's genuine ideological conflict with western civilization is centered around the power of hope in the eventuation of despair. More than it is a film about fear or Terror, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a film about hope.\n\nIn accord with the rest of the trilogy, Bruce Wayne is not the only protagonist whose arc is built around the movie's central thematic concepts. Even the arc supplied for Selina Kyle ends up justifying her seemingly arbitrary insertion into this filmic imagining by providing a suitably dubious object of moral faith for the fallen Dark Knight. She begins with similar outlook to Bane, but the Nolans don't buy into Ra's Al Ghul's assertion that criminals aren't complicated. Everyone, and everything, is complicated.\n\nOddly enough, it's this principle that is behind most of the shortcomings of the film. It's a little *too* complicated, with the rushed series of first-act events seriously paling in comparison to the emotional impact of the conclusion, and an aforementioned twist that doesn't make much sense. There are also a lot more impossible feats performed by Bruce Wayne here than before, including a near-superhuman healing ability. And where \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\" stood alone very effectively, one can't help but feel that both films are practically required viewing for this one.\n\nBut none of that really outweighs the sheer, touching veracity of this finale and its philosophical/moral ambitions, which are all up to par with the predecessors and pay off a great deal of things with a genuine craftsmanship. This \"Batman\" series has always been about the power of symbols in a corrupted world and personal accountability in a society of structural shackles, and when Batman returns to Gotham at the top of the final act to brand his symbol in flames upon the city's largest bridge structure, we are reminded of the paradoxical purity of his message. Even as part of a system that is broken, even funded by a wealth that would perhaps do more good dispersed amongst the third world, even if no one ever knows his name, the Batman fights for the goodness of fallen people (be they cops, cat-burglars or orphans) who may otherwise have never had the chance to rise."

Cat woman aka Selina Kyle is given the major amount of the screen time and Hathway is a pretty competent Catwoman. Bane(Tom Hardy) is unfortunately all masked up so he can convey the menace only from the way he walks or talks in that Irish lilt. Michael Caine is excellent in the scenes he is in and so is Morgan Freeman. Marion cotillard is totally wasted. i could not really understand the necessity for her character in the movie and also could not fathom why an Oscar winning actor like her would go for such a two bit role. Joseph Gordon Lewitt creases his forehead throughout the movie and that is pretty much all he does. Christian Bale is above average but he cannot lift a screenplay which is weak and predictable from the very beginning. the only bright spot about the movie is its music which is better than the previous installments. This movie is a disappointment when considered in seclusion. when compared with The Dark Knight and Batman Begins, it is a f**king disaster. very very unhappy."

Tom Hardy was a beefy substitute for Heath Ledger in a hell of a villain as the merciless and destructive evil.. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise's there roles as strong as it's been throughout the series.. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fair job as the detective and he s a promising actor and the shocking 'Rise' was Marion Cotillard as 'Miranda Tate'..Anne Hatheway as CatWoman was just a sidekick and nothing much performance wise from her We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine.Nolan had ended on his own terms..If plans arise to reboot the \"Batman\" films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be... Must Watch for all Dark Knight and Nolan and movie lovers..!!"

I am a huge Batman fan, in all shapes and sizes (well, except the Joel Schumacher movies); I read the comics, watched the animated series and movies and the live action movies 2. I am intelligent enough to spot plot holes, unrealistic action scenes and 'forced' plot devices.\n\nWith those disclaimers in mind, most people who criticize this film would imagine I must hate it. And, yet, it's quite the opposite.\n\nI've just finished watching this for the 3rd time in 2 years. Yes, it's true that, the more often you watch it, the easier it is to spot things that seem off. To look at the details and to start questioning.\n\nBut...I really don't care. None of that makes this movie any less special for me. Because, truly, this movie goes to such emotional depths and gets you so in touch with the heart of what it means to be the Batman, that anything else is overshadowed.\n\nThe appeal and curse of Batman as a character is that he is human. He suffers and makes mistakes. He can be broken. He doesn't have super strength or the ability to fly. What he does have, beyond the training and the money and being 'the world's greatest detective', is his determination. His unwavering motivation to fight and win for his cause, to make Gotham safe at any cost. That's his superpower - never giving up.\n\nAnd, on top of that, he has a lot of pain and trauma; the kind that any human being will experience, at some point in their life, that is now out in the open for anyone to sympathize with.\n\nFor capturing those things and putting them on screen so beautifully, I am grateful to Mr. Nolan."

I really appreciate Nolan's creativity and presentation.What one needs was an awesome experience and not 100% logic to Action movies. The film stand all amid all minor glitches. The film has a lot of positives, The way Bruce & Tom Hardy character was portrayed, The way Real New York city was presented, The way the Whole experience stood at the end especially Bruce climbing out of the Well. Hans Zimmer Played a wonderful part in giving a master piece. All in All i would recommend everyone to watch whether they like it or not but for the cinematic experience it gives in the end.

The man is a master and did a masterful job in this third installment of the Batman saga. Bane is an enemy in which Batman has not yet seen, he's physically strong sure but his genius and ruthlessness is truly what's terrifying. He breaks Batman time and again until you almost question whether Batman can really beat him in the end (which is saying something, because we all know he has to right?). The choices of the other actors like Anne Hathaway were spot on, she was magnificent and nailed the cat women character this movie required to succeed. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Christian Bale were their own usual selves (exceptional) and I really didn't see anyone miscast or turn in anything other then a very strong performance. Overall this movie left me completely happy, the perfect ending to the perfect movie saga. These are not just great super hero movies, to me they're great films period."

The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.\n\nNolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.\n\nThe direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here.\n\nIn my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible."

The story is great and engaging, it was so good I didn't even realize that the runtime was over 2 hours. If you like dark, gritty, and/or action movies its a must watch. Also it should be noted that you should watch the first 2 films in the series otherwise some stuff might not add up. It wraps up everything in the trilogy and answers pretty much every question you could have. How it relates back to the first movie is quite impressive and after watching this one you'll probably try your best 'bane impression.' His voice is as memorable as his stature. So even if you don't like Batman you must watch it for Bane because he is that amazing. Props to Tom Hardy on his out of the park performance."

        "review_detailed_main": "Didn't think this film lived up to the hype surrounding it. It was good, don't get me wrong but it didn't compare with the Dark Knight. Seemed too full of action and definitely violence, which obscured the story somewhat.However Christian Bale played a blinder again and he has definitely made the role his and his alone. Nobody would be able to compare to him. The ending was again a bit rushed and didn't really come as any surprise, and again this let down the overall film. Sets up another series, which would have to be exceptional to compare. But overall a let down and not a fitting end to this franchise. Let's hope the Man Of Steel (another DC offering) will strengthen the comic lines takings as the Green Lantern certainly didn't. Sorry, the Avengers will be the box office topper this year!"

        "review_detailed_main": "A mediocre comic book film. While decent at times, there are too many patches of poor dialog the bring out poor performances from the actors. While Bruce Wayne is reluctant to put back on the bat suit, Bale seems equally reluctant to put on his Bruce Wayne suit. His performance is entirely uninteresting and he never seems to recover any fire. \n\nHathaway does a fair job, but she and Bale lack chemistry. A scene with Levitt is so poorly written and performed it is painful to watch. \n\nBane is never menacing. It sounds like he is impersonating Jeremy Irons from Die Hard 3. He also does this ridiculous head shake during his speech, as if to insure the audience that he is speaking. \n\nThe tie in to A Tale of Two Cities is obvious and ham fisted.  There is so little build up to the behavior the citizens quickly adopt that  it just fails to make itself plausible. While the personal sacrifice from A Tale of Two Cities makes that story powerful, the cop out in this film weakens the whole story.  \n\nSome of the action scenes are pretty good. Some are just ridiculous. Batman always seems like some guy in a suit who is fighting a creepy guy with a mask. \n\nOverall this movie just fails to ever become compelling."

        "review_detailed_main": "You just don't watch a Nolan movie. You experience it. Something happens inside you after you're done watching any of his movies.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises is not just a movie, its a baggage of expectations, its a sequel to The Dark Knight, it has been directed by Chris Nolan, it has the Batman and people have already started with their assumptions and speculations.\n\nDoes the movie survive all this?\n\nYes. Definitely yes.\n\nBatman Begins dealt with fear. The Dark Knight dealt with chaos. The Dark Knight Rises deals with pain.\n\nEight years have been passed since the demise of Harvey Dent. Batman had hung up the boots and started blaming himself for Harvey's Death and everything. With all the injuries he had sustained while fighting under that bat suit and the depression, he is no longer the Bruce Wayne Gotham knows. People have been questioning his sanity. Wayne empire is declining.\n\nIn comes Bane. The dark, brutal, masked and monolithic beast who almost destroys Wayne enterprises to seek Batman.\n\nSelina Kyle, a female burglar who teases Bruce Wayne with her attitude and activities.\n\nAs a result, Batman is forced to come back. What follows is the series of events that not only blow your mind away but cast a magical spell to last the full life time.\n\nThere are a several new players that have been introduced in the film, such as Wayne's love interest and the new age cop John Blake who does the job of being the good side kick of Gordon and plays in an important role in convincing Bruce Wayne to be back as the caped crusader to protect Gotham one last time from the terror of Bane and army.\n\nSo is The Dark Knight Rises better than The Dark Knight? If you were one of those fans who prefer Batman Begins to TDK then you'll find much to love about TDKR. And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you.\n\nAs both Batman and Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's work here is master- class, and he gives the character such an inescapable melancholy \u2013 a certain perseverance in the face of absolute resignation to his fate \u2013 that he becomes a more tragic figure than ever. That said, he's aided enormously by a never-better Michael Caine, who turns with hope and palpable love what might otherwise be expository dialogue into searing, supportive criticisms of Wayne's self-destruction.\n\nOn the other hand, after being marketed as heir to the Joker in \"The Dark Knight,\" Tom Hardy's Bane is a different sort of villain \u2013 a focused and more ideologically-developed version of Heath Ledger's Joker \u2013 but one with equally ruthless charm.\n\nWhile she doesn't quite steal the show as Heath Ledger's Joker did, Hathaway's Catwoman is a magnetic presence whenever she's on screen and she has great chemistry with Bale. Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty.\n\nThat being said, the acts of good old Gary Oldman and the power house Joseph Gordon Levitt cannot be ignored.\n\nChristopher Nolan is in peak time of his life. Whatever he is touching is turning into gold. He has taken The Batman series to a level which no one in thousand years can reach. The action scenes, the rise and the fall of all the characters along with the climax are just the pieces of the puzzle, which in the end you feel was taking shape since the day Batman Begins released. The first hour ties all the loose ends the first two movies left behind and the climax is so apt that you leave the theater feeling contended and satisfied.\n\nWe may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine. Nolan had something special to say with his time in the trenches, and he's ended on his own terms.\n\nI wonder which series Nolan decides to reboot next!"

I went into the cinema to The Dark Knight Rises on the day of release with high expectations. These were blown away! I even went to see it at the cinema again and I've never done that before! (I understand other people saw it many more times but still a first for me)\n\nThe acting was absolutely superb! Christian Bale was at his very best playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Michael Caine was brilliant as Alfred despite his short screen time and I feel the performance was Oscar nomination worthy. Anne Hathaway was a better Catwoman than I could have imagined. Joseph Gordon Levitt was really good as Blake. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always playing Gordon and Fox. Marion Cotillard was good as Miranda as well. Finally Tom Hardy as Bane. I thought this was good casting from the start but I never imagined something quite this good! Tom Hardy stole the show for me just like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight. Bane is one of my favourite baddies of all time now and while it wasn't quite as good as The Joker, it was as close as it was ever going to come. Tom Hardy is worthy of an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Bane especially since he was restricted with the mask and had to convey emotions through eyes, voice and body language. There were a few moments where I couldn't understand his voice but sometimes it just took a few extra seconds to absorb it and his voice sounds too awesome to care anyway.\n\nWally Pfisters cinematography was incredible once again and I think I see another Oscar nomination for him.\n\nHans Zimmer's score was his greatest yet in my opinion and it really added to the emotional depth of the film and just got you into the film right from the start. Dare I say it another Oscar nomination?\n\nFinally Christopher Nolan's Direction was incredible as always and I truly believe this to be his finest creation to date and he must get an Oscar nomination if not his first win, he definitely deserves it.\n\nOverall this film was outstanding, one of the greatest films ever made,the finest of Nolan's Batman trilogy and the best superhero movie of all time. An Oscar nomination is deserved and I think any other film coming out this year will struggle to beat it."

Problems are everywhere while solutions in the abyss. Bruce is down with grief, Wayne empire is at all time low, Bane and his gang is taking over the city brick by brick. Bruce is faced with a choice to let Gotham die or rise to give some hope to its citizens who are interested in only one thing that they do best when threatened: own survival.\n\nThis movie is a perfect blend of, pain, struggle, sadness, suspense, action, loss, chaos, triumph, powerful lines, a number of great performances and above all a very good story.\n\nOut of so many good ones if I need to choose a single stand out performance it would be Christian Bale, he has come a long way. This movie gave him a real chance to show what he is capable of as Bruce Wayne. Then comes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, reviewing their performance would be like holding a candle to the sun so I won't. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ann Hathaway were perfect for their parts, I was a little doubtful of Hathaway but she managed to steal the frames a good number of times. While I missed a mind blowing performance like Heath, Tom Hardy as Bane managed to deliver a handful of terrifying moments and last but not the least what a great music.\n\nA tiny issue I had was that first half took a little while to come to speed, but I guess it was necessary to build the story and to tie up the loose ends from last two parts.\n\nNo amount of words would be enough to praise Christopher Nolan for giving us a stellar finale.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10"

There's romance, real drama and feeling, in contrast to the first two movies. Action fans will dig it, wingnut tech-heads will dig it. There's even a hint of the supernatural in this movie. War movie fans will dig it. I think it's fair to say that most Chris Nolan fans will dig it too.

It was not only a great superhero film but a great film in general. Did they exactly need a conclusion to Batman's story? That's really not for me to decide, but they did it and in my opinion it ended in the best possible way. Not the best way, but the best possible way. This is an excellent film, it is excellent because it demonstrates everything that made the Dark Knight Trilogy complex, and because of Nolan's direction it made it even better. Christian Bale gives a fine performance as Batman, the theatrical voice is still there, but it's toned down. I could barely recognize Tom Hardy as Bane, the voice is a little much but he still does good nevertheless. I really don't get all the hate for Anne Hathaway, she's a good actress, regardless of what her ambitions might be, she did good in Les Miz but did well here. Joseph Gordon- Levitt did good as usual, and Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman can do this in their sleep. The Dark Knight was what it was because it had a realism to it, this could definitely happen in real life, in regards to the Joker. The realism fades when Bane comes along but that's not a bad thing if the story is told well (and it is). If you've seen the Dark Knight, go see this, and if you're looking for a great movie go see this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Is it a perfect film? No. It is a great blockbuster? Yes, it is. Tonally, The Dark Knight Rises rises above its predecessor in the trilogy, because it manages to balance the grounded in realism and comic book aspects into a tonally coherent work. In fact, though it still attempts to ground itself in reality, this is the most operatic and most bombastic of the Batman films. And, dear lord, does operatic work with the superhero genre. After all, at its true core, Batman, and the superhero genre, is inherently a ridiculous concept. I loved the ridiculous voice of Bane and Michael Cain's constant hamming it up, crying speeches.\n\nIn recent years, the JJ Abraham's school of film-making has gained currency. The film moving so fact to one scene to the next that the audience barely has time to register the illogical steps taken by the characters. This is evident in the 2009, Star Trek film. While Nolan does this, he does it with so much more panache that it transcends the narrative, editing weaknesses associated with this modern form of film- making. The Dark Knight Rises is a pure cinematic experience. It is a film that needs It is a film that needs to be experience in the big screen. Even the hand to hand fighting sequences-- an area that Christopher Nolan has struggled with in the past -- are exemplary; they are reminiscent of the slow light saber fights in the Old Trilogy.\n\nThe biggest problem with the film is that it does not developed the relationship between Marion Colitard's character and Bruce Wayne well enough; it feels too force. Another major problem with the film is the Howard Hughes segment, it which it is they only portion of the film that drags."

Marion Cotillard didn't do what deserved of her role.. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine had no new form or structure even after 8 years, people change with time.. and u need to show at least some change in their character.... The only people who showed justice to their roles were Anne Hathaway as catwomen and Christian Bale.... The story was nothing exceptional. But I say to the people don't expect anything like the The Dark Knight... Just an ordinary story, with an ordinary villain with no character devlopment like the Joker or Ra al gul... And a batman who can and at no point feels weaker in courage than then villain... Overall I give it a 6 for just Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale's performance with the direction of Nolan."

        "review_detailed_main": "First of all, the Dark Knight Rises in the concluding and final chapter in the critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan (Director) Dark knight Trilogy, and due to it being the predecessor to 2008's The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises was already overwhelmed with especially high expectations. However did it meet those expectations?\n\n(Spoilers!)The Dark Knight Rises opens with an overwhelming plane aerial action sequence, an the introduction of Tom Hardy's representation of the character of Bane. Tom hardy's performance as Bane is constantly stimulating, both visually and mentally, possibly as stimulating as Heath ledger's representation of the Joker in The Dark Knight, however I do believe that Hardy's performance is heavily tainted by the way in which the character of Bane was \"removed\" from the film, during the final act of the film. Among the incredible five star performances of the cast from Anne Hathaway in her fitting performance as Catwoman to the emotional performance of Morgan Freeman, the acting was a driving force in the film's outstanding quality. The intense, emotional performances were essential to the film's sharp writing, great pacing throughout the story. Christopher Nolan's incredible flashback technique used to compose an incredible plot twist during the final act of the Film. It has been constantly noted that the film has an extensive amount of plot holes, however after analyzing the story, I do believe that many of the plot holes mentioned are very pedantic methods used by fans of other blockbusters such as The Avengers, to better their personal opinions, rather than explaining what they enjoyed about their own personal favorite, they would rather slander and taint The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nHowever the film does have some relevant plot holes, which could have been resolved by additional footage, such as a director's cut or a three and a half hour edition of the film, I would have also been satisfied with a two part version of the film in which each part was two hours, or more in length. The film's combination of \"the chase\",and the \"the ticking time bomb\", during the final action sequence was an incredibly powerful sequence which kept me heavily invested in the outcome of the story, which climaxed with the most emotionally gripping moment in comic book film history, in my opinion. The supposed death of the Batman in the nuclear explosion, later denied by his alive appearance as Bruce Wayne, was a symbolic way to express how the death of Batman, allowed Bruce Wayne to Truly \"live\", while also leaving you wondering how he did it? Bruce Wayne's time in the underground prison was incredibly reminiscent of Batman Begins, as Bruce Wayne was forced re build his broken psyche, and truly become the Batman, physically and mentally; this also defined Bane to be both the greatest test for Batman mentally and physically but also the most important factor in Bruce becoming a truly righteous hero that Gotham deserves. And the final gift from Christopher Nolan the audience, was Joseph Gordon Levitt becoming the symbol of hope for Gotham as Wayne did in Batman Begins, leaving the audience understanding that the Batman is immortal in a metaphorical way, anyone with the will to do so can be Batman, in Nolan's cleverly and emotionally investing world. The Dark Knight Rises was a satisfying ending chapter to a greatly weaved masterpiece of a trilogy from start to finish. I would give The Dark Knight Rises 9.5/10, or an A+."

        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan's ambitious Batman trilogy has come to a close with perhaps one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Both Batman Begins and the Dark Knight were cinematic masterpieces and are complimented nicely with this film, The Dark Knight Rises. Being the longest film in the series, it has incredible set pieces, a sinister villain, excellent acting, a loud and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer, and lots of emotional depth.\n\nNolan's film takes place eight years after the events of the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne has moved into seclusion. Regarding Gotham, crime has been suppressed with the Dent laws, but now a new force led by the notorious Bane is threatening to take control over Gotham. So is it time for Bruce to give his cowl and cape another shot?\n\nThis film has a plethora of characters so events may be confusing at time(which it wasn't for me.) Christian Bale as always is near perfect as Batman and he adds some emotional depth to his eccentricity. Michael Caine has a bigger role here and has some of the biggest, most emotion-filled dialogue of the film. While different in stature from the Joker, Tom Hardy makes a great Bane and reminds me greatly of Hannibal. Both Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return and are amazing. I didn't think Anne Hathaway as Catwoman would be effective, but I was proved wrong. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings his talent as well as a few surprises to the film.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing ending to the greatest superhero trilogy. Some of the set pieces are just amazing and incredible to watch. The football stadium, the opening sequence with the airplanes, and the takeover of the stock exchange were just a few of my favorite sequences. But nothing competes with that amazing, action-packed finale. Some people may not like the ending at all, but I think it's a fair way to end the film. It's unfortunate that the movie shooting in Colorado overshadowed this film, but I want to point out movie violence is not the cause for real-life violence and we shouldn't abandon the theaters because of this heinous act. This film is amazing and I'm pretty sad that the trilogy is over. I rate this film 10/10."

The casting is incredible: Batman Begins + Inception + Anne Hathaway (she's such a complete and lovable actress and person)\n\nI just got the 2 DVD collector edition in Switzerland yesterday. I definitely recommend watching the bonus features, they explain a lot about the concept behind this movie and the connection with the beginning of the story.\n\nAn amazing production, screenplay, performance !\n\nAnd yet: The whole experience was so different than on big screen. \"Duh\" you might say and still... let me explain myself:\n\nI recognized that some parts are only effective if you watched the film only once. This doesn't necessarily happen with other masterpieces I can watch on an on.\n\nWhen I watched all the interesting bonus features on the second DVD, I started noticing that from many multiple shots (shots filmed from many angles at the same time) the choice of those shots used for the movie weren't the clearest, or the most astonishing. So may things are finally not so clearly seen in the movie. There were many other successful angles that could have been used more effectively.\n\nMusic soundtrack ? Hans Zimmer did a nice job but I would have preferred James Newton Howard.\n\nThe fights weren't that clever, too tough and bulky, not necessary, no intelligence around them, plain fist. Not my port of call.\n\nThank you Christopher Nolan for being clever enough to participate in the cinema industry and still deliver ART.\n\nDefinitely a realistic, surprising and enjoyable film\n\nThanks to all reviews and commentaries.\n\nA.real"

        "review_detailed_main": "Nolan has created a Pulp Masterpiece. With Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Nolan set out to get Batman back to his gritty roots. With Rises, Nolan slowly backs out of the grittiness and enters a pulpier realm. A Bondian realm that begins with a mid-air high-jacking. Has a villain that wears a mask 99% of the film. Batman and Catwoman fighting side by side only to be stopped by gunfire from henchmen so incompetent they can only hit their own comrades rather than hitting their intended targets. And of course a nuclear bomb countdown. Nolan clearly has a love for James Bond films (as he also showed with Inception). As a fellow Bond aficionado, I really appreciate this, and it only adds to my overall enjoyment of the film. Superhero movies generally follow a particular formula. I could predict the plot beats of most of the recent Marvel films (this is not a complaint of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, just an observation). The point is that this film (as its predecessor did) threw me more surprises than most films of this genre typically do. And my expectations were blown away. TDKR has a very intricate structure, and for being 165 minutes long, the movie flies by at a nice pace.\n\nNolan's film has the feeling of a Coppola-sized epic from the 1970s, with its plot complexity, large cast of characters, intricate dialogue scenes with equal helpings of pain and tragedy. Many scenes in the film are shot in an orange/sepia tone that reminds me of The Godfather Part II. Tom Hardy's Bane is a mythical, Kurtz-like antagonist. The film has subtext and some political satire, one can interpret that how they will.\n\n\"The Dark Knight Rises\" could very well be the most polarizing film of Nolan's career thus far, hopefully the debate will continue."

        "review_detailed_main": "THE BEST.\n\nTHE GREATEST.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE.\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF AN ENTIRE GENERATION.\n\nEvery once in a while, there's that one trilogy that would change the landscape of the film industry forever and would define an entire generation.\n\nThere was George Lucas' Star Wars trilogy, which took sci-fi movies to a whole new level (I wasn't born that time but I'm aware of the legacy of course).\n\nThen decades later, it was Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy which raised the bar in fantasy epics so high that even now could never be reached much less equaled (yes, Harry Potter and Game Of Thrones are baby stuff compared to the grandeur LOTR).\n\nAnd now, Christoper Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nBefore, comicbook / superhero movies were too campy, too light-hearted and in every bit sense of the word, unrealistic. Characters were over the top, stories were clich\u00e9 and predictable, no risk factors and just dull and there's no \"holy **** did you see that?!\" stuff. It's as if they weren't serious efforts, like, studio guys would just say \"hey since everybody's doing it, let's do it!\". Results vary but mostly mediocre stuff and below. Simply, you don't get emotionally-attached to them, which is THE POINT of watching movies.\n\nEnter the Nolan-era of comicbook / superhero movies.\n\nQuite literally, Nolan turned the genre upside-down, flip it and then some. Nolan CHANGED THE GAME and took it to uncharted levels by introducing never before seen elements such as dark tones and themes, gripping plots and scripts, masterclass musical scores, relatable characters which comprises of genuine heroes and likable villains, above all, pulse-pounding moments that would make your jaw drop countless times and say \"HOLY ****! HOLY ****! HOLY ****!!!\". It's a genuine effort and love of the craft that you can see and feel as much as Lucas to Star Wars and Jackson to LOTR.\n\nIt started with Batman Begins almost 7 years ago in 2005, continued 3 years later with The Dark Knight and now finally capped off with the monumental conclusion The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 as the motion picture event of the year. The trilogy redefined Batman and Bruce Wayne and everything we know in Gotham City. Right off Batman Begins' origin story, to the emotional torture core of The Dark Knight and to pain, suffering and triumph of The Dark Knight Rises, the legend of The Caped Crusader was flawless and the acting of the cast was impeccable all throughout.\n\nOf course, the guy that's got to be Batman has got to really be THE GUY, and Christian Bale not only meet expectations, he exceeded them in every step of the way.\n\nBale is the perfect Batman, just was the late great Christopher Reeve was as Superman. I mean, nobody could replicate that connection from Reeve and Superman for decades, maybe ever (though DC and Warner Bros. would try again with Henry Cavill in Man Of Steel, we'll see). Same thing can be said to Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, that Facebook guy is awful compared to him. As well as Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man. And I believe the case is the same for Bale; it's gonna be LONG, LONG TIME until somebody could match, much less surpass him as Batman. Most likely, never. In a nutshell, we felt for Batman because of Bale.\n\nAnd same thing could be said with Nolan's Batrilogy. Right from the opening scenes of Begins and as the credits roll of TDKR, it was a ride like no other comicbook / superhero movie has done ever before. This is the kind of stuff we'd tell our children and grandchildren that defined our generation, that we'll make them watch these things years from now and tell them experiences waiting in line outside theaters and watching DVDs and Blu-rays at midnight, like our parents now do. I mean, I'm not even a comics guy (I don't read any paper stuff honestly), nor a Batman fan or fan of any comicbook or superhero, but when Nolan's trilogy came, I became one. That to me, is something EXTRAORDINARY very few in one's life could experience.\n\nObviously, Star Wars has it fair share of haters, so does LOTR, so why should we be surprised by the Nolan haters. These guys would scream \"oh that's boring I've seen that before!\" or \"that's predictable I knew it!\" or \"Avengers is the best STFU GTFO LOL LMAO!\" or whatever these guys could come up it. They're clueless anyway. Smart viewers know what's really up.\n\nREMEMBER: These kind of critics are those who failed at art and literature and just about anything and everything in life. And when you're at the top, there'll always be those who'd want to pull you down. Nolan and his Batman is at top, that's why.\n\nHuge props and thanks to Nolan and Bale, to Liam Neeson, to the late great Heath Ledger (I'd almost forget to say that his portrayal of The Joker is in the league of Darth Vader as the greatest villains ever), to Tom Hardy, to Michael Caine, to Gary Oldman, to Morgan Freeman and just about every actor and crew that participated in bringing Batman to life LIKE NO OTHER.\n\nTake a bow ladies and gentlemen."

        "review_detailed_main": "'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't Epic. But its impressive nonetheless. Christopher Nolan delivers a film worth watching, however, he doesn't quiet top himself in here. Its an entertainer!\n\n'The Dark Knight Rises' Synopsis: Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.\n\n'The Dark Knight Rises' is overtly long & dragging. Christopher Nolan & Jonathan Nolan's Screenplay is excellent in parts, but at times, it comes across as dragging & long. For example, the bad-guy, Bane, played by Tom Hardy, why does he hate Gotham so much & why he's being so god-damn heartless. There is proper reason, yet he's creating a chaos. Another flaw, lies in its running time. 168 minutes seems a bit too stretched. Christopher Nolan's Direction is extremely competent. Cinematography is grand. Editing & Art Design, are spectacular. Action-Sequences are huge.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, shines. The Oscar-Winning Actor is so believable & natural in his part. Tom Hardy as Bane, is a big letdown. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is quite good. Michael Caine as Alfred, is given the backseat, while Gary Oldman as James Gordon & New-Entry Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, are terrific. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, has a delicious role. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, is dignified.\n\nOn the whole, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an impressive superhero flick, but it isn't half as good as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight'."

        "review_title": "Overrated",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises Review 3/5\n\nThe expectations were high for this film given that it was a direct follow up to The Dark Knight. With a great storyline, memorable characters, groundbreaking action scenes and a perfect performance by Heath Ledger it was easily one of the best comic book adaptations to date. But even that film had its flaws but not as much as this one. At the time of its release a lot of the critics received backlash and even death threats from the rabid fans. The fans were even worse than the Star Wars fans. Anyway The Dark Knight Rises is far from perfect but it does have some enjoyable moments throughout.\n\nEight years have past since the events of The Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne is retired living his life in isolation, The Joker is locked away and Gotham City's crime rate is at an all time low. But the masked villainous Bane and his army are lurking in the sewers and he has a plan. After hearing about Commissioner Gordon being hospitalised and encountering a mysterious cat burglar Bruce Wayne decides to come back out of retirement. It's a real crowd pleaser when he comes back as Batman but he has to go toe to toe with his toughest opponent yet. He's not as fast as he used to be however that is what gives the film it's edge, we can finally root for Bruce Wayne because he is in a vulnerable state here. Bane is sort of like a 60s Bond villain taking the city hostage threatening to blow it up if anyone leaves.\n\nThe opening plane hijack sequence is breathtaking and like the majority of the action sequences it was shot in IMAX using practical effects. From miniatures to daring stunts we see real stuntmen hang off of the dangling plane fuselage. The overall action scenes are intense accompanied by an epic music score by returning composer Hans Zimmer. Although some of them suffer from bad editing they are still enjoyable and look spectacular. It's best to watch it with surround sound speakers as the sound effects make the experience more immersive from Banes heavy breathing, the bone crunching punch ups to the extremely loud gunshots and explosions. It's the most action packed of the trilogy but it suffers from a thin plot.\n\nChristopher Nolan does a fine job directing the film but not much can be said about his screenplay. Unfortunately it's his worst writing yet making this the most implausible chapter. It's full of so many character storylines and it just gets confusing. There are a lot of things that make little to no sense. There isn't much logic to many of the scenes, there are some obvious twists throughout and a lot of things go by unexplained. Using flashbacks it harps back to previous plot lines and characters in an attempt to make it feel more connected to those films. On top of all that it runs at nearly 3 hours which is just too long considering how half baked the plot is.\n\nAside from all of this Christian Bale gives his best performance as a more weary broken Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy is really good in the role of Bane and every time he's on screen he is physically imposing, very intimidating and he has some great lines of dialogue. Michael Caine is only in it briefly but he gives an emotional nuanced performance as family butler Alfred. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anne Hathaway both do serviceable jobs - However with such a big cast the film didn't really need them, they are just there for fan service and to be honest their story arcs are not very interesting. But that being said Hathaways cat suit has a cool realistic look to it which fits well within the continuity of the Nolan franchise. That's one thing you can give them credit for is they make these films as grounded in reality as possible. But with outlandish characters like Bane and Catwoman there are a lot of things they have to compromise like Selina Kyle/Catwomans backstory. She wasn't resurrected by cats like the comics, she is simply just a woman who is very good at sneaking about. Bane isn't a raging hulk who gets pumped on steroid juice he's just a conflicted man who has been through some bad stuff. Overall it's a thourouly enjoyable film but it's let down by lazy writing full and plot-holes."

And can't they just climb out of the manholes or is Bane's men guarding every manhole in the city?\n\nThe cops charge Bane's men armed with machine guns and hardly any of the cops die and the next scene everyone is in a fist-fight?\n\nWhy doesn't Bane detonate the bomb immediately? Why wait 6 months? Literally no reason because he intends to just blow it up regardless.\n\nAwful ending twist with Talia Al'Ghul that means nothing to anyone and leads to an unintentionally hilarious death scene.\n\nBatman's broken back fixed by a rope and a punch to it.\n\nAll in all, not good."

I thought that she could have used some studying from older movies or even comic books to display the attitude of Selina just a little bit more.

However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, \"The Dark Knight Rises\"? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.\n\nThe film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.\n\nAt a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.\n\nIn conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10\""

But the advantage of this is that the scenes with Batman and Bruce Wayne have no extra gravity to them, giving the chance for characters to develop.\n\nTo a degree.\n\nEven approaching 3 hours, Nolan stretches his skill and that of the cast to rush through much of the plot, especially the back-stories that he isn't much interested in. This leads to the usual number of unexplained convergences, plot vacancies and narrative extended death scenes that plague most modern films. Yes, it drives the internet forums and people see the films again but this weakens cinema and strengthens the longer TV serials that attract so many film directors. Nolans exploration of identity (every character has a masked past, present or future) feels compressed here, fitted between the blowing up of the scenery.\n\nLooking through his, er, oeuvre, it is clear that Nolans interest in perception was best met by Christopher Priest with The Prestige. I can see Nolan and Priest combining again, but I can't see him trying another full action film - his disdain for the material is starting to surface."

Their reputation inspiring movie bosses to produce sequel, which all ended up disappointing... Will The Epic 'Dark Knight' trilogy be reduced to the same fate... The world waited with baited breath.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's comic book saga lived up to it's name to rise above other movie trilogies and soar to the thematic and stylistic heights of its predecessors.\n\nIn the mid 1990s' the reputation of Warner Bros. Batman franchise was at an all time low with Batman & Robin producing some of the cheesiest one liners in cinema history (such as Mr Freezes \"Ice to see you!\").\n\nIn 2005 Nolan resurrected the Caped Crusader in with the critically praised 'Batman Begins'', the grittier and darker origin story of how Bruce Wayne became to be a moonlight masked vigilante standing up against injustice in the city of Gotham. Helped with solid performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy a sequel was inevitable.\n\nIn 2008, Nolan and his team returned for the follow-up. The Dark Knight, just as captivating and ingenious as the first but with one exceptional difference. Heath Ledgers Joker, stole the show (and Academy Award) as he bought Gotham City to it's knees by turning Gothams White Knight (DA Harvey Dent) on to a grief driven killing spree that destroys everything that Harvey and Batman had fought so hard to stop.\n\nIn The Dark Knight Rises, the story has progressed eight years. Batman has taken blame for Harvey Dents murders and left Gotham to fend for itself. Bruce Wayne is holed up in a rebuilt Wayne Manor and is the most adrift we've seen the character on screen, weakened and even going grey he is considering a return to action against taking a new path. Bruce and Alfred (Michael Caine) debate Batman's future in tense and tender exchanges, that will tug your heart. You're hooked, and the fighting hasn't even started.\n\nIn a scene James Bond would kill for, a CIA aircraft transporting terrorists is sensationally hijacked in midair by Bane (Tom Hardy), an intimidating hulk whose nose and mouth are encumbered by a tubular, grill-like metal mask which gives his voice an artificial quality similar to that of Darth Vader. What Bane is up to is not entirely clear, but it can't be good.\n\nSelina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), A spirited Cat burglar tries to get Bruce Wayne/Batman back into the limelight. But an attempted kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a brazen attack on the Stock Exchange from Bane is what catches the Bats attention, the latter catastrophe having the double effect of bankrupting Bruce Wayne.\n\nCommandeering the city's sewers with his fellow mercenaries, Bane begins his first onslaught on the caped crusader which will leave you gasping in disbelief. If the Theme behind Batman Begins was fear and the Dark Knight is chaos then the theme behind this movie is clear\u0085 Pain! The remaining 90 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat, the pinnacle moment when Bane destroys\u0085 well everything, including a masterfully created scene that we've already seen in the trailers when Gotham's Football stadium implodes to the earthy. Depths below.\n\nThe real world threats of terrorism, political anarchy and economic instability make The Dark Knight Rises incomparable to this years other superhero blockbusters. While The Avengers may have bigger zings, The Dark Knight Rises has one thing Whedon missed: emotional engagement; a genuine sense of jeopardy and deepening human drama. (OK, three things.)"

The Dark Knight trilogy is a very good example of this, when your typical superhero films can also stand as powerful pieces of cinema. Alas \"Dark Knight Rises\", after the exploding success of the brilliantly captured \"Dark Knight\", did fell short in comparison. Arguably, the success of any Batman film and even comic/graphic novel is dynamics between our dark hero and the villain, and in my opinion, Batman vs Bane was not taken to it's full potential. The tactical brilliance of Bane, portrayed by Hardy, was always out-shadowed by his brutality and sheer raw power, with a very dubious choice of voice effects that subtracted the terrifying factor right out of the equation, while Bale's performance was never stellar throughout the trilogy, this script did nothing to develop his character, mostly the opposite happened when you reach the end of this story. The big revelation concerning our villain only made the whole concept of Bane even less powerful, shedding some light into some questionable plot holes in the story, and there is an unwelcome sort of cheesy in all Joseph Gordon-Levitt scenes, unquestionably brought to light in the last minutes of the film. All in all, the film does feel like an ending, further deconstructing the myth of Batman, a vigilante created by a common crime by a faceless criminal, to fight so that someone wouldn't suffer through the same."

It is its own thing, and other than a few sequences midway through and towards the end, it is every bit a masterpiece of action-filmmaking as The Dark Knight. The way Nolan handled the introduction, background, and development of the new characters was a treat and very satisfying. The only difference between this and the Dark Knight really is that the weaknesses of The Dark Knight Rises are just more pronounced. With a few scenes edited out in the middle, it would be just as good. This movie has inspirational components to it, while The Dark Knight has more morality-oriented components to it. But they both contain bits of both."

        "review_detailed_main": "I did not like how this was the most sentimental of the three Nolan Batman-movies. I prefer when the emotional aspects are more subtle, letting the audience draw its own conclusions about the characters feeling given their circumstances and back-stories. In The Dark Knight I felt the director trusted his audience more to understand Wayne's reactions after having heavily emphasized his childhood in Batman Begins. Whereas in The Dark Knight Rises it was much dwelled upon and fed to us with sentimental music. This made the first part of the movie a bit dreary, but it quickly became more enthralling and kept getting better as the story progressed. The acting was impeccable as were the visuals. I admit to having prejudices against superhero-movies, but the characters are complex and interesting. So was the plot, though it is clearly made to appeal to a mass-audience. There is nothing wrong with being popular and I did not waste my time watching these three movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "What a film! Rarely does one call a superhero flick a cinematic work of art. Well this one certainly is that and much more. It isn't a run-of-the-mill popcorn, action packed, story-less offering that many superhero films are. This one goes above and beyond. It is less about the masked man and more about the man behind the mask, a broken man fighting his own demons. A dark and emotional tale of absolution and revenge, strength and sacrifice. Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Catwoman. Its no wonder she is receiving nominations for her role in this movie and in Les Miserables. Bane i think is the highlight of this movie. His speech may go down in dialogue history. You feel mesmerized and taken aback by the sheer force of this movie. It has everything from the deepest darkest emotions to powerful confrontation scenes and a breathtaking climax. I had no idea so much time had gone by, that is how gripping this film is. Though if you prefer more violence and action, then this may not be for you. Personal opinion: It is the best film of 2012. A must see as it raises the bar for not only superhero flicks but also films in general."

I did not see that twist at the end coming which was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like was Bane's character. I think it was just because of the mask thing and not really being able to see him. The actor did a great job portraying the character despite this. This is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and pick up different clues along the way. I do wish Morgan Freeman had a bigger role in this one. Love Lucius! I would like a TV movie of Lucius and Alred having some adventures together. After seeing this one, I think it's time for a Batman marathon."

        "review_title": "Satisfying Conclusion",
        "review_detailed_main": "The third and final instalment of Christopher Nolan's, Jonathon Nolan's and David S. Goyer's legendary trilogy is my least favourite, but is by no means bad. The problem I have found with 'The Dark Knight Rises' is its loss of realism. 'Batman Begins', the first instalment, was extremely realistic and somehow still faithful to the comics. That was what made the film so amazing, in my opinion. 'The Dark Knight' loses the realism and the faithfulness to a degree, but that wasn't a bad thing. The tension, story, ideas and genuinely scary villains of the second instalment made it not just better than the first instalment, but possibly better than any other superhero film ever made.\n\nThe conclusion to this nigh perfect trilogy doesn't come close to the first two, but still satisfies. The realism, possibly the best thing about this trilogy, is gone. There is more than one scene or concept where you may think \"Well that's just plain stupid!\" On realism, it could have been much better. You'll know what scenes and concepts I am speaking of when you see them. Is this film faithful to the comics? No, it's even less faithful than 'The Dark Knight', but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It means even fans of the comics are in for big, Nolan twists. I believe that it is faithful enough for most fans to enjoy it, but much less faithful than the two previous films.\n\nThe writing of this film is much like the last two. It's very Nolan; intelligent but somewhat confusing. I think the problem with this instalment is that the writers tried too hard to make it the biggest and the best. This is part of the reason the film fails to live up to the previous two. The writing is certainly the worst of the three films, but is definitely not bad writing. It still seems dark and mysterious. I think they relied too much on shocks and scary villain scenes than on adding tension and genuinely terrifying, slow scenes. The Joker had many of these scenes in the previous film, seeming unpredictable and adding tension. Due to no more Joker, the humour is gone. This was necessary, but takes away some enjoyment for me.\n\nThe directing of this film is much like the previous two. Nolan uses the same style throughout all three instalments. The directing again takes away realism with the action not being realistic. I believe that if the age certificate was bumped up they could have made the film much more terrifying and realistic. The action in the film goes back to relying on fighting usually like in 'Batman Begins', not tension like 'The Dark Knight'. However, there are still tense scenes with Bane (Tom Hardy) that match some of the previous film's Joker scenes. The shots and action scenes are fantastically done, like the previous two, but as I have said, Tim Burton's Gothic look is more preferable to me.\n\nThe characters in this are amazing. Hardly any of them seem like their comic book selves, but this can be great, adding a fresh, unique feeling to the film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Blake, who I do believe adds to the film, unlike others. I also loved the controversial twist with Blake. If it were done any other way it'd probably take away the darker side to the film. The way it was done was very unique and interesting. I loved Cillian Murphy's cameo as Scarecrow again. I always love some Cillian Murphy in a film, and his rather insane Scarecrow adds a lot, in my opinion.\n\nChristian Bale plays a brilliant Batman/Bruce Wayne yet again. I love the dark edge to his character rough voice he uses as Batman. Tom Hardy was terrifying as Bane. He is the opposite of the Joker, thinking out a large scale plan and being calmly menacing. Very different to the comic book Bane in lots of ways, but I do enjoy different takes on characters, instead of the same thing in each remake. Anne Hathaway played an interesting Selina Kyle. She doesn't seem to be into the alter ego thing.. I don't think anyone calls her Catwoman throughout the entire film. Her settling down with Bruce Wayne doesn't appeal to me, as it isn't in character enough.\n\nJames Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer did an excellent job with the music yet again. All of the tracks are unique and are great additions. The soundtrack is very different to the previous films. The first two instalments use dragged out, slow music to create tension most of the time. This film does that, but to a much lesser degree. What I loved about the series' music in the first two was the tense, slow, metallic music that suits Batman and isn't like the usual exciting, blasting music. This music, while unique, is exciting and blasting usually. It takes the tension away again, which is one of the best things about this trilogy. As a standalone soundtrack, I absolutely love this, but as a part of this trilogy I'm not too fund of it. I much prefer the tense, slow tracks.\n\nOverall, I believe that this is a brilliant last instalment of a genius trilogy. I loved most of it. It is very different from the previous two, which is both good and bad. It felt very exciting and tense at times, and the overall story is excellent, if unrealistic. It is an amazing film, but is not close to as good as the previous two. I find it surprising that this ranks higher than Batman Begins on the Top 250 films. This finale doesn't disappoint. It is a genius conclusion for a genius trilogy. It's not as good as the other two instalments, but beating them would be an absolutely huge achievement. I expected a brilliant film to conclude the series, and that's what I got. Couldn't be happier."

        "review_detailed_main": "The third and final installment in this trilogy is much maligned because of a horrible incident around its release that had nothing to do with the film. While that tragedy is hard to separate from the film, it is unfortunate because the film is very good. The film is as dark and painful to watch as the prior two, but just as good in my opinion. The events of the two prior come together and come full circle as Christian Bale's character has to deal with his past, the events he put in place, and his place in the world. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane. The supporting cast is terrific. This, like the prior, is an adult film. It is gritty and visceral. The action is chaotic at point but very engaging. I like this story arc. I like these characters. I think the Direction and the visuals are unmatched. While I loved Tim Burton's Batman and respect it immensely nothing compares to this trilogy. It is not just good superhero filmmaking. It is great filmmaking using the superhero story as a vehicle to explore universal themes. See this and see it again."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are not enough words to describe the magnitude of this film, let alone space to even attempt it. So I'll do my best with what I have.\n\nThis film is perfect in every way. The synergy of elements, both technical, dramatic, and those supplied by the audience (such as emotional investment in the series, etc.) make it perfect. Writer/Director Chris Nolan understood how invested the audiences were in this series and he hit every single note perfectly.\n\nThe picture unfolds like a beautiful nightmare. We ease back into the world of Gotham well enough that we recognize the world we left briefly from the Dark Knight. Instantly we feel that the stakes are higher, and as the film goes on, the stakes are raised even further, seemingly impossibly so. Then, finally, as the picture hits its stride, we find ourselves engrossed in a spectacle the likes of which have not been approached since Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe depth of story and character, like so many of Nolan's films, are what bring all the elements to a head. Bane is maniacle, calculating, determined, and above all, undeniably and irrevocably brutally violent. This violence takes all forms, and manifests itself into some of the most brilliantly awe-inspiring action sequences you will EVER see.\n\nDark Knight Rises gets better with every passing second, between the action, the intrigue, the drama, and the mystery, the final result is nothing short of stunning. And while this may be an opinionated review, I beg every person alive to experience what this film has to offer.\n\nI swear on my life this movie is pure perfection."

        "review_title": "The weakest of the trilogy, but still a triumphant ending.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.\n\nIt has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.\n\nHowever a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.\n\nNolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.\n\nBut as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.\n\nAs for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.\n\nFurthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.\n\nBegins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception."

I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and as mentioned in previously read reviews, Bane on screen really gets your blood pumping. The late Joker had a great plan for corruption, but Bane's plan is simply to rule - and he plays the part perfect. There will certainly be comparisons of the two, but their characters are so entirely different, there is no comparison. Nolan also nails it again with these surprise character roles in Hathaway and Hardy - Bane is by far the most epic villain the Bat has ever seen and Hathaway is surprisingly a sexy and bad ass Catwoman. I am just so bummed this series is over, and very bummed that Nolan's next work is Superman...\n\nHopeful Robin spin off anyone????"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises ends the Christopher Nolan trilogy based on the DC Comic superhero. Set eight years after the end of The Dark Knight, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane, and Gary Oldman are back to fight the crime in Gotham City. This time, though, Batman faces one of his toughest opponents yet: Bane(played by Tom Hardy). Joining him are the unpredictable Catwoman(Anne Hathaway), and the young but passionate policeman John Blake( Joseph Gordan-Levitt).\n\nAs expected, Christian Bale gives an excellent portrayal of Batman, although this time he is allowed more time to build on Bruce Wayne. Morgan Freeman and Michael Cane bring their best once again, as they seem to always do in their films. Personally, I was a little weary of Anne Hathaway's performance of Catwoman. I've seen many of her films and generally enjoy her work. However, I was unsure if she could pull off Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Well, I was wrong. Hathaway was spectacular and shined in every moment on screen. I could say the same thing about Joseph Gordan-Levitt's performance, too. Sometimes the greatest asset to an actor is his or her ability to control every facial expression. Gordan-Levitt has perfected it, and proved it in his performance in TDKR.\n\nThere are only two negative notes to make about this film, as great as it is: the first being that it felt long. Yes, the film is nearly three hours long. And despite the fact that boredom never set in, I still felt the effects of a three-hour movie. At the same time, I didn't mind because there were several new characters who needed introducing and building, so it worked out for the better than the worst. The second, Bane's voice was a bit too raspy for my taste. There were a few moments where I had a difficult time understanding what he was saying. If they would have cleared his voice up just a wee bit more, it would have been perfect.\n\nOverall, the film was fantastic, and was definitely what I was expecting, especially coming from a beautiful cast and superb director. Also, I can't help but mention the perfection that comes from Hans Zimmer. His film scores are sometimes the only reason I'll watch a movie(although not in this case lol)! The Dark Knight Rises was the best ending to this excellent trilogy. Now I'm looking forward to the next big project of Christopher Nolan!"

While it was understandable to suspend disbelief for the Joker's antic because of his volatility, the same doesn't hold true for a cold and calculated Bane. This time the nihilistic philosophical lessons come off as pretentious and worn out. Even the repeated formula of action sequences pale in comparison to the first two films. What's left is a hastily done wrap-up of a film with zero character development for the supporting cast and a shallow narrative painted over a faux black."

Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.\n\nAs for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."

Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became \"Catwoman\", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain \"Bane\" completely shattered my expectations.\n\nOn the whole\"The Dark Knight Rises\" certainly rises a fire for money in the Box Office."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight has risen! The storm came, roared thunderously and blew everything away! Watching the film evokes the same kind of ecstasy as that of making love. It starts with an extended foreplay, builds up slowly, escalates wildly and culminates into an explosive, intense and unrelenting orgasm. In fact, it's a thousand times better than an orgasm. It's as close as having that romanticized elevated sense of being numb close on the heels of death. When you go numb and your senses fail you, and you are transported into a world that is beautiful, heart-wrenching, dark, compelling, unreal and majestic - you know that the storm has hit you, the fire that rose has engulfed you.\n\nThe best part of Nolan's Batman trilogy is that all the 3 films are distinctly different from each other. It would be unfair to compare The Dark Knight Rises with the previous two installments. Batman Begins was a Renaissance-moment, a triumphant interpretation of the caped crusader. His damaged psyche torn apart by guilt and fear - Nolan nails it with precision. And, the original treatment was so refreshing when Rachel points out that Bruce Wayne was the mask that Batman wore, not the other way round. The Dark Knight was edgier, darker, representing a world where chaos and order co-exist and complete each other; the sadistic sinisternerness of the Joker, blurring the boundaries between being amoral and being diabolical, is evidently portrayed - \"What am I without you? To them, you are just a freak, like me. You complete me.\" It dealt more with the psychological, a duel between the Agent of Chaos and the Fallen Knight, whereas The Dark Knight Rises is much more physical. Nolan wanted it to be a spectacle, an extravagant and dazzling finale on epic proportions, and he did achieve it. It's no-holds-barred, outrageous and heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, raw action on one hand and on the other, it captures Batman's emotional vulnerabilities like never before. For the self-appointed critics - please stop comparing. Applaud and acknowledge the genius of Christoper Nolan."

The action scenes are fantastically directed and beautifully executed and the writing is beyond fantastic.\n\nChristopher Nolan really smashed it and it is one of his best films he has ever made in his impeccable track record.\n\nThis is one of the best films of the year (not because I am a huge batman fan) but because it has a fantastic storyline and amazing action scenes.\n\nI just love this film and yes. It is joint first with the best superhero films of all time and is just one of the best action films of all time."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises arrived in cinemas on the back of deafening hype. The astronomical expectations seemed insurmountable for even a visionary of Christopher Nolan's caliber. So does Nolan deliver? Absolutely! Bold and unflinching, Nolan's operatic style makes The Dark Knight Rises an art piece of boundless spectacle and an epic of never-seen-before scope and scale. It visually obliterates the modern blockbuster with a story of daring boldness, taking your inner child on a savage ride.\n\nThe final chapter of Nolan's trilogy kicks off exactly eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The streets of Gotham have been cleaned up but as we soon find out, all that means is that the criminals have moved underground. Having taken the fall for the death of Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, now lives like a specter hobbling about the recesses of his fancy mansion while his faithful butler Alfred frets over him like a gawking mother goose. But something is stirring deep beneath Gotham's streets, and it is not long before Wayne once again finds himself staring into the heart of human darkness. When a hulking, masked psycho named Bane lays siege to his financial empire and plants a series of strategically placed explosives beneath the city, intending to cut off the isle's citizenry from the outside world, he hauls the bat-suit out of storage.\n\nFrom there, the movie unfolds with the carefully measured pacing of an epic, that rare sequel that endeavors to deepen and expand upon what has come before rather than merely repackaging it. It returns us to Gotham and its denizens, taking its time, gradually showing us the lay of the land. And once the cogs start whirring and the machine starts to warm up, The Dark Knight Rises takes off like a rocket \u2013 with Hans Zimmer's propulsive score as its fuel. And when it fires on all cylinders, it enters classic territory.\n\nThe pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas to the movie. Christian Bale gives us a Batman with a haunted quality, showing Wayne broken, rising, and risen in perfect succession. Gary Oldman retains his quiet dignity as Commissioner Gordon. Michael Caine's Alfred continues to class up the joint. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, is sexy, confident, and offers a great balance of humor. As Officer John Blake, Joseph Gordon-Levitt musters an interesting blend of earnestness and intensity. Both Marion Cotillard and Morgan Freeman execute their parts with precision. And Hardy is sensational as the diabolical antagonist Bane. He bites into his character's motivations and transcends the movie to a place that is darker and more malicious.\n\nNolan gives us an intellectual, heart-pounding movie that grips like a vice from minute one and never lets go, capping off the trilogy with passion and dignity and with slam-bang entertainment. The Dark Knight Rises is both the conclusion the franchise needs and the conclusion it deserves!"

If you are looking for Batman, you will be disappointed as he is scarcely in the film. The first half is particularly dull and could have easily been edited down drastically to ease some of the pain. The pacing picks up in the second half, but unfortunately, so does the absurdity in the plot. The motivation of the villains is never explained in anywhere close to a satisfactory manner and their actions defy all logic. The ending is particularly laughable and even embarrassing to watch. Nolan fans who claim that these Batman films are somehow rooted in the real world aren't really paying attention. This film is every bit as bad as the Schumaker films, worse because this takes itself seriously. THE DARK KNIGHT probably stands as the best Batman film to date despite it's own flaws. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the worst. I'd rather watch Adam West as Batman than this mess."

From the moment the film begins, you're pulled into a Gotham that's teetering on the edge, and Bruce Wayne, weary and broken, must summon the strength to don the cape once more. Christian Bale brings a raw humanity to Bruce, making his struggle against Bane-a villain unlike any Batman has faced before-feel intensely personal. As Gotham falls into chaos, you feel the weight of every decision, every sacrifice, and every blow that Bruce takes.\n\nWhat makes The Dark Knight Rises resonate so deeply is its focus on the man behind the mask. It's not just about Batman fighting to save Gotham; it's about Bruce Wayne fighting to find himself again, to reclaim his life after years of pain and loss. The film's action is breathtaking, but it's the quieter moments-the glimpses of Bruce's vulnerability, the loyalty of his allies, the hope for a better tomorrow-that truly stay with you. The ending, filled with both closure and new beginnings, leaves you feeling uplifted, reminding you that even in the darkest times, there's always a reason to rise. The Dark Knight Rises isn't just an action-packed spectacle; it's a deeply human story about redemption, resilience, and the enduring power of hope."

        "review_detailed_main": "Batman has defeated Ras-al-Ghul and his ninjas. He's defeated the Joker, a madman who only wanted to see the world burn. But now he faces Bane, a man who grew up in the world's darkest, cruelest dungeon. A man so dangerous he was excommunicated from the League of Shadows. A man with thousands of followers and millions of dollars at his disposal. And despite what the people closest to him say, Gotham needs Batman more than ever. Because in order to live up to his last Batman movie, Christopher Nolan has upped every stake and pulled every stop.\n\nLooking back, it's obvious that no one could top Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. None of the other villains in Batman's rouges gallery could be as frightening or disturbing as his Joker. But in Ed Hardy's Bane, Nolan has found a villain more powerful and far more dangerous. Bane is perhaps the ultimate physical combatant; massive, incredibly strong, all but impervious to pain. Comic book fans know him as the man who put Bruce Wayne in a wheelchair, and here he does worse. And he is very smart, and totally insane. The Joker was like a serial killer, a mad dog. Bane's madness is one of megalomania and unfettered hatred. The Joker sought to corrupt; he seeks to dominate and to destroy.\n\nAnd yet he has the gall to present himself as a hero, a liberator. After entombing the entire police force and taking Gotham hostage, he claims that he is giving the city back to the people, that he is giving them freedom from those in power who have oppressed and exploited them, that he has brought justice and equality. But he lies. His freedom is nothing more than anarchy, the freedom to kill and steal. His justice is a mockery of the word in which having too much wealth or being part of the old order are capital crimes. His equality is the wholesale liquidation of the rich, leaving a world in which everyone is equally poor. In throwing down the old order built on law and the power of wealth, he has built a new one based on fear and the power of the gun. And it's all just preparation for ultimate destruction.\n\nAgainst this mad warlord Batman's help comes from the unlikeliest of sources; master thief Catwoman (Anne Hathaway). When we meet her she's motivated only by money and self preservation, and like any good thief she convinces herself that t she's only stealing from those who can afford to lose it. She warns Batman that there's a storm coming, and he and his friends had best prepare. But when her storm arrives she realizes the old truth that you should be careful what you wish for. Hathaway's charm and wit make her perfect for this role, and her acrobatic fighting moves are stunning. I think it's safe to say that the last remaining taint of the Halle Berry version has been lifted from the character.\n\nNolan has outdone himself with the action sequences. The opening scene is every bit as forceful and unsettling as the one in Dark Night, with a coolness factor that rivals the best of James Bond. The climactic battle between Gotham's finest and Bane's thugs is one of the largest and most spectacular scenes of its kind, with hundreds of combatants crowding the city streets.. And the fights between Batman and Bane are everything fanboys could hope for. Eschewing precision and flair, these showdowns are brutally physical, with the effects of every blow being seen and heard. For me, this was one of the most satisfying brawls since Sean Connery took on Robert Shaw nearly fifty years ago.\n\nThis final installment in the franchise doesn't have a many twists and turns as its predecessor, but the ones it does have are still impressive. Bane's plans are a bit simpler than the Joker's, but no less genius, and he is equally as adept at predicting his opponents' moves. And although leaked information from an entertainment blog had given me foreknowledge of one major revelation, I was totally unprepared for the manner of this revelation and its effect on the story.\n\nThis is also a film rich with subtext. Bane's violent overthrow of Gotham's powers that be and his iron-fisted reign form a microcosm of countless violent revolutions. It could easily be a stand for the French Revolution, the Ayatollah's rise in Iran, or any of the various communist revolutions. In a period of unprecedented bloodshed and chaos, a determined man overthrows the old regime, only to replace it with one far worse. And just like Stalin or Mao, Bane knows that he's not doing any of this for the people. The only difference is that he doesn't even need to win public support, because he already has his mercenaries and thousands of released convicts.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises may not be as scary as the last film, it's not quite as deep, and I will admit that it lacks any performance to equal Heath Ledger's. But it is smart, thrilling, action packed and suspenseful. It's dark and brooding without being overpowering, and it does an excellent job of linking the narrative back to the first film. It is the summer's best movie and a worthy end for the Dark Night Trilogy."

Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess."

        "review_detailed_main": "In a world inundated with superhero sagas, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" emerges as a triumph of complexity and depth. Director Christopher Nolan's epic conclusion to his Batman trilogy transcends the confines of the genre, elevating it to the realm of modern mythology.\n\nSet in a Gotham City teetering on the brink of anarchy, the film explores the cost of heroism and the intricate dance between light and darkness. Christian Bale, reprising his role as the brooding vigilante, brings a raw and tormented humanity to Bruce Wayne, reminding us that beneath the mask lies a fractured soul seeking redemption.\n\nTom Hardy's Bane, a menacing force of chaos, proves to be a formidable adversary, and his presence looms large over every frame. His chillingly measured voice and brute strength make him a worthy counterpart to the Caped Crusader.\n\nWhat truly sets \"The Dark Knight Rises\" apart is its unflinching examination of the human spirit. It delves into themes of fear, pain, sacrifice, and the indomitable will to rise in the face of adversity. The film challenges us to confront our own inner demons and question the nature of heroism.\n\nThe technical prowess on display is nothing short of breathtaking. Hans Zimmer's haunting score serves as the heartbeat of the film, and Wally Pfister's cinematography captures the grandeur and grit of Gotham City with equal finesse. The practical effects, especially during the mesmerizing aerial sequences, ground the film in a visceral reality that few superhero movies achieve.\n\nWhile some may find fault in the film's ambitious narrative and its occasional leaps of logic, these imperfections only add to its allure. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" refuses to spoon-feed its audience, instead demanding engagement and contemplation.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a masterful conclusion to one of the most celebrated trilogies in cinematic history. It's a symphony of chaos and redemption, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling, and a reminder that heroes can rise, even in the darkest of times. This is not merely a superhero movie; it's a cinematic journey that resonates on a profound level, leaving a lasting imprint on the."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises, helming a rating of 8.4 on IMDB and still a high holder on the top 250 movies list is a prove that despite some people feeling dissatisfied towards this epic conclusion, it is still universally beloved as a movie, and as one might dare to say, a great superhero movie.\n\nWatching this film for the first time in theaters, with no knowledge of filmmaking, not even a movie fan at that time, just a normal audience going in the theatres for a ride, I remember coming out completely satisfied and floored. This film still crowns the most pristine look for an action film. The cinematography, the snow falling in the city of Gotham, everything about the visuals of this film is just screaming awesomeness, and for the longest time I hold this film as the pinnacle of the best looking action film and I still do.\n\nIn many ways, the minor flaws in here is so insignificant compare to the memorable bits of the film. This rendition of cat woman is by far the best one ever. Anne Hathaway achieves the perfect balance of sexiness and the feminine wit in this character, the visual design is also perfect. Bane is such an underrated villain, Tom Hardy adds so much on the character's simple motivation, the menace through his voice and his physicality rivals Batman and his energy brought so much to the tension we felt in the film. The opening and ending scene is one of the best in movie cinema.\n\nOne of my favourite aspects of this film is how Nolan coins the genre of the superhero saga into a prison break movie. The design of the pit is visually so mesmerizing, every time the camera points up to the light and we see the cave of the prison, the picture just becomes this visceral canvas of beauty in horror. The moment when Bruce Wayne confronts his true fear by foregoing the only security from the rope, it's honestly so badass that it trumps every other character moment in any Marvel movies and DC movies for that matter.\n\nAfter so many years, there's still not one DCEU movie that achieves this style of epic grounded action thriller where Nolan single-handedly master in Hollywood. It's only until 2016 where Denis Villeneuve finally managed to make something that comes close to that level of authentic grandness.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises also has the best score in the trilogy in my opinion, the best score for any hero movies, the perfect balance of grandness, epicness, the unsung melancholy and the haunting beauty of romantic sacrifice."

        "review_detailed_main": "SOMETIMES TRUTH IS NOT ENOUGH AND PEOPLE MUST BE REWARDED FOR THEIR FAITH'\n\nIt's an action-packed, mind blowing trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic elevation which causes people to feel motivated to do good and increases their altruism.\n\nWhereas, 'Batman: The Dark Knight' plays out \"with the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon and DA Harvey Dent, Batman has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism\" (ref. Google).\n\nWhile there were a ton of character strengths and virtues exhibited in this film of the following: wisdom, knowledge, creativity, judgement, love of learning, perspective, courage,bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest, humanity, love, kindness, social intelligence, justice, teamwork, fairness, leadership, temperance, forgiveness, humanity, prudence, self-regulation, transcendence, appreciation of beauty & excellence, hope, gratitude, and spirituality.\n\nNow pertaining to the art of watching film; THE THEMATIC ELEMENTS were mild that showcased violence, crime, and corruption for a PG-13-rated drama.\n\nAs it was a FICTIONAL story with DRAMATIC ELEMENTS of crime that had villains who were inspired by infamous, criminals of real life.\n\nThe VISUAL DESIGN was imaginative. The CINEMATOGRAPHY was very engaging, allowing the audience to feel and seem like they were apart of the action. The SPECIAL VISUAL EFFECTS were powerful. The EDITING was smooth and exciting at times. The COLOR was rich and in full-resolution.\n\nThe SOUND EFFECTS were creative. The MUSICAL SCORE was memorable and compelling. The DIALOGUE was strong and expressive.\n\nNow the ACTING showed glimpses of performances that were full of conviction and confidence, as the actors believe in what they're doing. Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon, Aaron Eckhart as DA Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as Batman, and Heath Ledger as the Joker were all brilliant. These actors stayed truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters; to stay true to the original comic book characters.\n\nNevertheless, the DIRECTOR'S STYLE of Christopher Nolan was clear and full of vision as a confrontationalist; in this style of directing, the director is in constant dialogue and debate with the cast and the production team about creative decisions and interpretations. The director seeks out and actively engages in such exchanges. Out of these exchanges, which can sometimes be risky, comes a final contested product as we can see through the select choices of shots.\n\nOverall the 'Batman: the Dark Knight' movie was phenomenal, but one thing I didn't agree with was the portrayal of schizophrenia paranoid-type in the joker; Hollywood seemed to have beefed it up. Yet you got to love Batman's heart for people as he loved unconditionally, giving them (even his enemies) a choice, and always seemed to make the right decisions; to reward people for their faith."

This is the ugliest example, but there are more moments when very alert action stops for a kiss between selina and batman or for the villain to tell the story of their life just before killing Batman...These scenes made me facepalm hard... Overall, a fun action packed movie which makes you jump off your seat a lot of times, but fails to meet the Dark Knight expectations."

Nolan skillfully crafts a multi-layered narrative that challenges viewers to confront difficult questions about power, justice, and the nature of heroism.

With its exhilarating action, thought-provoking themes, and unforgettable performances, it cements Christopher Nolan's legacy as one of the greatest directors of our time and solidifies Batman's status as a cultural icon.

It certainly brings to completion a saga that will remain immortal and will probably no longer be affected by any another suitor.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises had to be stunning and spectacular and brilliant just...because. After a very good start with Batman Begins and a truly magnificent follow-up with The Dark Knight how could Christopher Nolan go wrong? Expectations were off the charts. And those expectations were not quite met. Nolan certainly didn't get it all wrong but he surely didn't get it all right either. There's no way around it, this film is not as good as The Dark Knight. Does that mean it's a total letdown? No, not at all. It just means it is not the glorious triumph everyone expected. It's a satisfying finish to a great trilogy. People were just hoping to be able to use a better word than \"satisfying\".\n\nSo why does this film not measure up to the last one? Well there are a few reasons but one stands out above the rest. It's glaring and obvious and there was nothing Nolan could have done about it. This film misses Heath Ledger's Joker. Bane is an ominous presence. But a rather dull one. And what the heck is he saying anyway? The Joker had a manic intensity to him that this film sorely misses. Stretched out to almost three hours, clearly too long for its own good, this film desperately needed some real jolts along the way. Someone had to grab a hold of the story and shake the audience up. The Joker did that, Bane does not. Yes, Bane is frightening and foreboding and clearly very dangerous. But the personality just isn't there. There's no sense of wonder. The Joker always had you on your toes, what would he do next? Bane never intrigues you that way.\n\nIf you miss the Joker it could also be said that this film leaves you missing Batman. Christian Bale is solid as ever in the dual role of Bruce and Bat but in this film he spends very little time in that famous costume. We see an awful lot of Bruce Wayne, very little of Batman. The other familiar faces from the first two films are back. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman doing what they do. New characters? Well, there's Anne Hathaway doing a better than expected job playing Selina Kyle, who's kinda sorta maybe but not really Catwoman. Marion Cotillard plays Miranda Tate, investor in a Wayne Enterprises energy project. This character is woefully underdeveloped which proves to be problematic. Tom Hardy does the best he can with Bane, a very challenging villain to portray. Hidden away behind a mask it's hard to infuse the character with any personality. And again, seriously, what the heck is he saying? And there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing young police officer John Blake who knows Bruce Wayne is Batman just...because.\n\nThe fact this nobody cop knows Batman's identity is not the only disappointing contrivance required to move the plot along. The location of Bane's lair? Convenient. The entire Gotham police force trapping themselves underground? Very, very convenient. And dumb. And let us not even delve into Bruce Wayne's remarkable healing powers. This is a story which at times really struggles for momentum. With the Joker around lack of energy was never going to be a problem in the last film. Here things really get bogged down on more than one occasion. But while the film certainly has its flaws it does ultimately manage to satisfy. The trilogy gets the big sendoff it deserves. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't reach the spectacular heights of Nolan's last Batman effort so maybe you come away a touch disappointed. But taken on its own merits this is a good film. True greatness may elude it but it is a worthy end to a terrific saga."

But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.\n\nThe music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is.\n\nChristian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie.\n\nAnd the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible.\n\nThe script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie.\n\nHere, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS!\n\n1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?\n\n2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.\n\n3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a \"real world\" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.\n\n4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end.\n\n5. \"Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.\"\n\n6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.\n\n7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?\n\n8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.\n\n9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.\n\nAnd that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.\n\nAll and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."

        "review_detailed_main": "The best Bruce Wayne we've ever gotten in a movie. Every scene with him and the other characters, especially Alfred, are some of the best of the trilogy. The strongest part of the movie, for me, is the prison sequence with Bruce. I get chills every time he makes the climb.... everything surrounding him is flawless in my eyes.\n\nMy main negatives that bring the score down are the eventual arcs of the villains in the movie and honestly Anne Hathaway does not work in these types of roles. Some of the plot elements feel a bit rushed and don't pack nearly as big of a punch as The Dark Knight. Bane's takeover of the city feels far less believable than the Joker's.\n\nDespite those flaws, it's hard to end a trilogy with this good of an entry. I think, thematically, its brilliant and it's also a fantastic story for Bruce Wayne's character.\n\nThis ending is also incredible, and I get chills every time I see it. Hans Zimmer's score is legendary."

I won't give away any spoilers, the trailers pretty much encapsulate the rather two dimensional plot entirely. Anne Hathaway was good, played her role better than any predecessor. I was hoping for a film with batman (after struggling to 'become' batman in the previous two films) would fulfil a more alpha role. tom hardy was better than expected, but I really did struggle to understand him sometimes. his character is supposed to be a tactical genius, as well as a superb fighter, and this didn't really come across. finally, you end up not caring about most of the cast as they are all 'damaged' and selfish. but most of all, batman seems rather desperate, and seemed to have shut down that big brain of his. not a spoiler - but there is also one scene that emulates perfectly all those YouTube Mick takes too, I actually laughed out loud as it were. the film wallows through its three long hours, I would cut it to two and a half. actually, the more I think about it, I realise there wasn't that much I enjoyed in the film! ah well, it didn't measure up to avengers or Prometheus, but it was better than the second bale batman offering (but not as good as the first - which was 'ok')."

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a huge fan of batman director Christopher Nolan. He is the genius who brought us such groundbreaking films as Memento and Inception, the very good Batman Begins and the excellent The Dark Night.\n\nThat's why my hopes for this third installment were so high. Boy was i disappointed.\n\nThis movie is a GRAND MESS. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nNolan cuts off batman's balls and holds them hostage the entire movie. He is either hobbling around as Bruce Wayne looking like he belongs in a Senior's Home or in his batman's suit trading punches like an aged boxer with MS. No great fight scenes in the inimitable batman style with the whooshing and swooshing and swooping and gadgets and disappearances/reappearances.\n\nI would conjecture that this is both because of the post modern philosophy adopted that no man is a true hero (including batman) and also more practically because the fight team was actually changed from the first two movies to a new one for this film, a change drastically for the worse. They should have stuck to the Keysi Fighting Method.\n\nAnother error is that any movie is only as good as its villain and Bane is a horrible villain. He's really more like a big goon that the main villain usually sends in the eleventh hour to do his bidding like the big Russian guy in the Punisher for example. Don't expect another performance like Ledger's Joker here.\n\nWhat really gets me though, is how the second film developed the whole origin of Twoface as Harvey Dent (who was a great character) and then just dropped it and brought in a much worse villain????\n\nExtremely irritating was Nolan superimposing the Inception style of for example heavy background music etc on this film where it doesn't belong. Even the dialogue was hard to always pick out, especially when you have two of the main characters growling through masks and the war drums right beneath their voices.\n\nBut it didn't stop there. Nolan invited almost the entire Inception cast and stuck them into this film inflating the story by giving them non- essential roles and by constantly taking you out of the illusion of reality a film is supposed to create when it forces another much better film to come to mind. He and his buds must have been having such a good time on set enjoying the Inception reunion that they must have forgot they were filming an entirely different movie.\n\nThe cherry on the top of this egregious casting is when in the middle of the film you suddenly have a cameo by none other than Cilian Murphy the scarecrow villain in the first Batman movie as some minor people elected judge. (And yes, you guessed it, he was also in Inception). To me that's tantamount to giving Heath Ledger (Joker) or Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent) a role as a cop or a waiter in this film. Seriously man, is there anything else you can do wrong to break the movie spell and keep reminding me i'm only watching a film with actors- something totally fake?\n\nI wish i could stop here but honestly i could go on and on. The movie spends time with characters whose story lines are not that interesting and leads up to a clich\u00e9 climax that you and i have seen done in previous TV shows like 24 and other films.\n\nI believe the production suffered from the all too common problem of having too large a budget (250 million) that enabled Nolan to create a spectacle of \"Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing\" instead of an interesting film. The film alternates between dragging with boring exposition and blasting your ears off with nonsense. There is a tender moment between Bruce and Alfred that is very brief that was nice though ;)....\n\nGuys, I went into the theatre ready to love this film, willing to try to like it, but it never even gave me the chance.\n\nUnfortunately it does not live up to the hype. Like the Godfather Part 3, there is no reason to watch it even though you enjoyed the great Parts 1 and 2.\n\nLet sleeping dogs lie and let dead films die. For your own sake, do not break the caution tape to watch this wretched bomb of a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "For a while, I maintained that this was the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. Watching it for the first time in a few years, I can certainly see why. The second half is pure spectacle filmmaking at an epic scale with an extended set piece that feels expansive and alive and huge all at once. However, that first hour or so is much messier, and I think that last half of the film, largely got me to ignore some of the niggling issues that frontend the film.\n\nThe Batman has been absent from Gotham City for eight years. In that time, Gotham has seen a period of peace and prosperity it has not experienced in a very long time. In order to create that sense of calm, though, Police Commissioner Gordon pumped up the idol of Harvey Dent who had become the psychopathic villain Two-Face, murdered several people, and threatened to kill Gordon's son as the White Knight, blaming all of his crimes on Batman. Together with the Mayor and the City Council, they passed the Dent Act which allowed for aggressive anti-crime actions on the part of the police, resulting in a city without any serious organized crime at all. In this time, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, has become a recluse, having spent several post-Batman years and half of his fortune pursuing a fusion reactor before suddenly shutting it down and closing himself off from the world.\n\nIn enters Bane, a member of the League of Shadows and a former acolyte of Ra's Al Ghul, since excommunicated for his extreme methods. After the death of Ra's Al Ghul, Bane took over the League of Shadows and will continue the man's mission of burning Gotham to the ground, much like the League had done to Rome and London before it. The revolution he ignites is based heavily on the Jacobins of France during the French Revolution, which fits hand in hand with the overall movie's ties to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. He speaks of equality, but he rules with an iron fist, establishing a Committee for Public Safety, so to speak, that summarily executes enemies of the revolution. In order to get there, though, Bane must take control of Gotham.\n\nNow, the first half of the film is really setup for the giant spectacle that dominates the second half, and some of it is quite good and other elements end up going a bit too far. From beginning to end, I think Bane is great. He's intimidating physically and he ends up with a great plan to acquire wealth and demean Batman at the same time. Stealing his fingerprints through Catwoman/Selina Kyle to fake reckless options trading that wipes out his position in Wayne Enterprises is wonderful. The chase out of the Stock Exchange, giving Bruce Wayne his first moment as Batman in eight years, is exciting and well filmed. That it leaves Wayne so destitute that he can't pay his own power bill is...curious and a step too far. I get the point. The point is to take Wayne as low as possible both as Batman and as Wayne himself, but having his power shut off because of nonpayment roughly a day after his loses all his money feels weird at best and completely ignorant of how things work in the real world at worst.\n\nAnother very good thing that the first hour does is establish the overall thematic thrust of the film, and that's around pain. Bruce is suffering from a leg injury. That's good. He immediately gets cured well enough to fight as Batman again because of a gadget on his leg. That's...less good. And yet, the idea runs through the rest of it very well. Wayne carries the pain of his loss of Rachel Dawes, from The Dark Knight (to the point that people misinterpret his receding from the world due to that loss, but that's not the case). Gordon carries the pain of having to defend the man who tried to kill his son, while losing that son in a divorce at the same time. The city carries the scars of past trauma brought on by the Joker, but it manages to live on, just as Gordon does. And what do these people do with their pain? Well, more pain must come first.\n\nBane's efforts to take the city end up feeling great. He has an inside man at Wayne Enterprises, also knows that Wayne is Batman because of his connection to the League of Shadows, and he uses the greed of Daggett, a wealthy executive who wants to absorb Wayne Enterprises, to prepare his plan of cutting off the city from the rest of the world. But first, he must take out the Batman. That the \"every police officer\" gets trapped in the sewars is...less good, though. It's another step too far that didn't quite need to be taken. However, this element of the plot is where Selena Kyle is useful.\n\nAnne Hathaway as Selena Kyle is really good. She can switch between woundedly scared and feminine to coyly vicious and feminine in an instant. She steals into Wayne Manor as a servant at a party and shows both sides to Bruce as she steals his mother's pearls and his fingerprints, setting up the plot of the film. She's a survivor with a chip on her shoulder, so she's happy to watch as Bruce loses everything as the result of her actions. However she does still have a certain sense of justice so when Bane completely takes over and Gotham descends into a hellscape reminiscent of the French Terror, she's bothered by it, but being a survivor she does little to stop or escape it.\n\nThe movie turns when Batman has his confrontation with Bane. Evoking the famous comics scenario of Bane breaking Batman's back in the Knightfall run (pretty much the only time I was reading comics, by the way), Bane breaks Batman and sends him to a prison with hope, the worst punishment he can imagine. The visual image of Bruce needing to rise from the pit in order to overcome his pain and fear is great. That it takes him so much effort and that he has to essentially return to an earlier form of himself in order to do it is even better. There's such rich imagery here.\n\nThe final confrontation between Batman, as a symbol of order, and Bane, as a symbol of chaos and fire, dominates the last half of the movie. The film leaves open some unimportant questions of how Bruce Wayne gets from India to Gotham in about three weeks, but considering the character's history of running in the underworld, including in the Far East, that seems easily filled in by the audience, and once he's there he leads an all out rebellion against the ruling Revolutionary government with an aim towards getting his hands on the nuclear bomb set to go off in twelve hours. Yeah, it's very comic booky, but it's handled with the right balance of seriousness that I think the movie sells the situation well.\n\nAnd in terms of the final act, the spectacle of Batman leading an army in a war against Bane for control of Gotham and against a Jacobin Revolution is great. Batman the symbol leads those who had cowered away in fear to take to the streets, fulfilling the promise of Batman as a symbol established in the first movie (and re-explained to Blake, the cop who has figured out that Wayne is Batman in...another individual step that feels too far in the first half). The evocation of A Tale of Two Cities also helps provide the film a literary understructure that I appreciate. It's not just random bad guys butting up against a protagonist we all know from pop culture. It's a literary extension of the mythos.\n\nI feel like this was a bit of a ramble, but I'm gonna stick with it. The Dark Knight Rises is not a perfect movie. Its first half ends up taking a few ideas too far, which undermines them slightly, but not the overall story. What ends up carrying it all, though, is Nolan's sheer command of everything outside the script. Performances are very good. The spectacle is great. The use of image and sound creates a large story that carries interesting ideas about pain and the efforts to deal with it. It's an intelligent and rousing film that could have been a bit tighter, but, by the end, I don't really care that much."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Dark Knight Rises\" It's not so much a story about The Batman, as much as a story about Gotham City and the people affected by Bruce Wayne's alter ego. It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second. It's a satisfying conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy and aside from a few minor things it's pretty much the perfect third film in one of the best trilogies out there.

        "review_detailed_main": "And Christopher Nolan's genre-changing series of Batman films finally comes to a close with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. No matter what your opinions are of Nolan's Batman movies, you have to admit that they've had an effect on latest generation of superhero movies to arrive in theaters. With his trilogy finally complete and the all those involved moving on to other projects, I'll be curious to see where the comic book movie genre goes next. When I first saw THE DARK KNIGHT RISES in theaters (a midnight showing, of course, and one of the few I've attended), I admit I was initially disappointed but additional viewings have helped me appreciate it a lot more. The movie is set eight years following the events of THE DARK KNIGHT with Batman going on the run and the true details of Harvey Dent's death buried in hopes of using him as Gotham's shining hero. The city has enjoyed a time of peace as crime is at an all-time low, but this is all about to change. A terrorist named Bane has his sights set on Gotham. He arises under the guise as a freedom fighter with the goal of bringing the upper class to their knees while the lower class are allowed to rise to power, but Bane is no hero. Bruce Wayne returns to don the costume and investigate Bane but his time away from crime fighting has left him weakened. His initial confrontation with Bane leaves him broken, and Wayne must find the strength to return and, with help from a professional cat burglar, save Gotham from total destruction.\n\nTo put my views in perspective, I am a Nolan fan and I love his Batman movies. THE DARK KNIGHT is one of my favorite movies and I loved BATMAN BEGINS so much that it was one of the few movies I shelled out cash to see in theaters multiple times. So yes, my views are a little skewed toward the positive side. But my initial impressions of the final movie weren't as generous. It was a fine movie, sure, but it failed to live up to the immense hype I'd built in my own mind prior to seeing the movie. I knew Nolan would have a hard time topping THE DARK KNIGHT and I accepted this. I also reminded myself that Nolan's Batman universe isn't exactly the same as that of the comics and details were going to be fudged to make them fit in the overarching story he was attempting to tell. With a near 3 hour runtime, I was in no mood to humor these factors when I saw it in theaters and I walked away befuddled with my issues with the movie. It was slower paced, Wayne doesn't don the costume enough in the movie, and the finale was anticlimactic. But, over time and two more viewings on my own, I realize that this movie was a lot better than I was giving it credit for. Sure, there are still some plot issues I'm not a fan of but I remind myself that this is Nolan's Batman and any problems I have will probably be retcon'd in the next Batman reboot anyway. Just enjoy the Nolan series for what it is. And I do.\n\nAt a second glance, there is a lot about this movie I really like. Tom Hardy as Bane is just awesome. His bizarre voice took a minute to become acclimated with; it reminded me of Sean Connery talking through a tin can. Once I got used to his voice, Bane rose to become one of the best Batman villains that have been put to film yet, though not as remarkable as Heath Ledger's Joker (but, seriously, I don't see anyone topping that anytime soon). He is massive, intimidating presence and a perfect challenge for a Batman who's fallen into disrepair. What better motivation to rise than a madman with an insidious plan and the muscle to pound our hero into dust? On a related note, Anne Hathaway was an excellent choice for Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I was concerned at his casting at the beginning, but then I was just as concerned when Ledger was announced as Joker and my fears were proved unjustified when I saw his final performance. Hathaway does just as well; a cool manipulator\u0085she's beautiful but her sexiness isn't flaunted as it was in Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. I've also come to appreciate the overall plot of the film as an excellent finish to the series. It touches back on elements introduced in the first two movies and ties everything together nicely; you might almost assume Nolan had this planned from the start. I'm pretty sure he didn't, but it worked out great. The end has been caused for endless debate and complaints but, as long as I view it as an isolated Batman tale set in Nolan's own universe with no long-standing effect on the future Batman movies, I'm cool with it. I actually think it's a perfect end for the story Nolan has been building since 2005."

It just seem to never find it's footing. i found myself bored at times and had no problem getting up to get more popcorn in the middle of the movie. Catwoman was awesome. i really wish there was more of her in the movie. bane was not quite as awesome. he just didn't give me that omg what is he going to do feeling that i got with heath. I also dislike that they reused plot items from previous installments, it would have been better without the connection. The middle of the movie is like a long montage that could have been given some theme music and condensed to about 10 min. dkr had an overall bad flow which brushed over things that could have been flushed out more and dwelled on things that could have done with out.\n\nThe movie is worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away like with the dark knight."

        "review_title": "An emotional and satisfying conclusion",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"The dark knight rises\" isn't the perfect film but it is definitely the most emotional of all three. Yeah i said it (but neither were the previous two). But i would be lying if i was telling you that i did not have goosebumps in numerous scenes or wet eyes during some of the most honestly acting (and touching) moments in the history of cinema. This time around, Bruce Wayne is being tested mentally and physically against Bane and his hordes for the salvation (or destruction) of Gotham city. However, what really works here and makes all the way through our heart and emotions are the sharply drawn and fleshed out characters. There will be people claiming that there is an large number of individuals that take lots of screen time, yet they actually feel and act as normal \"humans\" rather than archetypical Hollywood algorithms. Christian Bale should get a nomination for his work as Bruce Wayne. This is his finest Batman. You really root for him simply because like all of us, he has limits (spiritual and physical), limits that will be broken.\n\nOn the antagonist part, Tom Hardy as Bane is physically impressive. Make no mistake. This is not a well built body with perfect abs and biceps in order to lure teenage girls to the cinema. Instead Nolan's Bane is a colossal muscle mountain that could snap your spine in a split second without making the slightest of effort. Just like the edgy and twitchy Joker, his unique body language and swaggering mannerisms will certainly leave an impact to the viewer's mind and rightly to do so.\n\nHowever, do i hear show stealer? Anne Hathaway - she is a fully lethal, sexy ass kicking babe. I cannot believe i am writing this but she was incredible! Of course she cannot fill Michelle Pfeiffer's (iconic) shoes simply because in the Tim Burtonland, Catwoman was a demented, emotionally scarred woman with certain supernatural status at the background and played more like a tragic villain. Here, Hathaway plays Selena Kyle as a sexy, independent, thief that is balancing between good and bad all the way through the film. A fitting antihero and blurred line between Batman's justice and Bane's menace. What i really enjoyed is how similar she looks, sounds, talks and moves like her counterpart in the animated series, comics and videogames. She is even waving that ass with a cat like pose. I absolutely loved this character!\n\nThe rest of the (multiple) cast are doing what they are doing best servicing the reliable (and sometimes surprising) story written by Nolan and Goyer. Both have done their homework with Nolan's direction becoming even more confident than before. His camera sweeps and embraces the vast cityscape of Gotham, day and (much more impressively) in the night. His exquisite taste for night time shots is something that deserves the IMAX ticket alone and brings back memories when Michael Mann used to be a cool director. But what about the script? How can a film surpass the heavy expectations of the Oscar worthy \"Dark knight\"? Wel, it doesn't, but instead it goes around them. How do you follow that? You can't. Thus Nolan and co-s have done the wise decision of not repeating themselves terminating unwanted comparisons with the previous installments. The first entry was focused to the personal spiritual odyssey of a man and the second evolved into a crime thriller about masked vigilantes and themes of anarchy fused with (in)justice. On the other hand, the third chapter goes back to conclude the journey and the degenerated anarchy, brings back everything (and everyone) together and ties them nicely in the vast present of terrorism and economic prevalence (in a lesser degree). The Joker was full of surprises and meaningless through his performance reflecting the psychotic personality. Bane has a plan - to destroy Gotham city, to live in order to see its ashes. He doesn't want chaos, he wants order through chaos which is an interesting concept. The layout of anger, injustice, blurred morality (chase the Batman the vigilante or the robbers?) and motives is displayed through a complex array of events and almost possible situations (military law anyone?) that can be thought provoking and mind feeding.\n\nCertain twists and turns do exist to maintain our thrilling interest to the sky but if you are a devoted Batman comic book guy, then you know kinda the story. \"The dark knight rises\" reaches superior film level status when it comes to powerful emotional scenes and outstanding sequences that will have your heart filled with grief and your sentiments exploding (for spoiler reasons i cannot mention any of these). The exceptional score by Hans Zimmer underlines and sometimes more than enough enhances the power of the unfolding events on screen into our mind. The A-class acting manages to inject real pathos and drama into the proceedings and this is what lacks from the movies nowdays. A good story, a fantastic cast and a large group of crew members that could make films like these possible. The movie is exceptionally shot, the action is plenty and more epic than before and the fight sequences between Batman and Bane are astonishing, especially their first encounter.\n\n\"The dark knight rises\" is an experience and should be seen in IMAX. There is ground here for even more psychological exploration and doubts about moral responsibilities that could reflect into our reality. This is a fitting and satisfying conclusion to the legend of the dark knight. Probably the world's best trilogy?"

Great actors, but what happened to the sound? Seems a lot of the dialogue is unintelligible to native English speakers over 45 years old. My kids could hear fine, but my wife and I and the press at the London screening couldn't decipher the dialogue at times. 'Most of us at the press show couldn't even hear the dialogue' said Nigel Andrews, the Financial Times reviewer on July 19th 2012.\n\nI don't know about you, but I hate missing out on dialogue, especially in a Nolan film where there are bound to be great subtleties at play that will heighten the overall film experience. So the chief sound editor should certainly be up for a Razzie. Trouble is, there doesn't look in the crew list like there was a chief sound editor and perhaps that was the problem."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just saw TDKR in IMAX with my Mom, and I have just one word for it... WHOA! I was really impressed with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this one... I'm sorry but I'm still in awe of this movie. The best Batman movie I've ever seen, and maybe the best MOVIE I've ever seen. Since the final scene in The Dark Knight when Batman is riding the Bat-Pod and disappears into downtown Gotham, I've been waiting four years to see what direction Christopher Nolan and the rest of the crew and cast would take. Now that we've finally reached the release of \"The Dark Knight Rises\", I'm extremely happy to say that I was completely blown away by this movie. Usually threequels tend not to do so good, but this is one of the few that are outstanding!\n\nStory (No spoilers): 8 years have passed since the Joker's rampage, and Batman has not been seen since he has taken the fall for Harvey Dent/Two-Face's crimes. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse, and is clearly emotionally damaged by his experiences as Batman, and his loss of his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes. The crime rate in Gotham City has quieted down, but that peacetime is short lived when a new threat arrives. A threat even worse than what the Joker had in store for Gotham... BANE. Batman is then forced to come out of hiding to stop Bane's reign of terror.\n\nThe acting as always is top notch: Christian Bale is an excellent and believable Batman/Bruce Wayne, and accurately shows the complexity of the character. This is probably his best portrayal of Bruce Wayne since we get a really good insight on Bruce Wayne much like the insight we got on Peter Parker in Spider-Man 2, and how Bruce must rise above his personal demons once again and become Batman in his heart and mind. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman really surprised me. I loved her performances in some of her other movies, but this performance is probably her best yet! She is the best Catwoman ever put on screen! Tom Hardy as Bane, while he may not be as interesting as the Joker he's still an awesome villain. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is phenomenal, and he is one of the most exciting and most terrifying villain I've ever seen. He's physically superior to Batman which is shown in the first confrontation between the two characters, which was so intense by the way. I like how his physical appearance was changed for this movie because the expressions in his eyes makes him more intimidating. And yes his voice was much more easier to understand this time, even though there are times you may not clearly understand what he said. Plus, Tom Hardy's Bane made me forget all about Joel Schumacher's version of Bane in \"Batman and Robin\", and that's saying something. As for the rest of the cast, Michael Caine (he got me teary eyed a few times in this one), Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotilliard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (awesome as usual, and his character has a surprising story arc at the end) are fantastic in their roles. Heck, anyone who had a small part or anyone who was an extra should be proud that they were even in this movie! Lastly the directing: Christopher Nolan has done such a superb job with telling his story of Batman, and I congratulate him for making a trilogy that is probably the best I've ever seen.\n\nThe moment this movie started, I was completely drawn into it from beginning to the end, as was everybody else in the theater. No spoilers, but there were twists and turns that I didn't expect to happen, some scenes with funny lines (especially some of the scenes between Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne, and between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman) and yes some romance. And the way the film ends (without spoiling anything) was perfect. All the loose ends that were open throughout the trilogy were wrapped up so nicely.\n\nThe visual effects once again were amazing and I liked the scene at the football stadium. The music by Hans Zimmer is mind blowing, and I don't think you could come up with a better score for Batman than this! And I also love the look of Gotham City in this one. Unlike the last two films which were filmed in Chicago, most of it this time was filmed in NYC, and some of the shots were filmed in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. Plus I was able to pick out a few spots obviously since most of this was filmed in NYC, since my family is from NYC.\n\nThis trilogy once again is probably the best that I've ever seen, and it's definitely the kind of trilogy we'll be telling our kids about in 20 years time much like our parents told us about Star Wars. These three movies have given me such great experiences and memories that I will remember forever, and I'm absolutely going to miss the hype that comes with waiting for Nolan's next Batman, but I think he's right when he says it's time for the story to come to an end. I'm not kidding when I say this: Check this one out because, you're in for one hell of a ride!\n\n(This is in light of the tragic shooting in Colorado: may God take care of the victims that are now with Him, the families of those who were killed and may He help the family of the shooter get through this terrible ordeal he's put them through.)\n\nUpdate: I still think this film is great, and I don't really see any problems or plot holes like people keep insisting there is. This was a solid ending to the trilogy and nothing more."

        "review_detailed_main": "Going out with a bang doesn't even begin to describe \"The Dark Knight Rises\", the final installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. The film runs over 2 hours and 30 minutes but keeps you interested at all times (the main problem I had with the otherwise excellent \"The Dark Knight\" was that its pacing felt uneven and it got a little boring at times) and keeps upping the tension every minute leading up to what is indeed an epic conclusion. The film picks up eight years after \"the Dark Knight\", with the city of Gotham almost crime-free due to Batman taking the blame for the death of Harvey Dent. But it turns out to be the calm before the biggest threat Gotham has ever faced \u0096 a revolution led by the menacing Bane (Tom Hardy) and his henchmen. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from the public eye with only his butler Alfred (Michael Caine) to keep him company. However, a mysterious criminal named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and threat of Gotham's destruction makes him rise from the shadows again. Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the other actors (Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson) who previously appeared in the series reprise their roles with ease and seem to push their acting to the very limit since it's the last installment. Especially Bale and Oldman have never been better in their roles. But it's the new additions to the cast that really lifts this movie to a higher level. Hathaway, whose casting I definitely had some doubts about, plays Selina/Catwoman perfectly \u0096 an extraordinary mix of strength and vulnerability. Marion Cotillard in the other \"love interest\" role blows previous Batman paramours Maggie Gyllenhaal and Katie Holmes out of the water. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also wonderful as John Blake, a policeman with strong beliefs. But it's Tom Hardy as Bane that really made the film for me. Not only is he truly terrifying at times, but he also manages to make the character sympathetic and complex. But the true star of the film is director (and co-screenwriter) Cristopher Nolan. As a previous fan of his work I was looking forward to this film with very high expectations and some fear that it wouldn't live up to the hype. My expectations were not matched \u0096 they were exceeded. The depth of the story was immense; it provoked lots of thoughts about society and our values and had a huge emotional impact on me. Credit for the cinematographer, the composer (Hans Zimmer truly is the greatest composer of today) and the special effects team is also due. Never have I ever felt as truly satisfied with every aspect of a film as I did with this one. So to summarize \"The Dark Knight Rises\" it is one of the best films I have ever seen and the absolute best one in the trilogy. It makes almost all other films pale in comparison to its grandeur and even if it won't be the box office winner of the year (which it very well may be) it's going to be a classic for years to come. As I try to describe how great it was I realize that it isn't possible \u0096 because it was so much more than great. This is a movie isn't just a movie. It's a future legend."

Hardy made Bane look like a fanatic catching its essence and its revolt. Hathway was not only sexy but also stellar.

        "review_detailed_main": "In 2005 Christopher Nolan gave us Batman Begins, a near-perfect film detailing the story of Bruce Wayne and his journey to becoming Batman. This film brought Batman out from the depths of movie hell, there courtesy of Joel Schumacher's appalling Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, which turned Batman into a joke who no one would want to touch with 10-foot pole. Thankfully Nolan was brave enough to resurrect him in 2005, and in 2008 we got The Dark Knight, a film which turned what we knew about blockbusters and superhero flicks upside-down. With a phenomenal performance by Heath Ledger and an even darker journey into Gotham City this was a perfect film.\n\nNow, after four years, Nolan concludes his epic trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises. There is no denying the hype for this movie is huge, people are bound to be disappointed, fans divided and angry, but when after I finished watching this (after having attended a back-to-back trilogy screening on an IMAX screen) I realised just how fitting this movie was. These aren't simple superhero movies with loud noises and non-stop action, he has imbued each character with true personalities and the story with multiple themes. Bruce Wayne became Batman in the beginning, fell into dark times in the middle and rose to become Gotham's hero in the end. Emotions run high in this final installment as Batman comes out of hiding to face a truly menacing villain along with the people close to him.\n\nEight years after the events of The Dark Knight Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is in hiding and his corporation is going broke, but the emergence of Bane (Tom Hardy), a mercenary with a dark past out for trouble, and Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) bring Wayne out of retirement. Now Batman, along with up and coming Detective Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Alfred (Michael Caine) and newcomer millionaire Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) must try and save Gotham from Bane and his mercenaries.\n\nWhere do I start with reviewing this movie? There is much to say and an unfortunate limit on my word count so I will be brief. The acting is outstanding from each cast member, Bale has been so good as Wayne/Batman and he completes his character arc with raw emotion. Hardy is exceptional as Bane, physically intimidating and always a scene-stealer, most of the film's best scenes involve Bane addressing a large crowd or brutalising anyone in his way. Hathaway does well as Catwoman, neither hero or villain she is a complex character who I wish we saw more of. Of course Oldman, Cotillard and Freeman are excellent, but I must mention Michael Caine who really shone in this film, delivering an award-worthy final turn as everyone's favourite butler. Finally Joseph Gordon-Levitt is proving again and again he is becoming one of the best actors of our time, he does a fantastic job as the optimistic detective who never loses hope.\n\nNolan's direction is perfect and his script (co-written with his brother Jonathon) is an emotional roller-coaster packed with some truly breathtaking action set-pieces filmed in glorious IMAX. Cities crumble, bridges collapse and civil wars are fought and look fantastic, thank you Nolan for not shooting in 3D! Hans Zimmer's score suits the tone of the film well, the now very well known chant is used to good effect in a pivotal scene towards the end.\n\nThis is a truly cinematic experience, expertly blending the action genre with drama, creating a fitting final act to Nolan's Batman trilogy. I may seem to be heaping too much praise on this movie, but really, it deserves it, it is engrossing and quite simply one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. Nolan's Batman trilogy is possibly one of the greatest conceived and it will be a long time before a superhero movie of this calibre will be made.\n\n10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "Disappointed as a viewer. The worst thing a film can do it to make the viewer step out of the film and say \"Give me a break\" If the film interrupts the viewing, it is flawed.\n\nGive me a break. Detonation of an atomic bomb off the coast of Gotham? The aftermath: Huge waves, devastation to the city. Radiation fall out for years. The suggestion that Batman is alive is also absurd. He had 5 seconds to detonation and had not dropped the bomb. NO WAY he could have reached any kind of escape velocity. And if his BAT vehicle submerged, which I doubt it did. He could not have survived the radioactivity and heat generated by the blast. This is just stupid writing. The film makers should have resorted to another scenario.\n\nNext, the entire police force crowded together in a massive mob heading toward city hall. That is just stupid. It may have worked in an old 1930s movie where UNION workers confronted private police and then fought it out with CLUBS, but to walk into a direct assault of canons? Have we learned nothing since the CIVIL WAR. Battles are not fought that way anymore. The police would have spread out, infiltrated the city hall via underground passages, used ropes to repel from buildings, and overwhelmed the bad guys, not walk in to certain death. The entire attack on city hall was plain stupid. Another example of pulling the viewer out of the film and making him say \"What the Hell?\".\n\nIn fact, the movie should have been called BATMAN and CATWOMAN. Ann Hathaway was an equal to the Dark Knight and I might say did more to save the city that he did.\n\nBANE was a bad dude, psychotic and menacing, but his mask was his Achilles heel. It was much too vulnerable and as such was a stupid idea. If the mask was controlling his pain, he needed to have it protected. All of the punches to his face would have been more than enough to disable this Darth Vader Wannabe. I did like the use of the Sean Connery voice. It added a bit of class the the maniac's demeanor.\n\nAlso, having a Mideastern villain wanting revenge on Gotham? Old news since 911. Not very original.\n\nThe film does show how vulnerable modern cities are to terrorism, but DUH! that Old news as well.\n\nBottom Line. Too many flaws in logic and writing for me to really enjoy the film."

Don't think, just do (like the joker).\n\nI also would like to spread out my condolences to the families of the victims of the shooting in Aurora.

Comparing this film the Nolan's last two films, the Dark Knight and Inception, it feels like the story just wasn't as well written. The twists we're OK, nothing mindblowing, and there were a few holes in the plot. But I think it really just came down to the Villains in the movie. What made Dark Knight so great was that The Joker was such a great character. Bane? Not so much. He was strong and punched hard, but wasn't quite evil enough. I expected more."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Dark Knight Rises is one of those rare films that you want to continue longer than its run time. The film is mind-blowingly awesome and I feel that the movie is immensely better than its predecessors. Why?\n\nWell, for one, it has outstanding performances by each and every cast member and not once did I feel the acting to be corny or lame. The real standouts were, of course, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy. Bale returns to take up the mantle of Batman once again and he doesn't disappoint in any way. His butler Alfred also made this movie great because Michael Caine is such a fine actor who can really evoke your emotions. Tom Hardy's performance as Bane is indescribable. It is just so good. We all expect Bane to be ruthless,and he is, but he is also very smart and sophisticated. He is no shape or form similar in any way to the piece of sh*t Bane from Batman and Robin. That Bane was just a vomit-inducing dumbass. I consider Hardy to give the finest performance in the film. You just have to see him on screen. Anne Hathaway, Morgan Freeman, and the rest were also great in the film.\n\nSecondly, the action along with the score make TDKR a film to watch. Batman is back after 8 years and he has a new vehicle at his disposal. The Bat-copter accounts for some action scenes in the film and it plays a crucial part in the story. Bane's physique, strength, and fighting skills are better than Batman's and the fighting scenes between them two makes you want to stand up and cheer. The score and soundtrack also alleviate the action and give the fight scenes a sense of epicness. We have Hans Zimmer to thank for that. Overall, the film's score makes every scene more better.\n\nFinally, the story is very interesting and never becomes boring or makes you want the film to skip to the fighting already. Batman has to come out of his hiatus and take on Bane who is terrorizing Gotham City. The film cleverly explores Bane's background in order to give the reader a reason as to what causes him to become the madman that he is. Not everything is what it seems. I won't go into too much because I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nI did have one issue with the film though. Bane's mask makes it hard to clearly understand what he is saying and a couple of times I had to ask my brother next to me what Bane just said. Even my brother didn't have a clue.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the film and I consider it to be one of the best superhero films made, even better than the Avengers - which I really liked.\n\n'Over and Out.' 22nd of July, 2012."

Its beautiful, stunning, shocking, amazing. and props to the guy who wrote the music... cause that is some VERY good music right there. :) Christian Bale is the best Batman and you get too peer into Bruce Waynes ideals and what he is truly made of. not batman... but Bruce Wayne. Anne Hathoway is perfect Catwoman who is sly, sexy, and utterly awesome. Lastly, Tom Hardy is a perfect evil mastermind with a twist. he gives Bane life and emotions and an overall shockingly good portrayal of bane. And what a great twist in the movie. i NEVER saw it coming. go see the Dark Knight Rises NOW."

I'm a huge fan of the series so was going to watch it anyway, whether it was good or bad because generally the conclusion of any epic series isn't that satisfying. But....we forget it's Christopher Nolan who has directed this. I was actually speechless for a long time after the movie finished. It's PHENOMENAL!!!\n\nIt's worth every dime of your money and time spent (it's a long movie). It's full of stupefying, yet sensible, action, with an addition to Batman's armada of stunning vehicles. There are many twists and turns which keeps even the most seasoned of the audience guessing till a long time. All the acting is genuine (no question there!), the cinematography is bold and raw. Catwoman steals the hearts. And Bane, oh.. He is so bad and so tough! The direction is, as always, brilliant. In fact, Christopher Nolan has given everything he's got to this finale. It's dark, we can emotionally attach to, and feel, every situation and along with all this I would like to make the special mention of the music, the background score, by Hans Zimmer. I wouldn't be wrong in saying that this film wouldn't have got this legendary aura to it without the background music!\n\nSo, in short, whether you've watched earlier parts or not, it's an at least a must watch movie, three times!"

        "review_detailed_main": "When Batman begins first came out I wasn't sure how you could do any better than the first Michael Keaton film. How wrong I was! Nolan has done a fantastic job reinventing the series, The sequel was almost as good as the first and gave us an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger which will always be remembered. So he had to get it right again and once again he does not disappoint.\n\nThere was always a worry for me that putting Catwoman into a comic book film that Nolan has really tried to keep as realistic as possible would add a camp over the top element to it but Anne Hathaway played it brilliantly and looked stunning in the tight leather outfit, I would have said cat suit but it's only hinted as one with a clever use of glasses for ears.\n\nTom Hardy was great as ever, he even managed to show his emotions through a thick mask. Once again another incredibly memorable bad guy has been brought to us. My only criticisms would be that occasionally it was difficult to understand what he was saying, I found myself having to really concentrate hard to follow the dialogue. Also without giving anything away he goes from a menacing, very intelligent force to be reckoned with that was always one step ahead of everyone, to a basic vulnerable thug quite quickly and I feel such a great character deserved a better finale.\n\nI also found that if I thought too hard about what the overall logic behind the city destruction plan was there were several plot holes.....but this is not based on a true story and there was nothing too obvious to take you out of the action so it really didn't matter too much.\n\nThe film is quite long but moves at a relentless pace, with Hanz Zimmers pounding soundtrack to keep us gripped along with some incredible action scenes, sit back, switch off and let Bane and Batmans clash unfold in a nicely wrapped up ending to a fantastic trilogy, it's just a shame it's all over."

        "review_title": "The Dark Knight Rises: Ironically at the Bottom of the Trilogy",
        "review_detailed_main": "I have always been a massive fan of the Batman comics, ever since I was a child I was asking for the Batmobile for Christmas, and even though it's terrible I'm still a fan of the Tim Burton reboot. (Now you really know I'm a die-hard fan) But with all that said, there was something about The Dark Knight Rises that didn't feel right to me.\n\nHaving seen it 4 times now I feel like I have a strong grasp on the entire film, and there are definitely some flaws that need pointing out, even though the majority of the film did leave me in awe. First of all I want to say that out of the trilogy; Batman Begins is my favourite. I love The Dark Knight, but it almost feels like 'filler' between Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises, in that there's no real story to it, it's just what Batman did for about a month that lead to Rachel dying. I loved Batman Begins because although it showed Bruce over a long period of time, it didn't really miss out any details. There were no stones left unturned, every story arc had an ending, every Christopher Nolan placed cheesy joke had it's minute, and even the ending wasn't as clich\u00e9d as it sounds on paper, even if I do hate it for making me wait 3 years to meet the Joker. But with all the hype leading up to 'Rises, I feel like an unobtainable greatness was expected by me and a lot of other fans, and so it would always seem worse than the previous two. That's nothing against Nolan though, 'Rises is a fantastic film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the only ending to a trilogy I have ever fully appreciated was Return of the King, but that's because it's such a masterpiece that the earlier films were dwarfed in comparison. So based on that 'Rises was destined to fail in my eyes.\n\nThat said, there were still parts of 'Rises that are truly awesome. Bane, for instance, is one of the best villains I have seen in any film, game, book, TV show, advert, comic or dental commercial ever. He's just so bad-ass, even with the ridiculous voice and perfectly smooth head; Tom Hardy manages to present this 'don' of a character that even Samurai-flipping-Jack would be frightened of, and he does it all with the majority of his face covered up. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman also deserves much credit. The 'Halle Berry Catwoman' was bitter sweet for me and much of the DC fan base, it no-doubt was a very, very poor film, but it was sexy as hell, and this is where I saw Anne Hathaway going wrong; I thought she'd try too hard to make a better character than Berry and end up making a Catwoman that pasty teenagers around the globe couldn't \"enjoy\". But rest assured universe; she ticked both boxes. Hathaway ended up creating a character with such a sense of mystique around her that I think we all ended up wanting her to have more screen time, just so we could work her out, well that and her uh..'delectable posterior' (to put it nicely). On top of that, there are so many moments in this film that have you on the edge of your seat, making involuntary \"phwwoaaaaarrr\"-like noises. The bat-pods, for instance, are so much cooler than ever before, with the rolling-sideways-wheels and smashing into and through buildings. The collection of all 5 tumblers also had me giggling like a little girl, and even the small references to 'Killer Croc' made me grin uncontrollably.\n\nThere are, however, some faults with The Dark Knight Rises that I feel need to be covered. A couple of them are just nit-picking; such as how in hell didn't the football player realise the ground had collapsed behind him? and how did Batman survive the nuclear blast if two seconds from detonation we saw him pushing the throttle forward?! Even if he had ejected immediately after he would have been able to avoid the blast radius. Some of the faults are more substantial though. For example I feel like bringing Ra's Al Ghul back into the picture with his daughter ruined things a tad, having Bane, the man exiled from the league of shadows for being too extreme is enough I think, as they don't really deal with Talia after she escapes, they just kill Bane and dispose of the bomb. Secondly, I feel there were a few too many plot twists for the story to flow properly, I mean come on Nolan; It's the end of the best Batman trilogy ever made; you don't have to keep throwing in changes to make sure we don't get bored. Hell, the majority of us are going to love it even if it's awful.\n\nOverall though it's extremely important to remember that this movie is the 'cat's pyjamas', and will probably go in for an Oscar or two if the academy don't act like idiots (again). Bane is one of the best written, most quotable character's of any film I've ever seen, and Bale really comes into his own as both Batman and Bruce in this third and final instalment (he tones down the Batman grumble, and doesn't make Bruce look like such a pansy anymore). So really disregard what I've said above, it's a fantastic film and I'm sure it will be a lot of people's favourite of the trilogy, just not mine. Go out and make your own opinion on it, because it's another of these films that come around once in a while where a review or general rating isn't able to truly determine how great it really is.

The next scene is at Wayne manor with Gordon saying his speech, and you think, this is just a boring scene, and will get better, but not for at least an hour and a half. The film is very enjoyably, and does not feel overlong, but starts of bad. It is a brilliant film, which was to be expected from the brilliant director, Christopher Nolan, just not as good as the dark knight, which no one expected it to be. I still highly recommend this film, just don't expect it to be the new shawshank redemption."

If we watch a comedy we nod approvingly if a joke is funny, if we're watching a drama we nod disapprovingly if something bad happens. In short, Dutch people aren't generally very enthusiastic. At the end of the Dark Knight Rises, however, there was applause. No kidding, actual applause. I had never seen this happen, ever. And it's not undeserved, because this is one amazing piece of cinema.\n\nThere might be some minor flaws in this film. Bane's voice sounded a bit odd at times, for instance. But then, no good movie is without mistakes. There's Pterodactyls in Citizen Kane, for god's sake! Look over the movies slight flaws and there's an amazing film underneath.\n\nThe story is compelling and much less \"superhero\" than the other two. Sure, you still have the typical comic-book characters. But the story's focus on the people behind those masks creates a much more realistic and emotionally compelling movie. And the movie achieves this without going too far away from the Batman's comic-book roots.\n\nBut there's another reason why this movie is such a great film. It complete's the trilogy. It rarely happens that movies based on comic-books contain an actual ending. This movie does, taking all the threads from the three movies and wrapping them up in a neat bundle.\n\nIn conclusion, it might be an unpopular opinion, but I find this to be the best Batman movie, ever."

The messy plot, all the logical faults, the soft comments where to sacrifice oneself for the city of Gotham, the tears, the worn out wisdom of the wise-man in the cave. I suspect a \"we're only in it for the money\" attitude for the creators of this film, but then again it looks as if they tried but failed, and an expensive film to make it must have been. Why not use some of that money on an intelligent plot. Instead of this mess. Just forget this movie and save your money, and your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.\n\nI've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.\n\nAs for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a few brilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.\n\nMichael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake.\n\nI don't know why IMDb doesn't let you post reviews with more then a thousand words. Anyway you can see the rest of my review at Movieweb.com under Huntsman."

        "review_title": "One of the finest examples of intelligent blockbuster entertainment, this concluding chapter in Nolan's Batman trilogy rises above even the loftiest of audience expectations",
        "review_detailed_main": "If there was anyone who could top 'The Dark Knight', it would have to be Christopher Nolan himself. It's no small feat even for the masterful director - not least for the fact that it would have been difficult to construct a villain as perfect as the late Heath Ledger's Joker \u2013 but fans who ever doubted if Nolan would be able to pull it off can now rest easy. Not only is the answer to that question an affirmative yes, Nolan closes quite possibly the very best comic-book adaptation ever with a heart-stopping bang, once and for all putting his stamp on the Batman legend with a viscerally thrilling and emotionally gripping conclusion.\n\nFamiliarity with the Gotham universe and the Bruce Wayne/ Batman character that Nolan had built over the course of 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' is a must if one were to truly appreciate and admire the subtleties, nuances and brilliance of this trilogy capper.\n\nOpening eight years after Batman disappeared into the shadows carrying the burden of District Attorney Harvey Dent's murder, Nolan and his co- screenwriter Johnathan Nolan paint a Gotham still living a lie. While Dent's legacy has assisted the city to lock up its criminals without trial, the seeds of criminalism are evident- after all, Gotham has once again been divided by class, with the wealthy controlling the institutions of power and the poor forced to grovel in the sewers. Those who recall 'Batman Begins' will certainly draw the parallels with Gotham before Batman's appearance, the very societal malaise perfect fodder for Ra's al Ghul and his League of Shadows' plan of destruction then.\n\nOf course, the similarities are no coincidence- Batman's adversary here is the vicious mercenary Bane (Tom Hardy), who was a student of the League of Shadows before he was ex-communicated from the organisation for being even too extremist for them. Sure, Bane may not be as familiar a villain within the Batman universe as the Joker, but a sensationally exhilarating mid-air hijack sequence will soon demonstrate that Bane isn't kidding when he proclaims himself as 'Gotham's reckoning'. Not only an intellectual equal to Batman, Bane is also physically superior, especially given Bruce's poor state of health following his self-imposed seclusion in the eight years that have followed.\n\nBane's strategy of upending the class inequality will intrigue and delight the more cerebral viewers, while his physicality will excite the adrenaline-driven (and predominantly male) viewer looking for some good- old mano-a-mano action goodness. Herein lies the genius of Nolan's films- built as they may be for blockbuster spectacle, they have always had an intellectual slant. The realities of our capitalist societies have been distilled and crystallised into that of Gotham, and the triggers of class warfare laid bare for our reflection.\n\nEven as it feels expansive in scope, Nolan never loses sight of his titular character. This is by far his most intimate take on Bruce Wayne/ Batman, returning full circle to examine Wayne's motivations for adopting the alter-ego in the first place as well as his inner demons. In particular, Nolan reinforces the relationship between Batman and his two guardians- the loyal Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and the equally loyal Wayne Enterprises employee Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).\n\nBesides casting light on Wayne's troubled soul, Nolan also delves once again into the core of the Batman legend. He established Batman as a symbol of hope and justice before, and here he powerfully reaffirms that notion of the caped crusader as a beacon of promise and perseverance amidst a fallen world. 'The Batman can be anyone', says Bruce Wayne in the movie- and Nolan leaves that statement ringing in your mind with a franchise feeder of an ending and a nifty twist to one of the key new characters he adds.\n\nWhether returning or new characters, all but Anne Hathaway have worked with Nolan previously, and every one of these fine actors are in top form here. Hathaway's zestful performance brings some welcome levity into the otherwise grim and brooding proceedings, and Levitt perfectly embodies the balance of optimism and pragmatism of his character. As Bane, Tom Hardy is unfortunately saddled with the bane (pun intended) of following in the shoes of Heath Ledger- and though he never manages to make his character quite as iconic, he is nevertheless a fearsome and formidable physical presence on screen. Veteran actors Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Gordon), Freeman and Caine are excellent as always, but it is Bale who carries the show with a thoroughly committed, haunting and hypnotic portrayal of Bruce Wayne.\n\nMesmerising too is Nolan's handling of the action scenes in the movie, most of which are filmed with IMAX cameras and look absolutely stunning in the format. From the opening skyjacking to blowing up a football field in the middle of a packed stadium to a daring mid-day raid on the Stock Exchange, Nolan spares nothing in ensuring that the action is consistently riveting. It is also never less than realistic, a quality that Nolan has managed to sustain through every one of his Batman films. And together with his regular d.p. Wally Pfister, Nolan creates a scarily authentic portrait of urban warfare complete with the collapse of physical and social structures.\n\nIndeed, as one looks back at Nolan's trilogy, one can only marvel at how he has managed to make the Batman universe so relevant and prescient to our real world. Unlike the Marvel movies which has kept the comic book universe intact while injecting real-world elements, Nolan has so beautifully integrated the twin universes together, sacrificing neither the legend from the books nor the realities of today's society. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an epic conclusion all right, packed with action, emotion, depth and symbolism, and a must-see simply because it is one of the very best films of the year."

He was hard and menacing yet much more human than the Joker, and one scene in particular you see Bane is still has a little bit of a soft side. The effects and cinematography were just what you'd expect, perfect. I honestly don't have any complaints with this film. It was everything I hoped for, and made this, in my mind, on of the greatest trilogy of all time.

When i first saw \"Begins\" i thought that it took the comic book films to a different level thanks to the believability and sincerity of the characters it portrayed. \"Rises\" continues this line which was set by the first movie and followed by \"The Dark Knight\".\n\nThe cast couldn't have been more perfect. Bale as Batman is able to give genuine emotion and bitterness following the losses he has suffered. He is not just another hero, he has been scarred by the events come to pass and knows that just putting up the mask again is not going to be enough.\n\nBane, played by Tom Hardy, stole the show for me. I was pleased that a new kind of villain was introduced. In the first movie, Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul relied on the terror of fear implanted in peoples minds, in the second one, Joker unleashed uncontrollable chaos and in the third one Bane is a brutal menace, who breaks down Batman and, by his words \"liberates people from the oppressive corruption Gotham endures\". Tom Hardy did remarkably well by creating Bane as someone terrifying simply by using his voice and eyes.\n\nI was also glad to see that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a great role following his \"Inception\" one. He plays a different kind of hero and this performance definitely feels like he will have a lot that comes in his way in next years. Anne Hathaway was also phenomenal as Selina Kyle. She had the main female part and did an excellent and believable job.\n\nThe rest of the supporting cast consisted of great actors and actresses too. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard and Gary Oldman were all marvelous in their respective roles. The chemistry between the whole cast was amazing, maybe it's the main reason why Nolan has included them in most of his films too.\n\nOther aspects of the film were completely mind-blowing. Hans Zimmer wrote score of immense atmosphere, the scale of action scenes was extraordinary and cinematography beyond ones imagination. Dialogue was smart and really gave life to the characters.\n\nIn conclusion, i have to say that the Batman trilogy Nolan has created is one of my favorites and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a worthy final chapter to it. Everything about this movie is shear perfect."

        "review_detailed_main": "There were a lot of batman movies, but none of them could meet the expectations created by the comics, with \"batman & Robin\" being one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen! Then Nolan came along with a bunch of masterpieces behind him, and then created two astounding batman films within a span of 3 years! And now, he has concluded, which to me is one of the best trilogies ever, in an epic and a heart-stopping way! As they say 'THE LEGEND ENDS, BUT THE LEGACY CONTINUES'............!!!\n\nIts hard to compare this and TDK, both of them are amusing in their own prospective. TDK was run mainly by joker, aka heath ledger, and this was clearly batman's show. I can't imagine a perfect way to end the trilogy. And Nolan did an amazing job in maintaining the fire created by TDK, clearly stating that he is one of the best in his genre.\n\nThe action sequences were pretty amazing so was the background music. There is a reason why Nolan retained the same cast for all the movies, and they did it professionally.\n\nIt was one hell of a ride for me, and gave me goosebumps throughout. Being a batman fan, I loved all the 3 movies, and just like the other two movies, I rate it 10/10. Don't miss it guys, besides you have got to see the 'legend end'."

I had been looking forward to Rises ever since I heard the last words in The Dark Knight and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. The plot was well thought out and the acting was superb, however with that said the acting was not close to that of Heath Ledger's spectacular performance in The Dark Knight. It was the perfect end to an incredible trilogy, Nolan has well earned a spot on my list of favorite directors. The only reason I gave this movie a 9/10 is because I do not believe that any film to date is \"perfect\", but the Dark Knight trilogy comes pretty damn close to it."

The acting was also Terrific and this got to be the number one movie of 2012 so far for me. It is definitely worth to watch and I promise it is not going to waste the 3 hours of your life! There is a perfect balance of story line, theme, action, romance, and drama in the film though I've got to admit I cried a couple of times in some scenes of the movie. There is definitely not going to be a sequel of this movie but there is going to be another story from it. Again, this movie (and of course its sequel) has got to be the best Superhero movie of all time! Bat Man is a human and superhero role model. Great job on this movie Dark Night team!"

        "review_title": "Sharp drop-off in quality from the earlier two",
        "review_detailed_main": "As \"The Dark Knight Rises\" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in \"The Dark Knight\" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.\n\nThough Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).\n\nAnd, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.\n\nThanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, \"The Dark Knight Rises\" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.\n\nThe cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of \"The Dark Night Rises\" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects."

And if you weren't then no Batman film will ever match TDK for you. (SPOLIER ALERT)And yes, it is The End, a resounding resolution for what Batman Begins begun. Threads from that film are picked up, lengthened and strengthened, bringing a staunch integrity \u2013 in every sense \u2013 to the overall arc. Is it perfect? Factor in some clunky catch-up exposition near the start, a cringey log-fire love scene and moments where Hans Zimmer's score nearly foghorns the actors off the screen and the answer's no. An even bigger question: is it up there with The Dark Knight? Not quite."

This film is a brutal, deep, thoughtful,touching, tale of redemption and destruction. The cast is superb but the standout is Joseph Gordon Levitt as a rookie cop who is ahead of the game. Although Tom Hardy gives him a run for his money as a re-imagined Bane, a terrorist that truly believes in a cause, rather than just anarchy, and that makes him truly terrifying. Even Anne Hathaway brought her game as Selina Kyle who acts whatever part she needs to. Everyone should see this film, although I will warn you that the violence in it is extreme for the rating and really pushes what you can do in a film of this classification"

Nolan returns to the roots of this series by making Bruce learn more about fear. Bruce must learn the power of fear yet again, see it in a new way and learn to use it in a different way.\n\nThe expected things are all there, the villain winning the first battle, hero returning stronger, nice twists, action and fist fights, new gadgets, effects. But don't let them blind you, look deeper and you would find the crowning jewel of this series.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning, the soundtrack is amazing!!"

Now I want to get this out of the way as soon as possible, a lot of people are comparing Bane to the Joker but you cannot do this, simply on the soul fact... they are completely different characters. The Joker was dark, cunning and knew how to manipulate those we all thought couldn't be, however Bane is without a doubt Batman's strongest opponent physically and mentally, he pushes Bruce Wayne/Batman to the brink of destruction throughout the movie, his physical presence in itself is extremely intimidating not to mention his distinctive voice. There are a lot of plot twists also throughout the movie which fit brilliantly within the story telling and the last 40 minutes are one of the greatest in cinematic history. I don't want to say much more because words simply can't describe how brilliant this movie is and in my opinion beats TDK and I never thought I would say that because TDK is a cinematic triumph across the board. All that's left to say now is thank you Mr. Nolan for a truly wonderful trilogy that concluded in epic style."
