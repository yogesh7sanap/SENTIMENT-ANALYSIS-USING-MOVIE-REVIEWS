The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.\n\nSee you next summer,Captain!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?\n\nAnd so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?\n\nAnd then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...\n\nI cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?\"\n\nAnd that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?\n\nI am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?\n\nI often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.\n\nExcept for this year.\n\nGo Jack.\n\nAnd, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected \"money shots\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.\n\nAnd now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"\n\nWell, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.\n\nOnce again, the children were wondering, \"What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"\n\nPerhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.\n\nAt this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.\n\nThis is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me."

The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.\n\nThere aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.\n\nI wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.\n\nBasically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10"

That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.\n\nBut kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie \"genre\" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!"

My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?).\n\nThe second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent.\n\nThe acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp's eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material.\n\nOverall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days. I'd give it *** out of four stars..."

But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting.\n\nThe entire movie consists mainly of CGI skeletons, CGI ships and tired children's' humour derived from would-be funny characters (the transvestite ghosts, whatever their names were, are the most forgettable sidekicks this side of Tantor). The plot is as uninteresting as they come. The only reason to see this film is Depp, and although his performance is positively amazing, it's not enough to boost this flick to \"great movie\" status. His great job and the gorgeous Caribbean scenery is enough to make this movie an above average kids' flick, but no more, no less.\n\nThere's not much else to say on the subject, so I'll leave you eunuchs to re-watch the film and consider that maybe everything about \"Pirates\" really isn't as amazing as you first thought it was.

The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like \"Stop blowing holes in my ship,\" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,\" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.\n\nWith hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)\n\nThe moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)\n\nThe other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...\n\nThe basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: \"we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'\"\n\nJack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as \"the worst pirate I've ever seen\", as in \"the worst at it\", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).\n\nThis character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another \"Mask of Zorro\", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...\n\nThere are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.\n\nThe film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - \"it's okay\", \"I was rooting for you\" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.\n\nBut then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! \u00ff"

It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find, namely:\n\nTHE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters, mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama, action, suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.)\n\nTHE BAD - Once again, the messages are \"laws are made to be broken;\" \"rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains,\" and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man, etc. etc. That all is so '60s clich\u00e9d by now, you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up, but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film, including a worldly outlook on everything, which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change.\n\nOVERALL - A fun movie, thanks mainly to Depp, director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen, and successful enough to spawn a sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.\n\nThe movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history."

        "review_detailed_main": "The movie deals with a curse on pirates , then they abduct the starring named Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) , the governor's daughter , with the aim she free them of a damned spell . A brave blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) is helped by a likable pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue his love and .save her from Jack's former pirate allies . They will have to confront a nasty villain (Geoffrey Rush) and his henchmen\n\nThe motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . Yet another swahbuckler adventure in which our starring blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow to save his love by embarking in a maritime escapade and these protagonists will have to confront an ominous villain and his hoodlums who are now undead. The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining. The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , also to Ray Harryhausen and his picture \u00a8Jason and the Argonauts\u00a8 regarding the living skeletons . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle including merciless pursuits , fantastic pirates , living skeletons , ships tumble down, overwhelming duels , swashbuckling and anything else . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . First-rate interpretation by Johnny Depp , he plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy and like Robert Newton in the film titled 'Blackbeard', providing the necessary hilarious touches . Along with habitual roles : Depp , Orlando Bloom , Kiera Knightley who was only eighteen years old when this movie came out , they're well accompanied by a good support cast , such as :Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Kevin MacNally , Mackenzie Crook , Martin Klebba, Greg Ellis, Damian O'Hare , Isaac C. Singleton Jr. , Trevor Goddard, Zoe Saldana and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is excellent but overacting , at times .\n\nColorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer . Klaus Badlet's musical score as well as direction by Gore Verbinsky are well made . The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is the tenth highest grossing franchise ever including similar actors and technicians . It is formed by the following ones : \u00a8The Curse of Black pearl (2003)\u00a8 by Gore Verbinski ; \u00a8Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\u00a8(2006) by Verbinski ; \u00a8Pirates of the Caribbean : At World's End\u00a8 (2007) by Verbinski ; \u00a8Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\u00a8 (2011) by Rob Marshall ; \u00a8Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u00a8 (2017) by Joachim R\u00f8nning, Espen Sandberg. Rating: 6,5/10 . Good."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this movie in the cinema without hearing any reviews at all from any newspapers and without reading the reviews from this website. I came out of the movie thinking it was OK, although would have been much better without all that ghost garbage. It's one of those movies I just forgot about from the minute it finished, it left no impact on me at all.\n\nA couple of months later I was looking through the IMDb Top250 list and I was absolutely shocked to see this movie was in it, absolutely shocked. I clicked on it to see if it was the same movie I saw because I simply couldn't believe what I was reading. This? In the top 250? What's my point? Well my point is that I thought the movie was ordinary at best. Maybe it's just me? As soon as the ghosts came into play I was instantly turned off by this unrealistic pointless add-on, so maybe this is what sent me to sleep. If it was the ghosts or not, it doesn't matter, I didn't like it.\n\nThe script and directing were good, so was Johnny Depp's acting. But Depps character gave me a pounding headache and the movies plot, in my mind, was absolutely terrible. Give me a realistic pirate movie, please, what a waste of talent on stupid ghosts."

        "review_detailed_main": "There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast. When I first saw The Curse of the Black Pearl as a boy I was fascinated. There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for.\n\nI can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical \"hero\" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states \"pirates Ye Be Warned\" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates.\n\nIts not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the \"crew of the dammed\". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time.\n\nAfter years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, \"you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one\", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes \"bring me that horizon\" as the ship sales off into the sunset."

Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)"

        "review_detailed_main": "8.0 is a much too high rating for this good but not great movie. I like the fact that a movie finally does justice to pirate stories. It's strange that this genre, which sure holds a few adventures in store, hasn't been too successful until \"Pirates Of The Caribbean\" hit the screen. Anyway, \"Pirates...\" is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of \"Indiana Jones\" and \"The Mummy\". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from \"Coupling\" and Gareth from \"The Office\" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all \"Pirates...\" is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster. I hope that maybe after the success of this movie, Hollywood thinks about turning \"Monkey Island\" (the classic adventure game by LucasArts) into a movie. Just a thought."

I especially couldn't believe that Return of the King got best Makeup over it. I saw NO makeup in that (the Orcs were people wearing masks), and then in Pirates, in come Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in spectacular makeup. I certainly think that Johnny should have gotten \"Best Actor\" for Jack Sparrow rather than Sean Penn.\n\nA great movie for all pirate lovers out there, and well - any movie lover out there."

        "review_title": "A fun movie with a great performance by Depp",
        "review_detailed_main": "(Note: this review is from 2003.) In its fullest, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Curl\" succeeds as entertainment. It is one of the great adventure films of this year, jam-packed with chills and thrills. It's a rousing swashbuckler with a great cast and a great story. But, ranking in at 143 minutes, it goes overboard on scenes a few times. Just a few.\n\nWhen \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" first opened, my Website was bombarded with desperate letters from frenzied fans of the film, all asking me to post a script for the film. It is perhaps the most requested script I've ever had people write to me about. It's amazing what an impact a film such as this can have.\n\nIt stars Johnny Depp in the lead role as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, the worst pirate the film's Good Bad Guy has ever heard of. \"Ah, but you have heard of me,\" Jack says. Jack used to be the captain of a deadly ship named the Black Pearl, before a mutiny took place at the command of Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Jack for dead on an island where he drank rum for three days and got a permanent case of sea daze.\n\nBut Jack survived, and now with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he will track down Barbosa and claim his ship back. Will is not in it for the ship, however, but rather for the young girl, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa in hopes of removing a curse put upon him and his crew after they removed gold coins from a cursed treasure chest. By the moon of the light, Barbosa and his idiot crew turn into skeletons. They cannot die, they cannot feel pleasure. They are \"cursed pirates.\" First, they must restore all of the golden coins to the treasure chest, then pour the blood of a Turner over the stash of treasure. Captain Barbosa thinks that Elizabeth is the late Bootstrap Bill Turner's daughter, but he never had one -- his single child was a boy, and the boy is Will, who is coming to save Elizabeth from a doom that he himself should be facing more than anyone.\n\nConfused? Don't be. When you watch the movie it will all make sense, because it just does.\n\nThe main element that carries along \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" well past its expiration date is the casting of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow. In a constant drunken stupor and with a splendidly funny rough British accent, Depp has finally hit payday in a mainstream motion picture. He's been cast in cult favorites over the years, specifically those directed by Tim Burton (\"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"Ed Wood\"), but he's been around since \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Platoon.\" He hasn't exactly gotten major recognition over the years, and though movie buffs know him by name, mainstream filmgoers probably wouldn't recognize him at first. Not now, however. Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Depp, at forty, has finally gotten a mainstream break.\n\nAlso helping the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. He's a dastardly villain with bad teeth and, we can only assume, bad breath. He's good at being a bad guy, but because the film is rated PG-13, a big step forward for Disney, he isn't allowed to be quite as vicious as he probably would be. And, I can only assume, the rating prohibits him from taking advantage of poor Elizabeth while she is held captive aboard his ship....\n\nThe movie's score is by Klaus Badelt, who has been getting his big break lately with films such as \"The Recruit.\" It's a good score that fits the film's tone of pirates. Pirates are everywhere in this film, and at one point a character remarks that it's good to be a pirate, or something like that. I just wonder: If that's true, why does Disney prohibit pirating of its films? Har, har.\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" is one of the better entertainments of the year, helped primarily because of a great cast and witty script. But the character that will stay in your head long after this is over, more than any other character in the film (including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, who I have not mentioned before now and I think I should have), is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's going to go down in the books as one of those famous film heroes. And what saves him from becoming another gung-ho hero is what helped Harrison Ford make Indiana Jones so likable: He's an apprehensive and cautious hero with wit and loads of dry humor and funny one-liners to spare. He's not the type of hero who is necessarily always looking out for the best because he wants to save the world, but rather because he knows it's sort of his duty to do so. And he does so with apprehension. It's a key to making a great screen hero, and Johnny Depp succeeds where I can only assume most modern action heroes would fail.\n\nLet's just hope the rumored, upcoming back-to-back sequels don't sink to Davy Jones' Locker, eh?"

While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good. What could have been a great 90 minute blockbuster has been stretched to 2 and a half hours on a plot that cannot manage it.\n\n*1/2 out of ****\n\np.s. It has been hyped up recently. If you have'nt seen it yet, don't."

I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one."

However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible.\n\nThe most surprising factor was how Johnny Depp played his character Jack Sparrow. Normally I am not a Depp fan per say, I enjoy his work but I don't exactly find myself fascinated by it. This role, however, gave me a whole different view of how truly talented Depp is as an actor. Depp took on a whole different role that even varied in the way his character Sparrow carried himself and mastered it like it was nothing.\n\nBloom was also a pleasant surprise. A few minutes into the film in you completely forgot about the elf and focused on the character in front of us. After seeing Bloom in this film I can honestly say that he is not a typecast and will well be on his way to the top. Rush was excellent as usual and portrayed his role as `a captain so evil Hell spat him out' with such humanity you actually felt a bit sorry for the cursed pirate.\n\nAll in all, this film is a rare gem to come from behind the Disney vaults. Along with the superb acting the writing, camera movement, plot, and timing was perfect. Not once did you feel the length of the movie setting in like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' or like watching `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' a third time. Humor, drama, action, and adventure where perfectly balanced out to make this film the movie of the summer."

        "review_detailed_main": "This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.\n\nBut also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.\n\nIn fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.\n\nThe Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago.\n\nThis is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is not just a film; it's a masterclass in adventure storytelling that seamlessly blends humor, action, and mystique. Released in 2003, this cinematic marvel forever altered the landscape of swashbuckling tales, breathing fresh life into a genre often relegated to the fringes of cinema.\n\nAt the heart of this film is the unforgettable character of Captain Jack Sparrow, brought to life by Johnny Depp in an iconic performance that defies the conventional hero archetype.

It combines folklore and fantasy in a way that captivates the imagination, reminding viewers that pirates are not merely thieves, but also vessels of untold stories and secret aspirations. The supernatural element of the cursed crew of the Black Pearl adds an enchanting dose of intrigue, creating a sense of foreboding and wonder that lingers throughout the film.\n\nNot to be overlooked, the breathtaking cinematography and lush production design transport audiences to a world where ocean waves crash against weathered ships, and the golden hues of sunrise reflect off the horizon. The meticulously crafted set pieces, from the eerie allure of cursed treasure to the vibrant marketplace of Port Royal, immerse viewers in a visually stunning experience that feels alive with the salty breeze of the Caribbean.\n\nThe film's delightful humor, paired with sharp dialogue and memorable supporting characters like Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, adds layers that elevate the story beyond mere spectacle. The chemistry among the cast is palpable, grounding the fantastical elements in relatable emotions and human conflicts.\n\nAs the film draws to a close with its thrilling finale, it leaves audiences not only satisfied but also yearning for more adventures on the high seas. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a cinematic treasure, a perfect blend of humor, heart, and high-seas excitement that continues to resonate with generations, proving that true adventure never goes out of style. With its clever storytelling and unforgettable characters, it remains a compelling masterpiece that invites viewers to set sail into a world of wonder and imagination."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just got back from seeing this movie and I was overwhelmed. I wasn't sure what to expect and was terrified that it'd be another Cutthroat Island bomb. One of my favorite things to collect is pirate paraphernalia so I was very heavily anticipating this movie -- making me certain I was setting myself up for disappointment... Thank GOD I was wrong!\n\nJohnny Depp has NEVER impressed me in all these years. I hated him in every show and movie he was ever in (and that included Edward Scissorhands, Platoon and 21 Jump Street) until now. This time he was right on the money. He stole the show and was by far the star over Orlando Bloom and Geoffery Rush. His character was colorful and was a throwback to the swashbuckling of guys like Douglas Fairbanks, Burt Lancaster and Errol Flynn. His costuming was fantastic, but the other characters' attire was great as well. Whoever picked out the outfits for this movie did a great job.\n\nEqually great was the cinematography. It isn't easy to capture much of the scenery the way they did. The shots of the ocean and the islands were beautiful. I was reminded of my trips to Hawai'i and Catalina. Great wideangle shots.\n\nI was also very impressed with the action. The movie never drags despite its long running time of over 2 hours. There are many fencing scenes and I enjoyed every one. Somehow they manage to make the movie very action-oriented without making it turn into a mindless action movie a la Stallone/Schwarzenegger. The movie is safe for the entire family despite its rating. My girlfriend and I took her 9-year-old daughter to see the movie and she loved it as well.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland you'll find many aspects of the ride in the film. The movie literally brought the ride to life with they way they recreated the ride's scenes without being hindered by them.\n\nI highly recommend this movie, despite the bad reviews it seems to be getting in many newspapers. You won't be disappointed. Take the kids."

The characters are the main focus and are all well realised, with solid arcs.\n\nDepp as Captain Jack is easily the main attraction as he entertains in every scene and holds it all together. Most other characters fall into specific categories of hero, antagonist, honest, dishonest, funny, straight, safe or dangerous, whilst Jack has aspects of everything. Geoffrey Rush is also on great form as Barbossa.\n\nVisually it as as strong as you would imagine from a high value Disney production. The action scenes and effects are all top drawer, particularly the fight choreography. I also love the art design of the sets, ships and costuming."

The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes. So if you don't have anything better to do or to watch go see this movie. It will keep you fairly amused during more than two hours."

I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!"

Nice special effects, decent plot, bad characters and couple of decent fight scenes make for a 6 outta 10 in my book."

The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch. It really is that good and The Curse Of The Black Pearl is now one of the my favorite movies. With two possible sequels on the way lets just hope they can be just as good or even better than this one. Go see it you won't be disappointed even with a running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes the movie is fast paced and action packed. With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action."

Man, this was my favorite movie.\n\nWhen the fourth Film was released, I wanted to watch the first one to get rid of the bad taste and the terrible memory of all the other movies. I took her on a weekend time, put myself in the right mood, had a big plate of pancakes on my table and saw, after a long time, the \"Pirates of the Caribbean 1\" again in the atmospheric light with my freshly purchased boxes and the best sound...\n\nAnd Now: The plot is relatively complicated tolled for such a simple pirate adventure, all locations look quite chic so I think it's a shame how much time on the water or on ships spend. The special effects are pretty cool, I like the eerie atmosphere and the actors manage to convey it correctly, making you feel like you're part of it. Even the costumes and make-up contribute to the impression that I do not see actors but I really see these characters. I think Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were born for these roles. I'm sooo happy to see again Disney movie with action and sword fight instead of musical numbers.\n\nBut: This movie was just below my expectations. It was not so exciting, not so cool, not so funny, not so thoughtful and not as creative as I thought or remembered.\n\nAnd to my astonishment, the movie is not nearly as good... as I thought. The movie was still good but, maybe I had lower demands as a kid, maybe the movie is still good but my taste and expectations are now too high, maybe the movie was never good was never that good to begin with and as a kid I tolerated it more or anything else happened so I can say today this movie is just OK."

As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?"

I rate this movie 9/10. The extras on DVD are fantasticE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story."

There are tricks and twists in this story. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining."

I read a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises important issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds of good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing entertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying \"it is a movie\" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I would call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who generally care nothing for \"great art films\"."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey!\n\nThe characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will.\n\nThe few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch.\n\nThis film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive clich\u00e9 of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain."

The actors are excellent in their individual roles and all worked very well together. Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well. Overall, I thought it was an excellently made movie that was fun for all ages."

Johnny Depp's performance is the one thing that makes this movie enjoyable throughout. Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category.\n\nAfterword: Pirates II has come out, and the first hour is abysmal. Depp seems bored, and there's even less of a story than in Crrse of the Black Pearl. Barely worth renting."

This movie was so packed with stereotypes and shallow eye-rolling dialogue that there is little to no room for any creative originality.\n\nIf it were not for the always delightful Johnny Depp, there would be little need for this movie at all. Splice together ten of your favorite Hollywood Frontal Lobotomies in to one big safe happy crapfest, and you'll achieve the same result.\n\nIn short, the movie was entertaining, but not deserving of any special attention."

Even the female, Kiera, was good, though we all could have done without the Will/Elizabeth romance at the end! About the only bad things in the story were the bad pirates and the lack of Will sailing away into the sunset with Sparrow on their ship! These two fine actors deserve a pat on the back and more like about a thousand stars for making their characters likable, enduring, and leaving a taste on your tongue for wanting more!

I am a big fan of Orlando Bloom as an actor and the flair he brings to his action scenes really enhances the character of Will Turner.\n\nI also think that the cgi is quite cool especially with the live skeletons which have aged well through the years.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great movie that can be enjoyed by all. It's a timeless movie that does not diminish in its quality the more you watch it. Highly recommend this!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: \"I was kind of bored\". Me, too.\n\nSpecial effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that \"Dead Man's Chest\" lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects.\n\nAnother gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm \"old\" (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue.\n\nIt's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few (\"Aliens\" for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, \"Dead Man's Chest\" fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not."

I've always been a fan of adventure movies growing up, as well as anything pirate related. So when seeing this adventure-pirate film I loved it. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the captain of his crew. Except their is no crew. One day Jack Sparrow gets captured on an island and imprisoned, when the island gets attacked. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his cursed crew attack the island looking for a precious piece of treasure when they encounter Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and kidnap her. Jack sparrow meets a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who frees him from his prison with a promise from Captain Jack to go and rescue his love Elizabeth Swan. Jack and Will must assemble a crew and track down Barbossa and save Elizabeth. This movie incorperates great storytelling elements with great acting. Johnny Depp does an incredible job playing captain Jack Sparrow, the start of the movie. A great movie for those who love adventure and pirates."

I suppose Hollowood just needs to make more since (as a whole) acting has gone down the turlet.\n\nAll in all it's a decent story, just way too much reliance on SFX.\n\nACTING: All the cast are fine, but Depp carries this film (him and Rush). Without him it would have laid flat.\n\nTEMPO: Fine, but as alluded to above, modern film has too much going on, and should just relax a little.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Excellent and realistic scenery and props. Love the costumes.\n\nDIRECTING / WRITING: Executive crew appeared to do well, but the music sounds nearly identical to the score from the film \"Gladiator.\"\n\nOhhh, that's because it's the same person. Again, contemporary Hollowood's talent pool is (mostly) hollow.\n\nIs it a good film? Yes.\n\nShould you watch this once? Arghh...uably Yes!\n\nRating 7.8."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, what started one of the highest-grossing movies series of all time, and a series that became a huge part of my childhood. In addition, to being wildly enjoyable and a great bit of fun, it also gave us one of the best-known characters to ever bless the silver screen, that is, Jack Sparrow.\n\nDespite considering this as one of the biggest movie influences of my childhood, I believe I've seen each film only once or twice. And if you were to ask me when was the last time I saw any of them, I couldn't tell you. So, fuelled by a desire to see the latest and hopefully last film in this series, and not remembering what has happened previously, I decided to embark on a journey through the seven seas and watch this whole series through.\n\nAnd what a great start to the series The Curse of the Black Pearl was. It's filled with everything you'd want from a fun, fantasy ridden pirate adventure. It's action-packed, guaranteed to make you laugh, and most importantly, it's tremendously entertaining. What surprised me the most, seeing it now with practically fresh eyes, was how tense and even scary it was, at times. People are killed left and right, and surprisingly little is left to the imagination. While I welcomed these traits as an adult, I'm a little surprised by their existence, especially when you consider how young most of the people watching it were, back in the day. However, it is mostly due to these thrilling elements that this film is as enjoyable as it is, even for the older audiences. Instead of having to only rely on action and comedy, the tension and horror elements create an environment that suits the film spectacularly well. It's an environment of moody and dark caves, loud and turmoiled cities, and dank and cursed ships. Combine all that with the contrasting splendour of Port Royale, and the royal fleet, and you'll have a film that beautifully divides pirates and the rest, giving each a surrounding that compliments them.\n\nBut, as we all know, this series wouldn't have been anything without the one factor that doesn't suit either of the aforementioned camps. That is, of course, Jack Sparrow. He essentially becomes the bridge between the two worlds. Using traits from both sides and mercilessly taking advantage of them. He is a man that seemingly looks out only for his own interest, but when push comes to show, he'll forget about his beliefs and do the right thing. Indeed, it is painfully clear that Sparrow was meant as the odd man out. Even his clothing, while very pirate-like, doesn't fit in with any of the other pirates. Nor does it fit in with the law-abiding citizens. But, Sparrow's purpose isn't just being a bridge between two worlds. He is also the much needed comedic relief, the light-hearted drunk who always seems manage to stumble his way through. The performance that Depp gave is one that has become iconic. The way he talks and acts, the mannerisms that he has throughout and the countless quotable lines, created a character that became a staple in most households. If you were to ask me or any of my friends who the most memorable and iconic movie characters from our childhoods were, Jack Sparrow would, without a doubt, be towards the top of that list.\n\nWhile I have spent my time praising The Curse of the Black Pearl thus far, there was one rather significant problem that I noticed. Although it is a fun and entertaining film, for the most part, it was, surprisingly, the action scenes that felt the most redundant. Indeed, the first hour or so flew by. I had to take a quick break at one point, and I could hardly believe that an hour had already passed. Unfortunately, though, that didn't continue forever. Especially towards the end, it seemed to start dragging quite a bit. A lof the scenes started to feel repetitive and stretched out, something that the first half of the film didn't struggle with. Having said that, The Curse of the Black Pearl never feels too long, despite its lengthy run time. And for that, we have to thank, for the most part, the performances and the pure entertainment that this film offers.\n\nWhile I didn't enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as much as I perhaps once did, there is no point in denying how fun it is. It's the perfect example of how to make a film where you can happily turn your brain off for a moment and enjoy some popcorn. Despite being shamelessly stupid at times, it never crosses the line of actually feeling stupid. Instead, it remains funny and fun throughout and provides a tremendous piece of entertainment."

Everything simply works smoothly. This is a great blockbuster film, mostly filmed on location. The CGI is spectacular for the time this was produced. The script is very tightly written with so many iconic one-liners. The plot is very imaginative, there's amazing choreography of action scenes, there is not a dull moment in the entire movie. The cast is so colourful and every character so iconic and memorable. This is the absolute trip through nostalgia lane. Johnny Depp steals the entire show, he is the soul of the franchise and of this movie, his Jack Sparrow is a career defining performance. The soundtrack is so iconic and memorable, they are simply not made like this any more. Everything in this movie works. \"The Curse of The Black Pearl\" is a pop culture milestone.

I was actually riveted, by the funny action and the amazing performance of Depp. Like I said, I'm not a Depp fan and I usually can't stand him in anything but as Jack Sparrow, Depp is totally amazing. Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat. And this film is very LONG!!! Oh well..."

And for kicks let's have Klaus Badelt go ham on the score with Hans Zimmer producing.\n\nThis could've been a throwaway movie, but people cared enough to look at this silly pirate theme park movie and put their mark on it. From the sprawling cast of secondary pirates to the effects involved with the massive ship battle halfway through the movie, this is no Michael Bay schlock, even if it is directed by Jerry Bruckheimer. Also Barbosa is hilarious, the writing and Rush's performance ok that's all byee."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much:\n\n1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained.\n\n2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever (\"Armageddon,\" \"Pearl Harbor\") actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after \"The Ring\" Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films (\"Mouse Hunt\"), horror thrillers (\"The Ring\"), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next.\n\n3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that.\n\n4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today.\n\nIt made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang. All in all a heck of a good time."

        "review_detailed_main": "It's crazy to think that the original \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie is the reason for why the movie industry is the way it is in a lot of ways. If you think about it, this was Disney's first PG-13 film; thus, if \"Pirates\" had flopped, Disney likely wouldn't have continued to make PG-13 movies and, for better or worse, likely wouldn't have acquired more mature properties like Star Wars or Marvel Superheroes.\n\nOf course, this film was a smash hit, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIt's easy to see why Pirates of the Caribbean was so successful. Beyond the obvious reason (Johnny Depp's now iconic performance as Captain Jack Sparrow), this film is incredibly fun, ridiculous, and full of inimitable action sequences.\n\nI would argue, however, that the appeal of this film (and the subsequent two movies in the series) runs deeper than just the surface joys of the zany action and stellar performances. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", at its core, is surprisingly anti-establishment and joyfully liberating. It is ultimately a tale of following your heart, and not letting social norms decide what is right and wrong.\n\nThat is what I think is so captivating about this series as a whole. You can look at it from both a surface level and a deeper level, and both interpretations are correct. It is both a relentlessly fun and exciting action movie, a work of escapist fantasy, while also being deeply liberating and life affirming.\n\nSpecifically related to this first film in the series, I am blown away every time I rewatch it just how solidly made it is: the way they introduce these lovable characters and develop their relationships is so endearing. Even though the story is (kind of) set in the real world, there is still a sense of rich history and politics with all the set pieces and characters. That, plus the fact that many of the character's backstories (especially Jack's) are not overly explained and left largely mysterious, is something that I've rarely seen done better in many other mainstream movies.\n\nOverall, this film is incredible, and I don't think it deserves this reputation as only being a really good action flick. It truly has something for everyone: action, wit, humor, drama, romance, and surprisingly complex ideas. A true landmark masterpiece."

        "review_detailed_main": "Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.\n\nCurse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree).\n\nOne thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqu\u00e9. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies.\n\nThe action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-"

A great movie, in my opinion, is the one that raises important issues and forces you to think about them and generates strong emotions together with superb acting. So, by definition, I tend to like dramas a lot.\n\nI know I can't expect this kind of things in an adventure movie. So, I saw POTC just to have fun and I had a great time. It's a movie which was designed to make a lot of money and entertain the whole family (like Disney's parks), and it did its job perfectly. I can imagine it must be so magical for the kids. Jack Sparrow, brought brilliantly to life by Johnny Depp is so charming and witty. I bet there are children out there arguing at play because everyone wants to be the Captain. Bloom did all right but that's it. I'm kinda romantic guy, so I did like scenes between Orlando and Keira, but I can understand they were very pathetic for some people. She did much better in them, he was basically just staring at her.\n\nThe story is interesting enough, it has golden treasure, curse and pretty good twists, effects are impressive, movie is also very funny. So, if you are looking for some fun, this is the right choice."

It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic \"pirate\" story.\n\nThe film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering \"Jack Sparrow\".\n\nDepp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several \"Best Actor\" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley \"Box Office\" Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet). Actually, it conformed something already a reality among moviegoers - Depp in the cast made a film worth considering, and Depp as the star made a film worth shelling out the bucks to see.\n\n******** The Curse of the Black Pearl (6/28/03) Jerry Bruckheimer : Gore Verbinski ~ Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush"

        "review_detailed_main": "To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last \"rebel\" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By \"rebel\" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of \"250 best movies ever\" here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.\n\nBut hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be \"cursed\" to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.\n\nYes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were for the used language alone !! I love expressions like \" Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker\" and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance.\n\nI can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what \"Leaving Las Vegas\" did to Nick Cage's. Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie? Then his big moment in \"Leaving Las Vegas\", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, \"Bringing Out The Dead\", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses.\n\nNow it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor. Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name) film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name).\n\nI am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course.\n\nFor a movie as over-produced as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder. The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\". The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from \"Clash of The Titans\".\n\nThe humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat. A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say \"Vincent Price\" cheese-ball?\n\nThe dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter. For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in \"Titanic\". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven.\n\nOn screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of \"Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene\", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed.\n\nOn to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)! Thank you very much."

        "review_detailed_main": "The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.\n\nThe other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character.\n\nThe music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets...\n\nThis is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves.\n\nIt completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this."

Let me explain myself...\n\nFirstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.\n\nAnyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great."

When I just think of a what a pirate should be than I look exactly at Jack Sparrow as a perfect example. Johnny as most of you by now already know does an AMAZING job at being Jack Sparrow and there for he is an AMAZING pirate. But not only Jack the whole crew of Barbossa was just a perfect example of what a pirate should be like and what I expect when I ask for pirates. This is just a beautiful example with a little bit of fantasy added onto it.\n\nI truly enjoyed the idea of a curse in the treasure, i always thought of pirates going after gold and treasure without really thinking about what curses could be on these treasures and who those treasures even belonged to, and I am not sure if I am underestimating the year 2003 technology or if I can say this with a full chest but the way the skeletons and i suppose CGI was done, it was really well done.\n\nFor sure a movie to go back to once in a while when you have been missing your childhood and a good recommender for the young kids to remember these movies as classics.\n\nPS: If you got this far, the title was not a lie, I damn love monkeys and this one was best of both worlds , adorable and scary."

        "review_detailed_main": "At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse.\n\nA script containing every ingredient you would look for in a movie of this genre backs up these superb performances. Without ever taking itself too seriously, Pirates of the Caribbean, embraces all of the old pirate clich\u00e9s, to produce a cracking story, exciting action sequences and enough double-crossing buccaneers to provide one of the most entertaining two and a half hours I have sat through. The CGI special effects create amazing fight scenes as Barbossa and his cursed crew exchange their human bodies for that of ghostly skeletons as they are hit by the glow of the moonlight. All praise goes to the special effects team that created these seamless transformations. Not just a fun Summer Blockbuster but also the movie that has resurrected the swashbuckling genre, Pirates of the Caribbean comes highly recommended. Yo-ho-ho, roll on the sequel!!! 9 out of 10."

Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to \"Boot Strap\" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with \"Mouse Hunt\" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film \"Bend It Like Beckham\". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale."

(like me)\n\n6.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film. But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest. Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me.\n\nI am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging. There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here. And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor. Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters."

Wouldn't you run away if you shot some guy in the head and he just shook it off laughing? Clearly nobody in this film caught on. Overall, I was not entertained. It wasn't even so bad it was funny."

Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan."

In fact, there's very little wrong with this fun adventure - the effects are superb (especially fighting in & out of the moonlight) - but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype (everyone I know said it was fantastic, but I see a lot more films than they do).\n\nFirst off, the pacing drags here and there (not really during scenes, but between the set-pieces). The swordfights (and other fighting bits) are inventive, but let down by lacklustre angles and editing.\n\nAnd in the script, they've tried (a bit too hard) to make comedy duos out of two of the royal officers, and two of the pirates, with scenes that would fit right into a Disney cartoon but only serve to hold up the story in this live action film. And while Geoffrey Rush is always great to watch, he just isn't evil enough.\n\nIn fact, I think that's the real fault of the film - it's written as if it were a cartoon. For a comparison, it's not as good as The Goonies.\n\nBut go see it. Johnny Depp = most entertaining performance so far this year."

I had never even seen the trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film and told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and see it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to me. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i finally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone! This film is one of the best epics every made! Watch it...you will not be disappointed!"

I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.\n\nIt all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.\n\nEnter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. \"POTC: TCOTBP\" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus \"Mouse Hunt\" and \"The Ring\" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me..."

It is, rather, a very enjoyable and expertly done piece of fluff and a rather long advert for Disneyland. It's basically a lovingly rendered rehash of all the well-known clich\u00e9s of 80 years of swashbuckler films with a bit of \"Sinbad the Sailor\" thrown in. This is like Ray Harryhausen (all hail!) would have done had he CGI tools at his disposal.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is fine entertainment and it's certainly a far better movie than the recent Star Wars efforts. But it's no masterpiece. It pales in the wake of classic swashbucklers like \"Captain Blood\" (Errol Flynn) or \"Treasure Island\" (the one with Jackie Cooper and the Disney one with Robert Newton), or even the recent \"Master and Commander\".\n\nLet's put POTC in the \"fantasy\" category. Within that context I would rate it much higher than within this TOP 250 FILMS category. It is a great fantasy film.\n\nAs a \"spoof\" it's not in the same class as \"Blazing Saddles\" or \"Young Frankenstein\" or \"Love and Death\", but it's very close and a job well done.\n\nGood film. Rent it."

It was cool to see the people turn into skeletons when they passed in and out of the moon light, but when you had a chance to really look at them it was sort of cheesy.\n\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that Disney couldn't decide whether this advertisement for one of their rides (marketing brilliance by the way, no matter how disgusting it is) should be for kids or adults. In the end, it didn't fit for anyone. It was too violent for little kids with scenes of people getting killed with swords and their throats slit by daggers. It was WAY too hokey for adults.\n\nMaybe it works for 13-year-olds that haven't seen the special effects in the Matrix or Lord of the Rings.\n\nMy advice, don't get your hopes up based on what the majority is saying about this one."

A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie."

The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.\n\nJohnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.\n\nHis British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.\n\nNaturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.\n\nAs for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.\n\nIf there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed."

Although the movie is a little bit long, nobody can get bored while watching it. What I liked most -and I think most people liked- is Johnny Depp's performance. He was GREAT, he perfectly played the role of Jack Sparrow and whenever he appeared, he was \"breaking\" the \"gravity\" that prevailed in the movie and turned everything more pleasant and funny, by reminding us that he's a really great actor, something he has already proved many times so far.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were also very good and proved that they are two talented actors. However, they are still quite young and I personally think that their performances seemed rather indifferent, comparing to Geoffrey Rush's and Johnny Depp's.\n\nTo sum up: I found this a great movie and anyone who hasn't watched it yet, he should definitely buy the DVD!\n\nFinally: Many people say it's a good movie, while others disagree. However, there is one point that nobody can doubt: Even if you are not a fan of such movies, it's worth watching just for Johnny Depp!"

Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing \"Yo ho, ho ho\" for days and days to come.

Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie. Seriously, if they picked anyone else for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, then I would not like this movie, and no one else would like it. Everyone I know believes so, and no one yet has stepped up and said something about changing the actor for Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nThe writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's. The way he looked and talked just freaked the hell out of me and I just wanted to scream my lungs out.\n\nThe special effects in this movie also got me too, the way the Skeletons look when the moon rises really got me. The special effects people did an amazing job at that, as well as the Make-Up people. Putting Make-Up on Johnny must of been tiring for both him and the people, as his role had a lot to do with that. I for one would not like it at all, I can't even handle 2 days of it.\n\n10/10, most people would agree that this movie is very stunning, and well done. The actors play their roles as if they themselves are that person, and all the other people who made this film possible, I bow down to your success pf getting into half of the worlds hearts."

And surprised that it's even done by Disney. Cause it's not the common Family Friendly movie you'd find from Disney.\n\nThe movie of course takes place in the Caribbean and during the 16th or 17th Century era. Which is when pirates ruled the 7 seas. A ship was sailing across the Atlantic which came across a wreckage of another ship. With only one passenger who is a young boy named Will Turner. Who had a gold medallion in his position. A girl named Elizabeth noticed the medallion to be pirate related so she took it and hid it from the ship's crew so that way they wouldn't think that Will is a pirate.\n\n8 years later Elizabeth is more grown up and Will is a blacksmith who makes and repairs swords for the army of the seaport town of Cape Royal. Life was very calm and peaceful till Jack Sparrow came ashore of Cape Royal. He is not your average pirate and he's very well known throughout the Caribbean. And there's a lot more to his back story than there seem to be.\n\nThe medallion that Elizabeth holds is the key to breaking the curse of the pirates of the black pearl.\n\nI gotta admit i did like it quite a bit. I just wish I knew it was going to be a must see movie. It had action, great special effects, plenty of humor in some parts, and great characters to know while watching the movie.\n\nIt's also unlike the common pirate movies you'd see anywhere else.

The character showcases his versatility in one of the most refreshing characters I have seen in a long time. And newcomer Keira Knightly shines onscreen in her role as Elizabeth. It seems as if Orlando Bloom was may have been left in the dust in this film by his dashing costars. His acting was rather one dimensional, and suspiciously similar to his character of Legolas in \"The Lord of the Rings\". But who's paying attention to his acting, anyways? Overall, this pirate movie is non stop laughs, action and adventure. Savvy?\n\nRating: B"

If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp."

Also, there are many lines which detract from the adventure and make it almost as much a comedy. That's fine if done in moderation (in my opinion), but this is done to excess and makes the movie appear more as a kid's adventure flick than an attempt at making a story.\n\nThis movie is only worth watching to see Depp's performance. Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a \"made for TV movie.\" It could be the directing, but then how would one explain the same directing that Depp received?\n\nThe mechanical special effects were ok (6/10), while the rest: production, lighting, photography were excellent(9/10) and the computer graphics were superb (10/10). They brought something new to computer graphics - well articulated skeletons as well as the immediate switching between body and bones in different light. Overall, in my opinion, the movie earned a 7/10.\n\n-Zafoid\n\nPS: A slight node to political correctness occurs in a few scenes thus downgrading the already flawed movie. Definitely see it for Depp.\n\n-Z"

Very different role to the voice over of Nigel the Pelican.\n\nIf you like him 4) Orlando Bloom... not good reason. He's pretty. Can't say much else about him though. He was better in Lord of the Rings. He's better being silent, elf-like and graceful.\n\n5) Keira Knightley... *shudders*... is better off playing people like Jules in Bend It Like Beckham: half friendly and half bitchy. Bizarre face: she's got a dazzling smile but a really pinched disgusted look the rest of the time. Not the best choice foe Elizabeth Swann.\n\n6) Johnny Depp again.\n\n7) It's fun. Really.

And if all i told you about this movie is that it was produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer, then you would automatically know it is something worth watching. From The Amazing Race, to CSI, Jerry Bruckhiemer produces everything worth watching. And don't get me started on the flawlessly beautifully talented Keira Knightly.

And..If he was affected by the curse, he would be immortal. So...How did launching him off a cannon into the ocean kill him? I guess that's why there's a \"Pirates of the Caribbean 2\"...

One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film.

Despite being so outlandish, Depp's pirate is clever, creative and believable ... except that he doesn't seem like he'd ever be able to back down a crew of pirates; to wit, his crew abandoned him on a desert island. That he could come back over and and over would create respect in many and, sometimes, those who seem craziest are most feared, so perhaps he could do it.\n\nVerbinski knows what he's doing but I wish so much of the movie hadn't rested on Depp's shoulders. That being said, it still works beautifully and Depp's acting is spot on. I guess it comes down to this: When you're watching the movie it can be totally absorbing and any criticisms spring to mind only when the lights are up and I've moved on to other things. I've seen the movie several times and get sucked in every time. If I were to judge a movie only by my thoughts after it's over, that wouldn't be fair. I believe you have to judge a movie mostly by what's on your mind during it and give much less criticism after wards. The movie IS the moment, not the trip home."

        "review_detailed_main": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre.\n\nWith this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons.\n\nFirst of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either.\n\nOne thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it.\n\nIf that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not.\n\nAfter having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people.\n\nAnyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10."

It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the \"damsel in distress\" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only \"cardboard\" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of."

This could have all the charm of a film based on a video game like such classics as \"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Street Fighter.\"\n\nNow to be fair I haven't seen either of those nor ever will, but neither had Johnny Depp at the helm. Much has been made about his swishbuckling here, but I dare anyone to see this and not keep his/her eye on the Sparrow. In the commentary, he and director Gore Verbinski talked about some of Depp's original ideas for the character...including a prosthetic nose. Hmmm, maybe that's where the Keith Richards' idea originated? To see the best use of a faux nose so far, see Vincent D'Onofrio in the excellent \"Salton Sea.\"\n\nBut back to these high seas, high crime and high entertainment. Look the ride itself had to be made suitably accommodating to put a lot of different butts in seats, and so was this film. But think of all the other action/adventure blockbusters that simply went bust.\n\nI recently saw \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" which despite Alan Moore's impetus wound up extremely ordinary. And we had to elect Schwarzenegger as governor just to prevent him from making any more films after \"The Rise of the Machines.\"\n\nSo for the people who complain about the plot, to make such a popcorn movie, you have to traffic in larger-than-life myths that *need* to be familiar. Lover's need to be separated, one must promise her love to another to redeem her true love. Toss in an absent father (Bootstrap is about as dead as Luke Skywalker's dad was.) Allow there to be a chase and make sure the original chase is after the wrong goal or gal or gal's blood...and your on your way.\n\nSo the key here, like the ride itself is not in revolutionary twists along the way but an attention to detail as we are moved along. The pirates' code and parley, splendid spectral special effects, the tie-ins to scenes from the ride. Little bits of the dialog...\"Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt\"...\"Welcome to the Caribbean, love\"...\"Impersonating a cleric of the Church of England...\"I want you to know that I was rooting for you mate\"...\"Cotton, he says you missed a spot.\" (As spoken by a mute man's parrot and translated by the first mate.)\n\nThis film is more than clever enough, and looks gorgeous, even on the small screen...though I and you imagined reader should have seen this on the big screen. The use of CGI was less \"siege\" and more \"see.\" Verbinski largely forsook his first name and avoided egregious amounts of gore.\n\nYes it's as inflated as a Macy's Parade balloon, but its the smaller things that keep this afloat. I'll give it one stars for each of the seas, and hope we don't get half as many sequels...\n\n7/10\n\nBy the way, the DVD I got from NetFlix was only IBM PC compatible for the bonus features. Not only Captain Barbossa is a fan of Apples, raise the flag for a MacIntosh Mutiny!"

The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal.\n\nJohnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick.\n\nA very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!"

All of the performances are very good, and it adds immeasurably to the quality of the film. The production is also very well done, right up to the great visual effects. However, one let down was the music, which features a pounding quality heard in many Bruckheimer action films.\n\nThe characters are brought to life with the skill of the \"Indiana Jones\" or \"Harry Potter\" movies, yet somehow the overall film seems to be just a few notches of \"The Mummy\" and \"Tomb Raider\" movies. Unlike the latter movies, however, it seems a sequel or two could really help lift \"Pirates\" out of that same category and into the heights reached by \"Indiana Jones\".\n\nThe verdict: about as good of a summer blockbuster as could be hoped for."

Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great. Great visuals, a nice interesting story, good performances, good make up, but it is still and will be another blockbuster film. 7.56/100"

Both movies give you that good feeling and have that quality where you never get sick of watching it and hearing the lines over and over. This is a film that everyone should see a couple of times, just to enjoy the pure fun it has to offer. The great film was a surprise to me, since I knew it was based off of a Disney ride and I thought it was going to be a film for kids, but it is definitely something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Captain Jack Sparrow is the pathetic yet savvy and smooth pirate that you can't help rooting for. Orlando Bloom is the one actor I don't particularly care for in any movie, but he doesn't bother me in this one. Geoffry Rush is cast perfectly and the special effects are nice. If you haven't seen this great film yet, go out and rent it or buy the DVD which is loaded with extras that will keep you happy."

After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these films\n\nThe production team seem to have taken a leaf out of the Peter Jackson book of film making by casting hunks as heroes with Shakespearian trained actors in the supporting roles . The cast are very good . Johhny Depp was atrocious as an English police inspector in FROM HELL but here as Jack Sparrow his camp English accent is entirely in keeping with the tone of the film . It also makes good business sense too , just think of the amount of 20 something woman who'll go to watch Depp play a swashbuckling rogue . Same with Orlando Bloom who's incredibly popular with a teenage girl audience . Keira Knightley ? Yeah she's really fit but like these other much hyped English Roses such as Julia Ormand in LEGENDS OF THE FALL and Kate Winslett in TITANIC I doubt if she'll be a household name many years from now , she is good as the ballsy heroine in this though . The always under rated Jonathon Pryce is slightly disappointing probably because like so many great stage actors he's not very good with camp humour . By an ironic contrast Geoffry Rush gives the best performance as the villain , a performance that may see him get an Oscar nod as best supporting actor\n\nThere does seem to be a lot of debate as to how well this film will do at the Oscars . I very much doubt if it'll be up for best picture or director ( It is a fantasy film and this genre is always over looked by the academy ) but it does deserve a handful of technical award nominations in the fields of cinematography , editing , sound , costume design and special effects . Unfortunately it's going to be up against RETURN OF THE KING and MASTER AND COMMANDER which means a probable empty treasure chest for these pirates which is a pity\n\n***** SPOILERS *****\n\nNo review of mine is complete without a few grumpy complaints so here they are : Once again the Brits are shown to be stupid and incompetent but that's Hollywood for you , while there's a serious plot hole at the end where it's revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?\n\nBut no matter I liked this movie and I thought I'd I never say this but I hope to see the words \" Produced by Jerry Brukheimer \" a lot more in the future\n\nUpdate - Sorrymy mistake . Jack wasn't suffering from the curse all along . Thanks to the forty or so people who wrote to me pointing this out"

The CGI effects were truly amazing, as they were able to characterize the skeletons to the characters, which made it easy to keep track of them.\n\nPirates, well put together, is not just a family-fun movie or a chick-flick, but rather something that just about anyone can enjoy: action for men, romance for women, and humor all around.\n\nShorlty: humorous and captivating, this is a must-see.

The part that was my favorite was when Elizabeth Swan was trying to hide from two pirates and soon hides in a closet, and they find her and she demands parlay. Pirates of the Caribbean does move somewhat slow and is a bit over two hours. But it is worth the time watching, and when i went to the movies to see it I knew I wouldn't be wasting money on a ticket. I would call this a family movie, so watch this while you relax with your familey."

My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it. If you haven`t seen this movie, the fact that it is a Disney movie should not discourage you, and the fact that it has pirates in it, well, in all fairness it is one of the best pirate movies I have seen, well worth a try, you won`t be disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "FIRST IMPRESSION\n\nI dont know about you, but I've been on Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride probably a dozen times. Its a classic, and in some ways the new blockbuster hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one as well.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBasically, Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a cunning and smooth-talking pirate who seems like he might have spent a little too much time at sea. After the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by an odd gang of pirates, who have been sailing on the mythical Black Pearl, it is up to Jack and a courageous blacksmith to not only save the kidnapped girl but also prevent the crew of the Black Pearl from destroying the curse that plagues them.\n\nACTING: 93%\n\nTruthfully, I wasnt a big fan of Johnny Depp.......until now. He is terrific in this movie. His smooth, humorous words and his somewhat drunken stature make his original pirate character into a full scale movie of its own. In some respects, I dare say, he made this film. But, all the other actors, including Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, are top notch and worthy of praise. Still, its Johnny Depp who lights up the screen, and everytime he enters a scene, the movie is somewhat enhanced and ultimately more enjoyable. All in all, great acting all around.\n\nSTORY: 75%\n\nModerately good story. I mean its nothing epic or rather new, but its decent for an action movie. Usually in a standard action flick, the plots follow a set pattern. The bad guys steal something, and the good guys set off to take it back. \"Pirates\" follows the same premise. One thing I didnt like about the story, and this is a big chunk of the story actually, was why did Jack and Will Turner want to stop the pirates of the Black Pearl from breaking their curse? I mean, once the curse is broken, they become mortal men. So, the danger of walking skeletons with the intent to kill would be over. And it wasnt like they were going to kill Will Turner over the coins; they just needed his blood. They knew and the audience knew that a simple cut would have sufficed. Decent story, with that one big fault in the story.\n\nDIRECTION: 85%\n\nWhen a high scale action blockbuster comes out, you know its probably a Michael Bay film or a Jerry Bruckheimer film. In this case, its a Bruckheimer film, and he doesnt disappoint. The shots of the battling ships floating around in the fog and the smoothness of the transition of the pirates to skeleton are all perfect. The shots of the beaches and palm trees also bring out a certain feeling of being stranded on a deserted island, with nothing to do but fish.\n\nFUN FACTOR: 85%\n\nOne of the things that plagued this film slightly is its length. At 133 minutes, the sword fighting got a little boring towards the end. But, nonetheless, the rest of the movie, especially the beginning is totally engrossing and I would have to say \"Pirates\" is one of the more entertaining movies of the year.\n\nFINAL IMPRESSION ---84%\n\nWith its exciting action sequences, the humor of Johnny Depp, and the excellent shots of the town and ships at sea, Pirates of the Caribbean is one movie definetly worth your time in the theater. Oh, and did I mention Johnny Depp?"

        "review_title": "2003: From LOTR to POTC...",
        "review_detailed_main": "The history of blockbusters fantasy epic movie franchises is just a series of new beginnings and so the glorious year 2003 was marked by the conclusion of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and the beginning of another, Gore Verbinski \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", the common denominator was Orlando Bloom who had the classical profile of the Hollywood young actor, but he wasn't the star. It was Johnny Depp.\n\nNow, when modern movies for the whole Hollywood old-fashioned way, their success then depend on various factors but having the right cast always means that half the job is done. And from that starting point, since the film is no serious melodrama, it can get away with two good castings: the hero and the villain (obviously). And allow me to state that as a mathematical certainty, for a good portion, the film is as good as Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are... I'll cover the remaining portion after.\n\nAs Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp surely delivers a performance that is not great because it's spectacular but because it's not; he plays a pirate who doesn't need to show it off, to chew the script as if he meant to make that clear for a 7-year-old M&Ms cruncher (not the film's target anyway). And so the more you underestimate him, the better.. I like that subdued approach and I guess Depp has such a predisposition to tone it down when it comes to over-the-top characters, it ends up bringing the right balance. It's precisely because he was good at Sparrow that maybe Depp's cheerful energy ran out of battery and gave that disastrous Willy Wonka.\n\nTo the villain now. I feared it would be the predictable rival in the dashing but boring Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), you know the clean-cut straitlaced no-nonsense officer who already acts like the chosen fianc\u00e9 of governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and is so confident he even treats the high-ranked father (Jonathan Pryce) like a lackey.... He gets along with the role but in the film, he's a cardboard character and nothing new after \"Titanic\" (maybe he'll get two additional dimensions in the sequels). No, the real villain is Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, the former mutineer who stole -with the Black Pearl- a treasure full of gold coins, they belonged to Cortes and struck the Black Pearl with a curse, turning the crew into skeletons, ghouls and monsters at moonlight. Naturally, I was more interested in daylight Rush.\n\nRush is over the top, going all \"aaargh\" in his role and it's again the right tone, in the way it completes Depp, Rush not only made me believe he could be a pirate, even with his borderline cartoonish attitude, but he made me believe he could be a rival and former ally to Sparrow Once you believe in that, the film works. It's obvious that the other pirates are secondary and their main purpose is to show their ugly yellow teeth, their rude and crass manners, one running gag involve one with a glass eye that keeps popping out and makes a weird rubber-sound, there's no hook or pegleg but there's Kevin R. McNally as Joshamee Gibbs and Zoe Seldana who save the day by being a little more than a 'colorful' presence... the parrot comes in close third\n\nI should mention Keira Knightley who's never disappointed me but here seems to have picked the wrong angle, she plays her part as if she was in \"The Duchess\" or \"Pride and Prejudice\", she's good in the sense that she gives a good performance but she doesn't feel like the Marian for Robin Hood, maybe the film didn't bring these romantic vibes we could sense between her and Will Turner (Bloom) and assumed we'd take it for granted... because both are young and beautiful. So many things in fact happen in the film that it didn't need to be sidetracked by a romance.\n\nThe real problem with the film is that it's based on a Disneyland ride and it's just too long and I'm not saying \"long\" because there were boring parts but I'm among those who have an inner resistance to fantasy and I don't understand why they needed to rely on supernatural elements. In a universe where anything is possible, the swashbuckling effect loses its appeal and the stakes are diminished, especially when the notions of lives and deaths are being toyed with... it all comes down to pirates being fearless not because they are trained that way but because they are immortal. If the film follow the pirates tropes to the bone but ultimately it's a fantasy story.\n\nIt's still effective as an action picture with some great shots, spectacular stunts that don't rely much on CGI, and little performances so good they didn't have be drowned in an overlong film. Anyway roughly two decades ago, \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" was the bless of Johnny Depp's career before he'd be cursed by his black amber... it took me as many decades to decide myself to watch the first film, I'm not in a rush to watch the sequels...\n\n... and here concludes my 1900th review."

        "review_detailed_main": "I must admit, this movie was pretty good. But, the ending was cheesy. As Stephen King once said, \"You can have a really good storyline, but it isn't as good as it could be because of the ending. After all, it's the ending that matters most in a story. Without something special to wrap it up, the story is worthless.\" With Pirates of the Caribbean, the storyboard directors should have been more choosy about what makes it in the movie. The ending of Pirates of the Caribbean makes it seem like the entire plot is a whole big love story, even though romance was shown very little throughout the film. Though, the hanging scene was good, the \"As is mine\" part wasn't necessary. Jack could've just thanked will and went on his way. And After Elizabeth's dream and before Johnny comes in, it was rather boring. I mean who CARES about Will and Elizabeth. It's setting up for a romance movie, when the movie should make the audience focus on the cursed pirates and Captain Jack, which is after all the focus of the movie. They could've just shown the part where Elizabeth puts on the necklace, then opens the window showing Port Royal. Then, the next part could be when Jack comes in on the boat. It would have kept the pirate theme alive, while still showing the movie from Elizabeth's point of view. There was a lot of action in this movie, so it should have ended shortly after a part with a lot of action. After the pirates become cursed no longer, they could've had Jack become captain, once again, and end the movie there. It would have made the people leaving the theater, thinking thet just came back from a really good pirate movie. Instead, they just remember the final part, so they leave thinking, \"That had a really good love story in it.\" COMPLETELY forgetting about Will and Captain Jack's huge sword fight and the climax of the 3rd act. The movie was overall good, but I would've tweaked it a bit to make it perfect."

        "review_detailed_main": "To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night! Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering. Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.\n\nThis film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me. There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late. The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.\n\nI can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just \"the girl\" in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief. Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie. His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat. Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.\n\nSo...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches. Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one."

Totally first class acting from the man as the irresistible Captain Jack Sparrow, loosely based on Keith Richards.\n\nSparrow swaggers and burbles his rum-soaked self across the Caribbean on a quest to reclaim his beloved ship the Black Pearl from his mutinous first mate Barbossa and involves young Will Turner (Orlando B) who's trying to win over Elizabeth Swan (Keira K). So follows the most exciting and funny adventure on the seven seas with some really great quotes.\n\nIf you haven't seen this already I'm shocked and suggest you go out and buy it now (you'll want it in hard copy, trust me.) Potc2:Dead Man's Chest London release is 7th July 2006 and they are in the process of filming Potc3. Long live Captain Jack Sparrow."

POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised."

I also did not like the cheesy ending.\n\nOn the other hand, the hottie factor was definitely high between Orlando and Johnny. Though they both played their roles well, I think the award for best acting in this movie should go to Geoffrey Rush. He was great.\n\nI admit the film had plenty of laughs and some of the one-on-one fight scenes were interesting.

All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with. At best, this film is a good way to spend a couple of hours where the alternative is banging your head against the wall."

I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and Orlando Bloom is so handsome, but Johnny is the true star in this movie you just have to see. I will recommend the commentaries on the movie, some of them are really entertaining. So see it again and again and again."

Johnny Depp, wow, what a performance; when Depp is on screen you can't take your eyes off of him, so into his character of the Pirate with a heart, and teeth, of gold. Splendid cast, story and action, and the heroine gets to do more than swoon in this adventure. Orlando Bloom is a hottie and a terrific hero.

        "review_detailed_main": "Blockbusters are a real hit or miss for me. Sometimes they're so filled with clich\u00e9s and bland characters I can't stand them, other times they surprise me with their level of quality. One example of the latter would be this movie, which I think is way better than it's given credit for, and there's multiple reasons for that. First of all is the immersion. The set, costume and sound design are all amazing and make it easy to pretend you really are in 18th century caribbean. The editing and cinematography are also both really good, and the score is practically perfect. The plot is engaging, the pacing is great and the worldbuilding is very well done. The characters are also good, Will and Elizabeth both have their struggles and weaknesses while also being pretty likeable. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both play their roles exceptionally well. However, the movie's biggest stars are Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, each giving the best performance in their career, as Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa. While Sparrow is goofy, entertaining and a very likeable anti-hero, Barbossa is vicious and threatening, whole also having legitimate reason for his actions and understandable motivations. Every time one of them is on screen, it's a joy to watch. They both serve as important characters for the story while also being one-liner machines. This movie also has great continuity and lets no arc stay unfinished. This is a movie which has just grown on me as the years have passed, it's one of my all-time favorite movies and I have no problems giving it the highest rating I can."

I have absolutely no idea how this pirate movie manages to enter the IMDb's Top 250 Movie List, but I guess most of you viewers love The Curse of the Black Pearl for some good reasons. However, I don't find it entirely revolutionizing in any sense.\n\nFirst of all, the plot's simply too straightforward in my taste (the script is pretty cheesy and tiring as well) and like any typical Hollywood movies, expect lots of the same old swashbuckling stuff and highlighted special effects without being mesmerized by its overall b-movie context. Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK.\n\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now. If you want a quality pirate (or ship) movie, I highly recommend you to watch 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' instead. It's far better than this dire action movie, for my sake."

        "review_detailed_main": "The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie.\n\nSo what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time.\n\nPart of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous.\n\nI have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little \"arr!\" here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar.\n\nAnd finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture.\n\nJack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: \"Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.\" and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!"

The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10"

There is also a thing called the Pirates code that the Pirates will never break, however Captain Barbossa always finds loopholes in the code. I could never get tired of watching this movie"

Although I have to admit that I have a big soft spot for Pirates.\n\nThe movie isn't anything special but that shouldn't take away from it.\n\nI thought the cast where fine but not the best part for the movie. Jack Sparrow was obviously the best character in the movie and I thought he was introduced well. Throughout the entire movie 'Captain' Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was good and fun to watch. He was nothing amazing as some people claim he is in this flick, but he is well done and a fine character that is pretty enjoyable at times. It has to be said however I haven't seen the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies as of yet so maybe his character improves. As of now he is a enjoyable character with a few good scenes and quips to make you smile. The rest of the cast where fine but nothing special so I won't bother mentioning them in detail. Basically they're mediocre (maybe slightly less).\n\nThe story was fine but nothing spectacular. Although I did like how the curse worked and how it changed the crew of the Black Pearl. Obviously I'm not mentioning spoilers.\n\nThe action was not great, but It was fine. Nothing amazing or even great but enough to make it's point. There was alot of scenes that include \"Action\", but I don't believe they where very good. So it's not a lack of action, just nothing special when it came to coreograthy. The action is pretty mediocre but it's more about the characters (Jack Sparrow) than an action-packed adventure.\n\nCast - 6/10\n\nStory - 6.5/10\n\nAction - 3.5/10\n\nJohnny Depp - 7.5/10\n\nOverall a fine watch but nothing truly spectacular. With action that wasn't amazing but prevalent but a story and lead character that I enjoy in parts.\n\nMaybe try this one out - 6/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "I hate Disney movies, Jerry Bruckheimer, and summer blockbusters. But the reviews of Johnny Depp in the film got my butt to the theatre, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nOccasionally, the movie gets into predictable ruts that are annoying, but most of the time the action is fast paced, the one-liners are zingy, and the acting is top notch.\n\nThe film is full of cliches, especially Love Conquers All, but for once they work.\n\nThis film almost ranks with Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman -- it would be up there but for the emphasis on some bit part actors for comic relief that dragged the pace down.\n\nThe score, as for all Jerry movies, is overly frenetic, but it steers clear of bombastic.\n\nDepp is certainly the highlight -- don't be surprised if you feel an urge to rent a bunch of Depp movies after this. Be sure to see Chocolat if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nBut Bloom is not quite as lame as some have painted. He does what he can with a fairly drab romantic leading man role, and I'm sure all the 12-year-old girls in the theatre were enjoying his big brown eyes as he gazed yearningly at Keira Knightley [who puts in a perky perfomance]. Here's hoping Orlando gets a role where he doesn't have to wear funny clothes and carry a sword!"

When Miss Swann is captured by the evil Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew of treacherous pirates who plan to use Elizabeth and her necklace to lift their curse, Will seeks out Jack and the mismatched pair go after Elizabeth, the Black Pearl (Barbossa's ship), adventure and revenge together. This movie is a great movie with fun for all the family. Johnny Depp really brings the film to life with his fantastic humour and great acting. Everything fits and the special affects are great. Watch it if you enjoy action movies with humour such as the Mummy Returns."

I just love the light-hearted, humorous and adventurous context which stands in total contrast to the sequels which are darker and more epic.\n\nThe humour in Pirates is brilliant - snarky, sarcastic and the running gags are also working very well. I especially adore Barbossa's monkey Jack (who will get more action in the third part!) But - as everyone else must admit - the real highlight of the whole trilogy is our dear Captain Jack Sparrow - played most brilliantly by Johnny Depp. I can't even say how much I love the character he created! His way to walk, to talk, to drink and to manipulate everyone else without them having the slightest clue as to what really are his motives has completely blown me away. Johnny Depp sure gave the performance of his life with this role and I'm still so very, very mad at the fact that he didn't get an Oscar for this achievement. Sure, Sean Penn is also a great actor, but the fact still remains, that without Johnny Depp we would have never gotten to know our beloved Captain Jack. No one else would have played him like this and he really created something on his own, instead of simply reading the script and doing it in the straightest way possible. And that's why he should have gotten an Oscar! - But hey, there's still hope for the third part!"

But the son (Will Turner) looks older than him ! Unbelievable ! And more : this kid-pirate is supposed to have been the great chief of the worst pirates of Caribbean, twelve or twenty years before ! Sorry, I can't swallow that !\n\nIt's clear : Johnny Depp is really too young for this part ! I know, it's a sex symbol. But what for ? He's not the one who got the girl at the end ! I think a more mature man (like \"Jack Nicholson\" for example) would be a better choice.\n\nAnd what about his make-up ? He looks like a \"transvestite\", he just missed the lipstick. That's a bad choice, again.\n\nTo fight all these bad choices, this poor Johnny overacts loudly to gain credibility. But in vain !\n\nSo, for those who can forgets an enormous casting mistake, the movie is pretty good. For those who thinks that a casting mistake can sink a movie, avoid this one."

The bottom line: Sparrow has a heart and cares about doing the right thing while Barbosa is one evil son of a b*** who'd sell his own mother if it would make him a profit.\n\nOh, and the true star of this movie, of course: The Pirates! I felt so sorry for them in the end. But looking at the sequel currently in production and seeing the names of supporting cast, perhaps I have nothing to worry about."

And I bet I'll love it the next time I watch it. It's a fantastic movie. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie. Did I mention I loved every minute of it?\n\nThis one has everything: good and entertaining story, well written script, fine direction, good acting (excellent acting in the case of J. Depp), great costumes and locations, nice looking effects, humor, cool characters, swordfights, ghosts, romance, great villains. WOW!! In short, this movie is awesome. And besides, pirates are cool!\n\nThe best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow). Depp delivers an outstanding performance, effectively shadowing everyone else, as the goofy, somewhat crazy pirate captain, proving once again he is a great actor.\n\nIf you expect deep ideas and dealing with important issues you won't find it here, but if you just want to be entertained and have a whole lotta fun I strongly recommend Pirates of the Carribean. I give it 9 out of 10 simply because of the fact that it provides 2 hours of great fun no matter how many times you've seen it."

His wit was great and the one-liners were completely memorable.\n\nOrlando Bloom made excellent eye-candy, and Keira Knightley was as gorgeous as ever and played an excellent role. Geoffry Rush played his role with as much ease as Depp and really did the whole bad-guy thing well!\n\nThe action was fantastic- the fantasy side was enjoyable. The jokes were great, and the special effects were also A+. I could watch this over and over again, and still get the same great feeling from it.

This is the role that people will remember him for.He improvises the character to wonderful effect and is joined by fun performances from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Gore Verbinski has proved himself to be adept in the big league and even though the sequels clearly lacked inspiration,the best of his talents are on show here as he allows his Depp to work his magic.The following films have somewhat tarnished the look of this film by being overlong and largely boring but as a standalone pirate adventure film, look no further than this."

OK, so I went to the movie theater with my pals, expecting to see a big waste of money, but, you know what? You can imagine, I LOVED IT! yes, I found it really amusing, but not banal, you know, everything was perfectly synchronized to work, to make laugh, even to scare. I have to say that Mr. Johnny Depp's performance is OUT OF THIS WORLD, fantastic, I'm not saying that his previous films were not superior, actually, some of them are; but I rediscovered Mr. Depp with this film, he is really a comedic actor. I can even suggest the Academy a well deserved award for him. Or for Mr. Geoffrey Rush. AMAZING! he is another great actor who doesn't take himself so seriously, giving his character a special dose of sarcasm and fun. Then, the lead couple, Orlando Bloom & Kyra Knightley (hope I wrote it right), they just do their job, I'm not saying they're bad, but their characters are not really as appealing as Depp's and Rush's roles are. But I must say She is gorgeous. Then, the delirious crew of the Black Pearl, they are simply funny! What else, oh yeah, the art direction, the costume design, the special effects, the makeup; those characteristics that can even be more important than the story of acting (Terminator 3?), but in this movie, they just combine perfectly to deliver an excellent product."

The plot was good at the beginning, but I got less interested when they started talking about the supernatural curse and the black pearl. I wasn't really a fan of the action scenes as I didn't think the sword fight scenes were thrilling, but I did like the action scene at the start when the pirates attacked the port. One positive thing about the movie is that I thought Johnny Depp portrayed his character quiet well. Overall it was the fantasy and supernatural aspect of the movie that was the main reason I didn't like it."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****"

With a slightly more capable director and screenwriters which could change the script and made it in a love story with Jack & Elizabeth (heh, like in Beauty & Beast), this movie will certainly gain some points with more demanding viewers and become a classic romance movie. Too bad, since the sound part is also great.\n\nSince it's not a classic, but somewhat between, only (but still good)\n\n7 out of 10."

One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the \"salty\" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???"

Keira Knightley fails to fill out her dress, but that's okay because she's cute too. Geoffrey Rush plays another retired rock star, and between him and Depp the movie is nearly watchable.\n\nI stayed awake through this movie the first time. The second time, not so much. The third time, I'm not sure. I intentionally turned it on a fourth time while I was on a trans-Atlantic flight and needed to sleep. The plot is kind of unintelligible, with characters escaping and getting captured and being held in prisons and escaping again every five minutes or so, and no one ever bothers to clear up which ship they're on at any given moment. It's a little too lead-footed to really be swashbuckling.\n\nBut anyway, it's got Johnny Depp. He's cool, right? He does stuff in this movie, so that must mean something. I'm not sure what, though."

I kinda regret not having seen it on the big screen. I will surely be seeing the next TWO, which are in production at this time.\n\nDuring one scene, he takes a swing at seducing a woman. Having enjoyed watching Depp in a romantic role, I was surprised at how smarmy he came off as when he was making his moves. Even though he is an attractive man, he managed to make himself seem, unappealing? Is that even possible? But it was fitting for his character, which is a testament to his talent, as usual.\n\nThe plot was interesting, they squoze all the ride scenes in, the effects were REALLY good, and the swordfight scenes are just plain fun to watch. Almost as good as the princess bride. :P"

Lots of cliches and borrowed ideas too though which fans will probably just excuse. The violence is cartoonish and the swearing is laughably tame I'm afraid. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom do good job in their roles, (Knightley was only 17 at the time of filming) but the film is completely stolen by Johnny Depp and the character he created."

I would not recommend this for children under 10 years old, it has some scary scenes with those skeletons and stormy seas. Our son, when he was 9, was very frightened when we rented Titanic because of all the flooding. I'm a Geoffrey Rush fan and he was great but I have to agree with everyone - Johnny Depp stole the show by his charisma, not fighting abilities. There's a great duel scene in here, too. The leading lady does a fine job for her part - she just needed to be a bit feistier. Thank you."

Flynn played a man forced into piracy in \"Captain Blood\" and a privateer (someone licensed to commit acts akin to piracy in wartime by the Queen, in the anti-Hitler parable \"The Sea Hawk\"). But special effects alone can't save a sinking ship of a movie.\n\nThe story of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" isn't difficult to follow. Admittedly, this movie has an awful lot of story but I followed it fine after I got bored with the whole shebang and started surfing on my phone, listening to the movie with only one ear.\n\nThe movie is very long. I don't mind long movies, but this one bored the socks off me. I'm still looking for one of them. And when I was fed up and checked the time on the dvd to see if it was nearly over and realized I had more than forty minutes to go, I switched off my dvd player and haven't gone back to it yet.\n\nSome of the imagery is gruesome but I remember what it was like being twelve. I ate that stuff up . . . Though it might give younger children the willies.\n\nAnyhow,the subtitle \"the curse of the Black Pearl\" is a misnomer: it's not \"The Black Pearl\" that's cursed, but the gold, allegedly stolen from the Aztecs by Cortes (ask the Toltecs some time what they thought of the Azetcs; they basically did to the Toltecs what Cortez did to them. What goes around . . . ) The undead pirates may be brought back to life under certain conditions . . . But I won't give it away. It's the crux of the movie and I'd hate to spoil it.\n\nI've enjoyed Depp's performances in other movies but here he's just plain weird, to say the least. Keira Knightley is okay, though I've had a mental block to her since \"Doctor Zhivago.\" Rush comes off as the typical pirate, though he doesn't play up a silly Long-John-Silver Bristol accent, thank goodness. He's the best thing in the movie, and that's not high praise.\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean\" has lots of good, if occasionally misplaced, humor. I never watch movies about gangsters, though I give leeway to watching flicks about pirates. After this I'll probably rethink that policy. I found the whole thing a big, bloated bore. Oh, it's better than lots of live-action Disney movies, especially those that nearly sank the company in the 1970s and 1980s. I wouldn't trade this for any of Kurt Russell's Disney \"comedies.\" But someone needed to take a hatched into the editing suite. More is not always better."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'll admit, I didn't know much about Johnny Depp before I saw this movie back in 2004, a year after it came out. But now hes my favorite actor. It is probably one of my favorites because of great acting from Depp, Bloom, and Knightley. I also enjoyed how there are the different scenes from the ride at Disney land/world. Cpt. Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) was by far my favorite villain of all times. I honestly cant think of any weaknesses in the movie what so ever other than the CG isn't up to date anymore. Over all I think that the entire cast deserves three flaming thumbs up(if thats possible) I highly recommend to everyone. I think I'll be Jack Sparrow this year for Halloween..."

        "review_detailed_main": "I think this film is spectacular because it presents you a new and stronger character: a ship. The Black Pearl inspired me suspense and curiosity. The film gives you the sensation: \"I want to be there\". The backgrounds are great, Johnny Depp has an amazing facility to interpret a drunk pirate ( how strange..., is it a \"casuality\"? ). I think Johnny Depp is the best actor in this moment, and I'm so proud to say: \"I love I'm\". I really wish Vanesssa Paradise to disappear... but we are talking about the film, I don't find enough mistakes to say: \"This film is crap\". And if it is, well, I really don't matter, I love this film, I love when Johnny says Elizabeth Swan: \"Easy on the goods, darling\" ( I wish being Elizabeth Swan in that instant ) and finally, I love Johnny Depp. Sorry if I have spelling or writing mistakes, but I'm a thirteen year-old Mexican girl... 10/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "It's hard to review such a popular, blockbuster film as Pirates. Basically, Depp's acting is terrific. So is Geoffrey Rush's. Bloom makes another appearance in a big movie, but both his and Knightley's characters are fairly shut out due to Depp. Some great dialogue; the script is absolutely hilarious. I have to admit I loved the costuming and makeup (it's unfortunate that all its Oscar nominations occurred during the year of Lord of the Rings). The music is also wonderful, fitting the adventurish theme perfectly. Although the story has a couple flaws and there is a fair bit of Hollywood predictability, the movie counters this with humour and good storytelling. All in all, the first pirate movie of its kind - modern, funny, and adventurous."

        "review_detailed_main": "As pirate movies go, this one's pretty good. But there's not much competition - I probably prefer Spielberg's Hook as well, especially in terms of music and \"magic\". But PotC has good production values, a decent story and cast and plenty of general action, comedy and drama.\n\nBut rewatching it, it feels less special than I'd remembered. Depp is the main highlight, with his weird, drunk, halfway between dumb and smart but very likeable Jack Sparrow. He doesn't have a filter so he can just say what everyone's thinking, like comedians do. The other characters have their traditions, manners and alliances to adhere to. Jack is much freer.\n\nRush is also entertaining as Barbosa, more of a traditional pirate, with the famous accent, cutthroat attitude but also respect for arbitrary rules, sometimes. He's both menacing and funny.\n\nThe special effects hold up pretty well but are not that exciting anymore. It was new at the time, but now we need more than seeing skeletons and internal organs to be blown away. The movie relies more on entertainment than any solid or meaningful story. And for the most part, it is fun. But I wish it had a bit more heart, danger or proper plot to hold it together.\n\nThe stunts, sets and costumes are among the better aspects of PotC. It doesn't just rely on CGI. We get to see real water battles, sword-fighting, swinging on ropes, cannon fire, double crosses, tricks, etc. But already in this first movie, it can be a little confusing what everyone's motivations are or whose side we should be on.\n\nPotC feels like it should have gone further in some direction and more fully committed. Either become a real swashbuckler and make the action even bigger and keep the story logical so we really get invested. Have real stakes. Or instead, go further with the comedy and really put the characters in some hilarious situations. Maybe play up the fantasy/horror aspects of the story.\n\nAs it is, I suppose PotC achieves a kind of \"balance\", but it ends up being safer and less interesting because of this. It's never actually scary, the laughs are good but too spread out and the plot is too confusing to care much about what the characters do. None of the threats seem real and we never fear for any of the characters much.\n\nIt works best as an action with comedy, but could have been more. Hook explores nostalgia, forgetting who you were, facing your destiny, the joy and pride of being a father, etc. PotC is vaguely about love, adventure and breaking the rules. Good, but not amazing."

I am not\n\nusually a Johnny Depp fan, but I think he was absolutely perfect for the part of Captain Jack Sparrow. I don't think anyone could've done better.

All the supporting actors are good, even the smaller parts and the film seems much shorter than its 2 and a half hours. This film was so good that the awful, over special effected sequels have ruined what could have been a great series of films.

For its time, it was one of the best adventure films alongside Indiana Jones. However, no movie is as great as when it debuted. Otherwise cinema would be dull. I personally think this is one of the weaker and slower Pirates movies and many modern movies like Jungle Cruise, provide a crazier and more entertaining adventure. It's iconic for its time, but not as enjoyable as it once was. This is one of those movies I wish I could go back in time and watch for the first time again. It made me obsessed with Pirates."

I think, and I tell it to everybody with which I talk about films, that film is a kind of art. It is in essence a theater piece fashioned with modern digital effects and sounds and music. It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every \"holes\" are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush). Without Depp it would be a little boring movie, but with him it is fun to see it even twice or more. In this category (family \"fairytale\" movie) it is very amusing."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the best of the \"Pirates\" franchise & one of the greatest fantasy-adventure films ever made. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen way back in 2003 upon it's release & i loved it & still do in 2020!!!\n\n\"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" is a fantastic piece of filmmaking as well as a big summer blockbuster film, everything from the absolutely stunning production design & outstanding special effects to the Amazing music score & excellent performances are all perfect & put together created a Masterpiece.\n\nSimple-basic story is about a famous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) who teams up with a young Blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom) who set sail on a thrilling adventure to rescue the princess Elizabeth (Knightley) & battle the Evil supernatural pirates lead by Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) & all hell breaks loose. That's the basic plot but of course there's lots more going on with Magic Medallions & Zombies & Battles & a whole lot of Fun.\n\nI loved all the performances here, especially the heroic turn as Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, i liked his character more than Captain Jack Sparrow (which everyone became obsessed with?) Now Bloom is everybit the handsome & willing fighter out to save his true love Elizabeth. Depp is silly & fun as Jack Sparrow & very bizarre but good fun & Keira Knightley is great as the quick thinking & beautiful Elizabeth but who really steals the show here in my opinion is the fantastic Geoffrey Rush as the Evil, Funny & Cunning Captain Bambosa, he's a hilarious villain with such a great voice & it's the standout performance here for me. The supernatural Zombie pirates look Amazing on screen with truly stunning special effects that make the pirates look scary rather than comical as you might expect from a big budget Disney production, here everything looks spectacular. The ships are so richly textured & beautifully detailed as is all the costumes & fantastic sets, all the best quality possible.\n\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl is truly a rip-roaring, swashbuckling fantasy adventure full of fun & magic. An instant CLASSIC & a film that be watched over & over again."

The music makes you want to rush into battle with the characters just to cheer them on. At the end of the day, what really carries this film to the heights it reached is Jack Sparrow. The combination of some of the best make-up/costume design ever done and top tier acting makes this character unforgettable."

Orlando bloom is flat and monotonous, and keira is just the eye candy. Plus, the movie does'nt seem to end, EVER!!!! It just goes on and on being smug and thinking it's funny. I guarantee people will look back on this film in a few years saying \"what the hell was i thinking?\" If you are over the age of 21 than there are good odds that you will not, i repeat WILL NOT enjoy this film.\n\nWhen i heard of POTC, i was expecting something witty, adventurous, surprising, romantic, exciting and full of great characters. Something along the lines of The Princess Bride but with a huge budget. But, instead we got this twaddle. A film that did well in America but comparative poorly everywhere else. I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong, i love America, but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! (meet the fockers made $277m in America and only $113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more?) Another thing i will do before i go and see a film is look it up on IMDb and see who the writers are and who the directors are. If you don't like their previous work, you probably won't like their new film.\n\nWhat has happened to Hollywood. It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2 etc.\n\nBut i guess, now with dvds, Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office, it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days. I just heard that they wanted to make POTC back in the 1990's, but the script was rejected. 95% of the movies i've seen in the last five years i hate. I officially hate Hollywood!!!"

I like Johnny Dep, but the portrayal of a pirate is a reach.... not at all believable. He seemed to soft to be a pirate, not rugged enough. There were some good scenes, but not the ones with Johnny Dep. If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a classic Pirate Movie, you will be disappointed. I have no real desire to see part two any time soon. I don't think the characters were developed enough and it felt like the movie is probably catering to the kids and not to adults. It had no historical value either and seemed to be done on a limited budget. Just not as good as all the hype."

With a great supporting cast but no one comes near Depp's performance save for maybe his rival of Geoffery Rush but even he cannot Blow Johnny out of the water. I was glad to see that this lived up to my expectations, but also and maybe even more importantly didn't deface the name of the beloved Disney ride like \"the Country Bears\" did. Of all the Pirate movies I have never seen a more well-rounded one. It has the perfect mix of action, superstition and reality of a pirate life. And for fans of the ride this film will be even funnier and much more rewarding featuring as advertized great tidbits from the original plot-line of the attraction.\n\nAnyone looking for a change of pace from the usual summer Blockbusters I urge you to go see this. Or for anyone who has ever been enchanted by pirates whether by means of the ride or otherwise. 10++/10"

This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times. Overall it's a good movie that the whole family can enjoy, but it's still a bit of a overrated movie.\n\n7.8/10"

Though it's not nearly as witty overall, it's full of great lines (most of which go to Jack Sparrow), funny references to Disney's PotC ride, and good visuals. The special effects are keen and not made to scare, though young ones might be wary. The movie can run on a bit, but I really didn't mind (It meant more Jack Sparrow). I've read reviews stating that Johnny Depp is channeling a drunken drag queen in this movie, and that's a good thing. There truly is something hypnotic, sexy, and worth swooning over in the way he plays Jack Sparrow.\n\nThis movie also encourages kids to eat their fruits... particularly apples.\n\nAnd if none of this has convinced you to go see this movie, then go to see the staggering amount of dental work. I'm not kidding, watch the credits and count the number of dentists who worked on this! Depp's and Rush's mouths alone must've kept several dentists busy for weeks."

The pacing was off and I found it too long. I think it would be a much better movie if it were 1/2 an hour shorter. I found myself checking my watch several times-not a good thing.\n\nThe length of the movie offset most of the good points for me and I gave the movie a 6/10. It was really hard for me to submit the vote. I could tell that someone really labored over this movie and tried to sweat the details. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how hard film makers work on their craft if it fails to deliver the goods, right?"

Since the centre of the world then was Istanbul, then known as Constantinople. You can still vilify the Brits because British Constantine ruled that world. The 'East' India Company and 'Eastern' Levant Company were both located in that area, Constantinople and Ankara. Brits refuse to teach on the India Company in school, because you're allowed to lie to anyone except kids. Pirates of the Carribean's producers made such efforts to create all these magnificent movies. If only the historians had given the slightest care. Watch this series as a parallel universe series where you cross oceans on, basically, canoos."

You expect a pirate movie - not necessarily full of romance, but this film lacks any trace of it. For instance: if you don't love Norrington, who then do you really love? A writer could do better than this. The movie is definitely not based on Disney's P. of the C. Anyone doubting that should go and visit the Real Pirates at Disneyland.

Then Pirates happen.\n\nLike Disney's family ride, you get great scenery, you get some thrills, spills, and some good honest humor, particulary with Johnny Depp's crafty swaggering character. Bloom and Knightley fit in nicely when it comes to the tale of a damsel in distress and her true love saving her. Rush commands his army of pirates well with a matured manner, yet he can still be quite evil. What really deserves some credit is the Special Effects and the Pirates themselves. We get a good gathering of savages and thieves, giving the ride lovers what they wanted. Good swordplay and great ship battles, what more could you want? A less sappy ending I guess. I mean C'mon!\n\nBottom line: It has Hollywood branded all over it's filthy tooth smile but it delivers what one would want out of a Disney Pirate movie, much like the ride (before they took out the pirates chasing women)."

He turns up just as the governor's daughter \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) is having to fend off the rather unwanted matrimonial intentions of \"Norrington\" (Jack Davenport). She has designs on the blacksmith's apprentice - \"Turner\" (a handsome but insipid, sorry, Orlando Bloom) whom she rescued from a pirate raid many years earlier. \"Sparrow\" would prove an excellent catch for \"Norrington\" but thanks to an hot poker, a donkey and some legerdemain at sea, he and \"Turner\" are soon abroad on the trail of his old crew and of the legendary pirates who sail the seas in the \"Black Pearl\" seeking an odd sort of salvation! What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his \"Barbossa\" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's \"Gov. Swann\" and an whole suite of powdered wigs. The visual effects are top drawer and the story well worth a watch on a big screen to do justice to the imagery and the best traditions of seafaring yarns."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh boy, where do I even begin with this movie? Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an absolute gem in the world of cinema. I mean, who doesn't love a good pirate adventure, am I right?\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about the plot. We've got a blacksmith, Will Turner, who teams up with the one and only Captain Jack Sparrow. And let me tell you, Captain Jack is a character like no other. He's eccentric, he's unpredictable, and he's got that swagger that just makes you want to be a pirate yourself. Together, they embark on a mission to save the love of Will's life, who has been kidnapped by some shady pirates. And guess what? These pirates are not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill buccaneers. Nope, they're undead! Talk about adding a supernatural twist to the story.\n\nNow, let's talk about the performances in this film. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is an absolute scene-stealer. He brings this quirky charm to the character that is just so entertaining to watch. You never know what he's going to do or say next, and that's what makes him so lovable. And let's not forget about Orlando Bloom as Will Turner. He brings this earnestness to the role that perfectly complements the madness of Captain Jack. And of course, we can't leave out Keira Knightley as the governor's daughter. She's strong, independent, and definitely not your damsel in distress. These three actors have such great chemistry on screen, and it's a joy to watch them interact.\n\nNow, let's talk about the action and adventure in this film. From the very beginning, you're thrown into this world of pirates, treasure, and epic sword fights. The action sequences are top-notch, and the special effects are just mind-blowing. The way they bring the undead pirates to life is so cool, and it adds an extra layer of excitement to the film. And let's not forget about the iconic music by Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is so catchy and memorable, it's impossible not to hum along.\n\nBut what really sets this movie apart is its sense of humor. The dialogue is witty, the comedic timing is spot on, and there are so many hilarious moments throughout. Captain Jack Sparrow's one-liners are pure gold, and they will have you laughing out loud. And let's not forget about the physical comedy as well. There are some great slapstick moments that will have you in stitches. It's this perfect blend of action, adventure, and comedy that makes Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl such a joy to watch.\n\nOverall, I would give this film a solid 8.5 out of 10. It's a swashbuckling adventure filled with unforgettable characters, thrilling action, and a whole lot of laughs. Whether you're a fan of pirates or not, this movie is definitely worth checking out. So grab your popcorn, set sail, and get ready for a wild ride with Captain Jack Sparrow. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!"

        "review_detailed_main": "This was a movie whose trailor was played all day, everyday, as the build-up to the release loomed here in Cape Town. Me, im one for swash-buckling pirates and handsome hero's, so of course i was intruiged and dutifully paid the fee to see the movie, although i have to add that my expectations were sky high, and this is normally a recipe for intense disappointment.\n\nBut not this day, this movie. It had me from the opening sequence, to the end credits and left me wanting more. i found the entire movie a marvel, the characters well scripted and perfectly brought to life. above all of that though, the humour and wit brought forth by the wondeful Jack Sparrow and counterparts made the film. the chemistry was perfect and this is definitely a movie i would indeed pay to see once again.\n\nas mentioned, Johnny Depp was PERFECTLY cast as Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow that is. He melded with this character and there is truthfully none other i could see in the role. it was tailor made and he fit it like a glove. it was also interestingly refreshing to see him in a role that departed from the \"Sleepy Hollow\" \"From Hell\" spectrums of the last few years.\n\nOrlando Bloom, an actor surrounded with much hype. and i have to say much deserved. He was fantastic, and a wonderful support. Will Turners chemistry with Captain Jack is a marvel to watch and i found myself smiling an aweful lot. and yes, i too drowned in his gorgeously long lashed eyes!\n\nKiera Knightly, the herione is one that i did not care for much. despite her success in Bend it like Beckham, Kiera never really captivated me, but even she had me smiling and praising the casting directors for their choice. she was lovely and a wonderful foil for the otherwise all male cast.\n\nthere is no other rating but 5/5; 10/10 Excellent, and more inportantly a movie that EVERYONE, adult and child alike would love. something for everyone!!!"

When I heard it was supposed to revive the pirate genre, show some awesome specialFX and would feature J.D. as a pirate, I half expected a dark and erie story that would keep me at the edge of my seat and make me mumble \"woooow\" every now and then into the bucket of popcorn I am holding on to.\n\nWell... none of it came through. Don't get me wrong, I did find it entertaining, but all throughout the movie, I kept thinking that I watching a film that was meant to be animated and reminded me strongly of former disney antics, just that (thank god) they didnt break into sing every now and then...\n\nThe story is barely more than ok, slimly suits the audience of 12+, the characters are flat and stereotype, the Fx are awesome but sometimes not put to use too well I feel - the zombie pirates didnt really scare anyone at all - and the humor was often flat and failed to hit its mark more than once...\n\nIt is a sunday evening film for entertainment, even of the family sort, but certainly not what I would spend the saturday night start-off money on... I'll give it a 6 out of 10, barely missing a 7, and it is 100% absolutely NOT the best film that came out this year."

Its excellent story and wonderful selection of actors and actresses has drawn in many people of all ages. What makes this movie so good is it's never ceasing action, which was brilliantly choreographed. Its musical score is quite good also. It might just seem that is the best movie ever made, or that it can be shown anywhere to anyone. But it is obviously not the greatest movie, nor can it be shown to whoever wants to watch it. Let me remind you that this movie is PG-13. This is because of its crude humor and intense fight scenes. This is why only people that are teens or older should watch it, hence PG-13. Other than that it is an excellent movie which deserves being watched more than once."

Johnny Depp does a great job playing Captain Jack. Captain Jack is so comedic yet so tough and \"piraty.\" Orlando Bloom is so great in this movie. Not to mention that he looks great in a pirate costume, but he is perfect for the part he plays. He plays a sensitive yet brave young man who tries to save his love. Kiera Knightly also does a wonderful job playing the beautiful but slightly tom boyish girl who falls in love with pretty boy Will. This movie has it all; romance, action (sword fights man!), mysterious music, and awesome special effects and costuming. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, it's one of those movies you just can't miss. 10+++++!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The theme of pirates is a very common one in movie-making. There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates. And of course, Hollywood has it's share in the pirate stories: 'Cutthroat Island' (I don't know why it flopped), 'Treasure Island', and variants have all graced or disgraced our screens for decades. And then this...\n\nI truly think that pirate movies aren't going to get better than POTC. The plot is original, surprising, and impossibly dynamic, the humor fresh and unforced, the filming absolutely stunning, and the acting thorough and enjoyable. Watching Jack Sparrow (by the way, the entire image of Jack Sparrow was left up to Johnny Depp. I can't imagine how it could've turned out better) clamber, sway, and in extreme cases fall through trembling holds, cages, and rigging was something that I know I will look back upon in about twenty years with just as much relish as I do now. The brilliant dynamic created by the sarcastic, irreverent Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the uber-eccentric, hilarious, infinitely scheming Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is something that cannot accurately be described by anyone on this earth. Add to that some semi-peripheral roles that only enhance the humor and action, and you get a masterpiece.\n\nThe sets were filmed on location using real ships (well... 2/3 real ships), real ocean, real islands, and a specially constructed real fort, giving this movie an authenticity that serves to endear it even more.\n\nThere is something in this movie that will appeal to anyone: action lovers, wisecracks, the romantic souls, those that like to tickle their nerves with semi-scary images, the thinkers, ANYONE. Should you watch this movie? Of course! And bring the kids along too... the skeletons and such, they're not even really scary. The whole movie is almost like a story, in fact. A very fast-paced, engrossing, exciting, and profound story."

Geoffrey Rush did a great job as the villianous captain, and Orlando Bloom had a nice follow up outside of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

This movie is a fun little ride-- not fantastic or amazing, but enjoyable. Johnny Depp is amazing in characterizing this pirate-- is he drunk? Is he crazy? Or is Jack Sparrow just pretending to be that way? He keeps up the act through the entire movie, which is a feat in its own right. So sit back and be entertained. It's not earthshattering, but a good little pirate adventure for a couch movie night."

Without him I probably would give it a 5.5/6 instead of a 7.

All of the death and violence that you know has to be in a movie like this is so tastefully done it's almost shocking in this day of blood by the gallon. Beautifully filmed and scored, you won't want to leave your seat for anything. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish. Pirates is completely unexpected in it's eloquence and detail. Too many films take their big budgets and blow the film, while this one shows them what they should have done. To say we can't wait until Pirates 2 comes out would be an understatement.

I don't know how this garbage made it to the top 250 list. The cheesy dialogue, dull action scenes, cardboard acting, lame use of CGI, and the ludicrous plot made this as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Some movies do such a good job somewhat smaller cogs that make a movie, that makes it seem so important, it leaves you wondering why this much focus isn't spent on other films. Pirates does this in many areas. -Costume design for one. The costumes are such a strength, made even better alongside the intricately detailed props. Everything feels and looks authentic. -The ships are also very cool! This is one film's set design I would love to visit and be a part of. -The soundtrack has been one that has been in my head, stuck for nearly two decades. Equal to the greats like Howard Shore or Hans Zimmer. It brings so much action and joy and makes you want to move around for sure. -Lastly the actors. Such a good cast and hard to think that this was the early breaks for Orlando and Keira, who are now pretty big deals. My most favourite role of Johnny Depp, don't really like him in anything else, but he's awesome in this! Great movie and even better soundtrack."

It has all the formulas for success: a great cast (Depp is perfect, and everybody else is more than up to par.), fantastic visuals (with help from ILM), and a great story. Being the first Walt Disney movie (under the Disney banner) to be given a PG-13 rating, I was surprised at how violent the movie was. While it is nowhere near an 'R' rating, definately not a PG rating either. Parents, think twice before bringing the younger ones.\n\nI can't think of too many complaints. Humor and action were well-balanced. I suppose some more sword-fighting would've been nice, but a minor gripe with an otherwise fantastic action-adventure. Compared to recent summer movies that weren't really all that good (Terminator 3, Matrix Reloaded, Hulk), it was nice to see another movie that, while no X2: X-Men United, manages to blow you out of the water! Hopefully, it will equally share the wealth with LXG (another great movie) when both open this week!\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7.5 out of 10 (Great action-adventure will blow you out of the water!)"

This movie is rather interesting. Even though Depp and Bloom are eye-candy, you can't help but love the movie. The special effects are fairly good. I praise the caster for casting this hilarious yet serious group. Well Done! Also, the two disc DVD set holds a great amount of extra's! Be sure to watch the blooper reel and Pirate's Diary! Great stuff for someone who wants to get behind the scenes!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The pirates who infested the Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may, in real life, have been a murderous bunch of cut-throats, but Hollywood has generally seen them as swashbuckling heroes, as in the Burt Lancaster vehicle \"The Crimson Pirate\" from the fifties. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" is a modern film in the same tradition. It is said to be based on a Disneyland theme park ride, although in this context the phrase \"based on\" probably means little more than \"sharing a name with\".\n\nThe film is set in Jamaica during the late seventeenth century, presumably before the destruction of Port Royal in an earthquake in 1692, as part of the action takes place in that city. There is, however, little attempt at period accuracy, and some of the costumes and uniforms on display seem to date from a much later period, in some cases as late as the 1770s. There are a number of other goofs; why, for example, would anyone need a warming-pan in the tropical climate of Jamaica? The plot is a complex one, which I will not summarise in full. It centres upon the rivalry between Will Turner, a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow for the love of Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of the British Governor of Jamaica. Despite their rivalry, and Will's detestation of all pirates, the two men have to join forces to rescue Elizabeth who has been kidnapped by Hector Barbossa, captain of the pirate ship the Black Pearl. Barbossa and his men are under a supernatural curse, laid upon them when they stole a treasure of Aztec gold. It transpires that Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl, but lost his command when Barbossa, against whom he has sworn vengeance, led a mutiny against him.\n\nThe studio did not hold out great hopes for the film; at one time Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner even wanted to drop the production. In the event, however, it proved an unexpected success, both critically and at the box office, and has spawned three sequels to date. The fact that a major character dies towards the end of the film might suggest that the producers were not anticipating a sequel; the character in question was miraculously resurrected in time for \"Dead Man's Chest\". There are, I think, two reasons for the film's success. The first is that, despite a complicated and often nonsensical plot, the story is an entertaining one which moves along at a fast pace. The film stays true to the traditions of the pirate film with some good action sequences, including an excellent hand-to-hand duel between Will and Sparrow.\n\nThe second reason for the film's success is some highly inventive casting. This was the film which first made a major star of Keira Knightley. The lovely Keira had already had a big success in Britain with \"Bend It like Beckham\", but was less well-known in America or internationally. In a traditional pirate movie, Elizabeth would doubtless have been played as a helpless, fragile damsel-in-distress. Today, feminist theory frowns upon this sort of portrayal of female characters, so Elizabeth becomes feisty and determined, but Keira is able to suggest an underlying fragility and vulnerability even when her character is at her feistiest. Geoffrey Rush was rather cast against type; I had always previously regarded him as the star of serious films like \"Shine\" or \"Elizabeth\", but here he plays Barbossa as a swaggering, semi-comic pantomime villain. Orlando Bloom has a difficult task; Will is, nominally at least, the romantic lead, but he is also rather strait-laced, and at times he seems rather dull by comparison with the film's real star character, Captain Jack.\n\nFor it is undoubtedly Johnny Depp who steals the film. Depp is sometimes an eccentric actor, but he is hardly ever a dull one. (OK, he was dull in \"Chocolat\", but then that was a very dull film). The original intention was that Captain Jack Sparrow should be played as a straightforward swashbuckler, based upon the pirates played by the likes of Lancaster or Errol Flynn. Depp, however, subverted this intention and turned Sparrow into a sort of 17th century rock star- he claims the character was based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones- with a slightly slurred diction and a more than slightly camp manner. To traditionalists this must have seemed like an outrageously eccentric interpretation of the role, and yet somehow it works brilliantly, contrasting nicely with the more straightforwardly masculine Will. Depp even received an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\", a remarkable achievement for an action-adventure summer blockbuster. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for lifting \"Curse of the Black Pearl\" well above the normal standard of such blockbusters. 7/10"

That was about 5 minutes into the movie, it all went down from there. It was just boring to me, pirates who were cursed and now need the blood of a certain fellow to lift it, whoooo. Orlando Bloom was annoying, I can understand pre teenage girls waving their \"Potc\" flags because hes oh so hot(those would be the imdb users with reviews like, \"omigawd this is like tha best movie EVER, orlando bloom rules!!!111\".\n\nMy confirmation came when my sweet mother, who never has a bad word to say about anyone or anything proclaimed, \"it wasnt really good\", when an hour rolled around we had both lost all interest and i was reading comic books, glancing at the tv now and then to see if anything interesting pops up. It didnt. Finally, I fell asleep.\n\n3/10"

He seems to bring to this film an appreciation for what makes traditional swashbucklers so enjoyable while not simply trying to reproduce them ... it's a successful update of the genre.\n\nJohnny Depp's eccentric performances can go off the rails, but his pirate-as-a-drunk-Keith-Richards idea is really inspired madness. Both he and Geoffrey Rush play BIG here, but they wisely play it straight too.\n\nKeira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are good straight heroes. Updated versions of the traditional hero types. Neither of them go BIG.\n\nThe films probably a bit too long and a bit too in love with CGI, but on the whole ... this is an example of how to do mainstream blockbuster filmmaking right."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is no accident that Pirates of the Caribbean became such a massive franchise in the early 2000s and it all stemmed from Curse of the Black Pearl. While the sequels exceeded the original at the box office, there are few action-adventures that click on all cylinders like this one. Fundamentally, this film works because the plot is balanced with twists while remaining concise. Because of that, Curse of the Black Pearl has energy and purpose throughout its runtime. The production design is also key here because the excellent costumes, sets, and locations create deep immersion that is necessary for this type of movie.\n\nHowever, no Pirates of the Caribbean review would be complete without mentioning the cast. Johnny Depp really does deserve all the credit in the world for delivering such an iconic performance. He steals every scene he is in and nails his sharp dialogue. Meanwhile, Knightley and Bloom may not be as tantalizing but they bring essential heart to build around. Also, Geoffrey Rush is underrated and electric as Barbossa. So, overall, Curse of the Black Pearl contains an abundance of strengths that synergize quite nicely and create a truly captivating experience. No wonder the film is widely loved and considered a modern classic.\n\nWriting: 8/10 Direction: 8/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Acting: 9/10 Editing: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 9/10 Production Design: 10/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 9/10\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10."

When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable."
