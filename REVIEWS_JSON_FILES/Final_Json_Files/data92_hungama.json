The way the characters are linked together is truly clever and hilarious. I think this movie is 10 times funnier than Hera Pheri.\n\nAnd, none of the actors disappoint! How great is that?\n\nVery entertaining. 9 out of 10"

Its confusion all the way in the movie, only the viewers know whats going on. Good acting by Paresh Rawal (as usual), Akshaye, Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav n even Rimi Sen's acting is praiseworthy. Overall a very good entertaining movie in a class of its own. For all the fans of 'andaz apna apna' n 'hera pheri' a must watch."

Akshaye Khanna does a very good job in this movie, and so does Aftab Shivdasani. They provide quite a few scenes with hard laughs, but the best one is Paresh Rawal of course. He delivers another brilliant role just like in Hera Pheri, except in this one he is a wealthy villager. His village accent is very good. I laughed at all his jokes. The rest of the cast did a pretty good job too.\n\nI usually don't give movies 10/10, so as you can see this film had to be that good for me to give it a 10. Other movies that I recommend are: Hera Pheri, Andaz Apna Apna, and Phir Hera Pheri."

It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these 26 characters lead to absolute chaos! Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a genius. The movie also makes fun of cliched Bollywood scenes. If I could, I would give this movie an 11 out of 10.

        "review_detailed_main": "Priyadarshan has always been inconsistent in my opinion. He gives us some good films and then some bad films. A little over 2 years back, he gave a film called De Dhana Dhan which was another \"Hungama\" type of film. However, that didn't work because it got too messy with its sub-plots. Hungama did not and that is why it is one of my favorite comedies and also one of the most underrated comedies in the past few decades.\n\nNandu is a struggling singer trying to make it in the big city. Due to some circumstances, he is forced to live with Anjali.\n\nAnjali runs away from her village for a better life and also to get away from a forced marriage to pay her father's debts by coming to Mumbai. She finds a job working for Jeetu\n\nJeetu tries to woo Anjali, who he thinks is the daughter of millionaire Radheshyam Tiwari..\n\nRadheshyam is a millionaire who tries to give living in a bigger city than a village a try..\n\nAlongside that comes more characters played by Shakti Kapoor, Rajpal Yadav, Manoj Jodhi, Tiku and Shoma etc.\n\nMany may not agree with me but Hungama is a very smart film because it knows how to keep the viewer compelled to stay on their seat. The writers could have easily confused the viewers but they don't because of the careful writing.\n\nThere are flaws, however. Firstly, the script does have some loopholes here and there. Most of them can be overlooked. The major problem I had was with the Aftab-Rimi-Akshaye love story. Rimi's choice does not exactly make sense because throughout the film it does not seem she's interested in any of the guys. One song could have been deleted to smoothen the ride.\n\nThose are pretty minor though. The best scenes in the film include Paresh Rawal, Akshaye Khanna, Shoma and Shakti Kapoor. Hilarious! Also, the Rajpal Yadav track is funny. The climax is fun to watch.\n\nThe music is a surprise since Priyadarshan films don't really have great soundtracks. I liked all the songs in the movie here.\n\nWhen a film does not have a conventional plot, the characters have to be strong and have strong lines. The dialogues are usually the high point of Priyadarshan films and it's the same case here. The lines are witty and rib tickling.\n\nPriyadarshan's directing is good and that's no surprise because he's born to make these kind of films.\n\nHungama would be incomplete without Paresh Rawal. All the characters are funny but Paresh takes it to another level. A tremendous comic act by a great actor.\n\nAkshaye Khanna is as always, efficient. Aftab does well. Ditto for Rimi. Shakti Kapoor is hilarious. Rajpal Yadav is just mad.. others support well.\n\nOverall - A film with lots of laughs and in the end, it leaves you putting a smile on your face. Recommended!"

Never ever I like to see a video of a song more then once but I must have seen it hundreds of times and still I find it hilarious....

'Hungama', is a yet another winning comedy from the talented filmmaker. It's Loud and Funny! It's long, but interesting at the same time.\n\nI had watched 'Hungama' during it's release, way back in 2003, and I enjoyed it. Sure, I found it outrageous, but I remember laughing loudly at a few portions. Over the years, when-ever I re-visit this comedy, It still manages to hold my attention, despite it's visible flaws.\n\n'Hungama' is the story of a bunch of misfits whose misconception about each others backgrounds end up in a series of chaotic, yet comic outcomes.\n\nAn adaptation of Priyadarshan's 1984 Malayalam film 'Poochakkoru Mookkuthi', 'Hungama' is mostly an engaging fare, thanks to it's interesting and progressive screenplay, that comes in-tact with memorable dialogue and winning performances by it's talented star cast. But, the writing in the second hour, trends to drag a bit. And some portions, are loud. The climax is over-the-top, but it's funny nonetheless.\n\nPriyadarshan's direction is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Songs are fairly okay. Performance-Wise: Paresh Rawal is impeccable. The legendary actor plays his part with unmatchable ease. Akshaye Khanna gets it right, as always. Aftab does deliver in some portions, while Rimi Sen is ordinary. Shoma Anand is amusing. Shakti Kapoor & Tiku Talsania are superb, and bring in a host of laughs. Manoj Joshi, Rajpal Yadav, Sanjay Narvekar & Razzak Khan are funny as well.\n\nOn the whole, 'Hungama' is meant for those who love Haha fares. Thumbs Up!"

One of the very poor Priyadarshan movies. I only watched it because I read many reviews of the sequel saying watch the original and that it's a \"masterpiece\" and absurd stuff like that. You gotta be one crazy person to hail nonsense like this as a masterpiece.\n\nThe actors are pathetic. There's a reason why Hera Pheri, Bhopal Bhulaiyya and even De Dana Dan which is the weakest PD movie ever are talked about even today and feel funny even today. It's because of the actors. Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, Suneil Shetty, this combo is that reason. Their comic timing is impeccable and their chemistry excellent.\n\nThe same is not the case with Hungama. These are some of the poorest actors ever forming the lead cast, barring Akshaye Khanna and Paresh Rawal. Even Shakti Kapoor's character was quite poorly written, thus failing to amuse me at all. I don't know how they cast Aftab Shivdasani and Rimi Sen back in the day in so many movies. They were unbearable. I won't say much about them although I have a lot to. This movie was a waste of my 2 and a half hours.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're thinking of watching this movie for the first time, don't do it. It is dated and easily the poorest Priyadashan film. Not worth watching.\n\n2/10."

The film has garnered a special place in my heart, compelling me to watch it repeatedly.\n\nOne of the many aspects that make \"Hungama\" stand out is the exceptional talent of Upashna Singh, who breathes life into the characters Dulari and Popat's wife. Often overlooked and underrated, Upashna's acting skills shine through in every scene, showcasing her versatility and depth as an artist. Her ability to seamlessly transition between the two roles demonstrates her dedication to her craft and her potential to be a leading actress in the industry.\n\nAftab, who plays the character Nandu, also deserves recognition for his outstanding performance. His handsomeness complements his acting skills, and he has managed to embody his character perfectly. It is disheartening to see such a talented actor like Aftab often underrated in the industry. Both Upashna and Aftab have showcased their prowess in \"Hungama,\" leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nThe ensemble cast of \"Hungama\" has also delivered remarkable performances, each contributing to the film's overall success. Their ability to bring their characters to life with perfection is truly commendable.
