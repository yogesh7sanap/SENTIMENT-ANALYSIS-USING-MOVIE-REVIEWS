And what in the name of all things good and holy is a \"Synchronizer\" and what does it have to do with anything at all? Why is Africa made of fiber-glass? Why is Richard Burton made of stone? Oh, God. They couldn't have made this worse if they had scripted it so. Oh, wait...they did. Well, for all its faults at least it's not a desperate attempt by a major studio to milk whatever money they can out of a pre-existing hit by combining a-list actors, and a controversial visualist director, with a hastily prepared screenplay that shares little of the spirit and intelligence of its predecessor, producing a boring, although often laughably pious bastardization of something far, far greater. Oh wait....it is. If you're a fan of bad movies, you have reached Zen here. If you're a fan of the original Exorcist, run, just run and don't look back. Run with your arms flailing into the night as the preview audiences surely did in 1977."

It makes you wonder, as any boob with as big a budget as this film could have made a good film and had no right to make one this bad!!\n\nThe film picks up several years after the last one. Most of the original cast are gone but Regan (Linda Blair) is back. Now she's a seemingly well-adjusted and shapely young lady who loves working with disabled kids(!). An annoying psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) works with Regan and assumes that all the publicity about her possession can easily be explained away using science. At the same time, a totally nutty priest (overplayed badly by Richard Burton) investigates the case and is certain possession did occur--and wants to be certain that Blair is not repossessed! Where this goes next is pretty dumb...no, it's INCREDIBLY dumb. It turns out that there is some sort of African demon named Pazuzu (or something like it) and the film just gets dumber and dumber. Badly made scenes involving the demon and locust swarms look amazingly silly and the plot goes very, very, very far from the original film--a bizarre choice, that's for sure! But if that isn't enough, there is an ear-piercing shrill sound that simply made me want to gouge my eardrums out to make it stop! At this point, I was ready to scream....and it never got any better! Too many dumb and annoying scenes and an African tie-in that made no sense--why did the script go this way?! The film is the trifecta of badness--horribly written, directed by a chimp and badly acted. An annoying and dumb film from start to finish and this is saying a lot considering that it was re-edited several times to even get it to this level of badness!"

The plot, if that's the word for it, is meant to be a sequel to The Exorcist, but it is devoid of logic and seeks only to shock. Admittedly The Exorcist did some of that too, but at least it was tied to a rational plot and characters. In this mess nothing is coherent, and the entire concept of some demon who is not the Devil but is called Pazuzu and flies around in the shape of a big locust while a great actor like James Earl Jones wears silly costumes and mouths absurd dialogue is so far beyond the rational it reduces the movie to self-parody. Richard Burton is here overacting with the turgid lines he's been given. Linda Blair seemed in a daze. The final scenes in which the entire house in Georgetown, the same one from the first film, gets wrecked and someone burned alive and swarms of locusts descend is just ludicrous. When it is over the viewer also will be in a daze - it is impossible to believe a plot this bad was ever approved and put on film. It is one of the worst films of all time."

I really liked how they set Father Lemont up to have to choose between the angelic Regan and the sinful Regan,and speaking of Regan Linda Blair was awesome. Going back to the end, I love how even though they looked the same and were dressed the same she managed to make the costume work, and make it look like an innocent sort of dress for one, yet at the same time the evil Regan looked sexy in the same dress!All in all I thought it was a darn good sequel and give it a 7/10!"

I had already been warned that Boorman's sequel was bad, but never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that such a piece of unadulterated garbage could be humanly concocted. It has no redeeming features whatsoever, there is not a single thing in this film that makes it worthy, and that is no mean feat. From the first ten minutes, when that flashy light bulb thing appeared, you could see the thing going straight off the rails, but I was hooked because the film kept surprising me, just when I thought it couldn't become any worse, something happened that was unbelievably even more ludicrous than what had come before. Overall, I have to admit I had a good time watching it and laughing wholeheartedly at the disaster I was witnessing. I don't know what is funnier, though, the film itself, or the fact that some people seem to find it good, or actually better than the original (???).

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1973 Exorcist is probably my favorite horror film, it's a film that I love and I always like to know or learn more about it, and even though I knew the sequel was bad, I didn't know it was SO bad. The existence of this film makes no sense, The Exorcist had already closed the story it presented to us, so I see this sequel as a clear attempt to build on the success of the first film.\n\nAbout the film, as difficult as it was to reach the end, I resisted, and I can say that it is an atrocity on several levels and in different contexts, trying my best to give meaning to its existence with motivations and plots that are ridiculous from the start from them. There is no way to justify director John Boorman's decisions.\n\nThere are moments when you might laugh because they are so absurd and poorly produced that they are actually funny, like the scenes involving the hypnosis device (a horrible concept that gets even worse as the film progresses and becomes more and more pointless), but unfortunately they are moments, the film is not so bad that it becomes funny, they are just moments and laughable concepts, the rest is torture. The most interesting thing is to know that director John Boorman doesn't like the original, I mean, he doesn't like the original, which is a renowned film, but did he like this thing he did here?\n\nThe cast is very affected and they are not bad actors. Louise Fletcher had just won the Oscar for her excellent work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and in this film she is as expressive as a door. Richard Burton, who is a great actor, is terrible as Father Lamont, it seemed like he didn't know what he was doing, what's more his character is terrible and seems more like a madman who talks about demons all the time, I don't judge the characters who don't take him seriously. But the biggest bad highlight of the cast is Linda Blayr, totally affected by the stardom that the first film gave her (she was incredible in the first film), she is as bad as everyone else and even worse. And her character can feel what Father Lamont feels and even heal mute people, 4 years have passed and Regan has gained superpowers, how incredible, right?\n\nAll the ''horror'' scenes in this film have the opposite effect, it was supposed to be something tense, but it is laughable and has one of the worst visual constructions in the horror genre, from the makeup that is much inferior to the first film (where it is clearly a double instead of Linda Blayr... and what a horrible stunt double), even those grasshoppers or isolated exorcism scenes without minimally acceptable contexts. The plot progresses as if it had several ideas brought together in some way without continuity and coherence. Concepts that were formed in the first film, such as the demon being persistent and difficult to defeat, are completely forgotten, and here the demon not only disappears in the blink of an eye but also introduces himself by saying his name.\n\nFor much of the film I was asking myself, what is happening? How did they get to that level? Because nothing has the slightest logical coherence and justification for happening, and when it does, it would be better not to have it. The editing of this film is terrible, there are transitions and overlapping images that are really amateurish, and if you isolate it scene by scene and stop little by little, you realize that it doesn't make sense.\n\nTo be fair to the film and to Ennio Morricone, the film's soundtrack is good, but even if it is good, it is very poorly used, and is affected because it doesn't match the badness of the scenes where it is inserted.\n\nExorcist II: The Heretic is everything the first film wasn't, even though it was an attempt to capitalize on the original, how did they reach this level in just 4 years? One of the worst sequels I've ever seen considering the quality of the first film and one of the worst films I've ever seen too. I couldn't express half the contempt I feel for this film in this review."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Eeee-villl\" says Richard Burton, unconvincingly cast as a conflicted Man of the Cloth in this follow-up to 1973's \"The Exorcist\". He attempts to purge mind demons from possession-survivor Regan (a vaguely distraught Linda Blair). Louise Fletcher (as Dr. Tuskin, Regan's therapist) and Kitty Winn (returning from the original as Regan's guardian, Sharon) are both mediocre, but Burton surely fares the worst; unsuccessfully hiding his embarrassment behind a staunchly theatrical mask, his readings seem conformed to reach the high balconies, and his over-enunciation seems peculiar in these surroundings--he's angry when he shouldn't be, and vice-versa. It's been said that this film cost Burton the Oscar for \"Equus\" (released the same year). Perhaps it was the troubled production (the constant rewrites, and director John Boorman suddenly taking ill) that tripped up the actors. Blair doesn't thrive; she keeps her poise but stays aloof from the proceedings (she's also a grown-up young woman who seems to be playing down her age, for a 'cute' effect). Boorman had a vision here, but damned if anyone could figure out what it was. William Goodhart's screenplay makes an attempt to show that great goodness can be a magnet for evil (they are helplessly intertwined), and that Regan was possessed by the demon Pazuzu because she is a healer. Unfortunately, none of this makes for a scary thriller. The film is heavy-handed, \"metaphysical\" and occasionally awkward and/or unintentionally funny (when Burton goes into synch to reach Dr. Tuskin, everyone is frantic because she's breathing abnormally, so what does the assistant tell Burton? \"Relax deeply!\"). Boorman's original version (butchered after disastrous early showings) eschews Burton's opening narration and begins inside the Mexican church (not outside near the steps); it also features a corny but satisfying final tag involving Sharon and Dr. Tuskin in Georgetown. ** from ****"

His \"Exorcist\" sequel is miles below the original if you're looking for scares, but miles above it in terms of actual storytelling, plot, character development, etc. It's full of interesting ideas (the most interesting being the idea of pure goodness as a magnet for evil), and Regan turns into an angelic heroine out to stop the demon that once possessed her. But Boorman's wacko imagery, while fascinating in places (the doves, the locusts), tends to get a little TOO wacko, to the point where you can't help laughing (the hypnosis machine, Richard Burton putting out a fire with a wooden crutch, James Earl Jones spitting up a tomato).\n\nIf you can accept the fact that this is a completely different movie than the original, you might find that it's a pretty good movie on its own. Fantastic acting from Burton, a wonderful score, and some truly gorgeous visuals, especially the climactic scene in the house, make it one of the most underrated movies of all time. Even if some scenes leave you falling over with laughter."

It really is 180 degrees from its suspenseful predecessor. I've read reviews from critics that hated Richard Burton's performance, saying that he was awfully over-the-top. I actually feel that Burton's performance is one of the film's strong points. Despite the goofy plot, he maintains a straight face. And after reading that he was drunk during part of the shoot, it's pretty impressive that he can deliver such a convincing performance. The rest of the cast is good as well. Linda Blair looks cute as a button. But at nearly two hours, the movie goes on way too long. What else can I say? This movie is just plain dull! I stopped following the plot after a while, not because it got too complicated, but because I didn't care anymore. Let's just say that I just finished watching the movie a couple days ago, and it's already on sale on Amazon.com. That alone shows you how much I appreciate this movie. (3 out of 10)"

Lamont discover the demon Pazuzu resides inside Regan and he goes to Africa to search for a cure from Kokumo (James Earl Jones).\n\nThe higher they climb, the farther they fall. There is an obvious way to make the sequel to Exorcist. This is not it. There is nothing scary. It's trying to explain the Exorcist rather than making a bigger Exorcist. The hypnotist machine is laughable and flattens the movie. The African story is muddled and drags. It may be teaching more about locus than anything else. The locus POV is also somewhat laughable. This is simply wrong in so many ways."

But oh how bad it is.\n\nPazuzu, the demon who terrorized young Regan MacNeil in the classic predecessor, has become essentially a giant grasshopper that drives locusts, and apparently entire film studios, mad. Linda Blair must have been truly possessed to have rendered such a heinous performance. She actually may be the worst actress alive. And nothing, not even the massive talent squandered on so thin a story, can redeem this hopelessly lost horror of a movie.\n\nIt's four years later, and what does she remember? Apparently everything except how to act. It would be 17 years before anyone attempted another sequel, but 1990's Exorcist III is infinitely better. My suggestion: pretend this one doesn't exist, and enjoy the trilogy, minus one."

        "review_detailed_main": "Unlike many other cinema fanatics, I don't necessarily consider William Friedkin's \"the Exorcist\" an absolute masterpiece but at least it kept me fascinated throughout its entire playtime. I really had to struggle my way through this lousy sequel and it might easily be the most redundant film ever made. Due to a combination of several unfortunate aspects, this film is a complete failure but it hurts to see that a few, really good, aspects are completely lost, like the outstanding Ennio Morricone score and the ambitious skills of scriptwriter William Goodhart. Far too ambitious, actually. For some incomprehensible reason, the plot of this sequel focuses on unraveling the events of the original, expanding the terror's origin with environmental influences and occult African rites. Father Lamont (played by Richard Burton) is burdened with the investigation of Father Merrin's last exorcism (the one on young Regan, which cost him his life) and discovers that there's still a battle between good and evil going on inside Regan's body. The premise might sound okay but the elaboration is far too complex, incoherent and even downright uninteresting. The stupidity of several far-fetched themes results in very ridiculous lines and several \"WTF\"-sequences. \"I will spit out a leopard\"? What the hell does that mean? What's even worse is that the \"horror\" is totally ignored. Exorcist II is a completely bloodless film that doesn't even features some obscenity or grim moments. Say whatever you want about story-driven horror films, but a project that completely avoids action or gore is doomed to fail no matter how massive the cast and budget are. Speaking about the cast: I rarely saw a film that starred so many big names and delivered so few intrigue. Richard Burton overacts terribly while Louise Fletcher doesn't seem to care about the lines she's driveling. In fact, why would she care because even director John Boorman seems frustrated over this job? Many little details featuring in the movie actually show that Boorman regrets not having made the original in 1973, which would have provided him with an immortal status. The only decent performance is given by Linda Blair who \u0096 by the way \u0096 looks gorgeous here in her teenage years. She's sexy and cherubic looking at the same time and her appearance distracts you a little from the dreadful wholesome that is this film. Very much NOT recommended, folks!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The excellent and competent film maker John Boorman had the hard responsibility to make a sequence which should have the same (or superior) quality of the first film, and even not achieving to give us a memorable work, he deserves to be applauded by having made a touching, although a bit slow in some moments, thriller. \"The Exorcist 2\" is a truly super production, with the best special effects the money could buy at the time (1977), and we notice that in each technical aspect: the cinematography, the photography and the sound track give the notion of the movie's magnitude, but even so the result didn't get to supplant the quality of the first of the series initiated by William Friedkin. Who is more talented, Friedkin or Boorman?hard to say, but lets remember that Friedkin made the first one with little money. Famous terror films generally generate sequences, and sometimes, the sequences overcome the original, it is more than enough to remind of the \"Hellraiser\" case , that, in 1988, had a better, more violent and cruel continuation, called \"Hellbound: Hellraiser 2\" (and, as \"The Exorcist\", the film was conducted by a new director, in this case, Tony Randel, who replaced Clive barker). In spite of great part of the \"Hellbound Hellraiser 2\" success derive of the fact of the memorable performances,such as the ones of the English actress Clare Higgins (playing perverse J\u00falia) and William Hope (as the young and brilliant dr. Kyle MacRae), the film, as well as \"The Exorcist 2\", overflows a rich and breath taking visual, but the script helped a lot. In the case of \"The Exorcist 2\",the plot didn't have the same psychological study and the character's depth of \"Hellbound: Hellraiser 2\" but a confused and undecided story.The great John Boorman should receive a medal: he really made everything that he could to offer a good show. The performances, excellent, come from Richard Burton, Linda Blair and Louise Fletcher. Ned Beatty is also in the film, interpreting an entertaining pilot. Beatty, an excellent actor in any role, works for the second time with Boorman, they made \"Deliverance\" together. Don't make a mistake, because \"The Exorcist 2\" is not the terrible film that the people comment, but a confused continuation, without defined objective, of one of the greatest Hollywood's successes ,but even so, the work of Boorman deserves to be seen, for its brilliant performances and for some good frights!!"

I recommend this movie to most fans.\n\n7/10 ~*StaRz*~"

Sure, the film is by no means great, but it runs competently enough especially compared to other film sequels in the genre and by no means feels like it should be labelled things such as \"Worst Film Ever\".\n\nThere is a decent soundtrack to this film and there are some nice visual shots and locations and everything cuts and flows nicely. The acting and direction are not dreadful, although a little shaky at times. It feels like it has some of the main ingredients to making a good horror film. However the storyline itself lets it down, as well as the film not actually being scary. It would be almost impossible for the sequel to one of the most controversial films of all time to be just as good. But it seems expectations are unrealistic.\n\nFirstly, the whole idea of the hypnosis machine was ludicrous. At one point Father Lamont and the doctor were plugged into Regan's thoughts via the machine when Regan herself was not. Also there was no need to give Regan supernatural healing powers or for there to be a Regan double. In fact Regan herself is not the real victim here and is shown that despite the possession to be walking around with no problems, it does not seem like the same demon from the first film. , and the whole locust thing is a bit lame. I guess you could argue that these points are why this is a terrible film but they merely make it an OK film.\n\nI have seen this film twice now and I was slightly entertained. There is some cheesy dialogue in the film, my favourite probably being the one quoted at the start, but I do not feel anything about this film embarrasses itself. It is alright to kill some time. Some points are quite funny but not over the top like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, and nowhere near as bad as some other horror films.\n\nMy advice is, if you like horror sequels then this is a competent run through of a well known story and is worth watching if you are wanting to watch every film in the franchise, topped off with a nice soundtrack.\n\nIf you are not really a fan of this sort of thing, but you loved The Exorcist and are hoping for the same thrills you got from watching that film, you will not find it here.\n\nRating: 5."

It has none of the awe-inspiring scenes from the original and instead relies on lacklustre acting and sub-standard puppets to scare. The only thing barely chilling are the flashbacks from the original considering the action scenes in this one look as though they were shot in a blender.\n\nThis story is about Regan (Linda Blair) four years later who has no recollection of the demonic presence who possessed her in the first film. Since she doesn't have the bloodied make-up on when the devil starts squatting her mind, it's hard to tell whether her zombified acting is part of her performance or not. Unfortunately she uses her own coarse vocals in this one making the original demon's voice seem soothing and giving her no finesse when she babbles those colourless lines. For some reason, unexplained, she goes to Dr. Gene (Louise Fletcher), a psychiatrist even though she continually states she has no problem. So Doctor Gene uses her magical hypnosis machine. Which is a box with two light bulbs and two dogleashes attached to it. So Regan and the good doctor put on their dogleashes, round their heads, and stare at the pretty blinking lights for an hour (no time elapsed) before getting lost into a deep trance where she is lucky enough to see herself in the former movie. Regan comes out of the ordeal fine but doctor Gene who gets her heart squeezed, suffers from a cardiac arrest and sees someone violently killed emerges completely fine and still doesn't believe Regan was possessed. Just one of the abysmal scenes and an example of dismal characterisation. The whole monosyllabic script seems as though it was written by a senile old man who continually forgets he just said the same thing 5 minutes ago. Father Lamont (Richard Burton) comes into the picture as the priest who harasses Regan insisting she's the devil. He- like any other logical person would do, goes to Africa to find the demon who thinks is within Regan, more script flaws (if there was one). Regan remains balmy, Father Lamont is stupefied after every pointless event and Dr. Gene gets more skeptical as increasingly bizarre things happen. I guess it is scarcely scary, I mean Linda Blair dances in it, the (hardly) special effects are horrifyingly bad and the ending will put you into tears upon the realisation that you actually paid to see this atrocity.\n\nP.S.

This looked like it was written by a committee of accountants. (Nothing personal against accountants, I am one. I also know I have no business writing a script.) Richard Burton was one of the best actors of his generation. If you based his career on this movie, you would have thought him a hack. He might have needed the cash and therefore just slept his way through this. I recommend avoiding this unless you have a thing for pain. Linda Blair went on to a career that seemingly matched the quality of this movie. Yes, this movie is scary, but not in a good way. It is scary they actually released this."

        "review_detailed_main": "Linda Blair reprises her role as Regan in \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic.\" Directed by John Boorman, the film finds everybody's favorite possessed little-girl growing up as a teen. Now under the care of a nurturing psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) and Sharon (Kitty Winn), her live-in nanny from the first film, while her mother is away (a.k.a. Ellen Burstyn didn't want to do the flick), Regan leads a seemingly normal life until a priest (Richard Burton) sent to investigate the events of the first film shows up and stirs her inner demons. Slowly but surely, Regan becomes aware of some new-found powers and a connection to the past that leads the film into Africa, where it all began.\n\nForever cursed as an inferior sequel, \"The Heretic\" is no doubt subpar compared to the first, but that's not to say that the film is not without its merits. Fact of the matter is that the film is host to several solid performances in its cast, most notably Linda Blair, who plays a very charming and very likable teenaged version of her signature character. Louise Fletcher, who had won an Oscar for playing the cruel and unusual Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" one year prior, does a complete 180 and anchors the film with heart and compassion. Like Ellen Burstyn in the original, you believe she loves and has a bond with Regan. Richard Burton is solid as the troubled Father Lamont and you'll spot a young James Earl Jones as well as Max Von Sydow, also returning from the first film.\n\nThe film's biggest problem is in its script, which, aside from not making sense at times, doesn't give its characters much to do. The first half of the film is fleshed out rather well and even takes the opportunity to dip into the past, almost like a prequel to the first (27 years later, two very mixed up prequels would emerge) but by the time the film reaches its conclusion, the story comes unraveled with an ending that flat out stinks and has little to no relevancy to the rest of the film. It's a shame, really, as some solid characters are established and the film seems bound and determined to destroy their credibility. The direction by Boorman can't be blamed. The man turns in a solid show and it is obviously the story \u2013 which was reportedly re-written five times, that serves as the film's downfall. Apparently, even in the 1970's, horror films fell victim to studio interference.\n\nWhile it attempts to reach the class of the original film, it ultimately fails. In the end, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is a film whose ideas are more interesting than its execution. You'll enjoy seeing some familiar faces and nods to the original, and while it's certainly not a terrible film by any means, it is one that simply can't hold a candle to its original."

Gene Tuskin was much different in this movie than in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (where she played the sadistic Nurse Ratched).

There are rumors going around in the church that Father Merrin was in fact a devil worshiper. Father Lamont has had it with the exorcism business feeling that there's nothing that he, or anyone else, can do to stop the spread of \"Evil\" in the world. Still Lamont goes to NYC to see Ragen and if she has the ability to battle Satan's evil forces.\n\nAs former African tribesman and now scientist and expert on the African Desert Locust Dr. KoKumo (James Earl Ray) told Father Lamont later in the film that Ragen can keep the locusts, the agents of Satan and his top man Pazuzu, from brushing their wings. Thus preventing Pazuza from turning them into gluttonous crop eating locusts into happy-go-lucky and harmless grasshoppers. What else can be said or added to this interesting observation that Dr. Kokumo tells us? the story about the \"Grasshopper and the Ant\"?\n\nFather Lamont becomes obsessed with this idea of using Regan as the catalyst to destroy Pazuzu and his hoards after he went to Africa after hearing Dr. Kokumo revelation. Lamont is so carried away with his obsession he's almost killed by a group of Africian villages for suspecting him of being in league with the Devil. Lamont meeting Dr. Kokumo has convinced him that Regan being the human version of the good female locust who can turn the \"Evil\" locusts into \"Friendly\" grasshoppers. Back in New York an almost deranged and driven Father Lamont is going to put Dr. Kokum's theory into practice!\n\nThe ending of the movie \"The Exorcist Part II\" is really too much with Father Lamont having it out with the \"Evil\" Regan who tries to seduce him and thus become corrupted by her. Meanwhile the good Regan, both parts played by Miss. Blair, just stands there on a ledge wondering what she's doing in the movie. As the battle between good and evil begins millions upon millions of locusts swarm all over the city of Washington D.C. All the action centers around the closed down and shuttered house where the exorcism of Regan took place four years ago.\n\nThe scene with Father Lamont and the \"Evil\" Regan having it out in her bedroom is just too off the wall to watch without cracking up. Lamont looked as if he were drugged or drunk and acted as if he were a zombie throughout most the film. Lamont battling and ripping the \"Evil\" Regan's heart out has to be one of the most outrageous and ridicules scenes ever put on a movie screen. There's an even funnier scene earlier in the movie where Father Lamont and Regan had both their brains electronically synchronized, in a cheap hotel room in Washington Heights! This brainless action was done so that Lamont & Regan could think alike in order to combat Pazuzu and his boss the one and only \"Big Man\" himself Satan.\n\nRichard Burton looks completely out of his head in most of his scenes in the film. I wondered if after making the movie Burton accelerated his drinking just to forget that he ever made it and thus also accelerated his untimely and early death in 1984 at the age of 59.\n\nLinda Blair was a real knockout even at the early age of 17. It's no wonder that after she survived from that disaster of a movie Linda became famous for playing roles of sexy frisky and hard hitting young women who can give as good as they take from the same as well as opposite sex in films like \"Roller Boogie\" and \"Savage Streets\".\n\nAcadamy Adward Winning Actress Louise Fletcher, who played young Regan's psychiatrist and friend Dr. Gene Tuskin, also survived the movie, more or less, with her reputation still in tact. Fletcher happily got the roles in future films that her fine talents called for. Even more encouraging her role in \" The Exorcist Part II\" is almost totally forgotten by most of the movie going public.\n\n\"The Exorcist Part II\" was voted by both critics and movie goers alike the worst movie of 1977. Watching it today, some thirty years later, the only thing wrong with that opinion is that it's not just the worst movie of that year, 1977, but very possibly one the worst movie of all times."

        "review_detailed_main": "I liked this when it came out and I still do. The bad press on it began immediately, and all the reviewers jumped on the bandwagon; only one of the reviews seemed to correlate with what showed on the screen. I think the time was wrong for mysticism, and maybe for religion: the sixties had ended, and the mode of fantasy then in favor was space fantasy, full of technical detail. A couple of decades later, the climate is different: \"Stigmata\", which has a story not unlike that of \"Exorcist II,\" and looks and feels so much like it that it might almost be the same film with different actors morphed in, didn't get good reviews but wasn't laughed out of theatres either.\n\nMost of the people who like \"Exorcist II\" tend not to have liked \"Exorcist I\" much, and vice versa. Blatty himself said in one interview that it didn't work because the director was a Protestant, and in another interview that it was because he wasn't a believer. To me the second film shows more spiritual feeling than the first, but no interest at all in the Church, and maybe in some minds that equates to unreligiousness.\n\nThe first \"Exorcist\" purported to be about possession, but most of its imagery was of a young girl being raped: by her mother's party guests, by doctors, by priests, by a crucifix. \"Exorcist II\" actually is about possession, among other things, and culminates in the interesting idea (excised after release but later restored on video and DVD) that people who have been possessed and purged of evil can go forth to heal all the others who are similarly afflicted. I happen to think that's an inspiring idea for a story.\n\nBut then I like mystical thrillers, and apparently most filmgoers don't--or didn't then. The first \"Exorcist\" was not one; this is. The images in the first film, when they don't involve repulsive bodily detail, have no metaphysical resonance; they're relentlessly physical, often sexual, and when the demon itself appears, it's in the form of the actual, literal statue. By contrast the images in \"Exorcist II\" have deliberate metaphysical implications. I doubt that they were worked out thoroughly; it's more as if Boorman were playing with them, in the same way he lets the light play through the stylized sets and behind the actors. The scenes of possession capture the sense of historical accounts of the phenomenon more than those in the first film, which is too much distracted by physical threat and sexual aberration.\n\nLike \"Exorcist II\" or no, take it seriously or no, I was and am puzzled why more people were unable to enjoy its appeal to the eye and the ear (the music was pretty too), let alone to the imagination. I think perhaps they couldn't allow themselves to enjoy it: that they had to deride it and be seen to deride it because what it said, or the way in which it was said, was something that they had just learned to reject or that contradicted something they had just learned to believe.\n\nIt must be admitted that the film is unsatisfactory dramatically. The fantastic incidents of the first film, besides being reduced to the most prosaic physical terms, were fitted within a sequence of conventional, punchy, easily playable scenes; one cared about Ellen Burstyn's problems in a movieish way, and through her Linda Blair's. In the sequel Blair doesn't have the scenes to play, and her inexperience as an actress keeps one from feeling involved with her; Burton is better, but his dialogue doesn't communicate the spiritual dilemma he's undergoing. The excitements of the narrative tend rather to distract from this also. But I found them fun in their own right, and the film as well, apart from the occasional gratuitous shock for shock's sake: fun for the mind and the fancy."

A sequel to this masterpiece had lots of risks. Usually sequels are not as good as the originals but at least it should keep the audience happy to consider them a successful movie at best. This one failed big time because of the massive expectations and enormous success of the original. The Heretic, by all means, is not a bad horror film. If it was an original probably people would have rated it around 5.5 maybe 6 at most but after The Exorcist this was / is a terrible sequel to the original. It had some great horror elements but overall far from being a sequel to the scariest movie of all time. The only good thing that shines with this film was the soundtrack. Even the Ennio Morricone's great music was of course not enough to save this movie. Richard Burton had everything the main character of this movie should not have. He just wasn't believable in this role. They probably tried to hire a star of that time but I think he was one of the reasons why the movie failed. An unknown would have worked in this role and just maybe people would not hate the film. Once again the Exorcist II: The Heretic was not a bad horror film. It was just a terrible sequel that was doomed to fail from the beginning."

I guess it was unreasonable to think that even trying to do a sequel to one of the greatest horror movies of all time was just a non-starter. It was so bad that I refuse to watch another sequel, prequel, or anything else trying to make money off the name of the original epic film.

That's all I have to say for the positives for this movie. Now, it's time to criticize the people who didn't do their job right.\n\nNegatives for Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977): The main plot of this movie is unbelievably incompetent and stupid. I don't understand why this doctor is forcing Regan to remember the events of the first movie, it's never explained why this is happening and the movie expects me to go with that idea. The movie is also not scary and instead everything comes off as unintentional comedy except I wasn't laugh, I was angry and yelling at the screen. The inclusion of the locust is really stupid and it was annoying seeing these things on screen. Also, why is James Earl Jones in this movie, this came out the same year as Star Wars (1977). The effects are garbage and while I understand this is from the 70s, it doesn't matter to me because I was annoyed with the rest of this movie, so I am going to complain about it. And finally, the climax of this movie is one of the dumbest things I've seen in my entire life.\n\nOverall, Exorcist II: The Heretic is a blatant insult to the original, it's an insult to horror and an insult to the world of cinema.

What a great way for ruining its reputation, with such a terrible and awful sequel! There are even much worse sequels out there (SON OF THE MASK, all of the POLICE ACADEMY movies, the last two JAWS movies are the prime examples) but judging on the badness of this movie that it's not a glowing endorsement!\n\nEXORCIST 2 THE HERETIC hasn't got any redeeming quality at all. The direction by John Boorman, who is among the best directors of 1970s' thrillers, was close to asinine. The acting is pretty terrible, especially by Richard Burton that does nothing but overact all the time and behaving nastily. Louise Fletcher lacks charisma at all, and even James Earl Jones' performance and a small Max Von Sydow cameo (for giving us the connection between this film and its predecessor) couldn't have saved this movie at all, because their characters are so badly written that both Jones and Von Sydow look very bored and disengaged as well. And the soundtrack is very creepy and nightmare inducing, and then there was the scene of the african plains with that shrilling scream that was so painful to hear that I felt like my head was exploding!!! I am serious when I say that this is one of the few movies that caused me pain and it was fault of the movie!\n\nThis movie has all the ingredients for a truly awful and dreadful movie: badly acted, poorly directed, written by a Jack Russell and with many scenes that make no sense whatsoever. No wonder this movie bombed and it was panned by EVERYONE at the time (including the critics and the few that liked the original THE EXORCIST in 1973) and also it's not a true sequel and a substandard movie as well!"

Not that this would make any difference neither in this world nor to the opinion that you people already have about this film. As a viewer I had a \"deja vue\" when the grasshopper flew over Africa, but that's personal. Rationally, this film had far more intelligent ideas than the first one. The first one was loud, impressive, perfect directed and had a magic unexplainable power, but it's only story was a freaked out minor who did crazy things. Why was she possessed? Who was that spirit? Who was father Merrin? etc etc was never answered to the first one. They just gave us some clues, but we never saw what really happened. We just believed whatever the characters were saying. In the sequel, which is more a normal film than a horror film, they gave us answers; and very interesting ones. So this minor is a very powerful human. She represents the good. The grasshoppers represent the evil. When they touch each other they stick and their personality changes. They become angry and perform evil acts. That minor has the power to separate the grasshoppers and turn them back to their normal behavior, preventing them from being evil. That example works, clearly, for us humans. As we know wars happen by a person who changes the normal behavior of a big group of people, i.e. Nazi's, and makes them evil. A minor like the character in the sequel would go inside that group of people (like an opinion leader??), and bring them back to their normal behavior. And that explains why it's the devil inside her and not just another spirit. She's THAT strong! And the concept of: \"if U touch my wings U are now mine\" it's so realistic of what is going on in our everyday, I think. It actually means: \"if you are evil for once you stay evil forever, there's no way back\". Which means that the hardest part i.e. is to lie for the first time, then you're a liar forever etc. etc. And visually, the travelogue in the sequel was so much more exciting and beautiful, I think... And I loved this machine that the psychiatrist had, and it's sound!\n\nWell, that's what I think and sorry for my English... they're my second language :-) BTW I'm a graduate film student; I guess all U guys will never see my films :-( Have a great day!"

The first time I saw it I didn't understand nothing because I kept thinking about the events of the original movie. You know what I mean. How come the writers never mentioned the character of father Karras??? he was the one who actually saved Regan. And why the movie is called The Heretic?? Who commit heresy? Father Merrin?? Why?? He was given permission by the Church to conduct the exorcism. There's lots of questions unanswered. So, I figured it out that maybe if I could somehow ignored the first movie I could appreciate this one. And it kind of work for me. I thought of the movie as a supernatural drama instead of a horror one, because, to be honest, it never scared me(except for the part when they are trying out the synchronizer and the possessed Reagan appears). Another reason why I liked this movie was because Louise fletcher was here and she's one of my favorite actresses and her character as Dr Gene Tuskin was the best performance of the movie, in opposition to that of Richard Burton and Linda Blair, who were ridiculous and annoying but... hey, it's not their fault, remember? So, toned down your expectations and if you want ( or can), follow my idea. You may find this piece-of-shi_t-movie it's not so bad... ...Somehow."

It almost feels like a Dario Argento film (Dario was probably influenced by this movie when he made PHENOMENA).\n\nThe really BAD:\n\nThe acting: everyone is terrible. Linda Blair is the worst of the bunch.\n\nThe script: it doesn't make much sense and it's pretty much pointless, certainly compared to the first movie. The characters are never defined and we never know anything about anyone.\n\nThe dialogue: howlingly bad! Pazuzu! Kokumo! Kokumo! Pazuzu!\n\nThe direction: I'm sure John Boorman's intentions for this sequel to the first blockbuster were honest. I'm certain he wanted to create this amazingly phantasmagoric horror film with over-the-top visuals and ideas. Unfortunately, not much of it works.\n\nThe catastrophically UGLY:\n\nCasting Richard Burton as a priest: one of the worst bits of casting ever. Burton doesn't look like a Catholic priest. He's looks like someone who had too much of a \"good\" life. Also, casting an actor who made movies in the 1940s, 1950s was wrong. They should have looked for someone who was more contemporary. The effect of having an old-fashion movie star Burton in a crazy contemporary dream-like horror film is jarring! It just doesn't work.\n\nThe ending: after Burton finds Kokumo, what little sense or semblance of quality the movie vanish in a blink of an eye. When everyone heads back to the house where the first movie took place, the film is totally derailed beyond repair. It's really bad and makes me wonder what were they thinking. When we see evil Blair dressed up in Fredericks of Hollywood lingerie and vamping it out and trying to be sexy, the whole film (and even the first movie) is hurt by the extreme cheesiness of it all. The good thing about the first movie was the total lack of cheesiness about it. It felt authentic. Never \"Hollywoodish\". Well, not the ending of the sequel. If Evil Blair in EXORCIST II had remained like the ugly possessed one we saw in the first movie and not the sexy vampy one, the ending might have been a tad better but making Blair sexy in order to turn on celibate Burton is just too silly for words. The house falling apart and the swarm of locusts coming to Washington was okay but it added nothing to the whole thing. What's really funny is that with the car crashing in the fence, the house crumbling and the locusts swarm buzzing all about, you'd think some of the neighbors would have noticed something. Also, what happens to Regan and Father Lamont? Where do they go?\n\nThe ending in EXORCIST II is truly bad and sends this John Boorman flick in the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE category. It's the most unintentionally hilarious ending ever conceived for the silver screen.\n\nAnd it's a shame because as bad as the ending is, there are some startlingly original moments in the first hour which have actually influenced movies and filmmakers up to this day. The dream-like quality seen in EXORCIST II feels very contemporary and after watching it recently, it made me realise how influential that approach was. Unfortunately, the film is not really scary and the plethora of bad and disastrous aspects in EXORCIST II nearly eclipse the few good qualities it has."

John Boorman's Exorcist II, on the other hand, is ALL waffle. As horror sequels go, this is easily one of the worst, an overly talky effort that does away with the shocking content of the original in favour of a pseudo 'scientific bunkum meets spiritual clap-trap' approach that is both utterly confusing and extremely boring, leaving the viewer longing for a 360 degree head rotation or a torrent of pea soup.\n\nRichard Burton is the star of this disaster, playing Father Philip Lamont, who is given the task of investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow); Burton is joined by Louise Fletcher as psychologist Dr. Gene Tuskin who is attempting to delve into the subconscious of Regan (Linda Blair), who might be still be under the influence of demon Pazuzu. All three central performances are uniformly awful, although at least Blair lights up the screen with her cherubic good looks.\n\n1/10, plus one extra point for James Earl Jones dressed up a locust, the New York high rise apartment with massive gaps in its balcony railings, and Dr. Tuskin's mind synchroniser, which consists of a pair of pulsating desk lamps and some rubber head straps with wires on.

        "review_detailed_main": "When The Exorcist managed to cram patrons into seats despite its rather adult-oriented nature, Warner Brothers were quick to develop a sequel. Unfortunately, most of those involved in the original did not want a bar of the sequel, and so a new director plus screenwriter had to be hired. According to estimates, fourteen million 1977 dollars were spent on this sequel. At that time, it was the single most expensive film that Warners had put together. Nowadays, the film is a staple of the bad film culture, with sites devoting masses of space to mocking the results. Oddly enough, the film supposedly made a profit at the box office, but not enough of one to compare with its (overrated) predecessor. Certainly not enough to even draw comparison to the surprise hit that Fox and Lucasfilm cooked up together that year. But Exorcist II was not without its impact. Blair's career, such as it was, never recovered, and writer William Goodhart was only able to sell one more screenplay three years later.\n\nLinda, for her part, acts very solidly with material that not even the worst soap opera star should have to endure. According to what she has said, Richard Burton started out sober on the film, but progressively became more and more intoxicated as the film rolled on. Perhaps he saw the impact this monstrosity would have on his career and decided to drown his sorrows in advance. The scenes with the so-called synchroniser, a piece of film prop designed to go down in infamy, make it all too clear the actors knew they were making crap. These sequences, in which a mass of ignorance regarding psychiatry and hypnosis is displayed, will probably haunt Goodhart and director John Boorman for all eternity. Granted, portraying these concepts in film was at a childish level then, but even audiences of the late 1970s knew better than to not mock this rubbish. Apparently, the reaction from the audience at the premiere was so strong that Boorman cut seven minutes out of the film in the hopes it would go over better. Since none of those seven minutes involve the \"synchroniser\"... well, you get the idea.\n\nEspecially funny is a moment when Regan prompts an autistic girl to speak to her. Maybe in America, the concept of not being able to speak was linked with autism, but in today's world where individuals who could speak and read at adult levels when toddling are finding out they are on the spectrum, it just adds more to the unintentional comedy factor. Also adding to the fun are scenes in which Richard Burton is wandering around in what appears to be Africa, trying to make sense of scenes in which few, if any, of his castmates speak English. Maybe these scenes are where future producers got the idea for the Wookiee sequences in the Star Wars Holiday Special. It is clear that these scenes saw the beginning of Burton's decision to give up and drink his way through the film. James Earl Jones signs up for the Embarrassed Actor league in this film, informing Burton at one point that if Pazuzu comes for him, he (Jones) will spit a leopard. I only wish I were making that up. Just as well for him that his other project in 1977 associated him with the most fearsome villain the big screen ever saw.\n\nThis explains why Jones is the only alumni from Exorcist II to have ever enjoyed solid, uninterrupted work since 1977. One can put him in a bad film, but he will rise to the occasion of making his character among the most memorable. Its just unfortunate that he is swimming against the tide of a film that attempts to create a conflict between a monotheistic god and the science that is the source of all improvement in the human condition that has occurred during the past hundred or so years. Is the implication of the previously-mentioned scene meant to be that this god can cure autism? Maybe the autistic civil rights movement is only getting started some thirty years after this crock was released, but that does not make the fact that those of us on the spectrum who can speak for ourselves will not be hesitant to tell this normalistic god where he can put his cure. While I am thinking of it, I do not wish to understand what acting in this film must have done to the eyes of its cast. With my hypersensitive vision, every scene with the \"synchroniser\" is giving me a rotten headache.\n\nTranslate all of the above to the following. Many things have been blamed for the critical failure of Exorcist II, but the party most at fault is the script. Goodhart throws a ton of mystical concepts from faith healing to voodoo (or whatever they are trying to demonstrate in this film) at the viewer, and the sad fact is that none of it sticks. Put simply, the film cannot make up its mind what it wants to be. In some moments, it even gives the impression of copping the X-Men comic books of the era, and not very well at that. The bad writing even extends into individual reactions that make no sense in context of the action and situation that prompts them. I realise this is unrelated to the writing, but the back projections for scenes in cars are also downright hilarious. Would it really have been that expensive to shoot in a real car, driving down a real street? Or to make gates that look like they are made from real iron and stone for that matter? Nothing in the film is convincing, and it almost makes one feel sad for the human element. Almost.\n\nFor that reason, more than anything, I gave Exorcist II a one out of ten. If stupidity is currency in Hollywood, then the makers of Exorcist II are analogous to Donald Trump."

Which is gorgeous. Which (some of it, anyway) is inspired by the flying sequences in Murnau's underrated \"Faust,\" only in gloriously amber color, as if Boorman smeared honey on his lenses.\n\nThe film is a great something--sometimes I think a monumental sick joke on religion, sometimes I think a fantastic film-making experiment that you shouldn't (for the sake of your sanity) take too seriously. It's Boorman turning the theological bull Blatty (appropriate name, I think) spouted in the original picture into something that resembles science fiction--a scientifically workable theory on the nature of evil, no less."

Though I've never really warmed to John Boorman I did find Exorcist II to be his most interesting film.\n\nAs a sequel it's thematically detached from the first and creates it's own new mythology and imagery. The events from Exorcist are referenced extensively and Regan, now 17, has multiple flashbacks to her bedroom. Father Lamont, a rogue priest played by Richard Burton, investigates the case in an effort to find out what really happened to Father Merrin by involving himself in Regan's therapy sessions. A muddled plot about curbing the spread of evil and the divinity of our teenage heroine fills up the rest of the film with regular cutaways to Africa where Lamont researches the recent history of Pazuzu (not the Devil, as most believe).\n\nNothing, repeat NOTHING in this film is even remotely intelligible. Towards the end there are dozens of unexplained elements. On top that there is some hilariously stupid dialogue. How did some of this stuff get approval? I would flat out refuse to say \"Oh, I was possessed by a demon. But it's okay, he's gone now,\" upon meeting a new friend. When the credits finally roll you'll be scratching your head, unable to make head nor tail of what you've just witnessed.\n\nWhat it does have going for it however is absolutely stunning photography. Only a few 70s set designs date this film aesthetically. The shots of African sunsets and the rock churches are amazing and the general dark, silhouetted appearance of the dialogue scenes create a wonderful, moody atmosphere.\n\nIt's a shame that Linda Blair's career collapsed after this. After getting involved in several bad relationships her acting career went down the toilet and she's never starred in anything as up-market as this ever since. She's such a cutie in Exorcist II and, as a bonus, hardly ever wears a bra.\n\nAs a sequel to a classic it's a bit of a let down, but as a stand-alone weirdo melodrama it's nothing if not interesting. Do check it out, but keep in mind everything I just said."

Many people consider this film to be the worst movie sequel ever made. I didn't think \"Exorcist II\" was that bad, but it's nowhere near as good as its predecessor. Linda Blair returns as Regan, the girl who was possessed by the Devil in the original 1973 classic. Here she's still bothered by the horrible things that happened to her when she was living in Georgetown, Washington D.C. Fearing that the demon will possess her once again, psychiatrist Louise Fletcher and priest Richard Burton try to help her while Burton wants to find out what happened to Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow), the ill-fated priest who tried to exorcise the foul-mouthed demon out of Regan in the first movie. Some scenes in \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" are interesting. Some are preposterous. Much of the dialogue is laughable (especially Burton's continuous ramblings about \"evil\"), and parts of the movie don't make sense. The special effects are good, and Ennio Morricone's music score is very effective (It would have been nice if they could have replayed the eerie \"Tubular Bells\" theme from the first film). But I think the main problem with \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is that it's not real scary. \"The Exorcist\" was a film that scared the pants off of me when I first saw it, and after seeing it again recently on the big screen, I was still jolted by many of its disturbing images as well as one new one (the \"spiderwalk\"). This film is pretty much devoid of chills and that's disappointing. Also, the performances here aren't as strong as they were in the first one. But I give the filmmakers credit for trying something different instead of doing a retread of the original. I think \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" needed a better script. It has some good moments, but it's not enough.\n\n** (out of four)"

Next to her comes the veteran Richard Burton, in the role of an unconvincing Catholic priest. In fact, he was already drowned in alcoholism in the same way that Blair might no longer be unknown to drugs. There is no merit in the support cast, no use talking. The script should have been used as toilet paper before the movie was shot. Everything that could be stuck in the film ended up appearing, invariably ridiculous, forced and pitiful: from obvious allusions to the hippies (watch costumes, for example) to an absurd story involving an African tribe, not to mention that box with strobe lights which left the person hypnotized. To make the salad more complete only the aliens and medieval knights were lacking. Can we offer this film to Pazuzu, to see if he takes the movie away for good?"

        "review_detailed_main": "I found Exorcist 11 The Heretic was quite a good horror film , despite what other people think. The story is about a woman called Gene Tuskin works with troubled children, but none more troubled than Regan MacNeil, (Linda Blair) who suffers from bad dreams and memories. The memories are of the time that she was possessed by a demon. Dr. Tuskin has an invention, a device that hypnotises two persons and links their minds together, and it reveals that the demon, named Pazuzu, still lurks within her, Ready to emerge again. Meanwhile, Father Lamont is ordered by his cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin, the priest who died while performing an exorcism on Regan. He undertakes the task He also feels that Evil is an entity and that it is winning the battle over Good. His investigation makes him go to Africa and he learns something terrible about locusts. I thought that the film was quite good even though there are a lot of comments saying that it was not. It was hard to be like the original which was a masterpiece. 5/10"

The screenplay is the pits, the acting is horrid (Richard Burton is obviously drunk throughout the film, and Louise Fletcher is about as warm and yielding as a morgue table.) But, the sets are magnificent, Ennio Morricone's score is perfect and beautiful, the cinamatography is top notch, and Boorman does pretty well despite being saddled with a silly story. One of my favorite guilty pleasures."

        "review_detailed_main": "Having a terrible stigma of being one of the worst follow ups to a horror classic, film critics and fans alike, have torn The Heretic apart for many years. Exorcist II does warrant this criticism but has some features done right by the director and producers. Let's start off by saying the film does have a poorly, mindless written plot along with a lot of the scenes being rather dull. The hypnosis machine and traveling within minds is a laughable and lazy attempt to add an \"interesting\" futuristic feel. Another fail is the scenes in Africa, which don't really make a whole lot of sense and add very little to Regan's story. Frightening moments and death scenes were very limited too.\n\nWith a hefty list of negative aspects to the film, one thing done right was casting previous major players, Linda Blair as Regan, Max von Sydow as Merrin, and Kitty Winn as Sharon. The lead roles of Louise Fletcher and Richard Burton were also solid additions and put forth a good character. Perhaps the biggest get was Ennio Morricone on the side of composing the film's music which was fantastic during the introduction's credits. All in all, the film was a below mediocre project to one of the most notorious horror films and should probably be skipped, as the first and third are better suited together."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why that bad? I liked this movie even more than first one (although it has a very high quality which had not been matched by any sequel) but I liked the different style of this one, with an interesting metaphysics background and the emotional evolution of the first movie's characters, especially Regan, not a possessed girl anymore but a feminine Messiah. I think the movie has some failures in its execution, with some cheesy scenes and dialogs and some overacted performances, especially Richard Burton. But the final result is amazing. I like the feeling of the African sceneries and that music theme sounding when Linda Blair is on scene. This movie has a positive feeling; it's the Good, opposite to the Evil shown in the first. It suggests that the Evil goes after good people (the nurse who heals the sick, Regan that seems to be special), and I like that idea. I think people didn't understand or didn't like that change, but, another \"Exorcist\" replica would have been better? Maybe for the box office, but what John Boorman did with this was a bizarre but quite worthy follow-up to the 1973 smash hit. I think it is commendable. Maybe it is not a masterpiece, I agree that it is not for the masses, it has a confusing history and slow, not easily digestible by everyone, but it has \"something\". Maybe what the director wanted for the movie but lost in translation. This very pretentious movie seems it could have been greater and better but finally results in a strange and sometimes complicated mixture of religious and philosophical theories, with some scares (not enough for the audience) and a great adventure film component. But whether you like it or not, something is certain, at any rate, it is a beautiful film to watch: visually exciting and musically captivating."

Yes, it's an underrated film, and I believe that at the Exorcist boom would be difficult to do as good a film as a result, expectations were high, the longing to see new shocking scenes was intense, it would be a long and painful road to Boorman, and was! The same even tried to get out while he could (or gave) but was barred by the studio! It really is complicated when a director is not involved with the original story, since he should make a direct continuation of the first film, Boorman tried to do what would be your sincere opinion about the subject and did, but did not get the expected results !   Well, Exorcist 2 The Heretic is yes, its a great time! Starting with the soundtrack by Ennio Morriconne, what inspires us, great moments of beautiful African musical illustrations mixing with what was in vogue at the time (see the track \"Magic and Ecstasy) and of course the theme of Regan (who becomes one of simplest track)!'s performances Linda, Kitty (this always ignored the credits and everything related to the Exorcist even being one of the best in the cast) and Burton (realized that even drunk) sound natural and punchy.'s special effects are not to be desired, bright scenes, worked for the best possible realism (by the book first) envision us, even that sometimes skidded along the script a little confused, but direct, mystical, with science side by side Boormam offers in his madness, it's up to you to decide whether it was good or not!'s far from perfect, but it's not so bad as talking!"

Instead of a cold documentary look at the suffering of a young girl and those around her (Boorman, and many others, felt that the suffering was exploited by the first film for entertainment value), Boorman decided on an outlandish mix of pseudo-religious philosophy and striking imagery that confused and angered audiences at the time.

Bloody hell.\n\nLinda Blair looks gorgeous here, and her performance is fine, but she has nothing to work with. Richard Burton however, appears to be either genuinely under hypnosis, drunk, or bored with everything involved and wanting desperately to get this over with so he can go somewhere else, as there are repeated occasions when he doesn't even wait for the person to whom he is speaking to finish their lines, before interrupting them.\n\nSurreal images of someone rolling a giant bolt through this hall of mirrors/ psychiatric offices, and a demon, Pazuzu, who looks strangely like Aunt Jemima, and Linda Blair's attractive body on constant display give this a very random, surreal, Italian giallo vibe at times, but the entire thing quickly collapses under its own weight, never to recover.

I've heard so many bad reviews of this one i never got round to watching it until now.\n\nThe experience was so bad that I've had to come online to moan and warn other people about it, no one i can ring would care so here is my review.\n\nThere was nothing at all which grabbed my interest. I wondered if the film is paced to quickly, but it can't be because i spent an hour and a half hoping it would be over soon, so in that respect it wasn't paced quite quick enough. But I kept missing bits because the lack of interest lets your mind wander. I found myself thinking \"i wish they had waited just a year or two more before filming so that Linda Blair would look that tiny bit older then it wouldn't feel so wrong to fancy her\" And the actress in makeup to look like Regan from part 1 is truly terrible, i want to say more about how bad it really looks, but i cant put into words without obscenities.\n\nWhat exactly made this the most expensive movie WB had ever made at the time? I reckon it was all spent 1st class travel expenses for the cast and crew, cos i don't see where it was spent on screen. The ending of the film may have cost a bit but it doesn't look very good even for 1977.\n\nRichard Burton has quite a long career behind him with some big movies in there. Cant say i remember him in any of those titles but i will always remember him for giving the worst on screen performance by an actor, i have EVER seen as the father. He just sort of wanders in front of the camera, or lingers there waiting to deliver his lines. When he does speak you just wish he would put a bit of emotion into his voice, its just monotone. Oh yeah and when he walks his hands stay perfectly by his sides, his movement is that wooden, just like the performance.\n\nCONCLUSION - You have either already watched this movie and you want to see how bad other people though it was, or you've only just found out there was a sequel and you're going to watch it anyway. I honestly think this is the worst horror movie I have ever watched in my life, what do you think?"

Yes, Sir Richard Burton was a great actor--yet when shoehorned with a crappy script and with his more irritating peccadilloes left unrestrained, he can be such a chore and bore to watch. Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile. This is a work that would probably bore the demons so much, they would decide to get out of Regan MacNeil's body, and perhaps even leave Earth's plane altogether, never even wanting a return ticket."

But this movie is so offensively awful to all of the senses a movie can influence that it isn't anyone's thing.\n\nIn the span of about two hours, this movie gives us: - A magical dream machine that can look into your mind - A priest riding a giant bumble bee - Linda Blair curing a young girl's autism by smiling at her - Linda Blair walking on the air - James Earl Jones in a locust costume - Characters giving corny monologues about \"hope\" and \"light\" that really mean nothing - Sexy Linda Blair clone trying to seduce a priest before turning into a spooky zombie monster\n\nThis movie is a long, painful slog of boring nonsense and bad writing and it's all managed by a really bad director who's just a really dumb person in general.\n\nLegend has it, this film was so bad that the only audience that didn't laugh it off the screen chased the producers down the street. You ask me? They were all far too nice.\n\nExorcist II: The Heretic is bedeviled by the horror of a 1/10. It is one of my Top 5 worst movies of all time."

        "review_title": "A noteworthy film, one of the most underrated movies ever!",
        "review_detailed_main": "The Exorcist II: The Heretic is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated movies ever. A well-known flop both in terms of box office and reviews. It's only but great sin is being the sequel of one of the most acclaimed and highest grossing movies in film history. \"The Heretic\" lacks enough scares to be qualified even as a scary movie, and the first \"Exorcist\" is widely regarded as \"the scariest movie ever\". The John Boorman's movie moves away from the genre in order to offer an independent work with a different visual and narrative style. But beyond the prejudice for being the next part of a great classic and, therefore, the high expectations placed on it, the main failure of the film (and from my point of view the only one) is its very complex plot, full of details and with an excess of information that, coupled with a somewhat neglected narrative development, built a film difficult to understand and, at times, slow and somewhat boring. A script in which take place the continuation of the story (of her protagonist Regan, played again for the beautiful Linda Blair), the supposed heresy of a priest, the eternal struggle between science and religion and metaphysics. A really far from mainstream content.\n\nBut apart from its difficult understanding, its estrangement from the genre of the first movie and its slow development, \"The Heretic\" is still a NOTEWORTHY MOVIE, especially if not compared to the first one. This film is valuable in itself. Personally I appreciate the risk and originality to create a new work of art. Because, above all, this movie has a remarkable art direction that helps to maintain the interest, and to lighten its dense story. The African landscapes, with simply sensational background music and an impressive use of the footage create a dreamlike feeling very accomplished. The music also stands out in other scenes of great visual impact, such as that in which Regan looks thoughtfully at its roof in an attic in New York, with a strongly beautiful score, \"Regan's Theme\" a melancholic and somewhat angelic theme, suggesting this girl, formerly victim of a demon, is a special human being. It's really worthy of mention this John Boorman's ability to convey certain feelings and emotions with a simple but very effective right mix of music and image. And while many dialogs have the certain innocence of that years (the 1970s), I think that almost the whole cast ensemble match their respective characters. Draws particular attention the angelic beauty of Linda Blair, who in this movie gets rid of the unpleasant character of the previous film to offer a girl that no longer possessed (although at the risk of being again) appears (as stated before) as a kind of messiah, an envoy to do the good.\n\nI think it is a worthy and remarkable film. I'm surprised the terrible criticism raised, especially when today almost no Hollywood film has content. Maybe with a more understandable script, a little less of footage, and a few more scares, the film had managed to won the public's support. I admit it is a dense film, you can like it, you can dislike it. But no one is indifferent to it. I can't understand how the reviewers, who always support anything that away from the easy way, don't like this movie (despite its failures). It's easier to understand its relative flop at the box office (It grossed over $30 million dollars at that time, thereby it was profitable, although not as expected) because is very difficult to market it for being difficult to place it in a specific genre. But in short, I keep going thinking the same. It is one of the most underrated movies ever and I encourage a new revision. The film deserves to be watched twice at last, and unbiased. You may find, among the entire jumble, a potential masterpiece that was never a masterpiece but shows its aims to be that.\n\nIf seeing any crap movie from Hollywood now, those that offer a lot of FX and no content, do you really think that \"The Exorcist II\" is a bad film? It may be not easy to watch, but I think its strengths are too numerous to be considered a crap.\n\nThe best: - The amazing soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Stunning! - The cinematography and the visuals - The whole cast ensemble. Linda Blair: an angel. - Its originality and risk - The story\n\nThe worst - Lack of scares (in my opinion it is not a failure, but compared to the first film its seems to be too light) - The difficulty to understand some things, due to its dense and a little complicated script - The ending, forced and not too conclusive\n\nOverall: it needs a further review and another chance. I can't understand the so much hatred to this enjoyable and personal movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was interested to read in someone else's comments that the movie everyone knows and despises is a hacked-to-bits version of a three-hour original, and that the three-hour original is much better. Yes, that's more or less what it feels like. There are some good things here nevertheless. I have a feeling critics would have been much kinder to Exorcist II if it had been released today: would-be blockbusters, and horror movies, have gotten so much worse as to reveal virtues that few would have noticed in 1977.\n\nSuch as...? Sheer, dark stylishness, for one thing. No horror film would be so well shot, or visually convey such seriousness of purpose, today. Richard Burton (and he's not the only one) delivers some laughable lines, to be sure; yet he and his surroundings are filmed with such sobriety that we don't laugh as much as we might - if at all. A common complaint made of a ridiculous film is that it takes itself too seriously. This charge is usually misguided. What's wrong with (say) \"Battlefield Earth\" is that it tries AND FAILS to take itself seriously. Much in Exorcist II, mostly the dialogue, is downright ludicrous, yet the film is redeemed by how seriously it succeeds in taking itself.\n\nOther good things... Those shots of Africa, shot within a studio and all the better for it, are both beautiful and seriously creepy. The musical score is a fine one (one of Morricone's best). Then there's Linda Blair. It was a marvellous stroke of good luck that the 13-year-old actress they chose to play the part of an even younger girl in \"The Exorcist\" would grow up to be so gorgeous."

I think my favorite bad acting/line from this pile of crap was \"She didn't, it did. It was horrible......utterly horrible......and fascinating,\" all the while Burton is looking right at the camera.\n\nI was hoping for this movie to be a lot worse than it was. Yes, James Earl Jones in a locust costume, sexy possessed Linda Blair, and those stupid fake looking locusts were bad enough, but I was hoping for more.\n\nI can still see why people were so mad when it first came out though.

So, all narrative and space inconsistencies \u0096 us in Black Africa or ex-Mesopotamy? Both at the same time undoubtedly- of the dream are then allowed and this, in spite of the attempt of scenario which the production sought to graft to its first opus. Surfing on the \"pseudosciences\" in vogue at the time, this last one had tried indeed well to sell to us the hypno-psychoanalysis using an old flashing light and some electrodes. They had even delivered the outcome of the second opus of the concurrent saga: \"The Omen\", by setting fire to the bewitched children's nurse to conclude the history. But the writers were mistaken in stage or in director. Because Boorman don't give a dawn of psycho-malefic troubles of Linda Blair, it still prefers to see her in transparent nightdress than all covered with sallow vomit. Which he wants, it's to film giant grasshoppers, cracks and African rites on a pagano-epic music of Ennio Morricone.\n\nFour years earlier, producers had ever massacred Mario Bava's \"Lisa and devil\", always for a exorcism question. Here, it is the same cacophony feeling which is offered to us."

Richard Burton sleepwalks through this movie and the rest of the cast likewise phones it in. \"The Exorcist\" was a well written and directed movie which had a very real statement about good and evil. Mr Boorman must not have liked what it said, because he contradicted everything that was said in the original. What the heck, this is the same man who gave us \"Zardoz.\" It is one thing for a movie to be made by people who do not know how to make movies and have almost no budget. But when people who know better and have money make something this bad, it is an insult to the audience. The only thing I wonder is what the studio was thinking."

It's such a silly mess of bad acting, cringeworthy dialogue, and a laughable music score. The great Richard Burton, undoubtedly inebriated half the time, plays to the rafters in the worst performance of his career. Cherubic Linda Blair seems to have lost whatever acting ability she exhibited in the first movie. She's 'all growed up' here, a fact director John Boorman wastes no time exploiting in her first scene where she bralessly jiggles her way through a tap dance number. Later scenes have her in a see-through nightgown and various tight tops. It's tacky but is anybody really surprised? Boorman's direction is at times interesting but he seems to forget that this is supposed to be a horror movie. The only thing scary or horrifying about this film is that it was even made. So many unintentionally funny scenes that it should be classified as a comedy. The synchronizer! Oh my god the synchronizer! This has to be seen to be believed. It's a turkey, for sure, but not one without some comical merits. Sadly, Paul Henreid's last film is so far removed from Casablanca it might as well have been shot on Mars."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is an inferior sequel to what some consider the best horror film of all time. In this follow-up, Regan is now a bit older and attending college. But she is still haunted by the subtle memories of her possession by the devilish demon, Pasuzu, when she was twelve. Regularly visiting a children's hospital, she somehow gets hooked up onto this \"synchronizer\" machine where a doctor can somehow enter her subconscious or something along those lines. But now, Pasuzu has returned, and is tormenting Regan all over again.\n\nI haven't seen this film in awhile, but I don't think it was anything too special. The whole \"synchronizer\" premise to the film was pretty far fetched, and apparently the crowd used to test screen the film found the movie to be awful after that element was introduced. I don't completely agree, I think that concept isn't very realistic and a bit ridiculous, but in the context of the movie they somehow manage to make it work. The biggest problem with this movie is the absence of Ellen Burstyn, who gave a remarkable performance in the original film as Regan's mother. Linda Blair is back though, and she is a very good actress, so she gave a good performance. Richard Burton who played the priest in this film was also very good as was Louise Fletcher, who plays a guidance counselor. One of the good qualities to this film, however, was the flashback sequences to Father Merrin's time spent in Africa, which had some really distinctive visuals. Although, I think the back story was a little bit bizarre and unneeded, but whatever.\n\nOverall, I didn't think \"Exoricst II: The Heretic\" was a complete waste of time, and I think some people were a little harsh on it. It's not nearly as good as the original movie was, it is below average, but watchable at the least. Far from perfect, but still decent enough. If you want to see a slightly better Linda Blair film, watch \"Summer of Fear\", which was directed by horror legend Wes Craven and released the following year. 4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "4 years after the events of the last film, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is now living in New York while her mother continues to work in Europe attending school as well as undergoing a new kind of synchronized hypnotic therapy under the care of Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher) as Regan still deals with dreams left over from her experience even if the memories aren't there. Father Phillip Lamont (Richard Burton) is assigned to investigate Regan's Exorcism as many within the Church have come to brand Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who died in the course of the exorcism as a heretic and satanic worshipper. During the course of Lamont's investigation, he connects with Regan and through shared hypnosis learns of Merrin's prior encounters during his time in Africa that put him against Pazuzu (Karen Knapp), who may have been the demon who possessed Regan.\n\nDue to legal animosity with William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin, neither one of them wanted to return for a follow-up to The Exorcist. Initially intended to be made as a cynical low-budget rehash of the first movie. Playwright William Goodhart wrote the script for the sequel, The Heretic, who sought to make a more introspective film on human consciousness and the nature of good and evil which further lead to John Boorman getting involved as he found the first film \"repulsive\" and liked the underlying ideas presented in Goodhart's sequel. As with the first film, The Heretic experienced its fair share of production problems including delayed filming from Boorman contracting San Joaquin Valley Fever as well as re-writes that were going on while filming was taking place. Made for $14 million, the film earned $30 million which proved to be a far cry from the massive grosses of the original. Both critics and audiences panned the film with many reports of derisive laughter at screenings including from William Peter Blatty who had claimed to be the first one to laugh. William Friedkin referred to the film as \"a freaking disgrace\" and the worst movie he'd seen at that point. Exorcist II: The Heretic isn't a good movie and a poor follow-up to its predecessor, but it is utterly fascinating in a way that only a good director can truly do even if the work is not good.\n\nFrom a purely visual standpoint, John Boorman at least knows how to create something visually attention grabbing and impressive. Scenes like the Cardinal's office, the Ethiopian rock church, or Regan's New York Penthouse with all its reflective surfaces that must have been torture for the cinematographer are undeniably striking in their visually beauty. Additionally Ennio Morricone's soundtrack while not scary or atmospheric is very memorable and dreamlike and you can see why Quentin Tarantino reused parts of it for his Hateful Eight soundtrack. Given Boorman's open dislike of the first film, tonally The Heretic has little if anything to do with its predecessor. Rather than being a slow terrifying character study, the film goes into almost science-fiction territory with a strange device known as a synchronizer that allows Regan to share her dreams with Dr. Tuskin and Father Lamont and it's a far cry from the comparatively more grounded and gritty setup of the first one. When we're out of the scenes of Regan \"synchronizing\", which are often ponderously paced with not a lot happening, the movie becomes this very strange \"adventure\" story with Phillip Lamont backtracking over Father Merrin's work in Africa which is really just an excuse for Boorman to do more trippy imagery. Due to Warner Bros. Unwillingness to approve location shooting, many of the Africa set scenes look and feel like dressed up sound stages (because they are) and while they never feel like tangible livable places, they do add to that weird surreal dream style Boorman is looking for. The performances aren't great this time around as actors often feel confused as to what and why they're doing things and it leads to some unintentionally funny lines such as where Regan very matter of factly says to a stranger \"I was possessed by a demon but I'm better now.\" In what feels like it should be from a parody and not a sequel.\n\nExorcist II: The Heretic is an absolutely baffling sequel, but it's not unwatchable bad. Even on a bad day, John Boorman is too weird and interesting of a director to dismiss even when he fires wide of the mark as is the case here. You get the sense he wants to make something about good triumphing over evil, it's just that it's done in a very clumsy and idiosyncratic way. Even critics and directors like Pauline Kael and Martin Scorsese have complimented parts of the movie while acknowledging it's flaws. Does that make the movie good? No, it just means it has ideas. But for what it's worth bad execution with ideas is still more interesting than good execution without any."

It's the only movie that actually scares me and it's a magnificent piece of work, really. Except for the music (with the exception of \"Tubular Bells\"), I wouldn't change anything about it.\n\nNow comes this other movie, this *sequel* (hiss!) directed by the man who gave us \"Deliverance\". Linda Blair returns as Regan, and Kitty Winn as Sharon, along with Max von Sydow for some fill-in-the-blanks work, but they're the only prominent talents behind or in front of the cameras to return.\n\nHow dare this movie pretend to be in the same league as \"The Exorcist,\" right? Wrong.\n\nGoing in with absolutely no expectations whatsoever (I recommend that state of mind), I found a good story told in a not-particularly-good fashion. The acting is mostly awful, except some capable moments by Linda Blair and James Earl Jones. However, the actors deliver lines that weren't really meant for Hollywood-- metaphorical, psychospiritual stuff about locusts and the demon Pazuzu, who, four years prior, got all up in little Regan's grill and may be doing so again. This is, at its core, a fantasy, not a nightmare.\n\nSome scenes of the movie-- a ritual at a clifftop church in Africa and Father Lamont's meeting with Kokumo, just a couple examples-- are actually fascinating. John Boorman is a good director, mostly, and makes choices that are bewildering, but not as terrible as you've heard. The movie also distances itself from the original-- the patchwork, obnoxious soundtrack of the first is replaced by a single score by the legendary Ennio Morricone, and the visuals appeal less to claustrophobia. Some tracking shots in Africa are absolutely breathtaking, but then William Fraker, the cinematographer, has a long history of doing great, underrated work-- see also \"1941\" (1979) and \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969).\n\nAll in all, it's not a great movie. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a carbon copy of Exorcist 1, but that's great. Honestly, I can guarantee it began as a moneymaking scheme by the studio to recapture the original's instant, intoxicating success. But another sequel to a religious-horror classic was like that, and it will never be acquitted-- \"Damien: Omen II,\" a disastrous joke of a movie. \"Exorcist II\" is acquitted."

It feels unsure of itself a good deal of the time, making it unsurprising to read that its production was pretty chaotic.\n\nBut there are parts here and there that stopped me from hating it like some other people seem to do. While there's little narrative flow, some individual scenes work. I liked Ennio Morricone's score (not sure I've ever disliked a Morricone score) and John Boorman knows how to capture some interesting visuals. There are parts of this that look striking, and it's the kind of movie where you can see where the money went (it's not such a misfire that it feels like it wasted its budget).\n\nBut I just wish it was as confident with its narrative. The story here makes it pretty boring, and the half-hearted attempt to sort of but not completely follow the first movie is frustrating. It's not a movie I hated or regretted watching, but I'd also find it hard to recommend someone sit through all two hours of it."

        "review_detailed_main": "'Exorcist II: The Heretic' is the utterly baffling, awful, and yet somewhat fascinating sequel to the classic 1973 original 'The Exorcist' by William Friedkin, which still to this day ranks as one of the scariest movies of all-time. How it managed to spawn a sequel as bad as this is beyond me. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this flick down to the bad direction, muddled plot, dull pacing, and lacking any sort of scares or tension. This movie is an awkward and weird mess from start to finish.\n\nThe Plot = Set 4 years after the events of the first movie with Regan (Linda Blair) trying to life a normal life after her demon possession from the previous entry and is now under the care of psychiatrist Dr Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Meanwhile a Priest Father Lamont (Richard Burton) is investigating the death of Father Merrin, which leads him to New York and comes to discover that the demon still lurks within Regan and must find a way to destroy it once and for all.\n\nOne thing that you could admire about this flick is that its certainly ambitious and at the very least it wasn't just a safe retread of the first film. However, what we do get is a truly bizarre disaster of a film that takes a huge risk but falls flat. This is a prime example of directors John Boorman and Rospo Pallenberg having too much free reign. However, the visuals are somewhat impressive with some interesting camerawork and decent special effects, but that's about the only positive I could give to this.\n\nThe performances here are decent with Linda Blair again giving a strong performance despite the awful writing. Richard Burton brings some much-needed screen presence to this flick, and he does a commendable job with the clunky dialogue. Louise Flecther gives a fine performance as the psychiatrist.\n\nOverall there's a reason why 'Exorcist II: The Heretic' is considered one of the sequels of all-time as its simply horrendous."

She is now involved in experimental therapy to help her recover, but this comes in handy when another priest(Richard Burton) is assigned to investigate the circumstances of Father Merrin's death, but then finds to his horror that the very same demon that possessed Regan is back, and determined to prevail...\n\nBizarre is the word to describe this film; though script is ambitious, story is utterly ridiculous and nonsensical, leading to some unintentionally funny moments, and a laughable final confrontation with the demon. Direction by John Boorman is energetic but hampered by over-the-top visuals that will leave viewer dumbfounded.\n\nDeeply disappointing sequel."

        "review_detailed_main": "Exorcist II: The Heretic is easily one of the most hated sequels of all time and I can't say it's without good reason. It goes against just about everything that made the original so terrifying and unique and tries to do its own thing with, sometimes, God-awful results.\n\nThe Heretic has Regan in her late teens now and she doesn't remember much of her ordeal with the devil in Georgetown. She's seeing a therapist who believes that she might have a special gift for healing. A priest (played by Richard Burton) believes this, too, and they all figure out that the devil only seems to like to possess those who are natural healers.\n\nThis is an interesting direction to take, but they don't really go anywhere with it. Director John Boorman's camera swirls, twirls, and flies with aplomb, but it seems like it's only doing that to make up for a less than satisfactory narrative. One thing is for sure - Ennio Morricone's music score is stellar and filled with beautiful themes (including a gorgeous theme for Regan)."

But unfortunately the script is weak, the focus is on a silly psychoanalysis gadget, and the acting can't turn any of poor dialogue around.\n\nI think any writer could look at this and see missed opportunities in the plot and basic storylines.\n\nAvoid this turkey."

Same goes to James Earl Jones but everyone else (Definitely Richard Burton) do very poor acting and whenever we are with Richard Burton the film goes completely boring!\n\nThe films plot is OK, some of it is actually really good and unique but other parts are like \"WTH?\"\n\nThis sequel isn't one of the worst films I've seen or one of the worst sequels ever.

        "review_detailed_main": "The Heretic is probably my favourite movie of all time, and thats saying something since I was born in the 50's... There's something about this movie that entirely captivates me - Boorman made Deliverance, yes, and that movie has tension and builds to its denouement, but The Heretic? This movie has plain weird on a scale I hadn't seen since Kubrick's 2001. I PAID to see this movie about 20 times in the theatres, I became so obsessed with it. (Mmm I seem to remember also having an attachment to Rollerball,,,OK, I *was* in my early 20's ) - However , I don't think I would have had such an investment in this movie without seeing Exorcist I... EI was the 1st act here, and Boorman took what was a plain horror movie ( don't buy in to the hype around at the time of The Exorcist of having Doctors and nurses on standby in the cinemas \"In Case\" and all that sh*t)( I actually got asked to leave a theatre showing Exorcist 1 for laughing during the \"Reagan wets the carpet\" scene.. d'oh! and turned it into something that would make me question my religious beliefs - I didn't believe in God then... and I still don't - but do I believe in Good and Evil as abstract forces in the world? This film made me question that, and can people who have been \"brushed with the wings\" of evil help those who are struggling? Mmm.. aren't a lot of recovering/recovered drug addicts working with young people to try and break the cycle? Pazuzu can be a bitch if you aren't careful! (ask Kitty Winn!)"

        "review_detailed_main": "This is by far the worst horror film ever made. But wait, this film was made in 1977 and is still discussed, it's been release as part of a box set. Most importantly hands up those of us who have seen this film would watch it again. It has something. Call it charm, call it super-glue, but the film sticks with you. Can anyone remember \"The legend of blood Castle, ETN, Children shouldn't play with dead things, The Orphan, Curtains?\" These were all films of the video nasty era. Far worst effects for worse acting, far worse story lines and probably impossible to get hold of. So why is this film singled out to receive this accolade. I think it is because it crosses some point where is ceases to be just bad and into the realms of awful rarely trod. In doing so it becomes good, it is where the charm lies. Once you understand that the film is terrible, it becomes watchable and the experience ceases to be painful BTW There was another Excorcist film made (it was called \"Shadows and Cries\" and was meant to be part III. That was also a truly terrible film, but had none of the charm of its predecessors. If you can find a copy of it anywhere, get it and do a compare and contrast and you'll see what I mean."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was looking for a favorable review for this film somewhere on the Internet but I simply couldn't find one. The film seems to be universally reviled. When I finally got around to viewing it my expectations were as low as they could be. Described by many as the worst sequel of all time and some call it the worst movie ever made. I would not go that far. But one thing's for sure; It's not good.\n\nWhat Boorman and co. were exactly trying to do with the flick is puzzling. It's not a horror movie, it seems to be trying to be a psychological thriller but it fails completely. In fact, there is no suspense to be found at all. Haphazard editing and a confusing (read: rather shitty) script ruin all chances of atmosphere and suspense. The dialogue is very silly as well.\n\nActing is OK I thought. Richard Burton is not all bad. Most reviewers trash his performance and accuse him and Linda Blair of not being able to pull off a single scene together convincingly. I think he does pretty well under the circumstances. As does Louise Fletcher in a horribly written role. This quality actress has never found a decent role since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones perform decently but the material lets them down.\n\nBig plus also for the cinematography and overall look. The film may be trash, but it's a well filmed trash. Exterior shots in Africa look quite nice, some interesting color schemes throughout and the artsy look on many scenes look great. The music by Ennio Morricone is nothing short of fantastic, much better than the film deserves.\n\nThe main problem is that this flick doesn't make any sense. Where it's going is never clear and when it's over you still don't have a clue. Originally Exorcist II was a three hour feature which (reportedly) made some sense but Boorman had to chop it down by a third. I don't know if there's a masterpiece buried in the film archives somewhere but I seriously doubt it. But I do believe that everyone involved had some point to make which simply got completely lost.\n\nAfter reading countless reviews claiming this as one of the worst films of all time I can't say I was bored to death as my expectations were very low. There are some things to admire here but the bad outweighs the good."

Most of the time you hear just loud sounds and weird noises while you either watch Regan having nightmares or see random locust flying around.

So to examine the issue more closely her counselor \"Dr. Gene Tuskin\" (Louise Fletcher) recommends that she goes under a unique type of hypnosis in order to reveal more details to her. Meanwhile a priest by the name of \"Father Philip Lamont\" (Richard Burton) is sent to investigate her specific case and to report his findings to the \"Cardinal\" (played by Paul Henreid) in charge. As it so happens, Father Lamont manages to get there just in time to witness the hypnosis session. Unfortunately, something goes horribly wrong and Dr. Tuskin almost dies as a result. But even worse than that the session also brings the demon that possessed her back as well--and the nightmare returns all over again. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is an immediate sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever produced so a great number of people had high expectations. Unfortunately, this film turned out to be a great disappointment due in large part to a weak script and some rather ridiculous scenarios--with the ending being downright laughable. In short, this movie just didn't measure up to its predecessor in any way, shape or form and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

        "review_detailed_main": "As everyone knows by now, The Exorcist is a horror classic. This film would be a horror classic as well if it wasn't so misunderstood. This film mixes horror, science fiction, and fantasy all in one film. It is pervaded with a dreamlike atmosphere to the point in which it doesn't even feel as if you're watching a film when you see it. It feels as if you're right in the middle of a bizarre nightmare you can't wake up from, similar to Suspiria. The music contributes to this dreamlike atmosphere in a way I have never heard a score contribute to the atmosphere before. Ennio Morricone did a terrific job at composing the score. Listening to this score alone, you can see it's really no wonder he's considered a legendary composer. The camera-work also achieved the effect of contributing the dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nI believe the reason so many people dislike it is because it is so different in tone to the first film. People watch the film expecting it to be exactly the same as the first and it isn't whatsoever. It is a very unique film experience that feels nothing like the first film. While the first film was a straight horror/drama grounded in reality for the most part, this film goes it's own route and is highly fantastical. If it was simply called The Heretic, I think people would like it a lot more. Because it's a sequel, people can't seem to get the first film out of their mind and constantly compare it.\n\nThe film gives a reason for Regan's possession. It gives the idea that she had the gift of healing as the reason she was possessed. Satan wanted to destroy this gift because it was used for goodness, so he sent a demon to possess Regan. I believe that was a genius and creative idea. There is a touching scene in which Regan causes an autistic girl who is mute speak for the first time in front of her mother. It always gives me goosebumps no matter how many times I see the film. The story which is very well written cleverly links the past with the future. While it gives fresh ideas and builds on the story of Regan's life and the aftermath of her possession, it also delves further into the past by showing Father Merrin's prior experience with exorcism before he met Regan. It is also brilliantly acted. Linda Blair is terrific and it's good to see her play Regan yet again. It was also nice to see Kitty Winn for the second time. Louise Fletcher, James Earl Jones, Richard Burton, Paul Henreid, and Ned Beatty are also among the all star cast and give unforgettable performances.\n\nOverall, I think the amount of hatred this film receives is absolutely unfair. It deserves none of it. It is one of the most underrated, misunderstood films of all time. Sometimes I even enjoy it more than the first film. Please don't let the bad reputation this film has discourage you from watching it. You may have the same feelings about the film that I do."

Lamont will seek out Komumo, against The Church's order to break away from a case where he was only to investigate the reasons behind the mysterious death of Father Merrin(Max Von Sydow), in the hopes of joining together to defeat Satan's angel and save Reagan from certain future horror.\n\nLouise Fletcher portrays Dr. Gene Tuskin, Reagan's doctor in charge of seeing that Reagan gets proper psychiatric care. She invented the tacky, wacky hypnosis machine with it's strobe light and mechanical sound. She is a scientist and simply will not accept that Reagan has some sort of supernatural evil buried within(in a startling sequence where she is interlinked with Reagan, Pazuzu almost kills her gripping her heart in it's evil grasp).\n\nI will not take up for the film overall, because I think it's crap like the majority, but will give credit to William A Fraker for his stunning cinematography and the great Ennio Morricone for his eerie, spine-tingling score which brings an atmosphere to this wretched exercise it really doesn't deserve. The dialogue and acting is anything but great and Burton looks embarrassed(I read that the only reason he'd even accept this role was that he'd get the lead psychiatrist role in Sidney Lumet's marvelous, \"Equus\")to even be in it. Fletcher has her bright career moments, but doesn't spark or even glimmer in her role. She's like an actress just starting out trying to remember her lines. All this could be because they do not believe in the material and no inspiration seems to be in the story either where we follow ESP and Voodoo mumbo jumbo, not to mention we actually \"ride\" on the wings of a locust in a dream as Burton's Lamont is being led by Pazuzu to the Voodoo Priest within Reagan's hypnotic state.\n\nThe final climactic showdown is merely the tip of the iceberg in that it is a noisy, ridiculous, special-effects laden incoherent mess which leaves the viewer(..or at least me)feeling like they do not know what just happened. It's derivative and laughable and closes the door on the fact that this film couldn't be saved from being a laughingstock and disappointing considering those involved."

        "review_detailed_main": "I just tried watching this movie to give it another chance and I have come to a similar conclusion upon my 1st viewing. Linda Blair herself said that this film was a failure and there were \" too many cooks in the kitchen\" and it went through a lot of changes during the making of the film that the end product barely resembles the original script. The man most responsible for this cinematic abortion is pointed at the director John Boorman, a man that normally makes great movies with some of my favorites including Excalibur and Deliverance. John Boorman took a high brow/psedo intellectual route by making a movie with esoteric themes, but is actually low on substance and has nothing to really reel in the viewer to care about all the crap that is going on here. John Boorman's pretentious vision is nothing more than an artist whipping out his penis and masturbating on the canvas, then presenting it as a piece of art. This drudgery was annoying to sit through and in the special edition, I even listened to John Boorman's commentary in his attempt to defend the film. Obviously, this does not resemble the original film at all and is easily one of the worst major movie sequels of all time. This had a big budget, great cast and crew working on this, but it's all for naught and a huge waste of money and time that I will never get back that could have been better spent doing something else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Terrible sequel to the 1974 classic. It picks up about three years after the events in the first film. Regan (Linda Blair) seemingly remembers nothing about being possessed. She's also seeing a psychiatrist (Louise Fletcher) who believes then possession never happened and it was all in her mind. Then a priest (Richard Burton!) comes to believe the demon that possessed Regan is still lurking inside her waiting to come out.\n\nThis was a legendary fiasco when it came out in 1977. People laughed, booed and literally threw things at the screen during premieres across the country. I KNEW this was going to be a disaster when director John Boorman made it clear it was NOT a horror film! Ummmmmm...what did he think he was doing? \"Gone With the Wind\"? It's not scary in the slightest and the story wanders all over the place. Some of the cinematography is beautiful (that's why I'm giving it two stars) but everything else is lousy. There are scenes in Africa that are slow and boring and I'm still not quite sure what the locusts have to do with anything. And the name of the demon is Pazuzu. Seriously. WHO thought that up??? It's the stupidest name for a demon ever! Acting is no help. Blair is annoying, Burton appears to be dead roaring drunk most of the time and Fletcher appears stone-faced through much of the movie. And poor James Earl Jones is in a stupid locust costume! Sadly it's also Paul Henreid's last film.\n\nIt's terrible all right. With a better script and a director who wasn't afraid to make a horror film it might have worked."

This movie started off good, I was engaged for first half an hour but after that everything went wrong. It started feeling like a never-ending boredom.

Undeniably, the first movie was going to be a hard act to follow. Sure enough, John Boorman's \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" was silly.\n\nOne could argue that the sequel wasn't going for the original's horror factor, instead trying to be a psychological thriller. If you take that at face value, then the movie's got some interesting camera angles. Aside from that, it's hard to take anything about the movie seriously. The scenes involving possession look like a spoof of the first movie.*\n\nBasically, if you're looking for an attempt at a psychological thriller, with no connection to any other movie, then you'll probably enjoy this one. Otherwise you'll roll your eyes at it. It's not the atrocity that its reputation suggests, but it's laughable compared to the first movie.\n\nAs a side note, I got Linda Blair's autograph at a Wizard World convention in 2014. Very nice lady.\n\n*Linda Blair did in fact star in a spoof of her most famous role, called \"Repossessed\", starring (who else?) Leslie Nielsen as the priest."

The old priest in Africa, Regans psychic ability (which is never explained)and the main priest dithering around and upsetting everyone. I found him a particularly unnecessary and annoying character.\n\nThe scene at the end where Regan and the Priest are battling the sexy evil Regan is laughable - its so cheesy, there is no tension or suspense - (the scene I believe inspired many of the half horror half porno films of the early eighties).\n\nAlso the acting of Regans maid was horrendous and thats all I want to say about her.\n\nThis was a messy film - it started with the right idea, but someone got confused along the way. 2/10"

The memorable moments are continuous, you won't be able to avoid laughing, even if you try to take it seriously, which is, frankly, impossible.

Reagan becomes a kind of new age heroine and Boorman (surprisingly) turns the misogyny and mean spiritedness of the original film into an emotionally passionate look at this young woman as a survivor of real spiritual and emotional trauma. The film has some hard amazingly passionate performances from Louise Fletcher, Richard Burton and Linda Blair.

One of the most obvious is its complete cheesiness as everything in here is mistakenly bad, but it's still a fun watch. It's fun to see how everything comes together, not only with the returning characters but the idea of having the spirit as well is a novel idea and much fun can be had from seeing just how it goes through events. The idea of the hypnosis machine triggering the different visions of the demon's previous encounters throughout history that gives this plenty to like in the first half. It's got a silly quality which the original didn't have in that everything in here is so over-the-top with the revelations showing the fighter braving the various terrains or fighting off the deadly swarm of locusts ravaging their camp which is absolutely reveling in cheese that few films have. It's great to see how this plays out, and really sets up the finale that really has a great impact to it being a huge action set-piece. This is the high point of the film involving the battle to get home and the battle inside the house that leaves the entire place in ruins with all the different tricks and tactics employed throughout here to get the upper hand. There are several things about this that didn't really work. The main issue is that the film really goes on far longer than it should and contains a lot of useless moments. The Africa scenes are twice as long as they should be, the sequences in the hospital are equally overlong and in general, there are scenes in here that are there for pretty much no real reason. That just makes it more hopeful when something will happen, only for more dialog to take place. The other main issue here is the complete disregard for comprehension in here. It makes no sense at all and has a feeling that it enjoys being that way. Going through everything in here that makes no sense at all is a task that's far too hard to try to explain and get out of the way, and it feels like that's what the feel was going in, as there's no way that something this incomprehensive was by fault. Some of it can make a headache causing time, the wrong feeling when trying to explain something that was really hard to understand the first time around. These are the main things wrong with it, but they do count for a lot.\n\nRated R: Violence, Language and Brief Nudity."

Chris McNeal has seemingly been abducted and everyone doesn't care, though Sharron lives with Regan in a NY penthouse (for some reason that isn't explained). The 'Syncronizer' looks like a Radio Shack intruder alarm that has been as hastily glued together as the script has. Richard Burton is as wooden as the sets. The highlight for me was Louise Fletcher having a prolonged \"I'll have what she's having\" moment brought on by Linda Blair's frantic molestation that reminded me of the Light Switch scene in Faulty Towers. Bizarre."

The length of the movie is approximately two hours and if you sleeps for half an hour which I am sure you will providing the pace of the movie still will not feel that you have missed something.\n\nActing is bad and most of the characters are having same expressions throughout the movie.

In fact it redeems the whole concept, chucking out the obscene pseudo-religiosity of the first movie (which it used to justify indulging in sadistic fantasies about little girls that would have made De Sade blush) and creating instead a hypnotic nightmare-fantasy that makes Regan a sympathetic and courageous heroine. If the plot is incomprehensible it is no more so than that of most horror films, and Boorman's masterful direction gives it a gravity and emotional resonance that bring it close to the level of Dreyer's \"Vampyr\".\n\nLet's hope the DVD release will bring new converts to this amazing work."

It's very rare for me to write a review but looking at the current rating, I just had to explain because the rating is not fair.\n\nExorcist II is an interesting movie. Yes, it's not as good as the original. It's not very scary either. It's also very different from the original but definitely it's not a bad movie as the ratings suggests.\n\nIt's a mystical movie that serves a sequel and prequel at the same time (midquel if you wish). It takes you on a journey to find the beginning of the story, it also gives you the outcome of the events (what has happened with this little girl and how is she able to continue after being possessed) and it seals the story. Though, the end was the weakest part of the movie. I watched 117min version where father Lamont walks away with Regan. There are at least three different versions of the movie. One of them culminates with the death of father Lamond.\n\nOverall, this movie deserves 7 out of 10!\n\nNB! Don't trust the rating, 3.8 is very unfair!"

But it goes further than that. This film makes sure - with it's top starred cast and an director who's already renowned as a influential individual in the genre - that it does much more than being an awful sequel but instead to strive on becoming a horrific, life-changing for the worst and all around crappy film in general.\n\nRichard Burton, while not miscast, seems not to be bothered about his role. Most scenes he's in ( which is many ) are filled with unintentional humour. Fire! Fire! Expressionless facial impressions and monotonous line deliveries leaves the poor bugger into a blackening ditch in which he can't climb out from. Funny, but depressing to watch him waffle around.\n\nThen you have Linda Blair. As a child actor in the first film, she did alright in not becoming one of those obnoxious kid actors we often see. Sadly, now that she is older, her inability to act can not be accused on her being a child. Very young she still is but talent stems from a young age and watching her in this, i can expect she stars in TV roles after this.\n\nI could write a novel on how many scenes and shots will make you laugh but like any bad film, laughter tends to be the prime reaction from the audience. Is there anything worthwhile to mention? It's interesting in parts. The back-story of Father Merrin and his initial exorcism on the African kid is intriguing but unlike Father Karris, Father Lamont personal quest on discovering himself and his beliefs is so uninteresting that the whole film collapses. Instead we get to watch the evil Reagan attempting to seduce the priest with her evil powers...Meh\n\nAwful film with awful acting. Skip to number three, the true sequel. However, you can always close your eyes and listen to the soundtrack, composed by Morricone."

But I think someone tried to make some money with the success of the original movie, but damn he failed big time.\n\nFrom the first scenes of this movie, I knew it gonna sucks balls. I won't tell too much cuz I don't want to explore you the plot, but most of the time the movie deals with what happened in the first movie and digging it till it find an excuse to create another problem, and a way to get something happen in the movie. However, there is nothing scary nor unique as the first movie. Not any thrilling atmosphere or unforgettable moments. The act is pretty bad and constrained, especially when there is an attempt to reach the satanic moments of the first movie.\n\nOverall, I just say this is a bad movie, even without comparing it to the first one, it's just a tedious and boring movie which makes you laugh when it's trying to thrill you. Don't expect for something which is a bit similar to the first movie. And ignore these who tells you it's a good movie, they are must be a blinded die hard fan of the first movie. I can't remember when was the last time that I saw such a pathetic horror film, it's just drags on and on and when it's ends, you feel nothing but why the hell it was released and why you wasted so much time for nothing?"

He reedited it, cutting eight minutes in hopes of getting the story (written by William Goodhart) to the point of coherency, to no avail. The film remains a kind of reverse gold standard for sequels. It's still a ridiculously overacted, although at times visually haunting, movie. Richard Burton stars as a troubled priest (something of a specialty of his) who is brought in to follow up on the case of Linda Blair, who is institutionalized, still troubled by her encounter with the devil (who wouldn't be?). By the time they confront Satan's minion in the final struggle, you'll be rooting for evil to win."

So, after watching it I wasn't too sure how the sequels would be.\n\nHowever, The Heretic seems to be an interesting yet extremely uneven sequel to the original film. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is set about four years after the Georgetown incident with Regan McNeil. Following a possessed woman killing herself by immolation, the church re-opens the investigation into the deaths of Damien Karras and Lankester Merrin, the two priests who saved Regan's soul. Father Lamont, who was assigned to exorcise the possessed woman, is now assigned to handle the case. His investigation takes him strange places and he meets strange people.\n\nOkay, first off, then-young Linda Blair gives a great performance as troubled Regan MacNeil. I hope she is able to top it in the upcoming Blumhouse legacy sequel by David Gordon Green, by the way. Richard Burton does a great job throughout the film as a troubled priest grappling with his faith. Louise Fletcher is pretty good as a mother figure to Regan, while James Earl Jones is woefully underused throughout the film.\n\nThe imagery throughout the film is pretty creepy, but standard stuff. The two music pieces that Ennio Morricone are both beautiful and creepy. Also, the climax is almost exactly like the climax to The Conjuring Two in parts, so I wasn't too surprised in scenes.\n\nNot a half bad film, though. If you must watch it, I recommend getting the blu-ray edition from Scream Factory, not just for the good picture, but also for the extended cut.\n\nStay Scared!"

And hasn't Linda Blair grown and aged, since we last saw her, and she's never looked sexier and good hearted The small side reflecting shots of Blair's possessed Reagen like we saw in the first, actually feel like a saving grace. There will be scenes in this movie, you won't believe, and locusts have never looked more appealing, and had as much screen time, visually stunning to watch, especially with human heads or in human body form.

Father Lamont is trying to find out, what truly happened to Father Merrin but he slowly discovers that the Demon, who possessed Regan hasn't truly left her body. He uncovers more of Father Merrin's past, when he did his first exorcism in Africa on a little boy. He decides to meet the former possessed soul (James Earl Jones) and try to find out, if Father Merrin made any mistakes in his past.

Blair does her best, she looks cute in most of the movie but she isn't an leading actress. The late Burton looks foolish at times with his unintentionally bad dialogue. Only Fletcher gives an memorable performance as an sympathetic doctor. This was an major box office disappointment, it was released in 1977.

Although this movie does an cult following. The biggest fan of \"The Exorcist 2:The Heretic\" is actually Oscar-Winning filmmaker:Martin Scorsese! This movie is best enjoyed with an open mind. The special effects does brings this movie to life at times but it is overdone by seeing Locusts on-screen, large or small. Which the feature looks pointless at times. (*** \u00bd/*****)."

        "review_detailed_main": "Looking back it is easy to see that the making of this film was not a good time for the main protagonists. Director John Boorman must have still been reeling from the less than enthusiastic reception of Zardoz (1975), a real letdown after the box office success and critical acclaim for Deliverence (1972). Linda Blair, the plucky young teen from the original film had noticeably matured but was rumoured to have been into substance abuse and prone to extremely late arrivals on set whilst her co-star had problems of his own. Richard Burton, always a bit of a drinker, was reputedly drunk most of the time and clearly unhappy. Indeed it is suggested he had only taken the role (without reading the script?) in order to be assured of the part in Equus the same year. And what a difference a film makes. Acting by numbers here for Boorman, he is not helped by a director who was severely under the cosh with sustained opposition from Blatty and Co to even make the film. Opposition that even restricted the use of original locations necessitating almost everything to be made on set. So, not only are the leading couple less than happy but the very circumstances of shooting handicapped. It is a wonder the thing got made at all but no surprise that the over extended pretend Africa scenes are so poor or that the extended use of the ridiculous supposed hypnosis syncroniser made to take up so much of the footage. Probably only a couple of pluses here, one that Burton was brilliant in his other film that year and the Morricone score was well up to his usual standard."

        "review_title": "As some viewers have noted, inside this awful, awful film is a great one screaming to get out",
        "review_detailed_main": "Almost every comment or review I ever read about \"Exorcist II\" panned it as one of the worst movies of the year it was made, and possibly one of the worst movies EVER made. I finally saw it on \"American Movie Classics\" last night, so I could judge it for myself. I have to make allowances for possible censorship and being chopped up so they could stick in commercials, but in the end I have to agree that this movie is phenomenally bad.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that here and there are some pretty effective individual film special effects, sound effects, bits of stage business and delivered lines that DO hit the mark, and these glints of potential hint at a really unsettling and creepy apocalyptic thriller that could have left the viewer shaken and afraid. But someone - Boorman the director, or the writer, or someone - couldn't keep control of the material, or make the script work the way it was supposed to, and the film will veer from brain-numbingly stupid to jolting and unnerving and back to stupid and overblown several times in a given scene. That's even more exhausting and irritating than if the movie just sucks.\n\nBurton is simultaneously the best and worst thing in this film. He's the best thing because he IS Richard Burton, and even his hammiest, most scene-chewing performances are worth watching in any film he happens to be in. In this case, Burton works overtime to give his character all the gravitas and portent he needs to carry the film. But he's the worst thing in the film because, well, the lines he has to deliver and the scenes he has to participate in are just plain ludicrous. It hurts me to see Burton like this...I hope he managed to pay off his condominium (or whatever financial need he had for this paycheck), because it's pretty obvious that he despises what he is doing in this film.\n\nAs for the other principle, Linda Blair...well, it's almost impossible to be fair to Blair regarding this movie. She can't really act, but the camera lends a certain hypnotic quality to her face in this movie, and Boorman exploits it for all he can. I think she tried hard to give Boorman what he wanted, but unfortunately what he wanted was for her to alternate \"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm\" with \"Pea Soup Vomiting Biker Slut From Hell\", and the results are basically unwatchable. I mean, we are talking Hayden-in-Attack-Of-the-Clones unwatchable. Blair was far better suited as a post-pubescent actress to the kind of \"Roller Boogie\"/\"Women in Cages\" things she did later,or as walk-on roles as herself, and I can only hope she eventually found happiness and contentment on the fringes of fame and celebrity.\n\nThis is said to be one of the most expensive films ever made for its time, and in \"E2:Heretic\"'s defense, most of the money is there on the screen. The \"African\" scenes are photographed and lit perfectly, detailed, and obsessively put together... they must have been murder to stage and shoot. The apocalyptic scenes (locust attacks, etc) are not especially convincing (especially to modern eyes accustomed to millions of dollars in CGI eye-candy) but there are plenty of them and the soundtrack and sound design work strenuously to convince the viewer that Nasty Things are going on here. In fact, I'd argue that the sound design is possibly the best thing about \"Heretic\", and if it hadn't been so meticulous and suitable, the movie would have been even less watchable than it is now.\n\n\"Heretic\" is a mess, no doubt about it, in the way that only a great director working from a horrible script (and with his head jammed firmly up his own rectum ) can make it. It's worth seeing once for Burton and Blair, and a weird role by James Earl Jones. But don't go out of your way to see it and DON'T, under any circumstance pay more than $5 to purchase, and then only on DVD with all the trimmings and extras."

No way. I have seen a whole lot worse. I think what the major problem is pertains to high expectations and low achievement. Nonetheless, Exorcist II: the Heretic is an entertaining film to degrees and though it is definitely a bad film - a film I found humorous for all the wrong reasons. Taking Richard Burton seriously as a priest is just one of the many problems the film has. Burton gives one of his typical performances but is competent in front of the camera. Academy award winner Louise Fletcher also is there to give varying degrees of credibility. The biggest problem is easily the muddled mess of a script. I saw the film and could not really explain what happened competently. I know that Regan is back and she still has the subconscious memories of what happened years ago. In order to exorcise these memories Burton goes to Africa to find James Earl Jones who is connected with a locust demon(?) Anywy the story sucks. But Boorman and his cast wend their way through the material and at the very least put something together that makes a little sense and is a bit of fun. I wasn't bored, and for me the worst thing a movie can be is boring. There are some powerful scenes in this film. I enjoyed SOME of the footage of Burton going to Africa. The opening scene of him exorcising a demon was well-shot. Max Von Sydow is back ala flashback. And last but certainly not least, Linda Blair returns giving a pretty good performance and looking quite beautiful and sexy. Make no mistakes, this film is a dud - but one of the worst films ever made? No way!"

The photography alone is worth the price of admission. And YES, millenials and gen Z Souls, Warner Brothers made a very healthy profit on this sequel. Richard Burton, Linda Blair, Louise Fletcher, James Earl Jones, Kitty Wynn, Paul Henreid and Max Von Sydow truly bring their A game in this truly chilling sequel. Exorcist 2: The Heretic was, perhaps, ahead of its' time, with themes of ultimate good attracting ultimate evil. Now, most true cinemaphiles consider it a masterpiece, which it is.

You might be surprised to hear this, but I'd still recommend seeing EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC, and especially if you enjoyed the original; it's such a jaw-droppingly awful abomination that you need to see it in order to believe it. What the hell were they all thinking? How do you follow up one of the scariest and most powerful box office horror classics with this type of garbage? You know you're in a heap of trouble when you've got actors like Richard Burton, Louise Fletcher and James Earl Jones and it turns out to be Kitty Winn (as Sharon) who gives the only credible performance. Linda Blair is terrible as Regan too, but nobody was expecting anything earth shattering from her anyway.\n\nIt's so much fun to trash this movie. There are so many areas to tear apart that one doesn't know where to begin. The \"script\" is utterly implausible and plays like the stuff born out of a bad acid trip where someone fried his mind the night before, wrote the film while tripping under the notion that he's found the key to life itself, and then awakens the next morning in a pool of vomit with no recollection and just a piece of paper with chicken scratch that he can't even read himself. There doesn't seem to be any point to the goings-on, and whatever plot can be surmised at all is ludicrous and confusing. The film is dumb, pointless, boring, badly acted, abysmally directed, and NON-FRIGHTENING. Idiotic dialogue abounds everywhere (\"Kokumo\"? \"Pazuzu\"?) and the music score from the great Ennio Morricone is stillborn.\n\nI've mentioned the poor acting, but I must devote a paragraph alone to Louise Fletcher (who had just won the Best Actress award for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST). She takes top honors as Worst Performer, even over Linda Blair. It's entrancing how ineffective and disinterested Fletcher appears throughout this film, delivering her lines as though she hasn't slept in a week. Yet another sign that director John Boorman was asleep at the wheel himself, or maybe a revelation that Miss Fletcher could never \"really\" act at all; her listless delivery makes me wonder if her emotionless nurse from CUCKOO'S NEST was not so much an Oscar worthy performance as it was Louise Fletcher just being herself.\n\nThat about covers it. The best thing that can be said for this turd is that some flashes of the cinematography are stronger than it deserves. You really owe it to yourself to see this thing at least one time. It's absolutely unbelievable. * out of ****"

John Boorman's follow-up to William Friedkin's thoroughly unsettling adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel is so far-removed from the mythos of \"The Exorcist\" that one wonders if the script was originally intended as a sequel in the first place. For the most part, \"The Heretic\" is a muddled possession tale whose intentions are never made clear: Father Lamont (Richard Burton) is drafted to investigate the details of Father Merrin's (Max von Sydow) death in the first film; this leads him back to recovering Regan (chipmunk-cheeked cutie Linda Blair), techno-psychiatrist Gene Taskin (Louise Fletcher, doing a kindler, gentler Nurse Ratched), and Kokumo (James Earl Jones), the young man Merrin exorcised in Africa. Given that \"The Exorcist\" is one of the best horror films ever made, it is hard to imagine what this sequel could have done to even remotely stand in its shadow. In 1973, Friedkin complained that Blatty's original screenplay relied too much on oblique symbolism; Friedkin wisely jettisoned these elements. Here, William Goodhart's script is heavy with ill-defined symbolism (locusts, y'dig?), and Boorman's direction is both bombastic (the conclusion has airplane turbulence, a car crash, and a house torn apart by supernatural vibes (or something) and ponderous (no less than 20 minutes are spent watching a dazed Burton aimlessly wander African villages). The film is filled with nonsensical moments: why does Taskin stop to help the crash victim when she has a plane to catch? why does Sharon (Kitty Winn, returning from the original) shatter the headlamp? how does Regan help the autistic girl talk? More importantly, why am I still watching this damn thing? Well...like the silly 'reverse hypnosis' machine employed by Dr. Taskin, \"Exorcist II\" lulled me into an apathetic trance...I didn't like the film...but I didn't hate it, either...it's fascinating, but in a completely ridiculous way...and not enough for anything more than an unintentionally-whimsical rental...(are you coming down to my level?)"

Of course it doesn't and probably will never exist anything like a synchronizer that synchronizes the minds of two persons. And yes, of course it's not necessary to have these lights at the synchronizer, but who the hell did ever had similar thoughts about the beamer of the enterprise?! Or did anybody had problems that in any (even the good) sci-fi movie of the 80s, you had to see the same \"futuristic\" typo graphs, which aren't even stylish nowadays and probably won't be in one hundred years, in which time these movies took place? So where's the problem about these unimportant things, what a \"synchronizer\" looks or sounds like? What's important is THE STORY, THE IDEA behind the movie. And the idea behind The Heretic is an interesting, mystic one. Compared to hundreds of other horror movies this one is a really good film. My recommendation: Go and watch it yourself, and make your own mind. By the way, I'm really into horror-movies, occult-thrillers and i've seen lots of films and splatter films don't knock me off the chair, but I never had to laugh at no time in this film...and that's good for a horror movie!"

If they do, it surely can only be for the reason that it is so poor it keeps it interesting because you keep wondering what is gonna be ballsed up next. The score is momentarily enigmatic, Reagan's Theme being particularly good. The acting is mostly dire, though how anyone else would have acted with such poor a script I do not know. The plot developments are laughable, the cinematography interesting with an attempt to be artsy though first and foremost Boorman should have made sure the film had a good script and capable actors. Despite the numerous flaws this film has, there's something about it which will keep me returning to watch it. For any Blair fans out there, she has never looked better than in this film. Arguably the only reason to watch it, except to witness the poorness for yourself."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is really deceiving to see \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\". I was awfully frustrated to see that such an amazingly awesome flick like the original Exorcist was completely destroyed by a lame sequel. It deserved so much better than this. The cinema industry sometimes need excuses to create a sequel but - for God's sake - make it worthy! I think Warner Bros. should have waited until they had a very good script for a sequel for the one written by William Goodhart simply raped with no mercy William Peter Blatty's masterpiece. I wasn't even born at the time when \"The Heretic\" was released back in 1977 but I can imagine the rage of the public that was expecting something at least on the same level of the first one.\n\nWe all know that it is a tough task to put out a sequel that is better than the first one. Yet, it is not impossible. We can mention, for instance, \"Terminator 2\". But in the case of \"The Heretic\" there simply was no reason at all to make such a crappy piece of work just for the sake of having a sequel.\n\nHowever, I do share the view that some people hold toward the idea that AT LEAST \"The Heretic\" explains how Father Karras really died in that room with Reagan. That is probably the only reason why someone should ever see this film.\n\nBy the way, let's not forget that back in 1977 \"The Heretic\" was the most expensive production Warner Bros. had ever done. God! - why didn't they wait until something worthwhile appeared!?!?!? It just really makes me angry. Sadly, \"The Heretic\" is a dull failure.\n\nJust to add something positive to \"The Heretic\": Ennio Morricone's music to the film kicks ass. He is the man!"

I am not even going to go into the whole locust idiocy. Let's just say that the producers must have used every locust in the free world to film this movie. Bad script, bad acting, cheesy special effects and a horrific (not in the good way) ending make this one of the worst films ever made in the history of Hollywood movies. On the plus side, Max von Sydow is the only watchable player in the film. My rating: 2 out of 10"

Problem being that if it hadn't been \"Exorcist II\" it likely would never have been made.\n\nDiscussing the film without thinking about the lurid details of its release (the laughter and booing from the audiences, or Boorman yanking the film from theatres after the first day to recut the whole thing) is a difficult task. \"Exorcist II\" has become, more than a film, a litmus test for sequels. In the opinion of some, no sequel has ever been this poor.\n\nWhich is unfair. Taken on its own, the movie is a curious mix of very inspired and very absurd moments and concepts. The casting is problematic and wildly uneven (Fletcher and Blair are fine, Burton is awful, and James Earl Jones steals the entire show). The script also veers from coherency to an almost surreal incompetence, sometimes in the same scene. And yet...\n\nAnd yet, this is a very misunderstood film. John Boorman was a very brave and unconventional choice as director, and he certainly accomplishes some startling and innovative visual effects. He is also to be commended for attempting to examine the concepts of the original film (and novel) in a metaphysical and nonlinear fashion. I've seen both cuts of the film and find that they differ from each other very little in overall impact. The fatal flaw in either version is the film's complete failure to prepare its audience for any of this material. Audiences were led to expect a carbon-copy repeat of the original and were instead confronted with this arty, heavily psychological mood piece. Understandably, they were a little upset.....\n\nIn no way does it accomplish its goals nearly as well as \"The Exorcist\", but I find this a far more enjoyable experience than Blatty's own \"Exorcist III\", which seems to have all of the elements with no idea as to how they should be executed.\n\nInfuriating, uneven, and quite beautiful. See it before you laugh at it."

Anyway enough of the babbling.\n\nThe films I love and that I find scary are the ones with good story lines (The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist etc.) but I had no idea what was going on. Even at the end. I found with The Shining everything came together towards the end but this I still have no idea what I watched. I would like to be able to press 'Contains Spoiler' but I don't know what there is to spoil. Most of this film is funny as well! I have no idea why they re-shot the exorcism, and the demons voice in it is laughable. I'm surprised William Peter Blatty (Author of The Exorcist) let this film be made.\n\nAnother thing, why is this film an 18?!?! It is not scary, has no gore, has no profanity at all, and has the slightest nudity (A pair of babylons for about 2 seconds). This film should be a 12 if anything.\n\nI supposed the only reason this deserves a 2 is because the music is composed by Ennio Morricone, who I love. and 'Regans Theme' is a beautiful piece of music.\n\nAs I say, watch this film out of curiosity but not because you want to see an interesting film. 2/10"

Bleary eyed priest Richard Burton is investigating the same lurid events and he discovers that some Africans were also possessed by the same demon. It's never clear how these things tie together, but there are some flashbacks featuring Max Von Sydow, James Earl Jones as an African shaman, and a lot of locusts. Director John Boorman clearly lost his way with this one. At one point we get a point of view shot from a locust! EXORCIST II makes no sense whatsoever but taken as a hallucinatory trip, it's actually kind of fun. There's a lot of weird music on the soundtrack courtesy of the great Ennio Morricone. Did any sequel to the original EXORCIST really stand a chance? It's doubtful, but this has to be seen to be believed!"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Devil is back at 8 Prospect Street in Georgetown. At least that was the intention of the directors of the terrible - in a bad sense - Exorcist 2: The Heretic, released four years after William Friedkin's absolute classic. The original easily assumes the top of any list of the best horror films of all time, even as many question its slow narrative and forget the boldness of William Peter Blatty's novel, something never anticipated at the time of its release. Nor did they imagine that that nearly $10 million production would one day hit the 200 million mark, drawing crowds to theaters with every new release or release.\n\nThis time the direction is by John Boorman, who had already declined to make the first film, for not agreeing with what he considered an abuse of minors. But the protagonist, Linda Blair (who steadfastly refused to wear the makeup of the first film), was now 18 years old, and Boorman agreed to direct this second episode of Regan McNeil. With the presence of veterans Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher, and an argument written by William Goodhart - who began by writing \"The Herectic\", based on the theories of paleontologist and archaeologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who inspired the figure of Father Merrin -, for John Boorman was the opportunity to realize what he called a metaphysical thriller.\n\nThere was no need to repeat the formula from the first film, putting the girl back tied to a bed, vomiting green goops and uttering obscenities. And even if they wanted to do the same thing, it wouldn't be possible. Linda Blair agreed to reprise the role as long as she didn't need to wear the heavy makeup again - in the sequel, the few possession scenes were performed by a double; Ellen Burstyn refused to take on Chris MacNeil again, even though she was nominated for an Oscar for Supporting Actress; and Max von Sydow was reluctant to reincarnate Father Merrin as the original had been such a success as it had negatively impacted his career. And both William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty had no desire to work on the film, especially since they learned what Warner Bros' intentions were. According to co-producer Richard Lederer, the kickoff of Exorcist 2 was practically a low-budget remake.\n\nIn the plot, after failing to exorcism a South American girl, Father Philip Lamont (Richard Burton) is given a mission by the Cardinal (Paul Henreid) to investigate the circumstances that led to the death of Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), who, as everyone who knows the original already knows, was the victim of a new encounter with the Assyrian demon Pazuzu. Due to his writings and testimonies, Merrin is considered a heretic, as the modern Church does not want to accept the existence of an evil entity capable of possessing bodies. Lamont meets Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), now in her late teens, trying to distract herself with tap dancing and constant psychiatric consultations by Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). The medical institute develops research and treatment for disabled children or children who have suffered trauma. Although she knows that Regan has forgotten the tragic events of the past, the doctor chooses to perform a synchronous hypnosis so that she can return to the room she had as a child, with permission from her and her tutor Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn, reprising the role), and with Lamont pressure. The experience nearly kills the doctor, with Lamont's witness, who can visualize the demon facing Regan for possession of Gene's heart.\n\nAfter visiting the former home of the MacNeils, the priest, during another hypnosis session, is led by the demon Pazuzu to another meeting with Merrin, who was trying to exorcise the young Kokumo in Africa. Believing that the boy has managed to face the devil, Lamont goes to Africa to retrace the paths of the deceased Father, even without the Cardinal's authorization. In the process, he will encounter hostility in some places until he meets the adult version of Kokumo (James Earl Jones), who will bring some teachings in the form of metaphors involving locusts. Regan starts to have nightmares, almost commits suicide jumping from the top of a building, and starts having some behavior changes that could suggest a possible return of the Devil. At this point, the film works with the idea that Evil has never abandoned the girl and there are two Regans: the one possessed by the devil and the one that was saved by Father Karras. Lamont believes the ultimate solution may be related to the old abode, where Regan should be able to confront the enemy, preventing her evil side from winning.\n\nOften considered one of the worst movies ever, this second chapter of \"The Exorcist\" disappoints, mainly, for not following the first film, either in tone, aesthetics, or even in the events. There being no possession here, the terror of \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" is only related to the imminence of a threat, without the oppression and violence felt in the preceding film, making a real and very visceral fight between good and bad. As a sequel to such an iconic and successful movie, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" fails completely. So it remains for it to be a kind of behind-the-scenes look at a story, in which we learn a little about the history of Pazuzu, travel to Africa, know more about Father Merrin (Max von Sydow reluctantly returned to film some flashbacks), and we see what happened to Regan four years later.\n\nThis second part totally abandons the battle between science vs. Faith to bring this more scientific concept, to bring the battle into the characters' minds. It is, however, very little, and worse when the film focuses on concepts as volatile as a brainwave synchronizer (Regan is calm, says she doesn't remember anything and just wants to go on with her life normally, but even so, Dr Tuskin decides to investigate the girl's mind with hypnosis to see if he can wake up the girl's worst nightmares), joint hypnosis, telepathy (even without the use of the synchronizer) and theories of universal goodness, the main symptom of which are the plagues of locusts. None of this was enough to impress audiences who even went to theaters but didn't like what they saw. The film reached the mark of 30 million viewers and garnered many negative reviews, some known as William Friedkin, who only watched half an hour of film and already attacked the directors: \"It's as bad as seeing a traffic accident!\". For all these reasons, added to a huge number of flashbacks, whose main effect is to cut the rhythm of the story, \"The Exorcist II: The Heretic\" has many ridiculous and boring moments, not even managing to take advantage of what would be its strongest points, the presence of Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher, and the deaf war they waged, opposing faith and science. Perhaps because of the frailty of the script, his characters always seem uncomfortable, and hardly believable.\n\nThere are also major flaws in the technical issues with total loss of quality, especially the laughable makeup, sound and special effects (the flight from the perspective of a grasshopper?) and Ennio Morricone's tribal music - in the opening scene of the exorcism. In a film designed to have a low budget, Boorman failed to achieve his intentions of filming in natural settings (such as Ethiopia, and in Georgetown, site of the MacNeil's first residence), having to create all the sets in the studio or in Warner's backyards, which left the film with an extremely amateur look. Everything that worked well in the original movie was totally left out in this sequel. We still have the obvious use of a double for Regan in transposing her face to the possessed version, but Linda Blair does her part well, effortlessly and without innocence, expressing her usual grimaces. The rest of the cast is totally underutilized. The roughly eight minutes in which Richard Burton made the same face, after the hypnosis session, was the subject of countless jokes at the time. In fact, it seems that the actor was mesmerized throughout the entire film, such was the actor's apathy throughout the entire film. Max von Sydow, Linda Blair and Louise Fletcher are completely wasted on a paltry script.\n\nIf The Original Exorcist easily enters any list of the best ones; the opposite can be said of this continuation. According to John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide, the feature is in the Top 10 of the worst productions of all time alongside Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space. Exorcist 2: The Heretic is very bad, boring, laughable, poorly performed and poorly directed (in many scenes the actors are poorly framed and the director doesn't notice it at all). A movie about Evil didn't need to be so bad. It could be said that the main error was the heresy in trying to continue in such an imbecile way a masterpiece, creating immense expectations and frustrating everyone. Not even the devil deserved it.... An Exorcist movie that doesn't look like The Exorcist. It's not frightening, it's not profane and it looks more like a film school experiment. This movie has a huge production behind it, the continuation of a classic that was a huge success, which makes the experience of watching it even more frustrating. In short, there was no reason for this movie to exist."

The second movie was based on an actual event. Unfortunately they were also trying for a sequel to Linda's original. Anneliese Michel, the lady the Emily Rose was based on, was a German college student and died in 76. The Exorcist 2 was made, or finished in, 77. The plots to the two movies are so similar in ways it is not funny. The character of the person who was watching Reagan, I believe, represented the trial and jury. Metaphors can be an amazing thing. Yes, I think that this movie could have actually followed the life story of Anneliese Michel a bit better, but it would have strayed from The Exorcist thesis."

        "review_detailed_main": "Exorcist 2 The Heretic is not as good as The Exorcist or The Exorcist 3, but is still and okay movie. It focusses more on Fr Merrin and his friend, as well as when he exorcised a young boy in Africa. This film is VERY dissapointing for fans of The Exorcist because this one trys to be a horror film, but fails, it's not scary and it's angles and cinematography is not brilliant. But after all of this it is still watchable. Some people will like this one better because it is more simple and less complicated and meaningful as The Exorcist. This film was very cheap and tacky, but still manages to be watchable. I wouldn't go out and spend \u00a320 on a DVD version of it, but is worth watchign if it is on TV or if you find a copy going cheap. This one is far more for young children rather then the adult audience that the Exorcist was aimed at. It is still a good movie with some good acting in it. The script and film could have done with a lot of worth, but is certainly not as good as The Exorcist because it trys to be somthing it isn't, it takes away the scaryness of Pazuzu. Before Exorcist 2 people thought that the possesser of Regan was THE Devil, which would have been much better, but now this film has made it look like the whole thing must become cheaper. Still - watch it if it is on or going cheap at a shop, but it is still no match against William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist Directed by William Friedkin."

        "review_detailed_main": "The 1974 original is hands down my favourite movie of the 70\u2032s and probably my favourite horror movie of all time, but I never saw the sequels as I heard only bad press. So when while trawling the weekly horror rack I spotted the Exorcist 2 I thought why not? Now that I have seen it I can tell you why YOU shouldn't bother.\n\nFollowing on about 4 years from the events of the first film we find Linda Blair back as Regan, who is either delusional or simply in denial about her previous demonic possession, though she still frequently visits a psychiatric practise with several other patients.\n\nAn early highlight is a meeting with a fellow patient which results in the following exchange: Patient - \"What's wrong with you?\" Regan - \"I was possessed by a demon. It's OK he's gone.\" What cracked me up is the light and breezy way she says the above, almost like she was saying \"Looks like rain, don't worry I've got an umbrella.\" Anyway plot: Richard Burton is Father Lamont, a priest commissioned to look into the events of Regan's exorcism, in particular the death of Father Merrin, who reappears in flashback and whose reputation had come into question as a result. After Lamont gets too involved in Regan's situation he is removed from the \"case\" and goes to Africa to find another boy possessed by the demon (now named Axui-Xui \"ah-zoo-zoo\") to discover more..... and hilarity ensues.\n\nWithout spoilers, Lamont and Regan can share visions by putting on headbands with cords attached to nothing and looking at a cheesy disco strobe light and speaking slowly.\n\nIn the very first usage of what they call \"synchronised hypnosis\" Regan's doctor goes into shock and Lamont simply picks up the headband and without ever using the thing before is able to drag her out. After which the event is never spoken of again! One more clumsy exchange featuring the \"spirit\" (apparently piloting a helicopter and buzzing wild animals) later and off goes the plot into whatever is required to set up some pretty awkward scenes that I am sure the director felt would be coo-oooollllll. My favourite recurring motif is that of the \"hover-locust\", literally a locust that is able to furiously beat its wings without advancing.\n\nThe less said about the finale the better, I really had no idea of what was supposed to be happening, who was in danger and what was real or a flashback. It just seemed they ran out of ideas and noisy and confusing means scary, not just noisy and confusing.\n\nThis movie is the poster child of why a good movie sometimes should be allowed to stand on its own, without being soiled by dodgy sequels. I can't believe that quality actors signed up for this rubbish. Richard Burton! Max Von Sydow!! James Earl Jones!?! The special effects are pretty dodgy but that is probably more a by-product of the film being made in 1977.\n\nMy biggest criticism, and the harshest I can render on any flick, is that it achieve its primary purpose. A comedy should at least be funny, an action flick should have some action and a horror movie should be scary. Obvious right? The only time I got scared of this movie was when I checked the time and realised there was 25 minutes still to go.\n\nFinally the director should be ashamed for sexing up Linda Blair, who was about 16 or so when filming, the first shot has her jiggling about in a crop top and it is obvious that the costume department didn't have room in the budget for a bra! I hate a lot of films, this one is so boring I couldn't summon the passion to even care. I can't come up with anything worse really.\n\nFinal Rating - 3 / 10. So bad it's... just bad.\n\nIf you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"

My fave mo is when Burton grabs the ridiculous head set rig to speak to Satan (or maybe it was Liz Taylor). All that blood, money and talent wasted. Like the invasion of Iraq."

Best viewed as a curiosity, but if you're an Exorcist aficionado skip II and go straight to III. A worthy and underrated sequel."

The musical score just got on my nerves.\n\nThis is a truly bad film but one of those bad films that is totally watchable just to see how much worse it is going to get right up to the hilarious climax - fires, swarming insects, Linda Blair in wedge healed espadrilles... its all there.\n\nThe film is confusing, very silly, and badly acted but I still think everyone who likes horror films should watch it!"
