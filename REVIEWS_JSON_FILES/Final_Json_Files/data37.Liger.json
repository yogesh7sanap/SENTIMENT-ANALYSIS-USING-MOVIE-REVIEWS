So many movies were copied and nothing new content was found, story is also very old and we have gone through many movies like this. Mike Tyson was wasted, even Vijay Deverakonda was wasted. Songs are worst, not that much impressive.\n\nOverall, this Liger went rampage towards audience in theatre, better save ur time and money. The only thing u get from this movie is headache..!"

There will be further research into Liger. This video is unlike any other in that you must see it from beginning to end to really comprehend what is going on... A result like this is unforeseeable. When it comes to Bollywood film choreography, this is among the best. Vijay gives a convincing and likeable performance in the flick. The ups and downs of each MMA fighter's life were depicted with great nuance and accuracy."

        "review_detailed_main": "Vijay Deverakonda has a great screen presence and that might've saved him and Puri Jagnath in this film.\n\nThe first hour - of the movie was decent, the first fight scene was clean, the camera caught all hits in the right angle and flashed crisp moves. The curiosity of the movie was on the right track - meaning, quiet a few movies nowadays are pretentious after a few minuites in.\n\nThe characters's introductions were also adequet. Ramya Krishna's, Vijay, Ronit Roy and Ananya paday and Liger's fellow fighters. Ronit Roy's role as a coach was decent, he advised appropriatley but had not much importance later on in the movie. Ramya Krishna's role was decent until the second half. For example, her expressions and her chnage of positin was awkward when she tried to show off as a proud mother after Liger's MMA championshoip. She tried to emmunate her intensity onto the audiance as she did in Bahubali. And the frame there was blurry, it felt like Puri Jaganth did not polish the movie well.\n\nAnother place Puri did not polish well was when Liger was figting Mark Anderson, the camera did not deviate properly when Tyson punched Liger. And when Liger threw the last strike on Tyson, a lady's back covered the frame and did not show how Mark Anderson fell to ground. That was disappointing.\n\nMike Tyson was so random, he was working for some underworld mafia thing, and Liger fought him to save the heroine. What? If Tyson showed up at the International MMA Match as an advisor, or something relating to MMA he would of been more of a useful character and also would of recived some respect to his career. His role was very disappoiting.\n\nThe most diassapointing was the ending of the movie. It made me wonder if this movie was a about a random love story or actually about fighting. We don't even know if he won the International MMA. The love story was very random, like there was no emotional connection. She saw him fight and felt lust. The character had no scope. She mentioned going to Vegas to pursue acting but her dad says she is pursuing modeling. Another thing Puri, Nevada is a state and Vegas is in Nevada. Liger did not go to Nevada (again) to bring Tanya. Puri did not polish the movie and the dialogues were not polished either. As an audience I come to the movie to escape into another world, not to get confused.\n\nVijay Deverakond's acting was just a few stammering dialogues and fighting. Ananya Panday's acting was decent her character was bad so I can't seem to judge that well. Ramya Krishna's acting was overwhelming. Ronit Roy's acting had a lot of close up shots and so the lipsnching being off was very noticable.\n\nOverall, the movie was very random, - random songs, random love story, random dailouges, and a lot of fights. The fights are only part I am not complaining about. At the least the movie is not pretentious, so I still like you Puri.\n\nMy rating 2.7/5 or I guess 6/10."

All eyes are on the stage, and the audience members are riveted. I always looked forward to the combat scenes in the movies. There isn't a single character who hasn't done their part to ensure the film's success. This is an excellent film. There is nothing missing from this.

That point it touched."

Stories filled with humanity, wit, and wisdom! In addition, I would want to convey my appreciation for the excellent quality of the film they created. Vijay Deverakonda's change in Liger is breathtaking, and he delivers an impassioned performance. The play has grabbed the crowd. I particularly loved seeing battle sequences in the movies. The success of the film was due in large part to the efforts of each and every one of the characters. What a great film! It has everything you need.

The guy playing his son was solid but not exactly awe inspiring.\n\nRamya did an impressive job as always.\n\nVijay is the heart and soul of this production. He's got into incredible shape and his efforts in the time looked believable.\n\nThe action was high octane and believable.\n\nPeople are jumping on the bandwagon and panning it but I think it's a good effort and found watching it an enjoyable experience."

Suspense, romance, comedy, and motivation are all present! Furthermore, I admire their efforts and want to thank them for creating such a high-quality image. Seeing Vijay Deverakonda transform into Liger and deliver such an intense performance is very remarkable. Going to the cinema is a popular pastime for many people.

        "review_detailed_main": "All the main plot holes and rape culture celebration has been already called out in so many reviews. I would like to call out some lesser called out points that can still flop a movie by themselves: 1. Ananya Pandey: her character is unbearable. She believes the protagonist is an internet troll but falls in love with him the second she sees him fight. She gets kidnapped, but gets excited for a selfie with the kidnappers. She shames the hero so that he will get serious and work on his MMA goals, reminds me of my despicable teachers who used to beat us as kids for our own good. She and her gang talks like caricatures of bimbos in Hollywood comedies. I am sorry Ananya, but acting is not your thing.\n\n2. Chunky Pandey: his character is so flamboyant that it beats some of the most stereotyped gay characters. He is so rich that he can fly a whole MMA club to US in charter but he does not pay back loans. He is cool with his daughter wandering Vegas strip when he owes money to criminal gangs. Most of what is wrong with his character is poor writing but sub par acting and a crappy accent makes it worse.\n\n3. The Sanju character: he is the top contender for national MMA champion title, but he has no fighting scenes to attest his fighting skills. He is just painted as a villain who deserves a beating.\n\n4. 'The' Vijay Devarakonda: 'The' superlative was part of the title scene. He has not earned it yet. He has continued his streak of choosing a misogynistic hero character.\n\n5. US immigration: Chunkey Pandey's character has a guy in US embassy who gets Visas for Liger's team in a day. As an immigrant watching that from US, I felt like spitting on the screen. We wait months and years in line for the visa. This scene has no basis in fact.\n\n6. Liger's dad was a fighter whose nick name was Lion. Liger gets his name because his dad was nicknamed Lion and his mother calls herself a Tigress. There isn't a single scene where this is justified. The temple scene proves she is dumb, her demanding free MMA training for her son proves she is needy and all scenes prove she is loud. None of them are characteristics of a Tiger. Ergo, the movie's name is BS.\n\n7. Jokes: it will just suffice to say that they are very poor jokes 8. What boxing movie has no training montage? That could have been something watchable for a few mins.\n\n9. The fights: street fights are shown in great detail but the actual MMA championship is shown few seconds each round.\n\nSome of the actors and movie makers have recently spoken against the negative reviews and how it is effecting them. This movie is still in theaters and not in OTT yet. Which means all the negative reviews are from people who actually paid and watched this in a theater. There is no refund policy for a bad movie. And the makers and actors have already profited from our hard earned ticket money. This is an unavoidable repercussion for making a bad movie. Man/woman up and deal with it."

The film has greatly motivated me, since I now have a greater appreciation for the commitment and discipline required to become an outstanding athlete. Ananya Panday and Vijay Deveraoonda both delivered strong performances in Liger. The film has the perfect amount of drama, romance, and action. The Holy Mass is shown in this film. Action. Entertainment. Vijay delivers an outstanding performance that propels the film ahead. After seeing this video, I have a newfound respect for the devotion and sacrifice needed by professional sportsmen. Excellent work was done by Ananya Panday and Vijay Deveraoonda in Liger. There is a great harmony between the film's action, romance, and drama. There's a lot of action and fun in this movie."

I have a lots of expectation from this movie. All your hard work in to dustbin. Your stammering on screen did not work at all . Totally tourtured movie. Worst acting, worst writing, Cringy dialogue. *CRINGE ALERT* For those Whoever plan to watch movie. Ananya should go to acting and dancing class first if she wants to do more movies but its for sure that I'm not going to watch her any single movie from today.

But, lesson for us is: don't brag until the project hits the buzz.\n\nHere, the buzz just fizzles and it's like a tiny short circuit that lasted for a few moments into the movie. This movie reminds me of a crass joke, Liger is all gags and no puke!\n\nFew adjectives for this heavily inflated movie:\n\nCringe. (For the dialogs) Apathetic. (For the emotions) Boring (For the storyline)\n\nYet I have to say it's an absolute pleasure to see Ramya on screen with age apt roles. She is beautiful and has proven her acting prowess since her ' Criminal' days. I would watch any movie of hers on big screen out of sheer respect and admiration. Disclaimer: this doesn't absolve the writer who made her a loudmouth mom.\n\nMother-Son equation didn't evoke the instinctive feelings this time, surprisingly. There should have been more information around this duo to get us involved in their journey.\n\nLiger is like the Lays packet - more air than solid.\n\nThen that matchstick cast against the hero as heroine, all I have to say is \"y tho?\""

Every supporting/junior artists with the main cast were very unexperienced with acting. I really don't know how, great actors such as Vijay, Ramya Krishnan and Ronit Roy agreed on doing this film. After spending so much time and money on Production of this movie, this is what they show the audience and then everyone expects the audience to like this type of Films. I personally think that this movie is a disrespect towards the art of Film/Cinema. Me and few people had left the theater after the interval. It's Very disappointing to see The Indian Film Industry doing this...idk what the future is going to be if this is what they call Filmmaking."

        "review_detailed_main": "Liger is a 2022 Pan Indian film directed by puri Jagannath. Starring Vijay Devarakonda, Ananya Pandey in leads, supported by Ramya Krishnan, Ronit Roy and also Mike Tyson in form of a cameo.\n\nStory- Liger is a boy from karimnagar( TS) who gets shifted with his mother to the wide spreaded Mumbai. As he has plans to be prepared for MMA which isnt a course but a league called Mixed Martial Arts from a coach/leader (Ronit Roy). The reason behind opting him as a coach, should be watched while it contains a tinge of a twist. When gets the chance of showing his skills ,he proves and becomes a part of the coaching institute. After adapting all the techniques and having defeated the opponent in national levels he paves the way to the MMA league. How and what difficulties he faced during this ,should be watched (not really).\n\nOverview and impressions The flick directed by puri is moreover a commercial and illogical one. The only positive in this movie is the \"vijay\" . He did his best, as the true work can be seen . But also because of his over confidence led the movie to a dip. The dubbing seems to be very week. The Songs weren't really good and appears suddenly. This what happens when each song is composed by different composers . Although bgm was somewhat good. It suites to the vijay's transformation. Liger is seen with stammering issues which is ok but after few mins it gets annoying.\n\nDir Puri known for his mass taking, makeover of the hero, impactful dialogues and many more tried to do the same here but it failed miserably. Comparing it with his previous Flicks was a big blunder done by the people.\n\nThe dialogues throughout the film felt shrinking and didn't make any impact.\n\nEditing and screenplay were drowsy in their forms\n\nThe Characterisation of Ananya Pandey may fulfil to few masses. However her way of acting was intolerable and prodding.\n\nEntire training scenes of Vijay were shown motivating also in such a way that it could make you demotivated because of the descending screenplay.\n\nMother sentiment added is a big drawback.\n\nNowadays every film is concentrating on the mothers to make their sons monsters.\n\nTheir role is just to motivate you and nothing else. Caring and affection can be seen in few movies.\n\nBiggest factor \"Fight\" ,itself is missing in it as every match of the league gets covered in a song\"attack\". Except this song solid fights cannot be seen in the Movie. Felt the fights could've been more .\n\nAbrupt climax. Misuse of Mike Tyson. I don't know why but it seemed Mike Tyson's cameo was senseless and lethargic.\n\nVerdict It was puri who messed it up and not vijay. Liger is therefore a spoiled broth by the creators. It's definitely not worth the hype nor the words.\n\nHoping for a solid comeback for the duo with \"Jana Gana Mana\"."

Vijay Deverakonda looks good and puts in a heartfelt performance, but he can't salvage a substandard script. Ananya Panday is pathetic. Ramya Krishnan is constantly yelling for no reason. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Music is bad. Rating 1.5/5."

As an actor, Vijay Deverakonda is top-notch, and he did a fantastic job in this part. This film was directed by Puri, one of the greatest directors of all time.

Yes , it's \"LIGER\".\n\nPuri Jagannath has established that he is no more a relevant director and will soon vanish into oblivion. I still can't come to terms that he has directed such a movie even if KJo is behind producing this crap We admired his work in Idiot, Pokiri, Businessman.\n\nVijay , as he said, in his interview worked his way up in the Telugu film industry .No doubt that his hard work reflects in his performance but he chose a lacklustre script to make a comeback.\n\nAnanya Pandey was absolutely pathetic with her acting skills. To say the least, her screen presence is unbearable. She definitely has to go back to the drawing board and introspect .The scenes between Vijay and Ananya were absolutely not called for and would require a pain balm for relief.\n\nThe only saving grace was Rajmata Ramyakrishna to whom every loving and caring mother can relate to. I still remember the role of Nilambari that she portrayed opposite superstar Rajnikanth in Padayappa . She indeed stole the show in this flick as well. No doubt that any director can bank on her.\n\nThe casting of Ronit Roy as the constantly motivating coach was perfect and so was his performance.\n\nThe songs are forgettable and so is the bgm. This movie required a really good bgm to keep it alive.\n\nThe initial fight sequences were good but the MMA fight sequences were not very inspiring leaving the audiences high and dry.\n\nMike Tyson, Man, you made a joke of yourself. We were expecting an Ipman type cameo.\n\nAll in all, the movie is extremely predictable and irritating for the most part. Go for Karthikeya 2 if you don't mind watching it again."

Tigers will be watched in the future. This film is remarkable in that it must be watched in its entirety to make sense of the events... It is impossible to determine if this would have occurred.

The film itself is a crossbreed of Telugu Cinema and Bollywood (Kjo is co-producer) which explains why the talentless Ananya Pandey is cast as the heroine opposite Vijay Deverakonda The end result is a super silly actioner which would only add to the big budget flops piling up in Bollywood since the last few months...\n\nAn aspring mixed martial arts (MMA) champ who falls for a richie rich 'ladki' only to get spurned by her later due to his chronic stammer; Liger neither convinces nor entertains!! The hero's mamma (Ramya Krishnan) only screams and yells at the camera. Infact, the tempo of the film is forever hyper that Chunky Pandey appearing as Ananya ke docile pitaji in second half appears the most nuanced character of them all. Help!!\n\nI had seen Vijay before in Arjun Reddy (2017) and the actor can certainly fire if he gets a good script. Unfortunately, Liger doesn't give him any scope. The stammer appears forced at times and doesn't really add value to the narrative. As for the much touted Mike Tyson cameo, the whole thing turns out to be an extended joke the legend would certainly regret to be a part of. There is also a well conceived fight between Liger and a dozen trained women fighters which appears promising at first but is whiled away completely when the hero tamely submits himself to them instead of touching them. Ouch!!\n\nThe last Hindi film Puri Jagannadh directed was Amitabh Bachchan's Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap (2011) which was a spoof on the angry young man phenomenon and irrespective of its box office fate, I found it fun. Comparatively, Liger misses its target by miles!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni."

His fights are excellent, and so is the dance in Coka Song & Akdi Pakdi. Full marks to the hero and the director in this aspect.\n\nAnanya Panday on her debut in Tollywood is quite impressive. She is very glamorous with her screen presence and at the same time, amazed everyone with her performance too.\n\nRamya Krishnan as Vijay Deverakonda's mother shined in her role. Her ferocity and intensity are what a passionate mother needs and she portrays the same.\n\nMike Tyson, the international champ is undoubtedly the special attraction of the film. His presence lights up the screen and the spirit of the film. His scenes with Vijay Deverakonda are spellbinding.\n\nVishnu Reddy is okay in his limited role. Ronit Roy as a boxing coach is decent. Other artists such as Getup Srinu are okay in their respective roles.\n\nTechnical values : Director Puri Jagannadh's basic idea of making a film on mother sentiment and incorporating action part in it is good but completely dilutes the proceedings with his routine template writing.\n\nThe background score composed by Sunil Kashyap is okay. Songs composed by various musicians are good.\n\nThe cinematography work by Vishnu Sharma is okay as he tried to showcase the locations in the USA on a colourful note.\n\nThe action episodes are the best part of the entire film and the credit goes to the stunt director Kecha and his team.\n\nDharma Productions & Puri Connects production values are good.\n\nHighlights : Vijay Deverakonda Performance Action Sequences First Half\n\nDrawbacks : Routine Story & Screenplay Direction."

I really liked Vijay's performance he was energetic and took up the screen presence well even with the significantly less amount of dialogue. I hated the social commentary on social media and how women dress like huh?? I thought this was a MMA sports drama.\n\nAbsolutely trash film and an especially garbage sports drama.

        "review_detailed_main": "Liger sticks out like a sore thumb in Puri's career - calling this his worst film too is an understatement. He takes the audience for a ride while not even making a basic effort to tell a story or entertain. The film is a big, plain bore. The screenplay is a gargantuan mess - Puri is clueless in driving conversations in his sequences. His precise, straightforward dialogues were once his USP; in Liger, he is now a pale shadow of his past.\n\nThe rags-to-riches story is mounted without the slightest hint of authenticity. Vijay Deverakonda's stammering is the only trace of vulnerability in the film. Contrastingly, Liger is filled with scenes where every second character takes a dig at him for the same reason. There are only two women who play a key role in Liger's life - his mother, who constantly reminds him of his ambitions and a girlfriend who's a mannequin-equivalent and keeps distracting him from his dreams.\n\nAnanya Panday's Tanya is a classic example of Puri reducing the women in his films as objects. Tanya's pals advise her to use her physique to make a mark on Instagram and even have the gall to tell her, 'guys check out girls from bottom to top' and she doesn't mind the idea at all. This is precisely how Puri visualises the female leads in most of his films and unfortunately, this doesn't come as a surprise. Ramya Krishna keeps referring to Tanya as a devil in Liger - but the devil is the writing here.\n\nThe film pompously quotes Bruce Lee as a philosopher and places Mike Tyson as an inspirational figure in the protagonist's life. The director mistakes mental strength to be the pitch of his characters - they constantly need to shout to garner attention, even if they don't make any sense. In every random scene, Vijay says 'We're Indians' or 'I'm a fighter'. As a viewer though, the only fight is with your tolerance levels. Ronit Roy's only job is to remind Liger to 'Focus, focus and focus!!'\n\nLiger is remotely tolerable as long as the film is set in Mumbai. Once Vijay leaves for the US, the film falls apart like a pack of cards. From music to cinematography and the patchy production design and the supposed scale, there's no department in Liger that can even remotely distract the viewers and do some minimal damage control. The background score is painfully amateurish and the song situations are lazily designed. Most sequences are shot in Hindi and have been dubbed in Telugu later.\n\nThe stunt choreography is unimaginative, to put it mildly. In a scene, the baddies and Vijay keep slapping each other in a supposed display of their machismo. Was this supposed to be an unintentional dig at Arjun Reddy? Ali and Getup Srinu's characters are wasted efforts to tickle your funny bones. In fact, it is Mike Tyson's laughable cameo that makes the viewer laugh at his own plight. Chunky Pandey and Vishu Reddy are hapless even in their minimal screen time.\n\nVijay Deverakonda is a total misfit in Puri Jagannadh's universe - his stuttering makes no impact at all. He solely trusted the filmmaker with this and the latter lets him down big time. One can conveniently blame Ananya Panday for the absence of any screen presence, but could any other actress have done a better job with such a one-note character? Bad films leave you with a migraine but Liger isn't even capable of that. It's that forgettable.\n\nLiger, simply put, is a catastrophe. You had to take Vijay Deverakonda seriously when he said 'Waat Laga Denge'. Even 15-minute short films have more to tell than what Liger has to say in over 140 minutes."

Come on she is a better actress but what's wrong with her. Went too over board each and every scene. She seem to be super and over excited with the role and got carried away with it completely.\n\nAnd it does not end here, adding insult to injury the daddy Panday is also there, in a complete out of the blue unnecessary role.\n\nThen there is the Armour of God, Jackie Chan fight scene copy, made completely to the bin. And in the end, what on earth they did with Mike Tyson, what horrible lines, ridiculous dubbing and yes there was again Ananya going over board.\n\nThe movie was having a good plot, was having tons of budget, good movie title as well.

Documentaries on historic sports figures are my preferred viewing. The legend of the best MMA fighter is one of my all-time favorite stories. They are a living legend in our town and the athletic world. Everyone in Bollywood, from seasoned veterans to newcomers, can learn something from Vijay's dogged persistence. This weekend marks the long-awaited debut of Liger, a tiger-themed film. I had no reservations about the film's success after seeing the trailer because I am a huge fan of the artists in south Indian cinema. Movies on well-known sportsmen are my absolute favorites. Understanding the finest mixed martial arts competitors is fascinating to me. They are legends in our books and in the history of sports. Vijay has done a lot for the Bollywood community, and all the actors, including the young ones, owe him a lot."

If you think your toned body can bring people to the theatre, this movie should be a wake up call for you.\n\nThe new age movie goer expects better craft, a good story line and good technical back up. The movie runs very plane and it doesn't connect you with atleast one seen properly. Two of mother sentiment seens connect you but immediately after that you ll think unnecessarily connect to that seen and you feel like why I got fool. No story line, atleast one song is also not good listen in theatre.

Ronit Roy in his role as the coach is convincing and his presence and the initial action sequences are the only interesting part of the movie.\n\nAnanya's role as a rich kid and the dialogues given to her are laughable.

Still iam not beleive super star Mahesh pokiri cinema directed by the same director .The said movie also a block buster in Tamil remake acted by super star vijay\n\nNo comments on Vijay he done the justice for his role eventhough no plot he carry the movie on his shoulders.\n\nAnanya Pandey my sincere advice pls go and learn some acting skills in any cinema institute .\n\nRamya Krishnan role totally wasted in this movie. Because of pan India hype movie released in all languages. There will be a pride moment about South films as of now. This movie definately turned the negative impression among north Indian audiences and the overconfidence level is high in this cinema for director and he will get the praise for that."

We get hundreds of such movies in South film industries with similar plot. You guys need to work on your acting especially the actress Ananya Pandey. No expression can be seen when she delivers the dialogue. I am just confused on the role of ronit roy and chunky pandey, what were they doing in this movie."

My attention is totally devoted on the screen in front of me. Near the end of the movie, Mike Tyson makes an appearance as the fictional character Mark Henderson. Persistence and hard work are required for success. The film is fantastic. Both the cast and the director performed admirably. Despite the fact that over three hours had gone, not a single moment had been squandered. The film is instantly engaging. I can't help but keep looking at the screen. At the film's climax, Mike Tyson pops up as the fictional character Mark Henderson."

Little that I know about screenplay, No transfer from one cut to the other was not made in a way that makes the audience understand. The editing part was very bad. There were no good cuts in the movie especially after watching great editing from a teenager , You can expect more from an experienced professional. Music doesn't hit the top. And the acting was very fake. The characters are very fake and it felt like a weekly show on TV. The director himself mentioned that he took the point of stammering hero and tried to build a story around him. You better build a story first and build a character according to the story next time. Not a pleasant watch."

Ananya pandey looks silly in dialogue delivery and competes with Vijay in bad acting . Both proved themselves as half baked actors. Old story of boy cheated by girl . Looks like all stage for the actor to come for the fight and opponent is also ready to be defeated by hero. The movie doesn't create any impression of reality. The movie is much below from expectation. Even you start getting bore in first half. You will found lots of mindless action sequences, arbitrary songs and a story that lacks logic- 'Liger' feels like an ordeal to sit through. There is absolutely no emotional connection in the film and this is where Liger disappoints. There is no proper conflict in the film and the hero's journey looks half-baked. The love story is also forced and does not create much interest.\n\nThe twist featuring Ananya Pandey looks silly and has not been handled well. The mother's sentiment is also loud and lacks proper depth. There are no high moments in the film."

Ramya Krishnna garu's character was also well crafted and she was excellent few her dialogues were so intesful 3. Fights are the base of the film. All the fights were so amazing.\n\n4. Mike Tyson himself being in the film is biggest plus 5. Film also has a bit of a comedy in it.\n\nNow minuses 1. I strongly feel the depth is missing we can't really get into the film it just feels like floating on a boat but audience never get to swim in the emotions and intense 2. The pluses I mentioned above arent used well enough I felt there need to be more fights then unnecessary songs which weren't at timing even Tyson sir losing to vijay wasnt easy to take instead Tyson sir giving heroine and vijay in finale would be better 3. Except the waat laga denge and liger title track none was valid and required 4. Herione is the biggest minus I will not completely blame ananya for this but also the character written was not at all required the film would go well if the hero was fighting for his mother pride.\n\n5. I felt heros fall and rise are like as he is a hero he should fall and rise if not ppl won't like it I didn't felt he learened from his any of his falls too he didn't listen to his mom and master abt his love again and again and again.\n\nFelt more like a PowerPoint presentation or a pre shoot than a film it was more like finishing checklist he should do this and that and go here and there."

He or his PR team should have at least done some back ground research about the script and story.\n\nAnanya pandey acting was way below par. No expressions and abysmal performance. There are better sports drama films to watch and its sad there is no creativity at all in Bollywood industry.\n\nThis experiment of bringing puri or south actor but putting them in the same mould of failed Bollywood production houses such as Karan Johar will be a good lesson for any such future collaboration. Limiting the talents of puri and Vijay I believe sure belongs to Karan Johar and dharma productions. Please invest on creating good scripts and plots.\n\nMy suggestion is to defnitely avoid this movie and thank me for your saved money and time."

Vijay Deverakonda is today's Man of the Day for his outstanding performance and breathing as #LIGER. He also outperforms his previous efforts... Kudos! Purchase tickets right away.

Semms Vijay was just casted to incash the outsider trend and satisfy his wish for pan india movie and big lauch by dharma. Talent of ramya krishnan and mike tyson is totally wasted. The movie would be much better without ananya and the songs. This is puri jagganath's worst movie till date. Punch dialogue doesnt have any punch in them.

Vijay is a over confident fellow and thinks he is real life arjun reddy and shows that attitude. Hope this movie disaster teaches him some good lessons. I don't know how they came out and told people that this movie will shake india. It shook me in a different way. I should never judge a movie by its teaser. What a load of dump.

        "review_detailed_main": "The journey of Tanya_underskirt to Tanya_theStar would have looked a better story than Liger's journey into the world of MMA. Puri's haphazard writing combined with his trademark direction, ended up giving a really bad film which tests one's patience right from the first act. I even thought about stopping the movie on Hotstar half a dozen times within the first half itself. The story is about Liger's (THE Vijay Devarakonda) mother Balamani (Ramya Krishna) wanting him to become a National level MMA champion. She gets Christopher (Ronit Roy) to be his coach for free and one of Christopher's condition is no girls as they cause distraction. Enters Tanya (Ananya Panday) who distracts Liger and then breaks up with him. His stammering being the reason for break up is the only natural thing Tanya does in the entire movie. How Liger overcomes the heartbreak and turns his focus to be the champion he is meant to be, but this is not that kind of movie.\n\nThe first act itself has enough scenes that trigger with Puri's trademark dialogues. All the Tolly actors have spoken their lines in Telugu while the Bolly actors speaking their lines in Hindi. The lip sync gave it away, I can only wonder how fun was it shoot that way. The screenplay is something one expected to come across an early 2000s bad movie. And that third act involving Mike Tyson which made no sense and looked so forced into the script like a last minute addition. May be if one watches this as a parody movie then it can be enjoyed otherwise sitting through this is a sheer torture."

Along with action and romance, the film has just the right amount of drama. This film is jam-packed with action and suspense. The film is driven forward by Vijay's excellent performance. The video's portrayal of an athlete's daily routine and the grueling amount of effort that goes into becoming one served as a powerful inspiration to me."

The film was about three hours long, but it was never dull or uninteresting. This film is amusing from the very beginning. Throughout that period, I was glued to the television. As the fictitious character Mark Henderson, Mike Tyson appears in the film's climactic scene. To achieve any goal, you must work consistently and persistently at it. This film was enjoyable to see. The cast and crew should be commended for their efforts. Despite the fact that the race lasted more than three hours, there were no dull moments. The film's high energy and good humor are immediately apparent. It turned out I'd spent the whole time glued to the tube. At the end of the movie, Mike Tyson shows up as the made-up Mark Henderson."

His performance lacked a natural ebb and flow. Ananya was perfectly cast as the primary female character. And as an actor, Vijay Deverakonda was flawless. This film is the work of Puri, widely recognized as a top contemporary filmmaker. Moreover, I can view this film whenever it suits me, regardless of my mood or schedule. A true artistic creation. We get sherr and shivers when we see the Indian flag on Vijay Deverakonda. There are no words to explain how breathtaking this film is. At best, his performance was mediocre. Ananya was the greatest pick for the primary female role. As an actor, Vijay Deverakonda is top-notch. The idea for the film came from Puri, one of the best directors working today. In addition, I don't have to consider my mood or schedule while seeing this video. This is real art, not some fake imitation."

The songs are modable but Ananya Pandey is perfectly miscast in the movie.\n\nYou can only watch it for Vijay, and I recommend you to do it, for which atleast one can see Vijay's acting capabilities pretty well and clean and it can be appreciated.\n\nNice to see Vijay improvement in and out through out the movie.\n\nVijay saves the day and the movie and mainly my money not wasted,and Puri Jagannadh try hard his direction is somewhat good no doubt,The success of liger can be directly attributed to both a great story line and amazing acting all around. The entire cast did such a great job especially Vijay, that I really can't single out one person for carrying this movie. Just like in arjun reddy Pelli Choopulu, mahanati texiwala etc, there were multiple points at which the story could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. When Mike Tyson comes to screen his extended appearance is humorous as we had seen in trailer also, liger is like non stop thrillride excellent, and ramya krishnan played his mother role she was brilliant in her role very courageous, entertainment and his stammering acting is good in trailer very few people understand but in movie we can find lot of things emotions, romance, a bunch of action and even new thing is Liger is the story of a guy born and raised in the streets of Mumbai who goes on to become a world champ in kickboxing this might be spoilers but movie is worth, and background score is amazing and attack rap song by farhad Bhiwandiwala that blew my mind what a lyrics just like his previous song tera baap aaya, only one disappointment that ananya pandey acting she tried harder to impress audience but somewhat she done better then her previous movies, overall movie is worth watching. I don't know why people are saying that movie is boring but I gave 9 star out of 10 Action scenes are excellent Specially devarkonda's acting face expression verbal accent is excellent Action comedy."

But other than that, the rest were more or less pretty good. Vijay was phenomenal, his acting, body transformation, fight scenes were outstanding. Stammering is a pretty hard thing to do if you don't stammer in real life, and I think he did that really well. Ananya also didn't do terribly bad.

The songs are modable but Ananya Pandey is perfectly miscast in the movie.\n\nYou can only watch it for Vijay, and I recommend you to do it, for which atleast one can see Vijay's acting capabilities pretty well and clean and it can be appreciated."

Overall its a movie that everyone should watch.\n\nWe must talk about songs the songs were superb like akdi pakdi, waat laga denge, attack,aafat. The thing i thought is timing of songs only this part was poor.\n\nPlease visit nearby theatres and watch this fabulous movie in the theatre itself.\n\nAlso please dont boycott any movies because there is 100s of people effort to complete each movie."

Watching it in Cinemas makes it more enjoyable.\n\nI feel not every movie can give you good story or emotion, however sometimes we can watch movie that directs you to what the movie is all about in simple and with happy ending.\n\nLiger is the story of a guy born and raised in the streets of Mumbai who goes on to become a world champ in kickboxing this might be spoilers but movie is worth, and background score is amazing and attack rap song by farhad Bhiwandiwala that blew my mind what a lyrics just like his previous song tera baap aaya, only one disappointment that ananya pandey acting she tried harder to impress audience but somewhat she done better then her previous movies, overall movie is worth watching."

        "review_detailed_main": "I bet, if you enjoy watching hardcore masala action movies, you are gonna like Liger for sure. You won't be disappointed at all. Liger is a collaboration of Dharma Productions and Tollywood's Puri Connects production, but mostly influenced by South Indian movie styles, this is why it has so many hardcore fights and actions right from start to end which keeps pumping the blood with fun and thrill.\n\nDirected by Puri Jagannath, the same who also directed a blockbuster action flick Pokiri in 2006 starring Mahesh Babu, which was later remade as Wanted in Bollywood in 2009.\n\nLiger, the titular role played by Vijay Deverakonda, is an aspirant martial artist who wants to achieve world MMA championship title, which was left incomplete by his father. He joins in a free training centre run by Ronit Roy for professional training.\n\nIn the beginning, he gets ragged by other fellow students/trainees but slowly he becomes everyone's choice due to his impressive fighting skill. He also meets a cute and lovely social media influential girl Ananya Pandey, who easily falls for him.\n\nIf I'm not wrong, Liger is the first Indian movie which is based on MMA which also features real life globally famous boxer Mike Tyson. Earlier Tyson appeared in cameo role as himself in Sunny Deol-Shahid Kapoor starrer Fool N Final in 2007. He also appeared in a popular Chinese movie Ip Man 3 as opponent of Donnie Yen.\n\nRamya Krishnan and Ronit Roy well justified their respective roles of Vijay's mother and a his MMA trainer (and fighter).\n\nThe only downside is childish and immature character role written for Ananya Pandey. From start her role as a social media influencer is so ridiculous at most times.\n\nOverall Liger is a paisa wasool masala action entertainer with high dose of action stunts by Vijay Deverakonda.\n\nWatch it in cinemas, you won't regret\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d"

During the pandemic we ended up watching a lot of Aamir Khan movies and so we got hooked on Bollywood movies. This is a typical Bollywood movie. It's interesting, funny, has some good twist and of course it's a Broadway movie so it has several song and dance numbers. It strangely has an intermission in the middle of the movie for some reason, but overall I would definitely recommend seeing it."

The film is considered to be one of the best sports films produced by the Indian film industry. Excellent writing and directing. Every single actor in this film gave their best. In comparison to other sports films, this one sticks out. The image is unaffected by rotting tomatoes. LIGER excels at reaching a wide audience and making money. Vijay played a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, while Ananya was his on-screen love interest. There can be no discussion of Liger without referencing the carefully choreographed musical numbers."

He gave again another fantastic and commanding performance... Wow.. that's incredible. This impressive athletic showing is a compliment to Director Puri. This film is about an individual who achieves great success. If we keep our focus and determination, we will succeed. The movie isn't bad, and both the background music and Ramya Krishna's performance are excellent. The remaining cast members had outstanding performances.

There was no ebb or flow to his performance. The casting of Ananya as the main female character was spot on. Vijay Deverakonda's performance as an actor was outstanding. This film is the product of Puri, who is widely regarded as one of the finest filmmakers active today. And it doesn't matter what time of day it is or how I feel, I can always watch this film. In terms of creative accomplishment, it's the pinnacle. When I see the Indian flag on Vijay Deverakonda... and our sherr, I have shivers. The movie is so beautiful that there are no adequate words to describe it. His performance was mediocre at best. Ananya's selection as the female protagonist was suitable. Vijay Deverakonda is an outstanding actor who succeeded in the role. Puri, one of the industry's greatest filmmakers, directed this film. This video is available to me at any time, on any day, and in any mood. A true masterpiece."

They will forever be a legend among us and in the athletic world. Even for newcomers to Bollywood, Vijay's unrelenting effort is the most significant factor. I'm quite excited that Liger, a movie I've been waiting a long time to watch, is finally opening in theaters this weekend. My own predisposition toward south Indian cinema stars led me to believe that this movie would be a huge success only based on the trailer. I enjoy seeing documentaries on renowned athletes the most. My favorite story is about the most accomplished mixed martial artist. In our town and the athletic world, they will long be recognized as a legend. The tireless efforts of Vijay are essential for all Bollywood actors, including newcomers. The long-awaited film Liger is finally opening this weekend, and I cannot wait to see it. Because I am a major admirer of south Indian cinema performers, I predicted the film's success after seeing the trailer.\n\n57. One of the finest sports films produced by the Indian film industry. Highly competent script and directing. Each performer gave their finest performance in this film. This film is unique compared to other sports films. The film is unaffected by rotten tomatoes. LIGER is fantastic, and it serves as a model of how mass commercial entertainment should be done. Vijay was an MMA fighter, while Ananya was his onscreen girlfriend. The Liger's elaborate and skillfully performed musical numbers are the show's greatest strength, and I would be remiss if I didn't devote some space to addressing them here. The movie is one of the greatest Indian sports films ever made. Exceptional writing and directing. Every performer in this movie gave their best. This sports video stands apart from the competition. There is no influence of rotting tomatoes on the photo. LIGER is an amazing performer in the mass market. Vijay portrayed a mixed martial arts fighter, while Ananya played his on-screen girlfriend. Liger's intricate musical pieces demand discussion.\n\nSuccess requires perseverance and effort. This is a good film. Actors and director performed admirably. It was a nearly three-hour film, but not a single scene was dull or uninteresting. Even before it gets going, it's clear that this movie is going to be a blast. I can't help but keep gazing at the screen. Mike Tyson, playing a made-up character named Mark Henderson, shows up at the end. Success demands hard work and commitment. This is an excellent flick. The actors and director performed really well. The duration of the film was almost three hours, however it was never monotonous or uninteresting. The movie starts off well and keeps going from there. My attention span for the screen has been exhausted."

It is definitely a must-see! You are a wonder, Vijay, and you have done it again again. The movie is excellent. It's rare to see a film with this much anger.

        "review_detailed_main": "Ananya Panday on her debut in Tollywood is quite impressive. She is very glamorous with her screen presence and at the same time, amazed everyone with her performance too.\n\nRamya Krishnan as Vijay Deverakonda's mother shined in her role. Her ferocity and intensity are what a passionate mother needs and she portrays the same.\n\nMike Tyson, the international champ is undoubtedly the special attraction of the film. His presence lights up the screen and the spirit of the film. His scenes with Vijay Deverakonda are spellbinding.\n\nVishnu Reddy is okay in his limited role. Ronit Roy as a boxing coach is decent. Other artists such as Getup Srinu are okay in their respective roles.\n\nTechnical values : Director Puri Jagannadh's basic idea of making a film on mother sentiment and incorporating action part in it is good but completely dilutes the proceedings with his routine template writing.\n\nThe background score composed by Sunil Kashyap is okay. Songs composed by various musicians are good."

As a person who enjoys watching movies starring south Indian stars, I was confident in the film's success after seeing the trailer. When it comes to sports documentaries, I'm more interested in those that focus on past greats. One of my favorite true stories is the one about the MMA legend. They'll forever be remembered as a local and national athletic icon. For people who aren't familiar with Bollywood, Vijay's dogged determination stands out as the most crucial factor. This weekend, the film Liger, which I've anticipated for a long time, will be released in theaters. I'm a huge fan of south Indian film actors, so when I saw the trailer, I knew the film would be a smash hit, and it was. Seeing movies or documentaries on famous sportsmen is one of my all-time favorite things to do. The finest mixed-martial-arts fighter is the subject of one of my favorite sports biographies. They will be remembered as a cultural and sporting legend. For those who aren't acquainted with Bollywood, Vijay's unwavering resolve is the most striking feature."

I am unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. The conclusion features Mike Tyson's highly anticipated debut as the fictional character Mark Henderson. Success requires tenacity and effort. This is a great flick. The actors and the helmer did a fantastic job. Even though more than three hours had passed, not a single minute was wasted."

I don't know why people are spreading so much hate, did they really watch the movie properly?! The movie is definitely way better than the reviews that it got. Sure, it has some silly stuff and Ananya can do better, but she is not as awful as the reviews mention. She is supposed to act like a glamorous social media influencer, and she did her job okay. Ramya Krishnan is a fabulous actor, we have already seen that in Bahubali. She seems a bit loud at times, but it's also needed for the storyline. But other than that, her performance was also great. Vijay's performance was fantastic and it's definitely going to be a treat for those who love action."

This is an excellent flick. The actors and director provided outstanding performances. None of the film's almost three-hours' segments were dull or boring. From the outset, this picture is a blast.

Furthermore, I can watch this movie independent of my mood or schedule. A genuine work of art. As we see the Indian flag on Vijay Deverakonda, our sherr and our goosebumps increase. There are no adequate words to explain the breathtaking nature of this film. His performance was, at best, unimpressive. Ananya was the greatest option for the female protagonist. Vijay Deverakonda is an excellent actor who performed well in his role. Puri, one of the best in his business, directed this picture. This film is suitable for viewing at any time, on any day, and in any mood. A true masterpiece. Seeing the Indian flag atop Vijay Deverakonda... and our sherr... always gives me the chills. The movie is so incredible that it defies description. His work was only okay at best. I think Ananya would have been a fantastic choice for the main female role."

        "review_detailed_main": "Bollywood has created some very stunning films, but this one is up there with the best because to the choreographers. Vijay's portrayal in the movie is the most popular since it is grounded in realism. Wonderfully captured the ups and downs of the MMA fighter's life. This is a fantastic flick. The spotlight will once again shine on Tiger. The uniqueness of this picture lies in the fact that it must be seen from start to finish in order to fully understand what happens.... No amount of foresight on your part could have prevented this from occurring. This film has some of the most exquisite choreography in Bollywood. The film's depiction of Vijay is both accurate and moving. Each MMA fighter's trials and tragedies were represented with great skill. Tiger, once again subjected to our scrutiny, is a spectacular and fantastic cinematic experience. This is an extraordinary film in that it can only be fully appreciated by watching it from beginning to finish. You would not have been persuaded otherwise."

        "review_detailed_main": "Film isn't terrible, and the background music and Ramya Krishna's portrayal are both excellent. Excellent performances from the rest of the cast. Starring Ananya Panday, and including a cameo appearance by legendary American boxer Mike Tyson. Once again, he delivered a powerful dramatic performance. Wow, that's awesome. Thank you, Mr. Puri, for the inspiring work you did on the sports movie. The protagonist of this film is a successful individual. Assuming we put out enough effort and mental fortitude, we can do anything. Outstanding flick with Superb BGM Ramya Krishna's Representation #Vijay Deverakonda's Conflicts and Appearance Other cast members are also good. In the film, Ananya Panday and the famed American boxer Mike Tyson make cameo cameos. He gave again another fantastic performance. Fantastic .. Puri, the filmmaker, deserves praise for making such an engaging sports picture. It's a movie about someone who achieves success in life. Victory is certain if we have passion and perseverance in our hearts."

        "review_detailed_main": "Most of the films I see are about sports heroes. This story about the greatest mixed martial artist is one of my favorites. They will forever remain our and the sporting world's hero. Even for up-and-coming Bollywood stars, Vijay's hard efforts are indispensable. The movie Liger, which has been on my must-see list for a while, finally opens this weekend. As a fan of south Indian cinema actors, I was confident in the film's success after seeing the trailer. Nothing fascinates me more than documentaries or feature films on renowned athletes. One of my favorite sports biographies is about the best MMA fighter. They will go down in history as an athletic and cultural icon. The most significant aspect, especially for those unfamiliar with Bollywood, is Vijay's constant determination. This weekend sees the debut of Liger, a film that has been on my must-see list for quite some time. I knew this movie was going to be a smash since I love south Indian performers and I saw the trailer."
