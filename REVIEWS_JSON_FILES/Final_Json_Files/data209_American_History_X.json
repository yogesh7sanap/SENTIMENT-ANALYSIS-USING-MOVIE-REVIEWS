A very important social message.\n\nI would have given it a 10 if it were longer. I wish there were more scenes of his thought process of leaving the skinhead movement, and more scenes of him bonding with his little brother (Edward Furlong) and slowly getting him to rework his worldview and frame of reference as well. The ending is also a little abrupt.\n\nI just wish for more of the film. Nothing wrong with what we got. It's already a phenomenal work of art that I implore every person of every race to watch. Obviously the subject matter is skinheads, but the theme of de-radicalizing your brain is universal and is much needed in today's world."

So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil."

Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things \"your way\" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full."

This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!"

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.\n\nWho better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.\n\nNorton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.\n\nThe screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.\n\nWhat makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.\n\nThe movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.\n\nAs an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.\n\nEdward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.\n\nAlso surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for \"The Full Monty\", the year before.\n\nThis was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

        "review_title": "Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing",
        "review_detailed_main": "The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see \"American History X,\" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.\n\nIt's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?\n\nThe movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a \"racial commitment to crime.\" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about \"personal responsibility\" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.\n\nStill, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the \"intellectual\" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.\n\nThere are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.\n\nMy main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, \"What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?\" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting."

I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart."

His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check.\n\nThe story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause.\n\nIt would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance.

I urge generation x and generation next to take more than a mere cursory look at the fellow top 250. Did Norton deliver the role with the same intensity as Brando?\n\n\"Contemplate this on the tree of woe.\" James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom Conan the Barbarian (1982)"

        "review_detailed_main": "Along with questions of morality, with Greek tragedy blended in. It's the sort of story that you absorb and get the sense that you've seen before, but still very powerful, raw, and moving. Still, it's not without its faults.\n\nI really loved Norton's performance here as Derek, but when it comes to the film's exploration of racism, its reasons, and why someone might turn away from it, I felt I wasn't learning anything new. In the scenes that provide background for why Derek is a skinhead, the blacks are portrayed as, overall, not characters I'd define as admirable (the basketball scene, breaking into his car, the general tone and feel of his introduction to prison).\n\nWhen Derek is a skinhead, he is articulate in defense of his views, which are quite detailed. His firefighter father is killed by a black drug dealer in the line of duty - He was putting out a fire at the dealer's house. This does not improve Derek's mood. In spite of his intelligence and leadership qualities he can suddenly lose control, and become violent, and this leads to actions out of all proportion to the situation - killing two black men who were breaking into his car - that put him in prison for three years.\n\nIn prison is where Derek reverses course, but the reasons seem rather shallow. It boils down to being exposed to and befriending one funny likeable black guy that he works with in the prison laundry and two other very prison specific situations. Given the ardent nature of Derek's racism, it is hard to believe that this alone would turn him around or keep him turned around once he left prison and is out in the world again among his old influences.\n\nIts good points? It shows that such virulent racism can happen in normal families, to pretty normal looking people who have met with some tragedies and want to blame the \"other\". It also shows that change can occur through education - Once out of the Aryan brotherhood group in prison, Derek spends his time reading. I'd recommend this one, just understand there is lots of violence, sexual content, and strong language. It will never be on TV - It would only be 20 minutes long!"

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.\n\nIn a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private \"American History X\" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are inter cut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions. Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.\n\nIn jail Derek learns a few things about life, and racism, or more appropriately, himself, and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path.\n\n\"American History X\" is not a pleasant motion picture. It begins in flashback, as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car. His brother, who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle, witnesses this event. It's a good message about negative influences, along with everything else.\n\nMuch has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits. Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton (allegedly) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time. Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits, but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines, which are against the rules of the Director's Guild. He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as \"directed by Humpty Dumpty.\" Then, musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema (the film's international distributor) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band. They later wrote a song, called \"NLC,\" bashing the company.\n\nDespite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film, above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline \u0096 even if the direction isn't always up to par.\n\nEdward Norton is simply superb in his role, showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut (in the Richard Gere thriller \"A Primal Fear\"). Norton careens between the role of a raging, vicious supremacist and a kindler, gentler version of the same character; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor.\n\nThe rest of the cast is good as well \u0096 Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles. (D'Angelo in particular, who portrays a sleazy alcoholic \u0096 a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the \"Vacation\" movies.) \"American History X\" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release (mainly from viewers rather than critics, who were less kind) \u0096 it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one. The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level, visually, as \"Raging Bull\" or \"Schindler's List.\" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times.\n\nBut it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an (overall) impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay. A must-see for all who can stomach its content."

        "review_detailed_main": "Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is \u0096 a true American Classic, ironically by a British director. The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature & brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo Nazi propaganda. The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends. Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right side of humanity. I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants the same for his brother. Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by the same man (Derek / Norton). Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on every high school curriculum"

        "review_detailed_main": "What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.\n\nBut before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up. But I digress, so I chose to give this film a 8/10 just because I think there are a couple parts where it gets a little choppy and over narrated."

The Nazi group follows a racist doctrine about white supremacy , showing the feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments . Meanwhile his problematic family torn apart , specially his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo). He goes to jail after committing a heinous crime , but while in prison Derek's view of mankind is altered, he discovers that there is good and bad in every race . When he is released , the former neo-Nazi skinhead attempts to prevent his younger brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself as Derek must save him from a similar destination from going down the same wrong path that he did . As his only thought is to steer his brother away from that same violent past and being helped by a reformist headmaster (Avery Brooks).\n\nIntense and thought-provoking drama with powerful performances and slick direction , being developed by means of flashbacks filmed in black and white and color . It's an important production about racism and Nazism but with lots of violence and unpleasant images as a frightening rape in the prison and the shocking murder at the beginning . Extraordinary acting by Edward Norton who steals the show as fanatic Nazi that committed acts of racial crime throughout and subsequently become good guy . Very good cinematography -specially the black and white fragments- by the same director Tony Kaye . Emotive and moving musical score by Anne Dudley , including some wonderful song . However , disowned by his director and reportedly reedited by its star . The motion picture is stunningly realized Tony Kaye , an unsuccessful director of a few films and documentaries who here achieved his big and only hit . Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable seeing . Well worth watching ."

Edward Norton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful leader of a local gang of skinheads.\n\nThe movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the White Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even how he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people don't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of the skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the interaction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There was by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this film. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the views that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White Supremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American characters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.\n\n\"American History X\" made sure to do it right and make it true to life. The life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the segregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man. This was no \"Mississippi Burning\" or \"Rosewood\" detailing events of the past, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in both parties, and the different ways people can be reformed."

After killing some neighborhood thugs, the skinhead serves jail time and is eventually paroled (and reformed), yet he can't seem to straighten out his erratic family, particularly his younger brother who seems intent on following down the same ugly path. Director Tony Kaye puts the squeeze on us right from the start, staging a blacks vs. whites basketball game as if it were Epic Human Drama (photographed in black-and-white, with slow-motion effects and a heavenly choir). The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment'). The jailhouse scenes are the strongest, but the family drama and the sidebars with the police (who also get to make speeches) are uncomfortably contrived. ** from ****"

This has to be one of the most powerful films ever made on racism. The story, performances, camera, music all feel so real and thought provocative. It tells the story of Derek, a white supremacist nazi skinhead and how he transforms and now just wants his little brother Danny to not go down the same path. The narrative is non linear where the past is periodically shown in B/W while the present is in color. One of the most haunting aspects of the film is it's background score which is among the best I have heard. The writing is balanced and nuanced and it shows. Because honestly the plot is slim but the screenplay they made out of it is bloody brilliant. The film explores hate and the effect it has on people. The constant struggle is there to see, some scenes are very hard to watch and are extremely violent on the eyes and mind. We have all seen films portraying racism in one form or the another. But there is something in this film which stands out among them. And that is Edward Norton's jaw dropping performance as Derek Vinyard. He lights the screen on fire in the scenes he is delivering dialogues which reek of hate. It was a laudable performance. But I was left wanting for more. I do feel a bit more of Derek's back story on his journey into becoming a white supremacist could have been explored to add another layer. The film has a brutal climax which I didn't expect at all. It kind of comes a full circle in the end. The final moments of the film ends with an Abraham Lincoln's quote written for a paper by Danny he submitted for his AMERICAN HISTORY X class. This is a film you cannot afford to miss. ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH!"

Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?!

It's held up very well with time, it painted a pretty bleak picture of society, sadly things don't seem to have changed a great deal.\n\nSome inspirational scenes, some shocking scenes, the ending and the shower scene you need to cover your eyes. The scenes between Derek and Danny are terrific, such acting.\n\nEd Norton delivers a first class performance, he is outstanding, his character is mixed up, defiant, brave, angry, he adds a multitude of feelings and emotions into Derek.

Several parts of the film feel forced and not at all convincing, especially the ending which was over-the-top and completely unnecessary. The film contains enough drama without the need for an forced and overdramatic ending that contributes very little to the story other than some blood and violence.

I'm not used to seing him in such a role but he actually nailed it. I'm a little disappointed he didn't win the Oscar this year but that's just how it goes I guess.

The story was so rich and beautiful, from start to finish the movie had this tight grip on me where i just couldn't look away no matter how graphic some of the scenes were.\n\nI could just on and on, but just go watch the movie if you haven't already, and preferably watch it by yourself, you need to listen and feel and really immerse yourself in the movie which Tony Kaye made really easy for you.

Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.\n\nMore troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there (\"White Men Can't Jump\")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks."

The director Tony Kaye and the screenwriter David McKenna built a believable story and developed one of the best and most complex characters that I have ever seen in my personal experience as a cinema lover. They completely explored Derek's story, explaining the origin of his hate, why he embraced a certain ideology and showing his redemption path. We get to see what he went through in its rawest and truest possible way. This made me empathize with the protagonist and his brother. Edward Norton is convincing in this role, his dialogues are difficult to be listened to because they go against an evolved society that is still fighting to get equality. Unfortunately what we see here is not too distant from reality as there are still extremist groups that have a dangerous mentality. All things considered, I guess that this was a real challenge for the actor, but he definitely nailed it. I really enjoyed the non-linear storyline, which made the film more intense. I loved the use of black and white during flashbacks, it adds uniqueness to the whole narration. The photography is fantastic and the director managed to capture the characters' emotions perfectly. There were certain face close-ups that surprised me.\n\nIt is really difficult for me to describe this movie with words. It definitely made me think. Hate is complex and it usually has deep roots that need to be understood, in order to prevent the expansion of certain movements and ideologies that in the past caused a lot of violence and pain. This film for me is eternal: it will always feel actual and updated."

What separates most antisocial young men from most healthy ones is pure luck, but of course there are also many who suffer that have the sort of perspective this film grants the viewer.\n\nNow, the cathartic relief of ruining my life - and the lives of those around me, which I hadn't truly considered before - isn't very tempting."

However upon Dereks return from prison, his fellow Hitler-worshippers notice a change in his behaviour and realise that Derek is free from the hatred he harboured for the people 'invading' his neighbourhood. The task that lies before Derek is to convince Danny to see the errors of his ways before it is too late. An awesome movie delivered by an excellent cast, a definite classic. There is quite a lot of violence... a lot of people object to the curb scene, but it is not particularly shocking, and not a film to miss because of it.

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.\n\nWhen you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given.\n\nIt is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to.\n\nDo I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?\n\nI am!\n\nI liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way.\n\nAnother thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one...\n\nI think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be \"fair\", the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.\n\nRather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the \"hate is baggage line.\" Let me figure it out on my own! The best movies are the ones that make you think, not the ones that try to think for you."

I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious"

        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that dives deep into the complexities of hate, racism, and ultimately, redemption. Edward Norton delivers a stunning performance as Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi who grapples with the repercussions of his past actions in a moving and deeply emotional narrative.\n\nThe film's storytelling is raw and unflinching, using a non-linear structure that effectively reveals the backstory and gradual transformation of its characters. The black-and-white flashbacks juxtaposed with the vivid present day create a powerful visual narrative, emphasizing the stark contrasts between Derek's past beliefs and his quest for a better future.\n\nThe themes explored in \"American History X\" are hauntingly relevant and serve as a critical commentary on the cycle of hate and violence. It challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about prejudice and the environment that fosters it. The film doesn't shy away from showing the devastating impact of hate not only on individuals but on families and communities as well.\n\nWhat truly sets \"American History X\" apart is its focus on redemption and the possibility of change. The emotional climax delivers a gut-wrenching reminder that the fight against hate is a continuous journey, one that requires introspection, courage, and understanding.\n\n\"American History X\" is a must-see film that resonates on multiple levels. It's a haunting, beautifully crafted piece of cinema that leaves a lasting impact and sparks necessary conversations about forgiveness and the human capacity for change."

        "review_detailed_main": "Controversial subjects usually make for interesting movies, and American History X courts controversy in so many ways by examining neo-Nazis, racism, prison violence, and school violence all in the same movie. So American History X is a very interesting film, but it is executed so haphazardly that it becomes hard to enjoy, and it loses most of its potential and some of its power in the process.\n\nThe film examines the life and crimes of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), both whom are \"involved\" in the neo-nazi movement. In exactly what ways they are (and were) involved are examined in the film, much of which is told through flashbacks. It is evident that these two boys have forced much hardship upon their families, evident in the performance of Beverly D'Angelo as the boys' mother. However, the performances of both Norton and Furlong, although adequate, are short of spectacular.\n\nMuch of the action of the film is shot in pain-staking slow motion, making everything so over-dramatic that it's almost laughable. McKenna's screenplay is indeed interesting at points, but some of it too gets caught up on formulaic statements and unneeded dialogue. Many of the scenes seem unneeded and seem to need replacement by scenes that give more insight into Danny's mindset. Instead of these scenes, though, the viewer is left with a character who seems somewhat one-dimensional.\n\nEven with the slow motion, Kaye's direction and cinematography are unique enough to grab the viewer's attention, even when it does distract from the rest of the film. Also, the film is thought-provoking in its examination of racial matters, especially as we see through the eyes of characters so prejudiced. Further questioning and thought is provoked by the movie's ending, which is both beautiful and shocking in such an odd way that it almost makes the whole film worthwhile.\n\nIt is obvious that this film is unashamed to say what it wants to say. Yet it's still a shame that American History X was not caught on film as something more powerful and profound in its display.\n\nFinal Grade: B-."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a story that, ahead of its time, predicted struggles of the working class of all races that elected the great Donald in 2016 to the presidency of a failing superpower. In the Cilton years prison racialitst reform was filling prisons with minor offenders of wrong colour, while affirmative action was turning hard working Amuricans into hatte filled monstuers . A growing, ambitious guy of high IQ and later questionable tattoos has an inspiring black teacher that sells his woke agenda, while his policemen racialist father is against it. Black violentia kills the dad and a foster father figure is found in local corrupt republican-leaning manipulator. This causes guy to shave his head and when a gang of melanin rich drifters try to rob his car after losing control of the basketball court due to movie hero being an awesome, if melanin challenged, athlete, he stands his ground and uses some excess force to whack a couple of them here and there. For that he gets some prison sentence but whilst in jail he befriends a dark skinned comedian and rejects his ideology of republican nativism, all while getting some stitches for snitches and books from his ideologically possessed O-bama wannabe former teacher. After being brain-washed he gets out of prison to try to imprint some liberal woke bs into his impressionable younger brother. But, alas, as left wing indoctrination portrayed as sincere repentance for white privilege of being an orphan whose daddy policemen (also white privilege) had a privilege of being shot on duty by some gang members with excess access to drugs and melanin after protesting incompetence of his co-workers that got jobs via affirmative action, was beginning to work, there is a new problem. The violentia wins again as a bullet is shot again from a minority member into his brother, killing him on spot. So, violentia wins the day, and the circle continues, since no matter how many republicans repent for their white privilege, problem is not solved, since the root of the problem is was on the other side all along. This visionary message predicted presidential wins in 2016 in 2024 about 20 years ahead of its time."

Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.\n\nIf you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism."

        "review_detailed_main": "In an extremely powerful, important and often brutal drama looking at white supremacy, Edward Norton's acting is beyond Oscar-worthy. It's one of the rare movies that truly displays the extreme realism of violence, evil and cruelty of some humans in this world, and whilst it's not for kids, it's highly necessary. The film's themes focus on racism and violence in America, likely to leave a lasting effect on every audience.\n\nNorton is insanely good and incredibly flabbergasting in this movie. He plays horrifyingly violent skinhead who's finally released from prison after a brutal hate crime. Before his release, there's a short but substantial period of time during the first act of the film that focuses on his younger brother, who is clearly following the same path as his older brother, before Norton then tries to guide him away from white supremacy and racial violence.\n\nThis film is superbly-crafted, to hold one's attention from beginning to end. A very clever and effectual technique of storytelling American History X uses is to briefly give us an idea of Norton's character's crime at the start of the film in a black-and-white sequence, but then when we follow him later on as he tries to positively influence his younger brother, we receive more black-and-white flashbacks set before his prison time as the story plays out.\n\nIt's effective to wait for the present setting to play out more before we get more details, including black-and-white sequences of before the crime, the violent actions and his time in prison. It's one of those movies where they don't have to show every single detail of the racial violence, but it's just as brutal left off the screen. And the ending, which you'll never predict, leaves viewers with an unforgettable message about the subject matter of the film. American History X is very well-written, finely acted and phenomenally executed, best for mature teens and adults.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."

After finally having seen it, i can say it was certainly forgettable. The idea and subsequent story actually has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by the movies weird cinematography (black and white to show scenes in the past??) and quite frankly terribly dialogue and acting by everyone except for Norton, who i thought was the only solid actor. Not terrible, not great. Could have been so much better."

Things flow naturally: we get scenes with deep conversation and basic human interaction, but the second something happens, it's sudden and straight in your face. There is never much of a build-up, but it manages to make it work. 'Show, don't tell' is utilized in subtle body language, which bring a much deeper meaning to certain scenes. I also like the close-up shots for a more dramatic effect, and the unique directing style is very refreshing. The beginning hooks you straight in.\n\nWhat I first thought to be just another generic movie turned out to be one I'll remember for life. I am in love with this movie."

American History X was so strikingly bad though that I'm considering an attempt to sue for my wasted time. :-)\n\nThe Plot: Give the audience some credit! American History X was painfully heavy-handed. The word, \"Duh,\" sprang to mind (and often mouth) every few seconds. Challenge us...make us thing...leave some loose ends. Ed Furlong's 18-hour redemption plan? Please!\n\nThe Cinematography: I don't know who's to blame; my guess is Tony Kaye. How could something smack of pretension and look like an MTV show? Cut, pan, cut, pan, slow-mo, black-and-white. The camera work is symbolic of the film. Kaye never visually engages the characters and perhaps that's part of the reason that AHX is so ineffectual.\n\nEd Norton did what he could with a weak script and a poor director. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about the movie was the way Norton changed his body for the role. Tony Kaye (understandly) tried to remove his name from this \"opus\" and claimed that Norton was responsible for the editing. If that's true, let's hope Ed Norton sticks to acting and Tony Kaye goes back to music videos."

        "review_detailed_main": "My 9/10 rating is because \"American History X\" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity. Then again, maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation.\n\nBut other than that, the movie is quite good. Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming a white supremacist, we get to see various issues. For example, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time, his anger starts to ebb. Good support from Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie, even if they didn't develop it as far as they could."

The neo-nazi beliefs that the Vinyard brothers share are not just simply portrayed - they are explored in such a way that we discover seeds and roots and how the two characters have sunk to having such ideologies.\n\nThe writers, along with Edward Norton and his incredible portrayal of Derek, the eldest brother, did a remarkable job of making you truly believe that the characters were capable of redemption, something they started building on early on, which carried the film the whole way through.\n\nEvery character no matter how small provided interesting roles and thought provoking interactions and every single scene felt integral to the story.

The portrayal of Derek, oscillating between a dominating presence and vulnerability, strikes an odd chord, diluting his character's credibility.

Whether right or wrong, leadership stems from someone looking at someone's actions.\n\nThis movie resonates with many because this is actually happening somewhere in the world.

Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?\n\nFirst off I'm giving the film an 8. I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly. Those issues aside the film is great.\n\nThe script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here. Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend. The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.\n\nSome of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way. This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly. As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all. Still, it is a powerful film. Well worth catching.\n\nAlso there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released. It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak). He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. He didn't win his request. If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job. The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences."

        "review_detailed_main": "When I first came across the movie American History X it was while I was looking through Edward Nortons films on his profile. Having seen Primal Fear and Fight Club just a few weeks prior to this I was intrigued to see what other roles he could take on. Furthermore, I was a huge fan of Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 and was happily surprised to see him on this cast list as between 1991 and 1998 when this was released, he did not have many major roles.\n\nThe story is told through switching from present to past and the way it is done is simply outstanding. The flashback scenes are in black and white to firstly make it clear when the time period is and arguably also to show the darkness that was consuming Edward Nortons character when following the neo-nazi way of life that he did for so long. Edward Norton himself also adds to this effect and his performance makes it seem like he is playing two separate characters. His brother in the movie 'Danny' is played by Edward Furlong who gives a very gripping performance as we see his character change his ways completely in front of our eyes. The time period of only one day also adds the severity of this change and in a very powerful way shows the effect of influence that one person can have on another.\n\nFor people that haven't seen this movie it is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies I have personally seen and one that I believe everyone should watch. Because of this, I have not given away many details of the movie and I believe that words cannot convey the true message that this 'masterpiece' conveys.\n\n10/10. Cinematic Brilliance"

And that's why I saw the film three times at the same day. The truth is that I've seen this film 9 times. And I'm convinced that there will be a 10th time cause this film creats you so many contradictory feelings at 120 minutes. It's a masterpiece that manages to describe social and political problematic situations without taking a position. The viewer is free to decide If the heroes (or the anti-heroes) are right or wrong. Or maybe this dipole between right or wrong doesn't even exist. Cause in the end, the heroes are just... humans."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hands down the most disturbing film I have ever seen. American History X is simply outstanding.\n\nOne of the film's great strengths is the great all round performance by the cast. Empire Magazine claimed that Edward Norton did not win an Oscar for his performance one of the greatest Oscar injustices of all time. And I completely agree. Some of Norton's racist monologues were so convincing they bordered on being scary. The rest of the cast did great as well. I do think, however, that they could have selected a better actor to play the younger brother, Danny, but that is a nit pick, the actor in the film did fine but I just think someone could have given a more compelling dramatic performance.\n\nOverall, what I loved most about the film was the fact that it shows racism for what it is, something that is taught, how na\u00efve people can be led to believe anything if their circumstances call for it. The disturbing scenes where very disturbing and encapsulated the sheer lack of humanity that comes with such racist cults, such as, in this case, the Neo-Nazi's. Ultimately, American History X is not for the squeamish but it is one of the best films I have ever seen."

Like I was watching an old high school film about racism and hate. The film is extremely cliched and, at times, simply formulaic with a stapled on ending which tries to add an ironic nature to the film but only ends up causing the film to suffer from the old Hollywood adage of \"serious films have sad endings\".\n\nThe most blatant example of the poor story telling is when Derek is in prison and he realizes that black people simply aren't evil. The way in which this comes about is scriptwriting at it's worst. There was much to do about the directing but the film is filled, once again, with poor work. Kaye was said to have done his own camera work on cinematography. It's obvious that professionals should have been used. The only saving grace is Nortons fine acting which is lost among the many flaws of the film. Better films about racism and hate have been made. Skip this one."

        "review_title": "\"American History X\": A Compelling and Provocative Exploration of Hate and Redemption",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\" is a powerful and intense film that explores the destructive nature of hate and racism in American society. Edward Norton delivers a powerhouse performance as Derek Vinyard, a former neo-Nazi skinhead who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same violent path that he did. Director Tony Kaye uses striking black-and-white imagery to convey the darkness and brutality of Derek's past, while also highlighting the hope and redemption that are possible for those who choose to reject hate and embrace tolerance.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of \"American History X\" is the way in which it portrays the complex psychological and social factors that contribute to the spread of hate and prejudice. From the legacy of institutionalized racism in America to the economic and social disenfranchisement that fuels feelings of resentment and anger, the film does not shy away from tackling difficult and uncomfortable subjects. At the same time, it also recognizes that change is possible, and that individuals have the power to choose a different path.\n\nThe performances in \"American History X\" are uniformly excellent, with Norton delivering one of the most memorable performances of his career. He fully embodies Derek's rage, pain, and eventual transformation, making the character both sympathetic and frightening. The supporting cast is also strong, particularly Edward Furlong as Derek's brother Danny, who is drawn into the neo-Nazi movement as a vulnerable and impressionable teenager.\n\nOverall, \"American History X\" is a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful film that explores the dangers of hate and the possibility of redemption. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the complexities of American society and the human capacity for change."

        "review_title": "\"American History X\" is the true purpose of film",
        "review_detailed_main": "Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But \"American History X\" is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.\n\nThe first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation.\n\nThe second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film.\n\nThe final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.\n\nOverall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece."

There where just a few people; six skinheads in the front, a few professor types and father and son.\n\nWhen the scene where Edward Norton gives the young black intruder a deadly curbie, we all recoiled in shared horror at the brutal ugliness of it all.\n\nWhen the Edward Norton character was violently gang raped in the shower we collectively winced. His friendship and change of heart that happens left us all with a collective sigh of relief.\n\nWhen we all left the theater we smiled at each other and slowly talked, sociology professors, skinheads, a black father and son and me. We all agreed that this movie was very important, broke down a racial barrier that I see as breaking down. If only the mainstream news would see that the racial barriers where dissipating until the media stuck its noise in with all their critical race theory. Yes CRT is real.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is when left alone all races get along. Its a humanity thing. And I'm sure if there was a news camera inside the theater egging the naturally diverse theater goers into a \"Us VS Them\" scenario, then yah that would have been a newsworthy man made situation. But it wasn't. I never talked to a skinhead before and what I learned through this movie and because of that night, that we are all the same."

Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10"

Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard."

        "review_detailed_main": "Edward Norton has been an underrated actor in my eyes. Delivering great performances in films like Fight Club, Birdman and Moonrise Kingdom, there's no doubt he's an outstanding actor. His performance in American History X is some of his best work.\n\nAmerican History X follows Derek Vinyard, a former neo-nazi skinhead that tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did.\n\nThe widespread love for this film got me interested to watch it. What I admire is how far they went with a subject matter like this. Its portrayal of racism is unflinching throughout with sequences that truly had me on edge and even shocked me. The film doesn't hold back and I found that to be helpful to get into and understand Derek Vinyard's perception of the world. The use of black and white during the flashbacks was an excellent choice as I felt it was very representative of the hatred and violent nature Derek possessed. Not only that, it added a murky feeling to the film that suited the dark and angry tone of the film. My main issue with American History X is how the film depicted Derek's reformation. Witnessing the large amount of hatred and racism built up inside of him, I found to be quite unbelievable how quick he was able to switch against his morals. For me, this weakened the film as this was the entire character development Derek had but it didn't come across as very believable. In addition, the ending is also something I'm not sure how I feel about. The best part of American History X is Edward Norton. He always manages to disappear into the characters he plays and Derek Vinyard is no exception. He lives and breathes this role and does an incredible job playing him. Edward Furlong as Norton's younger brother is also very good.\n\nAmerican History X does have a lot of interesting things to say. The filmmaking is very well done and Edward Norton delivers an exceptional performance but I think the story required more subtlety and needed more to happen in Derek's life to make his reformation more believable in my eyes."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\" is an unflinching exploration of hatred, redemption, and the power of change, earning an emphatic 9/10 rating from me. I absolutely loved every aspect of this film. Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard is nothing short of astonishing, conveying the complexity of his character's journey from bigotry to enlightenment. The film editing masterfully weaves together past and present, enhancing the narrative's impact. Its strength lies in its unapologetic message about the destructive nature of racism and the possibility of transformation. The music is hauntingly evocative, underscoring the emotional depth of the story, while the cinematography captures the stark contrast of Venice Beach's sun-soaked streets and the darkness of hatred. \"American History X\" is a brutal but necessary reflection on the enduring scars of racism, and my love for it is as profound as the film's message."

The characters were developed well and you cared for them a great deal.\n\nStory: This has a real hyperreaslistc vibe to it. It feels almost like it's based off a true story because I'm sure there are many stories like this. It brings you through a story of hate, anger and redemption. The characters and your feelings develop along with the story and I cant say enough how well this was directed. I just really dont understand the meaning of the end however. Without spoiling it, why the heck would someone get shot over just staring at another person? That's the most ridiculous thing ever. Especially in a place where it happened. Seems most unrealistic and left a bitter taste after such a redeeming story. I'm really not sure what the director was thinking and that's my only complaint about this film.\n\nSummary: This is a very realistic, serious and emotional movie. I really didnt like the last bit of the ending but I would still recommend this movie as it still has a lot to offer."

        "review_title": "A Fairy Tale",
        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is basically a fairy tale. It is a film about one man's implausible 3-step transformation from a naive high-school kid to a white-supremist Nazi and leader of a skinhead tribe, to an honest caring upstanding citizen who only wants to do the right thing for his family and society at large. Like I said, a fairy tale. I won't reveal any more of the ending that wasn't already revealed on the preview. Basically it's a mixed happy/sad ending, where the \"happy\" part is that the main character finally comes to terms with who we was, how evil he was, the way his evilness has negatively influenced the lives of other people, and is able to write a nice cheery new chapter in his life. And all this happens in a short 4 years.\n\nWhat gets me is how unbelievably intelligent and level-headed the main character (played by Ed Norton) is, and how completely silly his transformation into a skinhead really is.\n\nMeanwhile his kid brother (played by Ed Furlong) who is also reasonably smart, follows in his brother's footsteps like a zombie. Norton's character is clearly free-thinking and is not one to follow in other people's footsteps, while Furlong is just the opposite. At least Furlong's character gives the impression that he might flip and go completely nuts at any given time, thereby adding some mystery to the film (Furlong is good at looking like a punk). But the reality is much more like a fairy tail.\n\nSo basically the film doesn't know what it wants to be. One the one hand, it deals with some incredibly moving race issues, and on the other hand we have a children's movie.\n\nI think The Chamber by John Grisham actually did a much better job at portraying a racist who slowly & reluctantly repents and finds the error in his ways, at the last possible moment. At least in that film, we understand that we're dealing with someone who, at his core, is really not a very nice man.\n\nJust the opposite in X.\n\n(5 out of 10)"

The leader of the racists, the fat racist guy (also the friend in My Name is Earl I'm pretty sure), Elliott Gould, the mom and even the little brother (and teen aged and child actors are usually awful to me). The cast of this movie is really great and make it so believable.\n\nThat said obviously Edward Norton is the heart of this film. He is really awesome in this movie and gets the audience to both loathe how horrible he is but also sympathize and pity him and the life he has led and want him to earn redemption.\n\nI don't want to give away the ending but the movie is a great drama with a fantastic climax and Norton deserved the Oscar for his portrayal without a doubt!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Now, the 1998 movie \"American History X\" from writer David McKenna and director Tony Kaye is a very hard-hitting movie that is a must-watch movie actually. I remember watching the movie back when it was just released and the impact it had on me back then.\n\nThe storyline in the movie, as written by David McKenna, really is a well-written one. It is a script that is not only story-driven, but most certainly also very much character-driven. And the characters in the movie are well-fleshed out and detailed, adding a lot of layers to the movie.\n\nAnd the cast ensemble in the movie was good. With the likes of Edward Norton in the leading role, and carrying the movie phenomenally, I might add, then you're in capable hands for 119 minutes. The movie also have good performances from the likes of Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Stacy Keach and most definitely also from Elliott Gould.\n\nWhat makes \"American History X\" such a powerhouse of a movie is the story, and how well it translates into aspects of society even today. But also the great acting performances in bringing the characters to life on the screen.\n\n\"American History X\" can be a visually tough movie for certain viewers, and thus it is a not a movie that is just for anyone. But I do firmly believe that director Tony Kaye's 1998 movie is one that must and should be watched. If you haven't already seen it, and have the chance to do so, you should and you must watch it.\n\nIt is also a movie that can be seen more than once with some years in between each viewing. But that is a testimony to the writing of David McKenna and the contents of the script and storyline.\n\nMy rating of \"American History X\" lands on a seven out of ten stars."

Even the average daytime soap creates a better backdrop than this. Blacks simply giving up their turf over a lost game of hoops?

Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers. This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him..."

It pears into the power of peer pressure and how the force to conform can conquer relationships.

As soon as I got the DVD as a gift, I always thought it was a normal movie and that I could do without seeing it. But now that I've seen it, I realize that my bias was completely wrong. There are not many central characters or that are thorough, but the two protagonists, Derek and Danny, are frighteningly beautiful. The costumes are excellent, the actors equal, Edward Norton is spatial. The sound does a great job inside the film, it represents the scene in which it is inserted, and it is one of the things that distinguishes a beautiful sound from a bad one. The cruelty of the topics and the tone used in all the scenes stunned me, I could not take my eyes off the TV. Even if we didn't get to the year 2000, the picture is beautiful. I really enjoyed the narration of the facts through the time shifts and the alternation between color scenes and black and white scenes is a huge plus. The end is emotionally strong, beautiful. This movie is now one of my 5 favorite movies and who knows if it will drop in rank, but at the level of preference, hard to beat it. I think this is one of the 3 best movies about racism and the Nazi era. He didn't just win the Academy Award for competition from \"Life Is Beautiful\" and \"Save Private Ryan,\" otherwise he would have had no rivals. If you want to get angry and strong, watch American History X.\n\n. Rating: 10/10."

American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part. In the end, there comes another beginning of the circle where he carries his brother's shot dead body. The politics is just between black and white similarly it was the politics in between right and wrong."

For example when Derek is telling Danny about his turnaround in prison, Danny accepts he's right straight away, and if Derek was so intelligent and smart, how come he was so easily turned towards hating blacks? I know his father put a few thoughts in his head, and he was killed by a black gang, but please!! I also thought the slow motion scenes were a bit too \"Hollywood\". I shouldn't be too picky though, because although the movie has a few flaws, American History X is still a stunner."

Edward Norton delivers a perfectly executed, demanding and controlling performance, worth mentioning as one of the best on screen you will see in a long time.\n\nThe film is delivered effectively through the strong violence and profanities. This film is not a feel-good movie, but one that will challenge you and ask questions about the world we live in How do we approach social prejudice? What do we do with minorities to prevent gang cultures to arise and disintegrate our societies?\n\nWhile this is a very disturbing and uncomfortable film to watch, I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. It is truly a thought-provoking no-nonsense modern American masterpiece.\n\n9/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The film shows that nothing goes unnoticed. Even a seemingly ordinary conversation at the dinner table can grow into a violent garden of hatred and malice, destruction and murder. Action generates opposition, those who really deserve it do not always suffer, and often innocent people have to pay for the mistakes of others. And help can come from the one from whom you least expect it. But I want to elaborate not on this, but on Derek's words before the attack on the supermarket. After all, if you think about his words, then he said everything correctly. His fiery speech absolutely correctly formulates the problem of emigrants and forces us to fully agree with it. Emigrants are needed to dilute a highly developed cultural society, to maintain the population. Recent events in England have clearly shown the problem of the non-indigenous population. Yes, they were born and live in the country, more than one generation has changed, but the genetic memory of Africans, Indians, Asians and others has not gone anywhere. Whole generations of families of African descent live on benefits and do not even seek to get an education, find a decent job. What for? After all, you can live by theft, distribution of drugs, weapons, etc. And this genetic memory, like an infection, penetrates the unformed minds of young Englishmen, forcing them to maraud too. And Muslim women wearing burqas in public places."

        "review_detailed_main": "I watched 'American History X' at a time in my life when I was thinking deeply about all the facets of racism and how it arises from the environments we are born into. I'm happy to say his film not only confirmed my own thoughts on these subjects but gave me even more insight into this worldwide problem. Being a white female who is probably still quite naive about racism because none of it ever comes my way, I am glad about the things I learned from this film. I find it interesting (and depressing) how so many movies and TV shows out there seem to glorify this idea of 'retribution' or vigilantism; the idea that one is not only righteous in murdering someone who has wronged them/harmed their family, but they gain respect from their peers (or those viewing the film)for doing so. Until I watched American History X I was yet to find a film that glorified forgiveness and change. For most of my life, I myself did not understand the concept of forgiveness, and unquestioningly believed in things like capital punishment, like many others around me (thankfully, I don't anymore!) What I love and relate to in this film is that it illustrates that every person, even those furtherest into their own beliefs, can change, and should be given the chance to do so. Some may say that the ending is clich\u00e9, but honestly I think when it comes to films with a message like this one, such observations are irrelevant and mundane. The ending was vital to the overall point of the film because it serves as a warning. At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9 myself, the end of this film warns us not to carry on the cycle of violence, but to forgive, and let people change. It's called evolution :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "IMDb Top 250: 38\n\nAHX is, in my young eyes, one of the best films ever created. A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone: hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.\n\nThe most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...\n\nBut almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.\n\nOnly Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though: he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.\n\nThe music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come: an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.\n\nAnd it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch. You will feel emotions watching this: not sadness, but that might happen, but shame. That snide joke you made to your buddies behind that person's back, that prejudice you thought in your head, well American History X will remind you of that.\n\nThe plot is well crafted and well told, the flashbacks are placed perfectly, and the pacing keeps things constantly interesting. If you can stomach the infamous scenes and the ample, but necessary language, American History X might just change you as a person for the better. 9.8/10"

        "review_title": "Nazism from a new angle, but too reliant on its lead performance",
        "review_detailed_main": "Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.\n\nThe story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.\n\nInfamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today."

        "review_title": "Brutal, visceral drama on hateful tribalism and escape",
        "review_detailed_main": "Released in late 1998 and directed by Tony Kaye from David McKenna's script, \"American History X\" is an urban drama about a former neo-Nazi leader, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from taking the same path of hate he did. Current events are shown in color whereas flashbacks are depicted in B&W. Stacy Keach plays the behind-the-scenes mentor of the neo-Nazis while Avery Brooks appears as Danny's principal. Elliott Gould is on hand as a Jewish history teacher who is interested in Danny's mother (Beverly D'Angelo).\n\nDuring the first half I found some of the dramatics dubious, to be nice; you can tell that kinks needed worked out in the script or the acting. After viewing the movie, I found out that the director felt the same way, insisting that the film needed more work; he also objected to Norton re-editing scenes without his approval and even wanted his name removed from the credits.\n\nIf you can roll with the palpable flaws, however, you'll likely find yourself immersed in the world of the characters by the second half. While the topic is unpleasant and there are some hard scenes to watch, \"American History X\" shoots for greatness and in some ways grasps it. For instance, there are a few moving, artistically-staged sequences, like the aftermath of the dinner-scene-from-hell and the climax. This is what I look for in great dramas, but rarely get. Norton's powerful performance is another example of the film's greatness.\n\nSomeone criticized the movie on the grounds that it simplifies complex issues, but how else can you tackle a subject like this and do it justice in a 2-hour movie while keeping it entertaining? Besides, nothing was so simplified to be unbelievable, as far as Derek's character arc goes. Someone else panned the narration, but \u2013 aduh \u2013 I guess he didn't get that the words are Danny's essay assignment for his new \"class\" with the principal, which explain the movie's title.\n\nThe overriding theme is that that all races/ethnicities tend to stick together and are in an undeclared war. The skinheads aren't really singled out because the movie plainly shows that their hostilities are mirrored in the other gangs, albeit with different verbiage and accouterments. While antagonistic tribalism is rampant it can't stand in the face of genuine relationship and the corresponding love and respect.\n\nADDITIONAL CAST: Fairuza Balk plays Derek's girlfriend while Jennifer Lien and William Russ appear as his sister and father. Guy Torry is on hand as an inmate Derek slowly befriends while Ethan Suplee plays a hulking neo-Nazi.\n\nThe film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles (Venice, Venice Beach, Fairfax, North Hollywood).\n\nGRADE: A-"

        "review_detailed_main": "I disagree very strongly with most of the people on this board. It seems strange that I despise this movie with such venom while other people hold it up as a perfect piece of work. Maybe my standards are higher. Maybe I've seen so many movies that I can see cliches more clearly than most. Maybe I expected more from a film with an ambition to change the world. Maybe I'm feeling disappointment because it failed so completely.\n\nI think \"American History X\" is a complete waste of your time. This is the story of a neo-Nazi named Derek who repents and gets out of prison just in time to save his kid brother Danny, who is going down the same skinhead path. That's the whole story. Everything else is atmosphere and complication, with sermons at every turn. I can understand why the director wanted to remove his name from the picture.\n\nLikewise, I can understand why Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Derek, the jailbird brother. Norton is one of our best actors and squeezes lots of blood from this stone of a production. His speech rhythms and body language are wonderful. However, I can't find anything else to recommend apart from Norton's performance. The script is preachy, predictable, simplistic and badly staged. Edward Furlong is useless as Danny the baby skinhead, and the annoying fat guy who blabbers Nazi platitudes is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in a major motion picture. The black-and-white flashback device would be laughable in a film school thesis, and it's embarrassing to see it used here. It took all my strength to stomach the scene at the end where the brothers slowly remove all the Nazi propaganda from Danny's bedroom wall in ultra-dramatic fashion. This is an amateurish production of a bad screenplay that didn't think itself through.\n\nI didn't believe anything that happened here. Why are all the neo-Nazi punks dressed so impeccably? Shouldn't they be lower-class kids wearing hand-me-downs and thrift store bargains? Maybe there would be a few trust-fund lads around, but the whole crowd of Nazi youth looks like they shop at the Gap and J. Crew. We find out that Derek experienced a trauma in prison, and are expected to believe not only that this event completely changed him, but also that Danny would make an immediate character switch as soon as he hears about Derek's prison experience. I didn't buy it, and why should I? This movie thinks I am stupid enough to believe anything I see without questioning it. And isn't that why we have neo-Nazis to begin with?\n\nDon't believe the hype. Leave \"American History X\" to rot, and rent something interesting like \"Do The Right Thing\" or \"Taxi Driver.\""

It is not the same whether you have racial views in Africa or in America, whether you belong to the major ethnic group or you are part of the minority. The manifestation of racism might be the same but the substance and the motives are different. In American history x I felt these motives were pretty much unconvincing.\n\nTo begin with Derek is not a cattle-like asshole, like many of his skinhead friends, who only embrace racism because they are too limited to think any further; neither he becomes a racist solely for the benefits of being part of the gang (like the majority, I suppose). Derek actually does think, he is a leader- at least that's the idea. As a result when he does become a racist he does it because of an internal belief that this is the correct, sane thing to do. He arguments, he has an opinion based on facts, he is becoming convinced because of these facts- the point is not that he misinterprets things, the point is that he is not a racist because of the emotional trauma, not because his father died, but because he thinks things that way.\n\nIn addition his prison rebirth is very unlikely to me. So what was that about after all? He saw one of his gang's members buying pot from a black guy, or a Mexican, i don't remember- so what, is this thing capable to destroy his whole world-view? What did he think, that all white guys have the same ideas as he has?\n\nHe met a funny, sympathetic black guy- OK , now don't tell me that Derek, intelligent as he was, thought that all black people were jerks. He was not a racist before his father's death, he actually liked Sweeney!-that part was very artificial, I mean, what is this supposed to mean, that Derek forgot just like that everything he had known about people, just because his father died? It was a trauma, his television interview-outburst might be explained with that, sort of a \"homage\" to the racist dad, but why did he start to hate EVERY black person all of a sudden from then on? Like I said before it wasn't just an emotional thing-it couldn't have been. Derek had his theory of black people being more likely to commit crimes, of taking the jobs of decent white people and so on-there was nothing in the movie that made a counter-argument to these, accepted by Derek; he simply forgot these at the end.\n\nAll in all, my observation is that the movie is very well acted, well structured, but not very realistic. Derek's-and for that matter Danny's- sudden changes of their view are totally unconvincing, because they do not come from the right place- Derek is a nazi because he believes in the theory, and there's nothing that should change him so radically, because every experience he has is mainly emotional. Danny probably never was very convinced of anything, so he is actually much more credible than his brother."

        "review_detailed_main": "Considered one of the greatest films of all time, we can easily define that \"Our American History\" does not have an exact time to be based or portrayed, as the criticism it makes is conducive to any generation. We are talking about a production that does not criticize neo-Nazi thoughts, but society in general. The production is about prejudice, changes and reflections, something we thought we had overcome, but which sometimes seems so common in the 21st century.\n\nThe Other American Story, feature film directed by Tony Kaye that tells the story of a skinhead (Edward Norton) arrested for murdering two black people and who tries to save his brother (Edward Furlong) when he returns home. The film follows two narrative lines: a past in black and white, exposed as a work of his brother for school, and the present, in color, with Derek's return to the house. These color changes are meant to show the conflict of right and wrong. Derek's past is always presented in black and white, as if it were a dark stain on his reality, while the present is given bright colors to make it clear that he is no longer that man. As Dan is the narrator, the story is based on his own point of view about his brother and the reality he lives in (where only white people seem to deserve a place on the planet).\n\nDerek Vinyard, lived by an excellent Edward Norton (Brooklyn: Motherless), embodies two people. Not that one is better than the other. The dislike for his character persists after the ice is broken by his fellow prisoner, when he suffers the violence he preaches or even in his moments of despair. It's with him forever, just like the swastika he carries on his chest. The character knows this and the director is keen to expose the feeling in the way he looks in the mirror.\n\nWhile the two brothers Derek and Danny appear to be strong and intelligent, they demonstrate incredible psychological fragility and are easily manipulated. An example: there is a scene in which Derek, still a young man, is talking excitedly about how he felt urged to study by his new teacher. Derek's father (an uneducated and prejudiced man) questions him with a rural speech, but that is enough to change the firstborn's initial opinion. Why, years later, Derek would again be manipulated by Cameron and become an asshole neo-Nazi. And finally, he would change his mind after a new meeting with his old teacher and by his own negative experiences with his lifestyle. Dan is the same. Tired of being just his brother's reflection, he decided to follow in the same footsteps. He was indoctrinated by Cameron, but his fuel to participate in that nonsense was just the love and admiration for his brother. So much so that when Derek recounts his experiences, he changes his mind drastically.\n\nThe film focuses on supremacist acts that flaunt hatred of black people. Racist and xenophobic speeches are part of Derek and his friends' playbook. The protagonist's actions, more than his speech, show that lives do not matter, they are something irrelevant. And there is an expansion, when he talks about stimulating racism in the country itself, when he compares crimes and penalties. David McKenna's screenplay pays little attention to causes and focuses on hate, even though it establishes the planted seed. His interest is in the misrepresentation of the individual at the moment when dehumanization takes place. Satellite characters confirm degeneration, in punctual disrespect, as in any interaction of Seth, or in Cameron's manipulative cynicism. Art that looks over the top but might not be, exposes every Nazi symbol it can manage. And Kaye does not skimp on the use of objects, highlighting boots, iron crosses and making counterpoints with the American flag.\n\nAmerican History X pervades historical situations. There are the attacks on Rodney King, the trial of the police and the uprising in Los Angeles to reach the level of propagandist blindness that affects people who have fascism inside them and decide to assume it. \"The video was manipulated\", \"the prison system is made up mostly of black people\", says Derek without listening to anything his interlocutor tries to say. A hateful blindness that cannot see any other side than the one he wants to believe in. And much of the film's tension is in the efficiency of the script's dialogues, but mainly in the close-ups that the director insists on keeping in practically all the scenes where the conversations are more serious, as in the moment when Dan argues with the school principal. As the camera is right on the actors' faces, which is another demonstration of the trust the director had in his cast (and in their quality, obviously), the spectator feels all the pressure of the scene.\n\nThe central objective of the film is to show the characters as human, flawed beings, showing that this thinking is not exclusive to monsters, but to people with a weak, fragile and desperate mind, who cling to a dishonest, immoral and opportunistic speech due to lack of of choice, making use of values common and dear to all to establish itself as a dominant behavior. Upon his return from prison, Derek's transformation isn't just physical. He lost 22 kilos, grew his hair and is embarrassed to be shirtless precisely because of his tattoos. Upon returning from prison he really looks different, demanding morality from his relatives. It is only after some time of exhibition that it is elucidated how the scene at the beginning ended, and how violent and serious the action of the central character was. Danny changed and became a skinhead after watching his brother kill a black man in cold blood. That was the moment when both would drastically change, the beginning of the process of redeeming one and deteriorating the other.\n\nDavid McKenna's script is so frank and pragmatic that it does not allow itself to be dreamy or naive, showing that the destinies of people who get involved or get involved with ideas of this nature or with pure and simple intolerance, tend to suffer, even if they repent and live differently. American History X accurately shows how fascism can easily touch ordinary people, helping to evoke the worst possible feelings, dominating hearts and minds with ease, and leaving only a trail of blood and sadness in its wake.\n\nThis is also the classic example of a feature dominated by its performances and the story it has to tell. Not only is Norton spectacular, but Furlong gives the performance of a lifetime, and Guy Torry, the black prison worker, gives us a wonderful and moving performance, so inevitably other technicalities end up being hidden - which doesn't absolve from not maintaining the very high level of the film. Tony Kaye's assured direction; the cinematography, subtly dark, working with black and white during flashbacks and playing with colors throughout the film, evoking an indescribable feeling of insecurity in moments that have more morbid tones. The soundtrack by the great Anne Dudley, who had already won an Oscar the previous year, is perfect in every moment.\n\nThe conclusion is that, through Derek's story, is that hate arises primarily from ignorance and a lack of empathy. Being white, born American and having had a minimally good living condition, Derek was unable to understand the socioeconomic inequality between whites and blacks, or the inhumane conditions in many countries that lead people to seek exile in the United States and Europe, until having been arrested and forced to admit all this from experience. But then he had already killed two people and lost 6 years of his life, with the risk that his brother would be next. Due to the blunt script, filled with very well written dialogues, which faithfully illustrate the last paragraph and for one of the best performances by Edward Norton, American History X is highly recommended, especially in the current world context in which we see prejudices as odious as racism and xenophobia being defended again around the world."

I rated this film 9/10, and the only thing keeping it from 10/10 was the script, which occasionally gets a little preachy, and at times I was aware that the characters were functioning as a mechanism to try and educate me, the viewer, not talking to each other.

        "review_detailed_main": "Racists in movies usually don't get treated like real characters in films. Usually they're seen as the guys in white masks that nobody ever who never even get to utter more then a few cliche lines. My guess as to why is that in an age of political correctness most filmmakers are afraid to dig deep into the psyche of the average racist. In Happiness, film makers showed a pedophile without judgement. In Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who is not only treated like a real character but is actually likeable! If they can do that in a film then surely should be able to make a film that portrays racism in a realistic and thought provoking manner. American History X is a good movie for that reason. It is the first film since Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" that deals with racism in a frank and open way and is unafraid of offending it's audience. What keeps \"American History X\" from being a great film (like \"Do the Right Thing\")is that some of the characters' actions seem contrived to fit the plot. Edward Norton's character is awfully wishy washy for a guy with deeply felt convictions. In one scene, he's talking about how much he hates blacks, then joking around with a black is enough to make him the picture of love and acceptance. Also, the film has a shock ending that does not make sense and confuses the message of the movie."

Transforming himself in the intelligent skinhead Derek Vineyard is a textbook example of great acting. His co-stars, even Eddie Furlong, combine to make this movie a great one. The message of the movie is not subtle but hits you right in the face with reality. People hate, and that hate can be turned around to hurt you in the worst way. This film doesn't lag for a second and every frame is loaded with meaning and emotion. This isn't a movie for the faint hearted and if you don't like what you are watching then it will be even harder for you to digest the fact that there are people out there just like every character in the movie. I think that everyone is racist to some degree and this movie has you both agreeing with what Derek has to say but at the same time thinking that you're not in the same boat as he is. You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga. Bottom Line: This movie deserves the place that it has on the top 250 and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you have seen it then go and see it again."

In terms of technical aspects Kayne's great to show the Flashbacks of our protagonist in black and white, and highlight the timeline, he wants to make us remember World War II, meaning that all such discrimination is a thing of the past, and narrative off of Danny and the family unit is great, because if we saw the film without these two aspects we do not apegar\u00edamos Derek, on the contrary, we'd hate, and hate is the opposite of what the film wants to preach, we we can not agree with Derek, but if we hate, we are not very different, the soundtrack is accurate, the picture is beautiful, especially in black and white times, the script is extremely intelligent, but leave some loose ends, and the performances are all great, especially Edward Norton, who is a great actor, but unlike the majority of his other films where he has a submissive and apathetic performance, not here, he is threatening, you really afraid, and yet he can pass the dramatic side, this is certainly one of the greatest performances of his career. Finally, the film is much more than a story of racism, the film deals with the human being, but outside the film's message, its technical aspects are amazing, it is a film that everyone should see."

Parents' hazardous believes propagandize children minds and transform them from good little people to an \"atomical future youthful bomb\". Mainly parents are responsible for theirs children delinquent behaviors and actions and first of all we have to blame them for the tragic incidence and not the children.

        "review_detailed_main": "As stated in the title, there are two types movies that exist, those with morals, which attempt to teach you something or reconsider a belief and those which simply attempt to entertain you, and this movie has a moral - to look at what we as human beings have become, to look deeper into ourselves and not become brainwashed by our own inability to see flaws as flaws instead of virtues, like stated in Donnie Darko (2001) \"look through your own mirror reflection,\".\n\nAmerican History X best tells this story through the eyes of a late 90's skinhead (Derek Vineyard) who is sent to prison and learnt to face his flawed views after murdering two black men who attempted to steal his car. In prison he befriends an black inmate who practically helps change his perception of the entire concept of race. After leaving prison he discovers that his past reckless behaviour has imprinted onto his younger brother (Daniel Vineyard) who has now fully joined the clan of skinheads which Derek once belonged to, Derek must then disassociate himself and Daniel from this group to save them from continuing down the same, dangerous path which he did. Whilst at the same time Daniel is forced to write a report on his brother's incarceration by his black teacher. I will not spoil the ending for you, Generous reader, but put it this way... It made me cry.\n\nAnd finally back to my point on morals, American History X Displays a man's struggle to analyse himself for what he truly is and fix his problem and save his brother before it's too late, the incredible performance by Edward Norton also adds great emotion to his character too which exacerbates the feeling of struggle which plagues Derek as he attempts to piece his life back together. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in watching greats of the film world or being thrilled by captivating storytelling, performances or a wonderfully chilling score."

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X (1998)\n\nWell, Edward Norton is so astonishing, and almost scarily convincing, you can overlook a lot of the well worn themes that guide the plot. In fact, all of the acting is strong, especially the little brother to Norton's skinhead character, an up and coming skinhead played by Edward Furlong.\n\nThe movie is covers basically a 24-hour period, but a good half of the screen time is flashbacks, presented in black and white to great effect. Not only does this help us keep track of what we are watching (the different lengths of hair help, too), but it adds pure style to what is basically a violent crime and prison film. It's fast, well edited, and filled with powerful social imagery and gut-wrenching interpersonal scenes.\n\nCrime and prison life form the backdrop for the two main things that give the movie depth. The first is obvious, maybe--race issues between blacks and skinhead whites in Venice Beach. It gets painfully oversimplified, maybe out of necessity in less than two hours, but it works well enough. The second is more important--the love and mutual admiration between two brothers. They are just kids, really, though Norton's role is very adult by the end. Their interactions are the best thing the movie has, and luckily they permeates everything, beginning to end.\n\nClich\u00e9s in this kind of world might be inevitable in this kind of mainstream movie, but if the African Americans are especially cardboard in their depictions, Norton's portrayal of justified racism really chilling, and the interactions within his family complex and revealing. The other Hollywood plot elements are things you just have to go along with. The kinds of good guys and bad guys, suffering mother and angry sister, the prison culture and street culture, and even the use of guns everywhere are not far from some Italian-American mobster movie, and I suppose that's partly just the truth of it. But it also seems a little easy, a rewriting of a common set of circumstances.\n\nToo common. Which is part of the point. You sometimes wish there wasn't a message to every movie like this--American History X is heavy on the moralizing--but the message is a slam dunk. The movie will leave you reeling."

Maybe the greatest ever made? Wow, those are some accolades. I'm thinking, hey it was decent, but are you kidding me?\n\nThe film isn't bad, but no matter how one tries to disguise it, preachy is preachy. There are a few things not too evident in the film. One is how many \"typical\" Americans totally concur with the societal views of Norton's character, especially everything he said at the dinner table. Maybe people don't want another Hitler around, but millions do feel the way he did about immigrants and why America has been falling into the toilet. So when they come out the mouth with a guy with a huge swastika tattooed on his body, they appear to be \"extreme.\" Considering that even right now, at this second,with racism so high among non-whites towards whites, and many millions of Americans being tired of the advantages illegal immigrants have for instance, those views aren't always so \"extreme\" after all.\n\nAnd the racism in the film - it's predominantly white-on-black, and again, since the whites here are skinheads and Nazis, their views seem \"extreme\" despite the millions that agree (again, short of reviving Hitler). It is rare we see black-on-white racism in the movie, and even when we hear (or see in the deleted scenes) that the leader and the fat guy got attacked by blacks, they don't get too much sympathy from the viewer. The black kid in the final violent scene probably came the closest to showing any black racism, muttering the phrase \"white boy\" earlier in the film and getting in Danny's face.\n\nThe turnaround of Norton's character in the prison is just too convenient. The film even gets a little sappy here - watch the neo-nazi lighten up to his black cleaning partner, because the black guy does funny things and makes him laugh. It's almost like this black guy was there for Norton's amusement, putting on a minstrel show, even wearing a sheet over his head imitating a klansman and making funny sounds. Look, now they are even talking about basketball together! If you spend one-on-one time with anyone long enough you will lighten up to them, but to change your whole philosophy?\n\nEven Norton's reason for his prison stay - gangbangers don't go after revenge anymore? After what happened, they don't even go after the family? Heck, they even knew the address!\n\nI think the film may have been much better if the part that was supposed to be tagged on at the end of the film was actually filmed and inserted. \"American History X\" was a decent movie, and the acting was especially good. But it is a very flawed film, too easy, and really doesn't reflect reality as much as so many think it does."

Well, yes. He's in prison. Other people at other times have been put in prison for waging battles they believed to be just; sometimes, the battles WERE just. We wouldn't have wanted Hitler's opponents, for instance, to give up and go with the flow, just because that would have made their lives easier - would we?\n\nMoreover, Danny's racism had intellectual grounds. When he goes into his rants he offers reasons - honest to goodness reasons - why others should believe what he believes. Does anyone ever offer him or us opposing reasons? Not that I noticed; instead, they look at him as they'd look at someone who spoke out of turn in church. Those who agree with Danny will feel cheated, with reason; those who disagree will (or ought) feel even more cheated, with even greater reason.\n\nI haven't given you the full story. While he's in prison, Danny actually MEETS a black man, for the first time in his life. He changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevents the film from being infuriating. As drama, it's distinctly so so. The characters are worth knowing, listening to, and following - even if the conclusion is an unmotivated cheat.\n\nSmack in the middle of Ordinary Road, that's where this film is. I suspect it found its way onto the IMDb top 250 list not because anyone really loved it, but because nobody really disliked it."

It has the same ingenious daily atmosphere as Tarantino's Reservoir dogs, even though Tarantino is about pure violence while this.. this is so true and so bad. How can you describe better the stupidity of misled young people. How can you describe better the look on a mans face when he realizes that there is nothing he can say to make these young men understand that they are wrong?\n\nThe actors and directing just makes me weak. Edvard Norton is one of the very best actors I have ever seen, and this is definitely his best performance so far. There is not even a one bad actor in this film.\n\nThis is not just about neo-nazism, this is about violence in family, about love, stupidity, ignorance, repent.

One of the best stories in movies in my opinion, and while not without its faults-which only came up after further analysis-the story manages to be gut-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Its themes and messages are expressed well and the anti-racism theme is prevalent throughout the whole movie.\n\nWhile the cinematography isn't exactly groundbreaking, the way it's filmed (often handheld) is very human, in a way that gets you closer to the characters and their interactions.\n\nAlthough the subject of the movie can spark up conversations for days (which I consider a good thing), the strength and thought put into the movie is unquestionable."

People searching for solutions to complex problems and lashing out with unintelligent behavior. Both the White Supremacist and the Black Gangs are equally ignorant and their actions are stupefying.\n\nThe Film makes a powerful effort for it all to be meaningful, but it comes across as somewhat stereotypical. It is far less insightful than it pretends to be. It is all carried along by the extreme portrayals and the darkly poetic visuals.\n\nThe prison middle and heroic transformation has the weakest of explanations and is rather shallow. Add to that the overacting of a fat Neo-Nazi and a stilted educator swallowing his lines as if he really doesn't believe anything he is saying, and the Film is rendered interesting but overrated. Worth a look see for some of the strong suits but ultimately superficial and somewhat a disappointment."

It has been and will be a problem of all countries in the world. The essence of extremism lies in the lack of self-confidence and proper education which should be partly constructed in the family and partly at school. I also believe some people are more inclined to brainwashing from birth.\n\nIn this movie, the exremism is demonstrated in the form of racism but it could have also been some sort of faith-based group. The only way to keep away from such groups is to develop yourself and question everything. In this movie, Derek learned it from the hard way. My criticism about the movie is that it is not that easy to quit such an extremist group after all those years. Derek challenges the boss in the middle of a huge skinhead party and throws punches at his face. Normally, he must have got killed right there. Instead, he should have talked the boss personally much before and try to move elsewhere with all his family. Another thing is, his freaky girlfriend turns against him too quickly. He must have guessed that from her toxic personality and terminated his relationship much before the party.\n\nOn the upside, among the supporting cast, Avery Brooks and Guy Torry perform excellent. Overall, the movie gives good messages."

        "review_detailed_main": "Reminiscent of Spike Lee's Malcolm X who's main character had a change of heart and mind in prison that was followed by an epiphany when he saw men and woman of all races alike searching for answers, American History X unfortunately fails to demonstrate the most important element of any cathartic journey: Soul Searching.\n\nThis is an obvious fiction of a boy who filled the vacuum of his missing father with a figure who would do his father's murder justice. The idea is interesting. However, it attempted to gather sympathy (and successfully) for the boy's plight by taking pot shots at easy targets. Derek is portrayed early in the movie preaching a succinct set of more than half-baked ideals which magically disintegrated with his \"change of heart\" in prison; when all his better angels kindly removed his indignation. The most insulting nugget of sanctimoniousness is Sweeny's comment \"Ask yourself one question...has this made your life better?\". Folks, when fighting for ANY cause, no-one ever expects the quality of one's life to improve. Did Ghandi's life improve by fasting?!\n\nFrankly, this is a very tough and serious subject that deserves more than a `change of heart'; it also demands a change of mind. It demands a journey of thought and reason. But in Hollywood who needs reason when you have tears, right? Thus we're left with a serious theme that is trampled by trite and exaggerated sensationalism.\n\nI believed at first that the sanctimoniousness was Tony Kaye's. But perhaps this touch is Edward Norton's who apparently monkey-ed around in post-production to the point where Tony Kaye wanted to use a pseudonym (I don't blame him). This wouldn't surprise me after seeing Norton's naive tear-jerker Keeping the Faith. Unfortunately, in Norton I'm \"Losing the Faith\".\n\nThis movie could've been much better if it was created for grown ups. But then it would have to have been created by grown ups."

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is a powerful and challenging film that explores the destructive nature of racism and the possibility of redemption. The film tells the story of a former neo-Nazi named Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton, who tries to prevent his younger brother Danny played by Edward Furlong from following in his footsteps.\n\nThe film opens with a brutal scene of violence that sets the tone for the rest of the film. The scene is graphic and disturbing, but it's necessary to establish the context for Derek's journey.\n\nThe film explores the roots of racism and the ways in which it can destroy individuals and communities. Through Derek's journey, we see how easy it is for people to be swept up in hateful ideologies and how difficult it can be to break free from those beliefs. Derek's transformation is gradual and not without setbacks, but it's ultimately a hopeful and uplifting story that shows the power of personal growth and redemption.\n\nOne of the major strengths of American History X is its performances. Ed Norton delivers an exceptional performance as Derek, perfectly capturing the character's intelligence, charisma, and anger. He's also able to convey the character's growth and redemption without making it feel forced or contrived. Edward Furlong also gives a strong performance as Danny, a young man who's lost and searching for guidance.\n\nThe film is beautifully shot, with a mix of black and white and colour footage that adds to the film's sense of realism. The use of slow-motion and close-ups also help to create a sense of tension and drama. The soundtrack is also brilliant, featuring a mix of punk and hip-hop music that complements the film's themes and tone.\n\nThe themes of the film are heavy and challenging, but they're handled with great sensitivity and nuance. The film shows the almost ever-present possibility of redemption and the importance of confronting our own biases and prejudices. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll and will make you think about the nature of hatred and the possibility of change.\n\nOverall, American History X is a powerful and moving film that deserves to be seen. While it's not an easy film to watch, it's an important and necessary one that tackles sensitive and complex issues with intelligence and nuance."

Overall the movie is relatively disturbing in the beginning, but by the end of the first hour and then towards the end the movie starts to resemble a coming of age movie.

One glance at an online discussion of this movie shows that they're divisive and often ugly. (There are even ongoing debates about which gangs or groups should rightly be called \"Skinheads,\" and which are racist.) I'm just not in the mood for controversy this morning. I'd rather just tell you what I thought about AHX as a film.\n\nThis movie had a lot of great things going for it, but two things stood out in particular. The first was Edward Norton's tour de force performance. I've liked Norton elsewhere, like \"Red Dragon,\" where he was good. Here, he's phenomenal. He's goddam frightening as Neo-nazi Derek. (He reminded me of Bill Moseley's turn as \"Otis Driftwood\" in \"House of 1,000 Corpses.\") Then we see him as a redeemed man. Then, through flashbacks, he's made even more human and three-dimensional, as we see a sensitive young teenager traumatized by the death of his father. Norton was so damned good that I still seem to have trouble believing that the same actor played all three roles. I don't pretend to be a film expert; reviews like this are just a hobby. But I think I know great acting when I see it, and this was great acting.\n\nThe second was a really smart script. Again, I learned from this. I always assumed that Neo-Nazis were poorly educated nuts from the fringes of society. As it turns out, they actually do have an ideology, albeit a horrible and misguided one. This movie makes a very smart move in scripting Derek and his younger brother as \"brilliant\" students, who articulate facts and motivations for doing odious things. Listening to Derek's tirades (including one cringe- inducing scene at a dinner-table) actually sheds light on what motivates the characters' real-life counterparts.\n\nOnly two small things occurred to me that made this film a little less perfect than so many others have claimed it to be. First, this movie doesn't even know the meaning of subtlety. Its message and delivery were so heavy handed that it was almost an ABC afterschool special. We even have an overly convenient framing device \u2013 Derek's adulating brother, Danny (played wonderfully by Edward Furlong), is asked by an African American history teacher to write a report on Derek's life. The superior film, \"Crash\" (2004,) for example, handled racism with a hell of a lot more finesse and surprises.\n\nSecond, one character arc was way too quick and implausible. After one conversation with his redeemed older brother, Danny also disavows the Neo-nazi movement? After years of propaganda and socialization by the group? I'm not so sure a disturbed, fascist teenager can be deprogrammed so easily. Did anyone else who saw this movie wonder about this as well?\n\nStill, this was a great film. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. One final note \u2013 the ending quote by Abraham Lincoln was just beautiful. I'd actually heard only snippets of it sampled by films before \u2013 once in \"Apocalypse Now\" and once in \"X2: X-Men United.\" It's better in its entirety."

Edward Norton was great but what really surprised me was the performance by Edward Furlong, I had never seen him in anything before this picture but he was amazing in it and portrayed a character in this mindset perfectly. This is an amazing viewing experience and extremely powerful, if you haven't watched it you should."

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.\n\nAlthough the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension. Neither black nor white people are \"judged\" in the film, it's primary focus being to outline that it's people's brutality that causes a racial divide, not race itself."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\"\n\nAspect ratio: 1.85:1\n\nSound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS\n\n(Color & black and white)\n\nAn angry young white supremacist (Edward Norton) is reformed whilst in prison for killing two black men, and struggles to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from travelling down the same desperate path.\n\nScorching drama, elevated by Norton's intense performance as the frustrated rebel whose intelligence is twisted by circumstances into an all-consuming hatred of minorities, until his eyes are finally opened to the realities of such manufactured racism. Commercials/music video director Tony Kaye made his feature debut here, though the project was taken out of his hands by studio bosses and 'completed' by Norton following a lengthy editing process, prompting Kaye to reject the finished product (he was refused permission to credit himself as 'Humpty Dumpty'). David McKenna's script describes the ways in which Nazi ideology is propagated by strong-minded individuals who impose their influence on the young and vulnerable (Stacy Keach plays the head of Norton's local skinhead chapter, who co-ordinates episodes of violent 'activism' from a safe legal distance), and how it manifests itself amongst those without an appropriate outlet for their aggressive tendencies.\n\nThe film kicks into high gear from the outset, when the full extent of Norton's racism becomes apparent during a horrific confrontation with his widowed mom's new boyfriend (Elliott Gould), followed by a gut-wrenching scene in which Norton commits the sickening crime that will send him to prison and change his life forever. There, his worldview is profoundly challenged not only by his friendship with African-American co-worker Guy Torry (terrific in a pivotal role), but also by the double standards employed amongst the skinhead gangs he encounters within the prison system. For these characters, there can be no happy ending, and the film builds to a shattering finale. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, William Russ and an unrecognizable Fairuza Balk. Fine technical credits."

        "review_detailed_main": "The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned. Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed. AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong. In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison. You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property. It was certainly NOT self-defense.\n\nAMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it. But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors. Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to \"rid\" a portion of California of \"unwanted, inferior races.\" A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home. Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization. He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA). If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever. I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run. In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long. This is sad, but a point is presented here. Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is: sheer stupidity and ignorance.\n\nThe film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration. After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali. The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down. In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch. Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads. Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.\n\nRumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued. Whoever's \"vision\" won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong. It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end. Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds. It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives. He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry. Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.\n\nRATING: 10 of 10"

The plot was simply exceptional with many great scenes and some plot twists that I could not even imagine, and along with the direction which was made by Tony Kaye, this masterpiece was made. The interpretation of Edward Norton who played as Derek Vinyard was simply outstanding and he made the difference in this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Edward Furlong's who played as Danny Vinyard, Ethan Suplee's who played as Seth Ryan and Guy Torry's who played as Lamont. Finally, I have to say that \"American History X\" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch because I am sure that everybody can learn something from it."

This film rather wants to get to the bottom of it, making a statement of what need to be done.\n\nIt doesn't just show racist people, in this case neo-nazis, as frustrated, lonely people reaching out to whomever willingly to accept them. The main character, played convincingly by Edward Norton, is an intelligent orator and charismatic leader, who let his black side explain the problems of society, and act accordingly.\n\nHate is shown from both sides. Good reasons for hate are presented. At the same time the narrowsighted aspect of it carefully comes to light, making you see that hate blinds your good judgement. Making you reject there is a flip side to the matter. If you see beyond the entertaining value of this film (which is great), it might actually grab you, wanting you to help those who hate.\n\nThis movie also makes a huge point of the effect trusted persons arguments have on others.

Everything about the movie feels great: the cinematography, the black and white shots, the soundtracks, and the acting-omg, that portrayal by Edward Norton! I was a fan when I watched him in Fight Club, but this was way at the top. Nothing in the movie is cliched, as someone might expect from a 1998 film, but everything is portrayed so subtly, and that's where the perfection lies. Excellent film!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Watching American History X again 19 years after its release, the sight of Edward Norton's enigmatic frame captured in stark black- and- white quickly reminded me of just why I loved the film so much, and why it was one of the first DVDs I purchased when the transition from VHS was starting to take hold. I was 13 when I first saw the film in 1998, and now I'm 32 with more life experience and many, many more movies under my belt, the cracks and problems with Tony Kaye's tale of brotherly love and neo-Nazism also became apparent. It was something I could never quite put my finger on as a youngster, but the film's main issue is with trying to resolve a lifetime of hate and dysfunction in a single night, and by setting itself such time constraints, over-simplifies an incredibly complex and sensitive subject, although its heart is certainly in the right place.\n\nAmerican History X tells the story of two brothers; Derek (Norton), a charismatic and hardened skin-head freshly released from prison following a brutal double-murder, and Danny (Edward Furlong), an intelligent kid following in the doomed footsteps of the older sibling he admires so much. Danny has just written a paper on Adolf Hitler, glorifying the fascist leader as a civil rights hero. His (black) schoolteacher Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) is outraged, but sets Danny the task of penning a paper on his brother, who had walked free that very morning. Hurrying home to reunite with his hero, Danny finds his brother a changed man. Derek has grown his hair, and no longer proudly displays the swastika tattooed on his torso. Something happened in prison that allowed Derek to let go of his misguided hate, and sets about ensuring that Danny doesn't follow the same path by confronting hate teacher and former ally Cameron (Stacy Keach).\n\nThis impeccably-performed and suitably rough-around-the-edges movie is far more successful with depicting Derek's rise to legend-status amongst his gang than it is with handling his drastic change of heart. Despite a rather silly basketball game, the bulk of the black-and- white flashbacks offer a keen and convincing insight into the mind of a highly-intelligent leader of men who has inherited prejudice and hate. When he enters prison following the shocking murder, Derek becomes torn between the hypocritical Aryan Brotherhood and his laundry-room work mate Lamont (Guy Torry). These moments, which are supposed to convince us that a man of Derek's single-mindedness could learn the error of his ways, are reduced to a handful of clumsily-written conversations and a particularly nasty rape. It ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise, and whether this uneven narrative was the result of Norton being brought in to help with the final edit, causing Kaye to completely disown the film, I couldn't tell you. Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power, and Norton gives a performance of such staggering intensity that he will likely never best it."

Which became especially gross when Danny told about the sound that action made. I'm still shivering thinking of it. The scene of Derek running to the school was moving and one of the best scenes in the movie. The scenes in the prison were also very powerful.

AHX flicks from flashbacks of Derek's rise (head of a cult) and fall (murder), and rise again (redemption), to his present day atonement. Derek's crime is one of the most violent off-screen acts in cinema history. Danny looks up to his older brother, slowly but surely following his footsteps. It's down to Derek to put things right. This film sticks to the back of the mind, because the representation of its immoral actions are heavy, powerful and a harsh kick on reality regarding hate-crime."

It kept me interested throughout the entirety of the runtime and it even made me a little heavy on emotions. Not only is the story great, the performances in the movie are phenomenal, especially Edward Norton. The guy should've won the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor back then. The dark and haunting score helps lift the atmosphere of the movie to new heights. And the way it is directed (cinematography and such) just adds to everything. The way they use grey scale for Flashbacks is something I just simply adore.\n\nThis movie is fantastic in every way possible. It is definitely one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend it.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This movie isn't always easy to watch."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good."

But it also is terrific in it's acting, directing and photography.\n\nEdward Norton is the highlight of this film (along with an Oscar Nom.) as the troubled Derek Vinyard, who after his father is killed by a group of blacks is drawn into the Neo-Nazi movement in Venice Beach. The scenes depicting his time in the Nazi movement is startling, violent, and frustrating. It really puts the zap on your head. Anyway, after Derek is put in jail for double murder, he leaves only wanting to save his brother (played well by Edward Furlong) from the same movement that put him into jail. All through the film, we never feel anything in this movie is less than perfect. I certaintly didn't, and hopefully you won't either. Best film of 1998. A++"

The basketball scene itself is so silly, it single-handedly destroys any credibility this film might have had. Others have already noted the unbelievable dinner and prison scenes as well. A lifetime of hate - instant contrition. How can anyone possibly take this thing seriously? There are far greater movies on racial injustice, \"Mississippi Burning\" being one that comes to mind quickly. AHX should be closer to the bottom 250 than it is to the top."

The problem is that the overall message of the film - racism is malignant and doesn't provide the solace it promises - is completely undermined by Norton's presentation. He gives a truly stunning performance, but his character (Danny) is so much more appealing when he's the mesmerizing racist poster boy. When he returns from prison, after having sorted out all of his prior racist ideology, he's much less interesting to watch. It was actually disturbing to me how sexy he was, shirtless in the street, after having just killed someone in one of the most violent ways I've ever encountered. It's hard to buy the idea that racism is bad when it comes in such an attractive package, especially when its opposite is presented as feminized and weak.\n\nThis movie had high ambitions, and almost reached them, but in the end misses its target by letting Norton be TOO good."

This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's. As long as you can get by the gore and action then this will likely be a film for you. This is a must see film for all fans of drama movies."

        "review_detailed_main": "The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention."

        "review_detailed_main": "American History X is stirringly thought-provoking. It serves as a wake up call for the masses that differentiate on the basis of any particular entity.\n\nThe movie reels off the story about a Neo-Nazi skinhead who was once against the black progeny, but later figures to prevent his brother from choosing the same path after getting a reality check. The movie is incorporated with peculiarities of anger, violence, compassion and honorable philosophy. It possesses an ideal run time of 2 hours and manages to blow away. Also, an unforeseeable climax diversifies the movie making it even more disparate.\n\nThey probably couldn't have assembled a better cast. Edward Norton, who played the lead role was undeniably striking, no wonder he got nominated for the 'Best Actor in a Leading Role' category at the Academy awards. Edward Furlong was simply alluring while enacting an integral character of the story line. Greater supporting roles played by Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks were commendable. Accompanying them were Ethan Suplee and Guy Torry, they pulled of a splendid task as well. Minor roles impersonated by Jennifer Lien and Elliot Gould too were above average.\n\nFilm Direction was brilliantly executed. Consorted by David McKenna's screenplay, Tony Kaye, the director, doubtlessly managed to produce the necessary ambiance. Editing sector was absolutely praiseworthy. Likewise, music by Anne Dudley was pleasing. Cinematography was garden-variety.\n\nAll things considered, the film is top notch. Controversial yet soothing. Violent yet placid. In a single word, EPIC. Watch it and I'm certain that it will leave you thinking about racial abuse and its intracacies."

But will it be enough to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlobg) from making the same mistakes as he did?\n\nIt's kind of fitting that, for such a film\u2014one so focused on turmoil, struggle and radical beliefs\u2014American History X is the result of an extremely troubled background itself, director Tony Kaye attempting to disown the final film after star Ed Norton saw fit to re-cut the film against his wishes. Amazingly, somehow, the finished film bears no signs of its tumultuous past, being a nigh on perfect study of the cyclical nature of bigotry, one that powerfully drives home the futility of blind hatred.\n\nBoasting many a brilliant performance, wonderful cinematography, smart editing throughout (Norton must've known what he was doing), and some almost poetic acts of violence, plus a powerful message at its heart, this is must-see cinema that makes the viewer think long and hard about what they have witnessed long after the shocking climax has faded from the screen."

Racism is also one of the film main theme thinking that white people have supremacy over people of colors. American History X excels in story telling, why? because of its black and white and colored scheme every time there is a flashback, which is in black and white format and wherein its story line evolved. The colored one represents the present time.\n\nEdward Norton got nominated for this film and I think he really deserves it one of the flawless acting performance I've ever seen, It's shame that the Academy didn't nominate this gem in the Best Picture category I think the reason is its provoking theme and I think the academy is not ready to recognize a Powerful Politically charged film during the 90's"

The movie almost had me in tears by the end of it. If you aren't moved after watching this movie then you just aren't human.\n\nDerek Vinyard (Ed Norton) is one of the most dynamic characters I have ever seen in a movie. I mean he is so impressionable but yet so charismatic at the same time. Very rarely do get that kind of dangerous combination together. He was so gullible and would believe what any strong willed person forced upon him, but the dangerous part is that he take what he learned and influence so many people with it. He had that special something that people were just drawn to. He could make people do whatever he wanted them to do, but in the same turn would do whatever someone else wanted him to do. His transformation by the end of this movie was just so inspiring. This is one of the best characters I have seen in a long long time.\n\nIf you have not seen this movie yet, you do not know what you are missing. I'm not going to lie to you though; this movie is not for everyone. American History X will show you a side of the real world that no one really wants to know about. So if you want to stay in your perfect little bubble that there is nothing wrong in the world then DO NOT watch this movie. This movie tackles the race issues in our society in a way that most people would be afraid to touch. By the end of this movie you will be almost ready to cry because it shows you everything that is wrong with society today, but there is that silver lining of hope that everyone can change. In conclusion, if you're faint-hearted this movie isn't for you, but if you want an in your face look at the dark side of society that will send a chill down your spine then check this movie out."

Edward Norton played his role so well that you really passionately love him or hate him (meaning the character that he is playing). I have watched this movie more than 10 times and it seems like each time that i watch it i still find something out that i didn't catch any or the times before that i watched it. I would recommend this movie though more to the younger to middle aged adults, i would not recommend showing it to any teenagers or any elderly people as it can be a bit to graphic at times."

It's one such movie wherein you'll find yourself somewhere among those characters and compare yourself with one of those, I mean if you are really a movie nerd. Being an Indian I really don't picturize what sort of discrimination is going on in USA. But this movie I think really gave me an idea of what it is like. And I got to know it's all about exasperation.Edward Norton did the best, was definitely an academy award performance by him.\n\nAs you keep watching the movie at particular time you'll have a different perception about it. It'll definitely change your paradigm and you'll start thinking alongside Edward, which is the best part of the movie. I don't really wanna spoil it, and if you love watching movies to learn something this movie has got a heap of it. A recommended watch for conclusion."

        "review_title": "A gripping performance from Norton leads American History X to glory.",
        "review_detailed_main": "American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi and his overcoming of hate, and his attempts to prevent his brother from following in his footsteps. The film shows how blame only leads to hate, and hate creates nothing positive, only suffering and regret. Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, the former neo-Nazi, is enthralling and showcases his exceptional ability. Norton bosses every scene he is in, whether he is portraying a neo-Nazi or one that has overcome that path; it almost seems as if he is portraying two different characters. Some extremely powerful speeches - whether for good or bad causes - are excellently written, showcasing the ability of screenwriter, David McKenna, and Norton delivers them exceptionally. Supporting performances from many of the cast, including Edward Furlong, who plays younger brother Danny, are well done. Danny in many ways portrays the shadow of his older brother; he is on a very similar path, and this is clearly shown when comparing the Derek seen as a neo-Nazi in clever flashbacks to Danny now, and the gap in mentality and attitude there is between the brothers after Derek is released from prison. We get a more precise view of Danny's thoughts in small sections we see in his essay, American History X; he writes the words 'It doesn't bother me anymore' on his computer screen, and this in some ways explains his demise and how he has been desensitised to violence and hate. The use of different characters to represent levels of extremes and how people influence one another is profound. The headteacher of Danny's school, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), is the first person in the film we see try to discourage Danny from falling into a hateful path, he represents a sort of hope that one can be better than full of views of hatred and division. The new partner of the brother's mother, Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), represents how people with decent views can be pushed aside by hatred. And characters on the other end of the spectrum, such as the brother's friend, Seth (Ethan Suplee), who embodies blind thuggery. How these characters influence both Derek and Danny show how important it is to listen to the right people and is also a showcase of the intelligent writing on show. Director Tony Kaye utilises every minute of this film to full effect; no scene is wasted. The film has a good pacing and is done very well with flashbacks and current events. The cinematography is quite brilliant, the use of the noir effect on all flashback scenes is crucial. The black/white contrast is a theme ever-present in this film and the noir effect captures this perfectly. The fact that present scenes are in colour also shows a contrast and change in attitude of Derek; as in the flashback scenes he is a neo-Nazi skinhead, full of hate, and in present scenes he is a changed man, a neo-Nazi no more, and a man who has lost his hate. The film shares some similarities with Shawshank Redemption: they both involve crime and prisons, but more importantly can give the viewer a slightly different outlook on life. Shawshank has been known to give many viewers a different outlook on life in general - how to view life and how to be more positive. American History X can give a viewer a slightly more nuanced look on life; it shows how hate gets you nowhere, it only causes evil, and that losing that hate can make your outlook on life much more positive. American History X has a cleverly intertwined story that is still relevant today. Edward Norton's performance is outstanding along with the screenplay, and although the main character may not be relatable on face-value, the way his mind works, is manipulated, and the mental experiences he goes through can be compared with those of an everyday person. This makes for a captivating experience and is well worth the watch."

A lot of mixed feelings while watching the viewer. Between anger and compassion, the pity and hate, between love and disappointment. And Very moving ending. Somehow, after watching the film, it will be hard to stop thinking about him and connect with your real life. But I know it happened to me and I'm pretty sure it was everyone else watching this film. Just a masterpiece, giving you plenty to think. I liked a lot and cried a lot."

Edwards Norton and Furlong were exceptional in their characters..and so was the rest of the actors. As a Libertarian I agree with much of what Derrik was saying about the state of the country. This movies certainly did not do such a good job of making many of the black characters sympathetic, except Lamont. I mean come on, 3 guys with guns, one standing on your front porch and one in your yard and one breaking into your car...are we supposed to feel sympathy for them? I did not like the girl who played Derriks girlfriend...it would have been better in a miniseries perhaps if they had showed him longing for her but at the same time, wanting to leave the gang..instead the breakup was so abrupt. I would have liked to see more of the family flashbacks. This movie, besides Lamont, actually made me feel more sympathetic to the skinheads than the minorities (except that horrible grocery store scene) I would buy this movie because I really enjoyed the Edwards performances, and Norton was extraordinarily sexy in those white boxers."

The title refers to an assignment Danny has to write after the school principle, who was a black man, is outraged by Danny's history paper about Nazism, so he gives him the task to write about skin-heads for a special class named 'American History X'. An impressive movie, from all the things Derek has to face in prison, to the way he tries to change Danny, his younger brother, showing him that the path he has chosen is not right. Edward Norton's acting is beyond perfect, this has to be one of his greatest roles, Edward Furlong played very well, this movie would not be the same without them. The story is well thought and the cast is chosen well. The ending has a great impact on everyone."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"American History X\" deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie.\n\nThat said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama.\n\nAs long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch.\n\n6/10"
