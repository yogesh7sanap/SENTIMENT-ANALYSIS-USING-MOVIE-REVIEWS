From the totally pointless/unrelated cheesy opening scene of HF on a shooting range, the lake chase scene, the whole buddy buddy chemistry (or total deliberate lack thereof) to the non stop annoying phone ringing or maybe the complete lack of an interesting plot? Some of these should have given away to most people the real intentions of this film.\n\nThe 'love' scene with Harrison Ford should be the last clue to anyone blind enough, that this is really not to be taken seriously and can be considered made specially for Mystery Science Theatre.\n\nThe film is called 'Hollywood Homicide', I believe, so titled as to ruffle some Hollywood feathers with the notion that Hollywood has been killed by the never ending rain of terrible buddy cop movies. The real joke is that some suit somewhere probably OK'd this as a real action movie.\n\nIn fact, the funniest thing is that some people took it seriously and enjoyed it as a serious action movie.\n\nThe chases are deliberately over the top lame (I mean really, really bad), the dialogue is so silly and pointless it just makes you laugh, the character development is totally non-existant, the cliches flow non-stop, the whole side plot of internal affairs is placed there because it's in every buddy cop movie, etc, etc. How anyone took this movie as a serious action film is beyond me.\n\nI give it 6/10 because, it's hilarious in places (in a MST kind of way), I agree with their intentions (THE COP FILMS MUST END!!!). Just please, don't take it anything more than a parody."

        "review_detailed_main": "Taking another chance on L.A, on the streets and more specifically on the police, as in \"Dark Blue\", Ron Shelton, a man of multiple themes, brings a new project to the table, which is called \"Hollywood Homicide\". The difference between this one and the latter one is that this is Hollywood, precisely. And when the beginning credits roll, and we're shown fifty \"Hollywood\" signs; it's obvious that they want us to realize that. Why would it be?\n\nThe story about Ron Shelton meeting Robert Souza in the set of \"Dark Blue\" and them both getting together to write the script of \"Hollywood Homicide\", because Souza had been a cop before\u0085Interesting. However, in the same vein, \"Dark Blue\" is the portrait of a cruel reality; \"Hollywood Homicide\" is the satire of a shallow but real reality in the end. It's Hollywood, and it was a good premise to put some fun in the crime scenes, probably to make it \"more dramatic than anything seen in Hollywood\".\n\nThe other elements the plot offers go from action to crime, or vice versa. They created the murderer of a rap band, so they could mess a little bit with the music business, too. There we see the producers, the groups, the \"showbiz\"\u0085It's even related with theater and movies, because one of the main characters wants to be an actor; and in a decent comedic way, he's thinking about acting each time he's doing something; and he probably isn't that good.\n\nI'm talking about K.C Calden; Josh Hartnett's character. He gives classes of movements to find the inner self. There, a lot of hot women assist and kiss him when they leave. In one scene, his partner tells him that he did for sex. \"At first it was for sex, now it has become something spiritual\", K.C answers, and at night, a hot woman is waiting for him in the \"Jacuzzi\". \"How long has it been since the last time you got laid\", K.C asks his partner. \"It's not your business\", the partner says. Then, he lets a man working as a prostitute into his car. When they discuss that, he says: \"It was nothing, it was a man, a cop; a cop man\".\n\nThis partner is Joe Gavilan, a pro in the police business played by a pro in the acting business. As he did with Kurt Russell in \"Dark Blue\", Shelton brings Harrison Ford back to the top of his game. With his character, based on writer Robert Souzas's own life, he has the best lines and he has a lot of fun. Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington) should be afraid of him; a man that has had sex, with Ruby (an over the top Lena Olin) and makes real estate business with producer Jerry Duran (the great Martin Landau) and Julius Armas (a correct Master P) while he's driving a car high speed. When he is told the composer of the rap group is still alive, he replies: \"Somebody actually writes that s***?\". He has had bad times, Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood) wants to get him, and in the best scene of the movie, he and K.C get interrogated. This scene is managed with camera changes between the two interrogating rooms, where in Joe's, his cell is always ringing; and in K.C's, he is \"centering\" himself spiritually. Joe's interrogator can't do anything, while K.C's interrogator (a woman) asks him to help her relax.\n\nThat scene stole the only laughs from me during the entire film. Keith David was also having fun in his Leo role, reprising some of the comic elements he gave to Lester Wallace in \"Barbershop\". More importantly, and if you were wondering, Shelton directs his actors perfectly, making a stupendous balance between the pro and the amateur, the old and the young; Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett. Their chemistry is perfect, and one of the few reasons to watch the movie. In the end, their characters are nothing else but cops, in a film that leaves a lot of plot situations unresolved, is a bit long, not funny enough, but different from the gross humor that everyone finds easy to put on paper."

Very formulaic. You get a wiser older cop with flaws and/or attitude and a young acolyte with flaws and/or attitude. The novelty here is that while many cops moonlight to pay their bills, Ford's a detective who doesn't let hot police work interfere with his on and off real estate brokerage business. With incessant calls for his private business on a cell phone that rings with \"My Girl,\" Ford delivers a good performance with wry humor and a surprising degree of athleticism (he's sixty but you'd never know it).\n\nJosh Hartnett, as the very junior homicide investigator, also has a sideline, actually two. He earnestly pursues an acting career while running a meditation mill for lissome young lovelies who, predictably, fall into his arms and bed. But he's a good cop.\n\nThe actual homicide story is instantly familiar and its development devoid of surprises. So what? It's summer! I can't see art films EVERY day.\n\n6/10. Can't give it more than that but it was entertaining for both me and my teenage son who especially appreciated the urban road rampage."

Several sensual scenes involving Harrison Ford actually drew snickers from the crowd. I even overheard a teenage girl say, \"Gross, isn't he like 60!\". I guess the 'Indy' days are over for Ford. The doughnut in one of the more intimate scenes probably drew the biggest laugh of the entire movie and got peoples' minds off the fact the Ford was making out with a lady 14 years younger than him.\n\nAnywho, the rest of the cast was good. Keith David as Lieutenant Fuqua was entertaining. The always surprising and very compelling, Dwight Yoakam was great. Not Sling Blade great, but more like Panic Room great. Josh Hartnett's character was funny in a very whacked out yoga way, but was clearly in the film for folks like the aforementioned wife. Overall good movie, go see it. 7/10."

The car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum. They manage to switch vehicles a few times, but always end up right on the tail of the baddies. The scene where Hartnett grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be. He is telling them about Eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die, which I imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty. It just came off as moronic, totally unbelievable and even cruel.\n\nSome subplots weren't even explored, they were just used as filler. Why does Hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes? Why, and on what grounds, is the bad IA guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief? Why can IA pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be Indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist? For some reason, even though Ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor, (he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer's house to jack up his own commission), they keep coming back to him anyway! They knew he lied to both of them! Yet there they were, coming to terms that both said they would never go for. Stupid, just stupid. This is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders. There they were, just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover. Amazing that they didn't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each....\n\nThe scriptwriting was terrible, the action sequences were boring, the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for Ford and Hartnett. It fails miserably. And Ford's phone! Turn the damn thing off! How many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie? 50? 60? It was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie! Every 30 seconds, that stupid tune would play! And if it wasn't Ford's, then Hartnett's was ringing! It was incredibly annoying!\n\nComplete waste of time, Ford's worst movie since 6 Days 7 Nights, which was without a doubt, the lowest point of his distinguished career."

        "review_detailed_main": "Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) is a seasoned detective. K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett) is his still wet behind the ears partner. Hollywood Homicide has them trying to balance the investigation of murders involving members of LA's rap industry with unusual extracurricular activities and concerns.\n\nThe most obvious aspects that make the film work so well are the extracurriculars. Without them, this might be seen as just another buddy-cop action/crime/drama--a good one at that, but nothing spectacular. But Hollywood Homicide is a comedy at heart. Gavilan's first concern upon arriving at any crime scene is that he gets some food, just the way he likes it. He's also a real estate agent. While conducting investigations, calls from buyers and sellers of homes always take precedence. Calden is also an aspiring actor, and he's quite a ladies' man. He even makes extra income by running a yoga class--with only women students--at $20 a head. Most of the students want to sleep with him, as do most other women he meets. They get away with it because Gavilan, at least, is also a great detective.\n\nAll of this material is very funny, but never in an over-the-top way. In fact, a lot of viewers might have difficulty \"getting\" the humor in the film, as much of it arrives by way of the action/crime/drama material that is only slightly exaggerated. That's a genre that often borders on the absurd even when it's played seriously. So the tendency may be for people to take this film seriously at times, and miss the gist of the humor.\n\nThe real joke, of course, is that this is Hollywood--a fact made all too clear by director Ron Shelton's title montage of \"Hollywood\" on various signs. In Hollywood, as in LA in general, it seems that everyone has something else that they'd rather be doing than their actual job, so they're all really focusing on that instead, while the day job pays the bills. Everyone is trying to make connections, and they're willing to do all kinds of unusual things to make them. Everyone is constantly on their cell phones. Run-ins with people who have various connections to the entertainment industry are commonplace, and it's not unusual to casually compliment them on their talent or some facet of their career before you, say, run after their offspring with a gun. Criminal activity and other unpleasant facts of daily existence are mostly taken in stride because no one can let such things get in the way of achieving success in what they really want to do.\n\nThat Shelton was able to make a film about \"the real joke\", and still keep a capable \"serious\" action/crime/drama running in the background is the real secret to the film's success. Without looking the broader themes, one might wonder why Harrison Ford would pick a seemingly pedestrian script at this stage of his career. From a deeper perspective, this is a very funny film with a more serious, almost self-deprecating subtext (for Hollywood, or the entertainment industry in general), and with an even more generalized \"the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence\" theme. Hollywood Homicide is well worth a watch or reassessment with this in mind."

They also have jobs on the side, Ford is a real-estate broker, and Hartnett is an actor/yoga instructor. These both play key roles in the movie, and add some of the comedic flavor. It was good to see Ford go back to having a personality, because it fits this movie. Overall I'd give the movie a 3.5 out of 5 scale, and definently recommend it, because its fun as hell!"

OK, all actors are entitled to a bad film once in a while.\n\nLike many have said the movie comes across as not being sure what genre it is or isn't. The worst part for me was watching Harrison Ford during chase scenes. It looked to me as though his arthritis was acting up. It was so distracting and I was embarrassed for him. I have seen plenty of aging actors take on physical roles that of course they're not as fast or as agile as their younger counterparts, but they didn't move with such rigidity and pain that it became a distraction in itself. YIKES! I understand that his character did real estate on the side. He looked more like an aging real estate agent who was forced into doing something physical that he's not accustomed to doing, like a cop chasing suspects.\n\nJosh Hartnett was also forgettable in this disaster and looked completely bored most of the time.

This is another of the reasons I decided to go, because often when people state this and give a movie a low rating, they are blaming the movie for their own lack of mental dexterity. The plot was not hard to follow, though it did zip right along. Josh Harnet and Harrison Ford played off of each other well, and their interaction was interesting and funny. I had never seen Josh before, and was impressed. No one will get an academy award, but as a light hearted summer action-comedy, it's a fine way to spend a rainy afternoon.

Actually, if Ford and Hartnett had simply ad-libbed I would wager the result could not have been worse than the final script.\n\nThe sad aspect of this movie is that the fault does not lie fully on the script. The acting from Ford and Hartnett is very poor. Most notably, Ford is completely unbelievable in his attempted \"quirky\" role. This is far from the dynamic, engaging Ford of \"Indiana Jones\" or \"Witness.\"\n\nYou have been warned. Watch this at your own risk. Even if you are watching for laughs I would not recommend this movie.

He has to team up with young Calden (Josh Hartnett). Both of them are involved in an investigation revolving around a series of murders in the world of rap. But in parallel, the former also works as an estate agent to make ends meet while the latter teaches yoga and dreams of becoming an actor...\n\nAmerican cinema has already offered us products boasting two mismatched cops who are compelled to work together to solve a murder or to clarify a judicial affair like \"48 Hours\" (1982) or \"the Lethal Weapon\" saga. \"Hollywood Homicide\" finds itself deeply rooted in this tradition with the portraits of the two men I described earlier. But it is different from the other buddy movies because the viewer discovers another face of the American police. Some members are obliged to occupy a second job to provide for their needs. Thanks to this, Shelton renews a little the genre his flick belongs to with the contribution of Robert Souza who was a former cop.\n\nThe director turned to this perspective with a playful eye and thus his film has strong comedy accents. Is it enough to ensure the vision of the film? Well, Shelton's venture and his intentions are rather commendable but they amount to a lame movie. It oscillates nearly all the time between comedy of manners and detective film and has trouble to keep a unity and a stable pace. It is at times monotonous especially in the first half and it sometimes takes a boisterous turn. Shelton also obviously tried to bestow his work with an action-packed side in his story, notably with an endless chase in the second hour; first in car then on foot which throws the film off balance. The options chosen by Shelton to showcase the two heroes' private lives also get the film embroiled in shallow subplots. Then as the film boasts two stars, Shelton and Souza seemed to proportion correctly Ford and Hartnett's roles so that each of them could have equal parts on the screen. You can check this remark throughout the film by the numerous signs or clues related to the respective lives of our duo.\n\nIf this film had been more tightened and fluid, it could have been the perfect contender to completely transcend and renew the buddy movie."

As this is a world that doesn't open up to law enforcement in general, solving this massacre is going to be tough.\n\nBut put on this Hollywood Homicide are a pair of detective partners of different generations both of whom have different other life careers. Harrison Ford has delved deeply into those get rich quick real estate schemes you see on infomercial television. He's got himself a $700,000.00 lemon on his hands right now and even LAPD's Internal Affairs is looking into him.\n\nAs for young Josh Hartnett, son of a cop killed in the line of duty, he'd really like to be an actor. He's also into new wave type religion that really drives Internal Affairs nuts when he's questioned.\n\nThe club owner Isaiah Washington who employs some LAPD cops as his security is not terribly cooperative, maybe preferring to deal with it in house in every sense of the word. It's not going to be easy for Ford and Hartnett who seem to be dealing with all of this in their spare time.\n\nIt's all the usual kind of stuff you expect in modern police comedies or dramas and this is a bit of both. I'd like to single out soul singer Gladys Knight who plays the mother of a survivor who does in fact put Hartnett and Ford on the right track. And his fans will be somewhat taken aback by Lou Diamond Phillips who has a cameo appearance as an undercover detective in full drag. Make up and wardrobe really did right by Lou.\n\nFans of the two lead actors should enjoy Hollywood Homicide."

        "review_detailed_main": "I like crime thrillers. It's one of my favorite genres, though I haven't seen many good ones in the medium of film. Most of the time, I'm reading them, like some of Kellerman's or Grisham's. Most movie crime thrillers just seem to fizzle out, though there are some classics, if they tend to be critically panned. Yesterday, I watched Hollywood Homicide on Netflix and finished with mixed feelings.\n\nIt promises to be both a comedy and a crime thriller, and it fails at both. There's maybe one point where I genuinely laughed because something funny happened, and about ten times where I just shook my head at the failed attempts at humor. The crime thriller aspect is ruined because there is literally zero mystery after about 10 minutes of the film when they literally show you who's the bad guy. Wow, you literally took away the entire point of crime thrillers: figuring out who done it and why. And the execution of telling you this is poor at best.\n\nThe action is few and far between and isn't very well executed. The acting isn't all that great. It does have Harrison Ford as the leading character, but nor are there any other memorable names or does he do a great job himself. The characters are either bland or unlikeable. Harrison's is the best, and shows signs of potential. The dialogue is meh. There's some good stuff, iffy stuff, and deplorable stuff. There's even an uncomfortable and unnecessary sex scene (though it doesn't show anything, thankfully).\n\nSo I wanted to like it, but the only piece of comedy comes in the first ten minutes, and the failed crime aspect kind of ruin this film. However, it does entertain for the rest of the film and didn't make me cringe much outside of the few failed attempts of humor. So it's not the worst thing, but it's a failed attempt at best. Hollywood Homicide gets a 5/10. Had it succeeded in either aspect it promises, it could've been a great film, but it just isn't great. It isn't good. It isn't decent. And it isn't even mediocre."

Two LAPD detectives played by Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett investigate the murder of an up and coming rap band. In his spare time Ford moonlights as an real estate agent, Hartnett as a yoga instructor, but he really wants to be an actor, an spends a lot of time reciting 'A Streetcar Named Desire'\n\nThere are scenes of action, car chases (more like Smokey & The Bandit than Bullit) chases on foot and shoot outs. In between there was loving making and some sentimental soul searching before the predictable finale\n\nLou Diamond Phillips pops up, as does Martin Landau, Eric Idle Smokey Robinson, Robert Wagner and Gladys Knight.\n\nFord remains watchable, as always, but these are not two of his better hours."

Secondly, is this movie a comedy or an action movie?

Thirdly, Isaiah Washington is not a good actor (time to find a new career buddy, sorry). Fourthly (if that's even a word), there is a point where the number of unusual characters gets annoying. In Hollywood Homicides case, about 20 minutes in. Fifthly, when in the history of detectives or cop movies is the Captain only referred to by first name both in the dialogue and the credits? Never; there must be a reason for this. Sixthly, not every character needs a love interest. This movie may have actually been better had Harrison Ford not had a \"ladyfriend\". Seventhly, in what universe can a cop fire his weapon at a vehicle in public without an investigation? Apparently in Sheltonland. Eigthly and finally, with a former detective as co-writer and advisor all previously said mistakes in realism should be nonexistant. Therefore, if you wish to see a buddy/cop movie that is both funny and action packed rent Lethal Weapon 1,3, or 4. These were and are how it's supposed to be done. Hollywood Homicide: 2 stars out of 10."

This movie has no sense of pace, we are left not really caring about the crime that has been committed or who did it, the action sequences are completely out of place and look like they were thrown in last minute to juice things up!

Best thing about 'Hollywood Homicide' is the pairing of Ford & Harnett. They are a lot of fun and have good on-screen chemistry which is odd to say when you learn after the fact they heavily disliked working with each other.\n\nFour members of a popular rap group are brutally gunned down while performing in a nightclub. Sgt. Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) and his younger, less experienced partner K. C. Calden (Josh Harnett) are assigned the case. Joe moonlights as a real estate agent and K. C. is an aspiring actor and somewhat of a womanizer.\n\nThere's bits involving a physic, the slimy head of a record label, his dirtbag head of security amongst shootouts & chase scenes delivering the required action. The trope about new partners bonding and some tacked on backstory about a cop father who was gunned down in the line of duty. Plus an additional antagonist in a IA lieutenant. There's a ton of known faces filling out the cast. As is typical of director Ron Shelton, his actress wife Lolita Davidovich has a role.\n\n'Hollywood Homicide' commits the ultimate deadly sin of a comedy - it isn't consistently funny. The action is rather pedestrian too. I liked the buddy cop pairing found here, but a lot of the best parts made it's way into a good trailer with a better tone than the actual movie. This is fairly average all things said and done."

The way life in SoCal is portrayed is how I view it (from afar, I'd never live in L.A., as I'm a Northern Cal person), rushing for the wrong reasons, networking with people instead of making real human connections, always pedaling some sales pitch, etc. And all this was with a dry sense of humor - I didn't notice any silly one-liners in the whole film, yet I laughed throughout its entirety. I liked all the main actors in their roles. The plot was only secondary to the characters, so its lack of coherence in spots wasn't a big deal to me. My one gripe is that the interrogation scene is a bit too frantic feeling, but I can forgive that one spot of overplay. All-in-all, I think this was a great, mocking, dryly funny romp of a movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "This film, in Denmark at least, was marketed as a lightweight cop/buddy movie, part of the joke being the mismatch of Josh Harnett and Harrison Ford. Personally I thought it was OK; as a rental that is. I wouldn't be too happy if I'd paid good money to see it in a theatre. Sure, in a few places it made me laugh, thereby fulfilling my expectations. There were more than a few 'names' in the movie that were either under-utilized or just tossed away, but so what? Everyone needs to slum it now and again, something that I'm sure director Ron Shelton was more than happy to do after the hard-hitting and bleak 'Dark Blue'. And I'm also sure that everyone got paid a tidy sum at the end of the day. Harrison Ford is a good serious actor, truly believable when playing furrowed-browed, exasperated characters under pressure. What a lot of viewers forget is that the bulk of his high profile comes from playing lightweight comedic characters - fast quipping Han Solo, desperate but dry Indiana Jones anyone? - He doesn't disappoint here either. He's a seriously entertaining comedic actor, whilst Josh Harnett is a proficient and good looking foil to the dog eared Mr. Ford. That said, the film just doesn't add up. Just look at the names; besides the aforementioned leads, there's Martin Landau, Lena Olin, Lou Diamond Phillips, Lolita Davidovich, Bruce Greenwood and a host of notables in cameo roles. The whole mish-mash is directed by the reputable Ron Shelton. Admittedly, just because a film has some heavyweight names doesn't automatically mean that there's going to be a lot of substance in the content, but one is right to expect more. There certainly isn't here though. This is a souffl\u00e9 of a film. The main plot is quickly forgotten.(...why I haven't mentioned it,)and there's the wasted talent, but I seen worse films that purported to be funny, and weren't. Films that even had sequels made!And therein lies my point. I had low expectations. I chuckled, therefore I was pleased. No more, no less.\n\nEpitaph: When the film ended, I couldn't help thinking that it could be translated into a highly entertaining TV cop show, but you'd have to keep Harrison Ford for it to work; and somehow I just don't see him doing that. Not just yet..."

        "review_detailed_main": "The Lethal Weapon franchise succeeded in marrying action and comedy, as did the 48 hours movies and the first couple of Beverly Hills Cops episodes. Hollywood Homicide tries to do the same, but from the outset, everything just falls flat.\n\nThere's a nightclub shooting scene with plenty of automatic gunfire, where no-one appears to get shot, though when we return to the scene of the crime later, bodies are littered everywhere. This initial inconsistency is indicative of the whole film. Potentially entertaining scenarios present themselves only to be mishandled by either lazy acting, lazy writing, lazy directing, or a combination of all three.\n\nHarrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have zero chemistry together in the lead roles as kind of mismatched buddy cops, who each moonlight in other occupations and have way too many side issues going on in their personal lives, especially, annoyingly so, with Ford's Joe Gavilan. Like some of the other characters in the movie, I actually got thoroughly sick of hearing his various phones ringing throughout the film. Many would say the phones were only ringing, because he was phoning in his performance. I wouldn't disagree.\n\nThe script simply isn't funny. Ron Shelton who wrote among other films the comical, witty, scripts for Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump, has struck out co-writing and directing this clunker. Ironically the funniest scene appears pre-end credits, where Hartnett's character KC Calden finally get his opportunity for a starring stage role in On The Waterfront with amusing results.\n\nThe action scenes are similarly vacuous, totally lacking in any sense of excitement or suspense. Shelton again has to take the blame for instance, for inserting one extremely long, boring car chase into the \"action\", immediately after another extremely long boring car chase had finished. He even ends the movie with Ford cracking the same unfunny lines he began with in one of his opening scenes.\n\nIt's clear Shelton's talents lie in the sports film genre, rather than crime comedy. I'd consign him to the penalty corner, until he chooses to see the error of his ways."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood Homicide is a typical buddy cop comedy with Harrison Ford as the experienced cop and Josh Hartnett as the rookie.\n\nThey have to team up for an assignment, and their differences are some of the sketches in the movie. Sometimes these sketches work and sometimes they do not. I think that the scenes with Harrison Ford are the best, Josh Hartnett seems to have some difficulties with his role in some of the scenes. I would like to question his acting ability, I am not sure if he is a future star of Hollywood.\n\nThe movie has been criticised because it chooses two paths; the more serious path with murders and the less serious comedy path. I can agree with this to some point, but I would say that this third way works too. It is possible it would have worked better, if it just was a comedy without the more serious thrills.\n\nAnyway, I can assure you that there is no doubt that the idea was to create a comedy, and I would say that Ron Shelton succeeded, but it is definitely not one of the best comedies I have seen. You will get entertained when watching this movie, but not much more than that. - My vote: 6/10"

It's absurd. I defy the viewer to explain what is going on with the murder investigation at any point in the film. It's the primary plot line and most of the time no one is even working on it.

It's fair to say that its reputation is most divisive, with some critics proving to be most ferocious in their summations. Personally I find it to be an enjoyable spin on the buddy buddy cop formula, where director Ron Shelton isn't afraid to put emphasis on characters instead of just filling out the pic with high octane bangs and crashes. The wry portrayal of the police system in a bustling Los Angeles is nicely etched into the froth, with the sidebar of coppers having two jobs being a deft poke in the ribs.\n\nGood fun with well crafted action scenes, but the main strength is in the writing and to see once again that Ford has been very undervalued as a comedy actor of the years. 6.5/10"

        "review_detailed_main": "(Josh Hartnett)'s dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and (Harrison Ford) being in a buddy-cop comedy. Here's 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better!\n\nThe buddy-cop movies are fun. However, their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s. Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea, though the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre, but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than (Hollywood Homicide)!\n\nWhat really did happen to this entertaining formula?! Since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same. You'd have a buddy-action stubborn flop after another. I'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all yet (Miami Vice - 2006)!\n\nI believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar movies and TV shows during 2 decades already. Add to that, particularly here, the negligent dealing, and the dull humor. Actually the matter this time is totally unbearable. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs, and the background of sinful city, but what else was new?! It's not about clich\u00e9; it's about few renewals mixed with clich\u00e9s where both have been badly made.\n\nThe acting, especially from (Hartnett)'s side, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or an actor!). So his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death? Revenge on yourself man, he probably died out of watching your acting! According to (Harrison Ford)'s performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we didn't! Even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy, or that's what they seemed here anyhow!\n\nThe directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh, some parts managed to be highly dull. Look at the sequence of arresting the black guy through the lake; it's a rare time to be boring in what's supposed to be action / comedy! They didn't utilize Hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place which's full of shining or fallen stars; since there were no cameos that could've given it few interesting moments.\n\nIt's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars' glamour, and its form as a buddy-cop movie, to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself!), and a buddy-cop destroyer more than a movie. God, don't make me, or my children, live enough to witness (Hollywood Homicide 2)!"

They are called on the case K. C. Calden (Josh Hartnett) and Sergeant Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) who, despite having a 36 year old age difference, work as buddies. And during the course of the movie there are some various stories such as Gavilan that works also as a real estate agent that tries to sell his flats. And Calden teaches yoga during his free time, has problems with women and is also an aspiring actor that is debuting as Stanley Kowalski in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE (and during a performance in the end he is interrupted by a service call).\n\nWhile many buddy cop movies worked in the past (such as the LETHAL WEAPON, BEVERLY HILLS COP and 48 HOURS) this didn't and it looks like a bad copy of all those good movies. While Ford gives a likeable performance as always, Hartnett probably gives one of his worst! He looked so whiny and awkward that it's no surprise he was such a loser through the all movie. The always reliable Keith David, Bruce Greenwood and even Martin Landau are very bland and looked like they wanted to be somewhere else. Some of the situations were quite cringeworthy too such as the car chase scene towards the end where Robert Wagner gets mud splattered by Calden's super fast car. About the only great thing about this movie was the soundtrack, but that alone can't save a movie.\n\nEven if you like some of the cast members, avoid this movie at all costs as it looks so painful that you feel actually sorry for the actors, and when this happens, it surely is a bad sign!"

Luckily, Hollywood Homicide is one that does deliver these acts.\n\nIt may not be the funniest movie ever made (it's not purely a comedy, really), but it's certainly worthy of a viewing.\n\nHartnett and Ford play off of each other quite well. At one point a woman waves to Hartnett's character and says hello. Hartnett yells back something like,\"Hey, Kimberly!\" She yells back,\"It's Amy.\" Hartnett is a bit embarrassed and moves on with Ford, as he quietly comments,\"you dog,\" in a serious yet very funny way. That's not the best example of the movie's humor--there's many more examples and certainly more funny ones, but I certainly don't want them to be known to anyone who hasn't seen the film.\n\nAn interesting attribute of the film is its ability to make clich\u00e9d formulas funny and interesting. For instance there is the buddy-cop element--I think I've seen that in about 200 other movies, but Hollywood Homicide handles it well. Hartnett (often referred to as \"the kid\") and Ford really do go well together, as I mentioned earlier. There's also the standard internal affairs challenges. These culminate in an extremely funny scene where both Hartnett and Ford are being interrogated in two rooms adjacent to each other.\n\nI could give a much better in-depth explanation of why this movie is funny, but to do this I would be greatly challenged; it's hard to do without discussing some of the scenes.\n\nAs for the plot, the pair is investigating a (yes, you guessed it) homicide in L.A. I give very little of this review to the plot because the plot is really more of a side-plot, a device used to set up the rest of the movie so that actors like Ford and Hartnett can play off of each other...they do it well."

How old's this idea ? well Quinn Martin had a very successful TV show with this premise starring Karl Malden and Michael Douglas away back in 1972 and the 1970s haven't dated well\n\nWith hindsight the film doesn't do itself any favours with the casting . Harrison Ford star was rapidly failing in 2003 and Josh Hartnett probably had a career high with BLACK HAWK DOWN and didn't go on to a become a massive Hollywood name and it's important in this type of buddy movie that the on screen chemistry crackles . Unfortunately it doesn't but the two stars aren't helped by a painfully loose script where instead of a murder investigation time is taken up with characters complaining that their cheese burger has lettuce in it and that they musn't be called sir because \" I work for a living \" . Many times I forgot I was watching a film where a murder investigation is taking place . Try and imagine an episode of THE WIRE not featuring Marlo and his crew and where no one swears and you've got the idea .

It does not have a story that makes sense and will fulfill you in the ending.\n\nBut...it is not cheap or dumb. Somehow it manages to be witty and in good taste, while giving us just enough action (and I don't just mean car chases...do understand, Harrison Ford is involved, and Josh Hartnett isn't exactly unattractive either ;) to keep us wildly entertained.\n\nThe one-liners are a riot, but there's an underlying parody here too, that is rampant throughout the movie. The movie makes fun of buddy comedies, of car chases, and of Hollywood in general, by showing you just how ridiculous it really is.\n\nAnd yet...somehow these two stars (especially Harrison Ford, but I am impressed with young what's-his-name too) are so likeable, and so genuine, that we can really believe their situation, and root for them.\n\nKudos to the makers of this film. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it will win your heart."

Of course, it is not gonna win any awards, no nominations either but if you got time and an action movie guy or action-comedy fan or like to pass some feel-good time or even if you like something \"original\", get some pop-corn and sit down and watch.

An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.\n\nFord at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford aren't exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned.\n\nAll in all, \"Hollywood Homicide\" is a reasonably amusing diversion, but just barely.

It works on the levels it wants to work on, so why complain? We have Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett as two homicide detectives working in Hollywood, investigating a case that involves some dead rappers in a night club. Joe Gavilan (Ford) is not only a cop, he does some real estate as well. K.C. Calden (Hartnett) is a teacher in yoga at night and wants to be an actor instead of a cop. There are quite some smiles here.\n\nI will not really go into the plot although I can add that Gavilan has some problems with Internal Affairs, especially a guy named Benny Macko (Bruce Greenwoord), and is seeing a psychic named Ruby (Lena Olin). Who the killer is and why does not really matter since the movie is not about that at all. (The final act proves this since the villain has no apparent evidence against him but to lead the story to its ending he simply starts shooting at the cops.) The movie is about the dialogue and the fun both Hartnett and Ford have with their characters.\n\nHartnett is the perfect sidekick here for Ford who is the kind of actor that seems to have fun being himself only with a different name and a different profession. His Gavilan shows us the same joy as his Han Solo or his Indiana Jones, something that makes this movie worth watching if no better movie should be available. I say this because there are a lot of better movies out there, but 'Hollywood Homicide' is definitely not a waste of your time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Hollywood Homicide was a victim of an unsteady marketing campaign that didn't know whether to advertise the film as a comedy or a cop-drama. It does involve cops and a murder investigation but it is the natural humour in the movie and the interplay between Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett that is the best reason to see it. Harrison Ford is as likable and gruff and easily humourous in this movie as you will ever see him. Having seen Sabrina and 6 Days 7 Nights, I was prepared for the worst, but Ford was on-key here and it was a happy surprise to watch him. He is effortlessly good here.\n\nJosh Hartnett's character had been partnered with Ford's for four months so they are comfortable with one another. It's not played as old cop / young hotshot rookie but as seasoned cop / good but inexperienced kid and it works well. There is a scene where Hartnett wears himself out chasing a suspect on foot while Ford instead follows in the car. The suspect is caught when Ford parks the car, gets out and waits patiently for the suspect to emerge from an alley and then trips him, allow a breathless Hartnett to finally cuff him.\n\nThe murder plot is perhaps too dark for this movie and it is the discordant note in it. The movie might have done better to have painted the bad guys as just bad and not evil. But don't bother about the murder investigation or bad guys and watch the movie for Ford and Hartnett. Ford especially sparkles and it would be a shame not to see him when he's so good."

Alimony has him working as a real estate agent. His younger partner K.C. Calden(Josh Hartnett) is a yoga instructor on the side, but really wants to become an actor. This unlikely duo is assigned the investigation of a multiple homicide at a dance club. Gavilan and Calden need to prove that music mogul Antione Sartain(Isaiah Washington)is killing off established rap stars that want to leave his management. Dwight Yoakam is a ruthless enforcer working for Sartain. While this investigation really gets muddled, Lt. Bennie Macko(Bruce Greenwood)is an Internal Affairs officer with a grudge and vendetta against Gavilan.\n\nThis movie is longer than it needs to be. Repetitive rap music is very annoying. Ford seems bored with his role. Hartnett seems miscast period. Bad ass Yoakam is a comical highlight. Lou Diamond Phillips is hilarious as an undercover hooker. Other faces you may recognize are: Martin Landau, Gladys Knight, Keith David, Smokey Robinson and Lolita Davidovich. Lena Olin plays Ruby, who is more than friendly with both Gavilan and Macko. The final chase scene is a redemption for this pot luck action flick. Violence, sexual situations and loads of profanity are a big help in holding this one together."

But the on screen chemistry between the two worked well and should be further developed in a sequel to these two great characters. If you are wondering why I have not discussed the plot nor setting it is because this is not one of those films. This is a film that you watch when you want something different. Not a great Action film, Not a great Thriller, but a film that will delight you and keep you laughing and on your feet until the end of the film.

I can't believe LAPD would allow Ford's character to carry on his real estate business while on duty. That would be a firing offense at virtually any job I know. Further, the antics Ford and Hartnett perform during their IAD interrogation would have got them thrown into the slammer. Certainly, what self respecting interrogator would allow Ford to keep his cell phone? This cop buddy movie is about as convincing as \"Tango and Cash\" or \"Showtime\". In other words, despite some fairly humorous scenes and dialogue, the best I can give \"Hollywood Homicide\" is a \"4\"."

From the beginning, Ford's presence is commanding, letting you know that he is \"in charge.\" But of what, we're not quite sure. It seems the lives of our hero (and his partner) are going in tangents not quite equal to their current profession. Harrison is trying to make a little extra money on the side, but his real estate deal has him so caught up in itself that he can't focus on the job at hand. As far as Hartnett is concerned, all he CAN do is find his \"center to focus\" on. But as a member of the audience, I found myself extremely lost in this film. Not lost like losing track of time (in fact, I could not wait for the movie to be over), but lost because their is no direction on the entire film.\n\nMystery does turn to comedy in the end, however, as Ford fights the head of the Internal Affairs, whose got it in for him.

        "review_detailed_main": "I suppose the idea of playing in a comedy must be intriguing to Harrison Ford probably because he doesn't get offered very many but its a shame he picked one so inane and pointless. Film is about an aging cop named Joe Gavilan (Ford) who moonlights as a real estate agent and no matter what crime was just committed he looks to try and sell a house. His young partner is K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett) who is thinking very hard of being an actor and he reads lines from popular dramas and prepares for a role in a very small production of \"Streetcar\". One night a hip-hop club is shot up and the members of a popular group are killed so they decide to talk to Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington) who heads the label that signed the group. Meanwhile, Lt. Benne Macko (Bruce Greenwood) of Internal Affairs is looking to bust Gavilan because of their bad history together. Gavilan is dating a radio psychic named Ruby (Lena Olin) who also use to date Macko and she also helps Gavilan with clues with her psychic ability. The premise is interesting enough and there are many Hollywood cop jokes written into the film. My favorite is the cameo by Eric Idle who plays a celebrity caught trying to pick up a hooker! The film does a good job of showing how the cops of Hollywood are always thinking of doing something else since Los Angeles has so many opportunities for other employment. But the dialogue is so silly and inane that its hard to believe that someone like Ford would utter some of the things that he had to. Hartnett is especially drab and he doesn't show much flair for comedy but one thing I found surprising was that he doesn't show the charisma that he showed in \"Black Hawk Down\". He's stiff as a board which use to be Ford's manner. You know your stiff when Harrison Ford is more lively in a film! There is also to many cliches like Greenwood as the Internal Affairs Officer with a chip on his shoulder towards Ford. Haven't we seen that a hundred times? And I had to cringe when Ford is riding the girls bicycle and tooting the horn while riding through a mob of people. Film is ultimately too silly and pointless. Ron Shelton directed and he usually has a terrific knack for comedy but here the film comes across as very uninspired. Don't waste your time!"

In the course of doing so, they travel all over LA (the scenic shots make the movie worth watching all by themselves), and make sure that the investigation doesn't interrupt their \"real\" lives, which for Hartnett's character is his acting carer, and for Ford's, his endless search of real estate commissions.\n\nThe rap industry was poorly portrayed here, the music was second-rate (as rap almost always is when not done by rappers or when rappers are directed by non-rappers), and the plot was horribly contrived, but the actors are good and do the best they can with woeful material.\n\nWithout question, the plot's greatest strength is the many swipes it takes at LA culture in general, and the buddy-cop movies in particular. The heroes are not portrayed as quasi-supermen, but rather as a wheeler-dealer and an A-list actor trapped in the prison of regular jobs. Isaiah Washington did play the villain exceptionally well, but you'd have difficulty knowing this from the paucity of screen time he got.\n\nThe movie works, the plot works, and the acting works, but only works enough for no one to get fired. You won't regret watching this movie, but just barely. There are far better movies out there, but alas, there are also far worse. A true middle-of-the-road flick likely to be on cable for the next twenty years."

I did have to look at the credits to identify Gladys Knight because I was thinking she was maybe someone else I couldn't quite put my finger on, but there was no mistaking Smokey Robbinson. This movie also has a lot of other cameo shots throughout, such as Eric Idle, Martin Landau, Robert Wagner, Frank Sinatra Jr., and for those that are into hip-hop and rap, (sorry, I'm not) many an artist from that gene had cameos. Harrison Ford gave a good performance and had the only true laugh in the movie when he was in the interrogation room and did the \"hip motion\" while up against the two way glass. My feeling is that this is a good dollar rental or a movie for Spike TV. This is not the type of movie I'd spend a lot of money on, (I got my copy at Big Lots for $3) but I wouldn't avoid it either."

        "review_detailed_main": "HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE\n\nGRADE: D+\n\nFor the past couple of years we've had a numerous amount of buddy-cop movies that attempt to be a `Lethal Weapon' or a `48 Hours' but don't even come close. That's usually because the two `buddies' don't have chemistry and the plot reeks more than a thirty-year-old turd. Those are just a couple of the problems in `Hollywood Homicide.'\n\nFord plays Joe Gavilan, a homicide detective that's up to his butt in debt and in his spare time dabbles in real estate. Hartnett plays his younger partner K.C. Calden, who is reconsidering being a cop and wants to be an actor, and in his spare time he's a yoga instructor. Things start to go awry when their investigation in a murder of a rap band leads them to a music CEO named Sartain (Isaiah Washington) and an unknown murderer (Dwight Yoakam). And at the same time, Internal Affairs officer Bennie Macko is trying to arrest Joe, who is dating Macko's ex-girlfriend Ruby (Lena Olin). Take all this and add about thirty-two subplots you get `Hollywood Homicide.'\n\nThe biggest problem with `Hollywood Homicide' is that it contains a long list of useless subplots that take up about half the film, leave no room for character development, and take us completely away from the main storyline. They throw the `Homicide' out the window! They might as well have just named the film `Hollwood'! They sure as hell deal with everything with `Hollywood' besides `Homicide`: hookers, murderers, rap artists, repo men, wannabe actors, drug dealers, bad cops, good cops, psychics, and car chases. Hey, why not just call the film `Hollywood Hookers, Murderers, Rap Artists, Repo Men, Wannabe Actors, Drug Dealers, Bad Cops, Good Cops, Psychics, and Car Chases.' If they would of went with that title I wouldn't have went into the theater expecting a good crime-solving movie, that dealt only with crime-solving, not that other mumbo jumbo.\n\nWhat's up with Harrison Ford these days? Since 1998 all he's been doing is picking bad movies! With last year's `K-19: The Widowmaker' where he sported a really bad Russian accent, and 2000's `What Lies Beneath,' where he played a character that wasn't him at all. Here he plays a cop. He's played a cop in numerous film like `Witness' and `Clear and Present Danger.' But at least in those films he actually shed a little bit of charm and heroism. Here he just goes though the script like a zombie, showing not a glimpse of a real cop. And his supporting actors Josh Hartnett and Lena Olin don't help out at all. None of it feels real. It all seems like they have to be there, not that they want to be there.\n\nIt's not like Ron Shelton isn't a good filmmaker, he's made great films like `White Men Can't Jump' and `Cobb.' It's just that his lifeless script with Robert Souza packs no punches at all and takes no risks. When they were writing the script they were probably thinking seeing Ford ride a pink bicycle would be hilarious, but it's not.\n\nDeep in this soulless piece-of-crap filmmaking, there lies the final half hour, which is the only reason I'm not grading this film any less. It's probably one of the best choreographed chase scenes on film. Only if the whole film had been that good."

        "review_detailed_main": "16 June 2003. It's not easy to make a semi-serious, comedy-cop thriller. Director, writer Ron Shelton (writer for Tin Cup and Bull Durham) took upon himself a very complex and difficult assignment trying to combine comedy with a rather serious, violent cop murder mystery. There were spots in the first half of the movie that seemed to lose action and momentum while the uneasy mix of crime drama and comedy required some brilliant skill and scriptwriting. The end result, \"Hollywood Homicide\" came out much better than the conflicting, confusing trailers of the movie (one a serious cop version and second trailer a comedy in the vain of Beverly Hills Cop).\n\nThe humor was above average, tinged with dry and cerebral humor not usually found in comedies these days. The interplay, the pushing the envelope in character development and character backgrounds were all good efforts at better, quality movie making. This movie was an entertaining and great first attempt by Ron Shelton who took risks with his material and found an fine balance between humor and story plotline that truly promises even better things to come.\n\nHarrison Ford did great with his expressions, his sense of humor, and his letting go and enjoying, playing his part while Josh Harnett went a long for an enjoyable romp with a different kind of cop movie. While this movie wasn't perfect nor Oscar performing, it rates kudos for its experimental success in bringing more to the screen and braving new quality attempts at good movie-making. Seven out of Ten Stars."

Hollywood Homicide (rubbish title!) thankfully and fortunately flopped big time in the summer of 2003. Though the audience who said 'no' to this were probably the same people who contributed to Bad Boys 2 (and equally terrible film from the same writer) being a success.\n\nHarrison Ford and Josh Hartnett play cops who moonlight as a real estate broker and yoga instructor. But Hartnett has aspirations to be an actor too (the irony is somewhat lost on him) and ends up yelling lines from A Streetcar Named Desire whenever he can. Oh stop it! My sides are splitting!\n\nAfter a couple of rappers are gunned down in a nightclub they investigate. Ron Shelton manages to stretch out this incredibly NON-existent plot for very painful, very boring 115 minutes.\n\nIt tries to be funny, and thinks it is, but this arrogance only amplifies the tediousness of the rank-amateur script. I kid you not; I could have got a 12-year-old, hyper on Buzz Cola, to write something better and more professional.\n\nHollywood Homicide is Unbelievably bad. And, I never thought I'd say this, it actually makes Showtime look good in comparison.\n\nThe DVD is 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby 5.1 sound. There are extras but I couldn't care less coz this film is rotten."

The trailer pretty much gives away the plot which at some points in the movie goes haywire it seems like the studio was forcing Ron Shelton to give everything into the movie so it could be a big summer tent pole release but alas for a movie of this nature to be a big summer tent pole release in my opinion I would have changed a few things. Number one- replace the non acting Master P with the more rounded Mos Def (who can make any bad movie pretty enjoyable hence his work in Showtime). Number two - make the film R rated you can't make a movie about Gangster rappers and not have profanity, I mean honestly how many ganster rappers do you know that release clean CD'S by choice also add some nudity. As much sex as Hartnett was getting the film could have showed some T&A ! Number three - Give the very underrated Isiah Washingtion more screen time as the villain ! I think that version of Hollywood Homicide would have been good to release in the summer. Although Ford and Hartnett have good chemsitry the film that is made here would have been better suited as a winter or fall release. So like I said I still have mixed thoughts on this one I liked the film for Hartnett and Ford and the many cameo's and pop culture refernces but the story line and lack of action upset me.

The film also features Josh Hartnett as his partner/fledgling actor, Lena Olin, Bruce Greenwood, Isaiah Washington, Keith David, Dwight Yoakam, Lolita Davidovich, Martin Landau, Master P, Lou Diamond Phillips, Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson, Kurupt, Dre, with a cameo by Eric Idle, and also Robert Wagner.\n\nDetective Joe Gavilan (Ford) and his young partner Kasey Calden (Hartnett) are assigned to a club slaying of a group of rappers. This brings them into the underside of the recording industry. Meanwhile, Gavilan is desperate to sell a house to get out of debt; later he tries to get the listing on the home of a producer (Martin Landau) in order to sell it.\n\nHis partner Kasey, whose father was a cop, isn't sure police work is for him. In fact, he's mounting a production of Streetcar in which he plays Stanley, and goes around practicing \"STELLAAA\".\n\nThe character of Gavilan is based on Robert Souza, a LAPD detective who also worked as a real estate broker ten years before retirement. The scene cuffed crook steals the gun from a patrol officer's belt and starts shooting it off in the parking lot actually happened during Souza's tenure.\n\nI thought the chase scene, with Gavilan commandeering cabs, stealing bikes and whatever, was very funny, and the production of Streetcar was a good touch. Practically speaking, I know in New York City police officers can draw their guns in the city proper but are not allowed to use them because of pedestrians. I can't believe they don't have the same law in Los Angeles, yet every time I see a crime movie set there, people are standing on the street shooting off guns. This one was no different.\n\nThis is just a light comedy. Take it as such, and you'll enjoy it."

        "review_detailed_main": "Why do people have to be so critical? Sure, this movie is no academy award candidate and may instead be a prime razzie award choice. But why is that cause for anyone to cut into it just because maybe \"they\" didn't get the point? It isn't!\n\nThe older, big name actors really show their age... Harrison Ford in particular. It really shows when we see him running. And Frank Sinatra Jr.! I hardly recognized him! But they weren't supposed to be their original selves... even big name stars age. I thought the fact of their againg was handled well.\n\nThis movie is poignant in places, it has some brief dramatic moments, has some passable action sets and is moderately funny throughout. It will need to toned down language-wise before it can be released for broadcast TV and a few of the steamier scenes will probably be cut, but it should draw a TV-14 rating.\n\nThe overall plot is reminiscent of those aimed at younger audiences where there is an obviously malevolent bad guy and unlikely heroes must save the day. The bad guys don't gloat and make threats of world domination, but they do hire killers and carry guns themselves. I did think the interaction between the Internal Affairs guy and his \"minions\" was a bit hokey though.\n\nBottom line here is that if you didn't like the movie that much, just write it off. Don't jump all over it like it was some virus or something. Okay? Personally, I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys comedic banter, overdone chase scenes, neat stunts and a fairly simple plot, by today's standards."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is a desperate film with no redeeming features whatsoever. Once again Harrison Ford's lack of comedic ability shines(!) through and reminds me of his rather inept performance in Working Girl. I rate Ford a fine actor but this role appeared badly chosen and maybe he is a bit limited now he is probably too old for fully fledged action roles. Regardless of whether the film is intended to be a self parody as some reviewers have maintained, surely the most important requirement is that it should entertain. Some of the humour is so forced and woeful that it borders on embarrassing, and the plot line jumps incoherently from one unlikely scenario to another. Little use is made of some potentially very useful cameo performers, and I, like most others found Josh Hartnett's performance quite baffling. His best acting seemed to be in Streetcar, and I'm sure it should have been his worst !! Again I like Hartnett, and perhaps blame should lay somewhere other than with the actors - as the saying goes \"you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear\" Makes you wonder whether the script offered by that bloke from Outkast could have led to a better movie."

Ford and Hartnett are brilliantly funny together in some bits. I recommend you check this out for some great laughs. Apparently IMDb is not a fan of brevity as they consider any review incomplete if it is less than \"10 lines.\" But there's really nothing else I want to say about this movie. So what can I put here? How 'bout some cool quotes. Here are some great quotes from Joseph Conrad's novel \"Heart Of Darkness\":\n\n1. \"And this also,\" said Marlow suddenly, \"has been one of the dark places of the earth.\" (p. 5)\n\nMarlow delivers this comment about England just before he begins his tale about his adventures in the Congo.\n\n2. # \"I raised my head. The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under an overcast sky--seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.\" --Marlow narrating\n\n3.\"I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell of the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations.\" --marlow\n\nGee, this book is pretty racist ultimately... but well written i guess."

This storyline keeps the movie watchable. Joe's partner is the 2000's poor mans Keanu Reeves, Josh Harnett. The partners are working on the murders of a group of up and coming rappers. This is their focus, but they both have plenty happening outside of work. Joe needs to really sell a house or his finances are screwed and KC is about to star in a play which he hopes will see him get discovered. This means the story kind of gets torn in several areas, and no great detail or screen time goes into any of them. For this reason there's no great depth to the characters. The movie was still OK though, thanks to the real estate sideline and a few great cameos, including Eric Idle, Master p, Andre 3000 and more."

Harrison Ford happens to be an aficionado of Motown, and the crime witness happens to be the son of an obscure Motown singer, giving Ford the clue to find his whereabouts. Ford's girlfriend (was her name Ruby? I just didn't care to remember what the names were after seeing it) happens to be psychic and this convenient ability happens to be the only solution for them to come across the criminals to lead to the conclusion. I mean, I don't mind a deus ex machina if used cleverly, but this was ridiculous.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more preposterous this whole movie really was, and largely devoid of any real substance or creativity. As I said, early on there were hints that this could be a fairly unique character-based cop movie, but it just never paid off at all in that sense, and the cliches and \"happens to be\" plot proved to make this a big waste of time.

While Harrison Ford is usually a very believeable and dependable actor, he must take some of the blame for this lackluster flick. He has absolutely no comedic instincts. He is probably trying to break out of his leading man roles. He is, afterall, getting a little too old for those. Comedy seems like a good idea. DeNiro's been doing it, but Ford just can't pull it off. Josh Hartnett is better, but his character is so one dimentional that he's borderline boring. I was really disappointed with this movie overall because it had so much potential. It's funny how the trailers at the theatre were edited to make this movie look like a comedy, but the TV spots have action written all over them. It's not that any movie has to be one or the other, it's just that this one is all over the place looking for a home. Ford is good at the physical comedy, but when it comes to dialogue, he falls flat. Don't bother to go to the theatre, wait to rent this one on DVD."

I give this film a great 1(ONE) and say that AWFUL IS NOT ENOUGH!"

Both lead stars provide us with a totally uninspired performance and the story has nothing to offer either. Actually, I'm still wondering whether the side-story of Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) trying to sell some real-estate was supposed to be funny. This is your regular buddy-cop movie but it doesn't come close to the best in class, \"Lethal Weapon\". The action scenes also bring nothing new, we've all seen that 1000 times before. I watched this movie in two parts and I had to force myself to put the DVD back in the player and watch the second part. All in all I give it 4/10. Only watch it when you've got nothing else to do and are really really bored."

        "review_detailed_main": "... Only with this one, I don't think there was truthfully that much to debase, in the beginning...\n\nA 'Keystone Cops' setup with someone as grizzled as Harrison Ford just doesn't work. Can you imagine the man himself pedalling real-estate? I wouldn't have thought so; he's far too 'gruff' and straight-down-the-line for that. As an actor he's a victim of the iconic roles he made famous; I'm sure he has a greater 'range' than some people will allow, but \"Hollywood Homicide\" is far too limp a vehicle for him to properly demonstrate it. Given a better script he could well play capably against type, but handing a non-comedian material too lame for Adam Sandler and expecting 'magic' to result is beyond even his talents. Each of you reading this review; think of the performer who generates the most chuckles within you... Got them? Right; well, I don't care who they are, even THEY couldn't have made \"Hollywood Homicide\" - as it stands - funny. Also, for something billed as an action-comedy, your pulse will likely be as constant as the expression of consternation that clouds your face...\n\nIt's Hollywood, alright; because you have trouble believing some of the actors here fit their roles. On that same note, why does Lou Diamond-Phillips have to consistently resort to playing transvestites in order to get work, these days????!! Midway through the running time, it gets to the point where there are so many extracurricular activities, we lose interest in what little actual 'plot' there is; so if the point is meant to be that these people aren't fully committed to the job they're doing, it's a case of life imitating art. The characters and actors appear sometimes disinterested, and ultimately that's how I felt, too."

No chemistry either with Josh Hartnet as Ford's partner in the police force. The cameos of Smokey Robinson and Robert Wagner was a waste of time.

Of the other characters, only Lena Olin stands out as the psychic. The story is all over the place not knowing whether or not to be serious or funny. Either way, it does not justify a 132 minute running time. When the audience is way ahead of the characters who the killers are and it takes them so long to catch up, you know you are in trouble. The movie is also full of unnecessary subplots that inexplicably are supposed to join with the main plot at the end. Overall, a watchable mixed bag, 5/10."

After I bought it on DVD, I was driven by the story. Harrison Ford was a good cop with some trouble and a great real estate man on the side. Josh being an exercise instructor with a tunnel vision for perfecting his craft in Hollywood, and on the side a cop. Joe (Ford) is helping his young partner out in a pinch, along the way, (subplot), the kid learns some eye-opening stuff. This had some new and old school players that made it all mix right together. I have seen this several times and amongst the action there is a scene in a Mustang that kind of just sticks with me, in the aftermath they handle things as though they are just on the top of their best game!\n\nThis was a sleeper hit for me and unexpected action drama with a good slice of comedy.\n\nRecommended Highly for Hartnett and Ford fans."

Lena Olin, on the other hand, was not give much to do...there were lots of cameos (eric idle did make us laugh just by appearing on the screen...not many actors can do that) but in general, this was a lackluster movie...worth seeing at a matinee or maybe as a rental...on the other hand, it's summer, and there generally aren't that many good movies out in summer anyway <sigh>...."

I'm sorry to say this but...Harrison Ford is getting too old for buddy cop movies like this... I would've rather stared at Josh Hartnett for the length of the film than see Ford have a sex scene with some woman.\n\nI give it 6/10 stars."

I thought the teaming of Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett would be very interesting and the movie had been lauded as such a great one. I was absolutely disappointed and disgusted that I wasted my time and money to go see it. There was way too much swearing (right from the get-go) and it seemed as if it couldn't decide whether it was a cop flick, a buddy flick, a music flick, or just a throw-as-many-cameos-in-as-you-can flick. There were *some* funny lines and the movie did get good (finally) in the last 15 minutes, but basically, it was a complete waste of time and money. I didn't care for the writing (including the one dimensional characters, the lack of substance, the loose ends, and lame premise -- all of this happened in a few days? What's up with that?). The directing was okay (although not first rate). And I sincerely wanted to give Josh a haircut the entire length of the movie (what was the purpose of that 70's style anyway?). Bottom line: If you are interested in a real good story or even good scenery, don't waste your efforts to go see this movie. Both thumbs way, way down for this disappointing venture."

        "review_detailed_main": "Ron Shelton seemed to have the notion that he could make a cop movie, obviously different from Dark Blue (which is the better movie), by using a strategy seen similarly in last year's Showtime with De Niro and Murphy. That one had laughs since each actor had their own personalities to add to the lengths the humor could take them. In 'Homicide', Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett can only be as funny as the script allows them to be, and sometimes laughs come unintentionally instead of by true skill.\n\nShelton does try to give the genre a bit of a gear change- Ford and Hartnett play cops who also have part-time jobs on the side, Ford a real estate broker who's been lagging in sales, Hartnett a yoga instructor and wannabe actor who seems to have less skill in the later, though more ambition for that than his cop job. They're assigned a case involving a murdered rap group, which includes a record company and the main producer (Isaiah Washington), who may or may not be working different angles.\n\nIf any working comedy comes in the movie it's in small, ridiculous doses that may be funnier to a viewer depending on sense of humor, for instance their is a running gag involving cell phones, which may be funny if someone else in the theater doesn't have a cell phone that goes off during the scene (it unfortunately happenned to me at the screening I went to). Or in the climax in which the thrills are done with a quasi Lethal Weapon feel, where one can see Ford's frustration and relentlessness as a good thing or a bad thing. When the credits rolled up for Hollywood Homicide I concluded to myself that I had seen an unfortunately average cop-buddy piece, one that took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and took too many pot shots at the exagerations that could be placed in such a movie. Perhaps Ford can be good in comedy if he gets the right direction (he helped ease some of the tension in 6 Days, 7 Nights) and script. C+"

        "review_detailed_main": "The title of this film is misleading. Ron Shelton's satirical version of the L.A.P.D. Hollywood division is right on target. Most viewers go to see this film, probably, with the wrong idea in mind. This is a tongue-in-cheek account of these two so very different detectives that are real life partners on the streets of Los Angeles.\n\nFirst of all, the idea of Det. Joe Gavilan selling real estate on the side to make ends meet is hilarious. At the most intense moments of the film he is interrupted by phone calls from prospective home buyers, or sellers; it is not to be believed! Also, the idea that K.C. Calden, played by Josh Harnett, can't shoot the target and his partner has to do it for him, goes over people's minds. That part of the audience misses the point of the satire on the genre cleverly executed by director Ron Shelton.\n\nThis is a role Harrison Ford might have been waiting for. He is in top form here. He looks the part. His Joe Gavilan is a man who has seen better days already and is ready for retirement. Harrison Ford will always be identified, perhaps, with action films. He proves here that he can play comedy as well as anyone else without making the character looks stupid, or out of place.\n\nJosh Harnett on the other hand was a surprise in this film. He holds his own against Mr. Ford. They make a goofy pair wherever they go. The idea he is an aspiring actor in a town full of wannabes is hysterical. That he can teach yoga to a class full of female students is not one's idea of what macho police detectives should be like.\n\nThe casting of Lena Olin as Harrison Ford's love interest was very clever. She's a good actress whose career has been somehow limited by the choices she has made, probably, but she is radiant in this film. Bruce Greenwood, Lolita Davidovich and Keith David round up the cast, but obviously it's the Ford show all the way. They seem to have had a great time while filming it."

This was the old cop/new cop storyline, with Ford as the veteran and Josh Hartnett as the young cop who also wants to be an actor. Like with \"Just Married\" from earlier this year, most of the funny moments were shown in the trailer, leaving a lot of dead time. Thankfully, Ford's acting made those parts watchable, but this was a poor role for Ford, who continues to slumber in Hollywood, taking mediocre roles like this instead of shining with better scripts. Hartnett is almost as green as an actor than his cop character was in the movie, somewhat charismatic, but not very good. Most supporting actors were weak, and the main strength of this movie was a really good chase scene through Hollywood at the end. I only laughed a few times, so this didn't really work for me."

Instead of making a memorable movie that could have stood out because of the wisdom, integrity or heart of the two men, in the end, all we get is a typical cop movie.\n\nThe film is labeled a comedy and does have comedic elements, but a lot of it is very forced. Examples would be of an awkward interrogation scene, and another scene where Harnett is chasing a suspected criminal where the criminal is shown going into a lake to try and dodge Hartnett. They weren't funny, and came off as awkward and time wasting. Hollywood Homicide did flop when it was released in theaters and one can see why. Several of the trailers were misleading, and the PG-13 rating to the film hurt it's chances, also of being a better film."

This has to be the simplest genre to film. All you need is a bit of chemistry between your leads and then copy \"Lethal Weapon\" or \"Bad Boys\" or any number of decent films in the past. Not sure what was happening here other than Harrison Ford trying to latch onto the soaring career of teen heartthrob Josh Hartnett. Both look uncomfortable and talentless in this ridiculous flop. Lena Olin tries to add a touch of class and Dwight Yoakum, Martin Landau, Sinatra's son, and Isiah Washington all have their moments. Lolita Davidovich survives the best.

The only reason i watched the whole thing is because im paralyzed, and i couldn't switch the channel myself in bed, lol.\n\nThis movie shows you that you can create a junky movie with a bunch of big name stars and it will still make money.\n\nI paid $1 at a flea market for it, and i want my money back! ha ha ha Everything about this movie was pure trash. It was too long, filled with boring stuff i didn't even care about.\n\nThe acting is awful... everyone was bad except the black cop, i liked his tiny roll.\n\nEvery situation was so fake, it was like the writer was in 12th grade.\n\nHarrison Ford reminded me of a old guy trying to act cool. His part was supposed to have comedy, but it was so fake that it just made him look dumb.\n\nJosh Harnette was absolutely awful. He should never trust the guy who wrote his part again. His character was not even likable. I personally would have seen his character killed off in first 5 minutes.\n\nThis movie was a waste of time. skip it, watch anything else that looks exciting to you on TV.\n\nI'd give it a 3, just because they spent millions to make it."

I used to love harrison ford but i'm starting to doubt the movies he picks cuz the last few i've seen have been pretty bad. Josh hartnett is no doubt a babe and i thought he was the only redeeming factor. Some people think he can't act but i think he's a pretty good actor and will be a big star. I look forward to see what he'll do in the future. Anyway, i've already seen beverly hills cop and this totally reminded me of that. The plotline was contrived, the big chase scene unoriginal, nothing you haven't seen 100 times before. Please spend your money on another good movie that's out so hollywood gets the message and stops putting out drivel like this. I'm going to see 28 days later tomorrow and i have high hopes for that cuz shallow grave & trainspotting rocked and so does christopher eccleston. I can already say i'm sure i'll enjoy it much more than hollywood homicide. PS. Please do not spend your money on charlie's angels either cuz i hope they don't make another one. I know that's selfish of me but oh well."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had no idea this was going to be as funny as it was. Dad and I went in expecting a serious detective flick about the seamy underbelly of the music biz. What we got was a good detective story about the aforementioned seamy underbelly and a helluva screwball comedy about two mismatched detectives and the troubles in their lives. Okay, the film is serious and violent at times so you might get a bit of whiplash as it switches from serious to comedy to serious again. But it's good whiplash.\n\nComing out of the flick, my eyes stung from all the laughing I did. And I was still giddy from the frequent andrenalin rushes. If movies are supposed to get you physically involved, this one succeeded.\n\nFord is quite enjoyable as the aging cop struggling to solve cases and make a fortune in legal second jobs. The problem is, other cops are not quite so picky where their second incomes come from. Hartnett is the young cop who is seems to be possessed by Shirley MacLaine. Lena Olin is quite fun as Rose, the radio psychic and Ford's girlfriend. Martin Landau is fun to watch as the aging film producer wanting to sell his mansion and maybe become a big name again.\n\nThe cast is full of people doing wonderful little cameo bits. Eric Idle starts of the parade as a writer protesting \"I did not hire prostitutes! That was research! Oh, hi, Candy!\" Lou Diamond Philips is gorgeous in drag as an undercover vice cop working a decoy stakeout. Singers Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson, Dwight Yoakam and Frank Sinatra Junior all appear fleetingly (it was fun listening to the ladies behind me recognize her). And Robert Wagner is there basically to get a metaphorical creme pie in the face, but what the heck, you learn why Graumann's has that handprints in cement tradition! I have no idea why he's credited as \"Silk Brown\" though, as he is playing himself.\n\nWhile I can't stand cell phones myself, they are used to great comic effect in two scenes. And after watching all the ultra-grim Internal Affairs scenes on NYPD BLUE, it was a real hoot watching the simultaneous interrogations of Ford's and Hartnett's characters go completely awry.\n\nMy rating-- this is worth full price."

It paces feebly through every clich\u00e9, from the \"cute\" avocations of the partners (the older one sells real estate on the side, the younger one wants to be Brando) to the \"funny\" running gags (the young one's effortless studliness, the old one's cell phone with a \"cute\" ring) to the needless backstory (the younger one's dad was killed by one of the bad guys) to the pointless cameo guest stars (Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson -- who are still welcome presences). And the women's roles! Sheer sex objects with no dimension; can this be the same Ron Shelton who wrote Susan Sarandon's great part in \"Bull Durham\"? The stunt doubles work overtime, the third-act car chase grinds on relentlessly, the bad guys have no edge or personality, the outcome isn't in doubt for a moment. Shelton's buddy banter is still a degree or two above the norm for this tired formula, and Ford paces with movie-star professionalism through the predictable trappings.

I realize that Ford is supposed to be the older, grissled veteran, but to me, he played it too old to make it believable. His big chase scene is laughable, especially when he gets on the girls bike.\n\nEverything about this movie is bad. Even the make-up. Did anyone else notice that Lena Olin's make-up was so heavy on her forehead and around her eyes, it made her look as if it had been applied by a cosmetoligist at a funeral home.\n\n2 stars out of 10"

Josh Hartnett has not been a favorite, preferring to take on fluffy roles like the one he had in \"Pearl Harbor,\" among other things. But he, as much if not more than Ford, is responsible for this movie's enjoyable storyline, which represents a revival of the \"buddy\" film with a new take on it- it's a fast-paced, masked comedy, and one that should not be raking in 1/100th of what \"The Hulk\" is taking in this week."

His rookie partner who plays a yoga teacher and somewhat also a ladies man who wants to get out of the business and become a actor mainly because he just cant take the job anymore. They investigate a crime that they are trying to figure out who murdered four sensation rap singers. I would agreed with the comment of Mr. Ebert and Mr. Roeper completley on what they said about this film. This movie I found that liked it right in the beginning. This movie is just a great way to start your summer off with some decent action-comedy to have you buzzing about all summer. Finally a pair of partners that I could finally get use to."

All in all, this was definately worth seeing.\n\nI must say though that the pace seems to slow down somewhere in the first quarter of the movie, and I was afraid things wouldn't pick up, but luckily they did and the rest of the movie totally made up for this. Also, there did seem to be somewhat a lack of resolution at the end but nowhere to the degree where I felt jipped or anything. I still felt a nice resolution at the end.\n\nBut as I said, these complaints are definately outweighed by the rest of the movie which is thoroughly enjoyable. 8 out of 10 stars here."

In contrast to the movies and TV shows we see way too often with mismatched cops who take their jobs way too seriously to provide good entertainment (Training Day, Showtime, Narc, Recruit, Third Watch, NYPD Blue, etc), this film is about two cops who are good at what they do but couldn't care less. Set in a city where everyone aspires to be something other than what they are, Josh Hartnett's K.C. Calden wants to be an actor while Harrison Ford's Joe Gavilan would rather be in real estate. Tied into the title, this premise cleverly pokes fun at its subjects' lives and subtly provides some genuine humor. Ford plays his role with far less intensity than you'd expect. Some might think he's sleepwalking through the script, and you can't deny that he doesn't put much effort to act like anyone other than himself, but the bottom line, is that a lazy Harrison Ford is fun to watch irreguardless."

While others may want to call it a bad detective movie, I like to call it a lovely comedy, a parody of both Hollywood industry and the police world. While Josh Hartnett can be unexpected in many of his roles, Harrison Ford really outdid himself playing such a part. So people, if you want to unwind after a bad or tiresome day, do watch this one.

This movie is a great comedy but yet there's suspense!Its a good movie to watch with friends, under 13 parents make have to skip a few scenes for violence and sex related matters . Other than that they did a great job with the movie! This movie is a great family film (for older kids that is) and is a lot of fun. Plus it takes place in Hollywood which makes it very interesting. They even have a guest start Robert Wagner! so its good for older ages too! The car chase at the end was done so great!They add humor to serious parts. K.C. (Josh Hartnett)is a yoga teacher and when he is taken to questioning he doesn't talk, instead his does yoga mean while Joe(Harrison Ford) is constantly talking on his cell phone during the questioning.

When I was selling software ( a job that gives you much freedom), I too sold high end real estate, not as high as Joe, but I, too, found myself taking phone calls during dinners, parties, house guests, etc. I have seen realtors who got themselves into horrible real estate investments that were similar to those of this movies heroes. And the reactions are all the same as portrayed in this film. While it seems a little far fetched I assure you it is not. Harrison Ford plays the cop who gets himself into all kinds of trouble from imminent foreclosure, repossession of his auto and complications in his love life. Watch it to laugh at this close to life example when one occupation collides with another."

I think the film works rather well and even though there are rather a lot of subplots the whole thing stick together pretty well. At no time did I feel confused or felt that the film lacked anything. It didn't try to be to much. A thing I loved was that the film was sort of a series of quit realistic scenarios and incidents that you can see happening out there in the real world. And it still manage to be hilarious. My favourite scene is the interrogation scene... I laughed and laughed and woke my roommate... and kept laughing.\n\nThis is a new favourite... gotta see all of it a some point."

And i think the whole concept of Harrison being a cop while also working as an estate agent is just nothing short of amazing. I am just writing crap now to take up the lines, so i also think that Harrisons shades are really cool and if anybody knows where the prop is of these glasses i would much appreciate it, i also know I spelt that word wrong so please could someone also correct me on it as i don't want to sound like a div in the future! I like the part in the film where the gangster rapper is running from the cops it was quite entertaining, also when he wets himself that did get a snigger out of me."

        "review_detailed_main": "While watching Hollywood Homicide I couldn't help but feel like Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett probably had a good deal of fun making the movie, and certainly a good deal of this fun is shared by the audience. Ford here reminds me of his appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brian, a times reserved yet sprinkled with burst of manic silliness. He is downright funny in this role and I was surprised at how much I liked the on-screen coupling of Ford and Hartnett. The rest of the movie, however, seemed like it had been written much too hastily. The concept is a good one - cops in L.A. often have second jobs to supplement their income - and it is fairly well executed, yet the quadruple homicide plot seems to be secondary to the shenanigans of the characters. The movie seems to want to be Lethal Weapon, but can't find a comfortable rhythm. At times it felt like entire scenes were missing, as if there'd been some mistake in the projection booth, that's how badly the movie flowed. Overall, however, the performances make the movie an enjoyable one and worth a look."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Hollywood Homicide\" is a movie starring Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett as detectives Joe Gavilan and K. C. Calden, assigned to Hollywood. Galivan, preoccupied with his real estate business, attempts to sell a house to a club owner who has just been killed. Calden, who wants to be an actor, has Galivan run lines from \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" The movie was directed by Ron Shelton, who co-wrote with Robert Souza and specializes in funny dialogue for guy characters. The movie is more interested in the goofy cops than the murder plot, with their dialogue redeeming otherwise standard scenes. The movie features a double act between a man who has seen everything and a man who has seen too much. K. C., who moonlights as a yoga instructor, agrees that they are all going to die someday, but his philosophical observations are cut short by a crash. The movie \"Hollywood Homicide\" begins with a hit on a rap group in a music club, resulting in four deaths. Joe and K. C. investigate, but are under investigation by Benne Macko, the Internal Affairs guy who hates Joe. Joe is suspected of \"mingling funds,\" confusing his personal debts with his real estate business debts. He has been seen with Ferre Salesclerk, a known hooker, and Ruby the psychic (Lena Olin), another member of the Los Angeles women who believe it is fun to make love on a blanket in an empty house. Hartnett makes an able partner for Ford, trading deadpan dialogue and telling everyone he's an actor. He has one of Shelton's nicest little scenes when he goes to the morgue and looks at the dead bodies of the murder victims. There is a chase and a half at the end of the movie, filled with cameos and walk-bys, including Frank Sinatra Jr. As a show-biz lawyer, Martin Landau as a fading producer, Lou Diamond Phillips as Wanda the cop in drag, Gladys Knight, Dwight Yoakam, Isaiah Washington, Master P, Kurupt, Eric Idle, Dr. Dre, and just plain Dre. Much of the closing excitement depends on the Fallacy of the Climbing Killer, a dependable chase cliche where the killer climbs to a high place from which he cannot escape unless he can fly. This film may be the most exciting film ever made about real estate, with the dialogue being the reason to see the movie. The movie is filled with cameos and walk-bys, and the dialogue is the reason to see the movie."
