        "review_detailed_main": "I wasn't in the best of the moods because when entering the theatre I planned to watch Shootout at Wadala, a movie of my second all time favorite actor. But, I had to settle for this one. This is the movie I started to Like Saif Ali Khan. I used to hate him. Coming back to movie, Bollywood hadn't witnessed zombies much. The way Koi Mil Gaya was a cult, rare SciFi Alien movie, which was very new to Bollywood and the 90s kids, similarly, this one, makes it's entry in a hilarious way not only in the horror comedy genre but a Bollywood Cult Zombie Movie which will be remembered over years. There are a few adult scenes in the movie, starts with one too, which nowadays aren't that big a deal. This is not only Horror Comedy, but mixed with lots and lots of adventure. People are always looking for adventure/jungle + comedy + good acting + good story + plot + great cinematography + something creative. This one has all. The direction, and cinematography isn't the greatest, but pretty much above average. I've watched this movie for about 3-4 times now, and can consider watching more. Not a keep watching anytime movie, but 2-4 times watchable. Also, I've heard second is going to get released too. Back to the movie, you'd love the experience of watching this movie for the first time. It's hilariously amazing. Yes, there is a margin it could have been better, but with the starcast, we don't expect more. Saif and Kunal both were exceptional. Vir Das overacted a little at times. This movie is really fun. I still remember that day watching the movie in the theatres with my friends and laughing out loud at many occasions."

        "review_detailed_main": "I went in for the opening show expecting just as much as everyone else did from a film which built the hype calling itself the first ZomCom (Zombie Comedy) of Indian cinema, and I felt the movie delivered.\n\nThe storyline itself is pretty simple with two stoner guys taking a trip to Goa with their socially inept friend where the effects of a new breakout drug go horribly wrong for the partying vacationers. The rest is just classic zombie-killing fun with guns, knives, whatever-comes-handy and more guns! The fun elements come from the rough language used throughout which doesn't try too hard and admirable visual effects. The ending might be predictable for those who have watched a fair share of Apocalypse movies but the film itself was quite fresh for me since it didn't try to shove another love story down the throats of the viewers.\n\nThe acting was decent and the characters themselves were well-designed for this kind of film. Since it's a ZomCom, you might not get the gore scare you might be looking for. But if you enjoy youth-oriented comedies and are in for the Indian \"Shawn of the Dead\", this is the movie for you! Go watch it, before it's Gone."

        "review_title": "Go Goa Gone is a refreshing change from your typical Bollywood mediocrity.",
        "review_detailed_main": "Go Goa Gone is a pretty good movie for the first of its kind in Bollywood. Apart from your typical Bollywood annoyances this movie was quite entertaining. Granted my opinion on this is fairly biased given my love for Zombie flicks, however I believe it stands on its own. The movie borrowed ideas from Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead that were easily recognizable and familiar; although nowhere as blatantly as many other Bollywood movie. Also, the setting of the movie felt eerily like the video game: Dead Island. Few scenes felt like they were exactly the same as some missions in the game.\n\nThe overall acting was good and the jokes were smart and stuck for most parts, some more than others. The chemistry between the three protagonists, and overall cast was spot on. Saif Ali Khan's pseudo Russian Mafioso was an entertaining gag when originally introduced but it got a little old and drabby after a while. The female lead in the movie was underused and felt like a background character, other than being your prototypical Bollywood 'Damsel in distress'.\n\nThe plot is very simple (like any other zombie movie) and can be easily figured out. The movie follows a very typical zombie flick formula: Intro to the main character, putting them in a setting of zombies, explaining the origin of zombies (little lacklustre in this move), figuring out how to fight and kill zombies, the lack of ability to shoot the zombies and mastering the headshot by the end of the movie, and so on. This movie is as original as any zombie movie can get. Every scene of the movie was fairly predictable. Not to say that this is a bad thing, all zombie movies are alike. It's the chemistry between the characters that really separate the greats from the rest. As liner as this movie was, the surprising anecdote about zombies which was cheesier than the cheesiest cheese cake, felt original. I laughed out loud several times during the movie; admittedly the humor was along the lines of 3 Idiots and Delhi Belly i.e. buddy movies with a lot of raunch.\n\nThe movie was 1 hour and 48 minutes in length, which is a little long for a movie of this sort. 1 hour and 30 to 40 minutes max would be ideal for a zombie flick. It's hard to keep the audience immersed. The jokes get lazy and pushy and the situations where protagonist has to escape the zombie hoards get nuttier and nuttier to the point of complete disbelief\n\nMy biggest complaint against this movie is its anti-smoking campaign.\n\nIt's almost ridiculous to see an anti-smoking campaign in a movie about pot-smoking booze hounds itching for parties that feature Mary Jane. There was an abundance of smoking scenes that featured small messages warning against smoking. It's almost like the NRA running ads that featured gun-related killings and having messages popping up simultaneously that say \"Don't shoot people in the face. Shooting people in the face is bad.\" I understand that the movie means well and doesn't want to glamorize smoking, but omitting smoking altogether from the movie would be more effective anti-smoking rhetoric than a miniscule, meaningless and insincere insulting sign at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOverall though, I would recommend this movie to any zombie fans out there. If you're not a fan of Bollywood but enjoy zombies it's still worth the watch. The nod to Bollywood cheesiness near the end of the movie was worth the price all on its own.There were obvious \"Are you serious? He would totally get bitten in that situation.\" type of scenes and the anti-smoking messages were very annoying. However, they are forgivable because it's Bollywood's first attempt at the genre and from the looks of it they have done a good job."

The dialogs were hilarious. The songs are very catchy!! The girls in the movie are great eye-candy. Refreshing is a word that comes to mind!! The other lesser known actors outshone Saif Ali Khan. It is fair to assume that there could be a sequel based on the way the movie ended. I am going to repeat. Refreshing.Entertaining.Funny."

Krishna D.K. and Raj Nidimoru are getting better with each film and this one is no exception. Screenplay is completely tight. Art direction and cinematography is awesome. Dialogues are funny. Music by Sachin-Jigar is foot-tapping with slowly- slowly being pick-up from the lot. Performance Kunal Khemu , Vir Das and Saif Ali Khan is note worthy. They are amazing and will make sure to entertain you. Anand Tiwari and Pooja Gupta do justice to their part.\n\nOverall , GGG is completely different from what you have observed in Indian Cinema and thumbs-up to the makers for trying out something new.

        "review_detailed_main": "Reviewed by Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.5/5 stars\n\nI must admit that I'm a hardcore fan of the zombie sub-genre in the pantheon horror movies. So it was exhilarating to watch \"Go Goa Gone\" in which directors Krishna DK and Raj Nidimoru have taken major strides in introducing zombies to the mainstream Indian audience. While baptizing this all important and long overdue initiation, they have also succeeded in hemming an impeccable, gut-busting horror comedy a well.\n\nThe film crackles with hilarious dialogs, nail-biting sequences, a fluid plot, a coherent yet energizing narrative arc, zany and madcap encounters ranging from the unpredictable to the completely outrageous, brilliant cinematography, and finally spot-on direction from the first frame to the last. The praiseworthy performances, especially from Saif Ali Khan (surprise, surprise) and Kunal Khemmu, only add to the overall viewing pleasure. Puja Gupta's role definition and her enactment are the perhaps the only minor letdowns in this otherwise brilliantly energizing film, but then again, she does provide great eye-candy. So, perhaps that was how her role was meant to be, so who's complaining.\n\nThank God, that the producers set out to make an adult oriented film and were contended with the 'A' certificate, cause the expletive words, gore, wicked jokes, sexual references, and mild exposure (still nothing compared to those tasteless item numbers), are vital for a film of this ilk to work.\n\n\"Go Goa Gone\" will go down in the annals of Indian Cinema as a pioneering film that shall hopefully, allow other filmmakers to explore zanier sub-genres that are already popular in other international film circuits. Not only one of the best Indian horror ever, but one of the best horror comedies ever made, even when compared to its western counterparts. Am absolute delight and complete entertainment for a cognizant adult audience. If you want real entertainment, and want a much-needed break from those myriad nonsensical masala films masquerading in the guise of entertainment, then dash to your nearest movie theater and catch the next show of this delectably wicked gore- fest."

        "review_detailed_main": "Over the past ten years, the description \"Bollywood horror film\" is becoming less rare, especially as Indian film distributors make more attempts to exploit international markets.\n\nThere has been a translation barrier to cross in that regard, however, by which I do not mean just the Hindustani language, but a film language and a cinematic mode so intimately tied in to the popular music culture, that it seemed (to foreign eyes) to turn even genres like action and science fiction into sprawling musicals.\n\nThis is my second Bollywood horror watching venture, following 2003's Bhoot (which starred Ajay Devgan and Urmila Matondkar). When I first saw Bhoot, a ghost/ exorcism horror film, I supposed that director Ram Gopal Varna was inspired by American horror films like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. I had not yet seen Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On: the Grudge, but once I had, I saw its influence all over the set design as well as other aspects of the film.\n\nBhoot, while not the first Bollywood horror film, marked a trend of Indian horror filmmakers joining something like a common culture of international cinematic horror creators, finding modes that would find greater international success.\n\nSo now, here comes Go Goa Gone, which has been (aptly) described as a zombie (horror) comedy, although, clearly, Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. have seen Shaun of the Dead, which nearly makes this a ZomRomCom.\n\nThe movie mostly focuses on a couple of hapless stoner/ cubicle dwellers, Luv (Vir Das) and Hardik (Kunal Khemu), a pairing not unlike that of Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, especially since Luv is the more ambitious of the two, particularly on the romantic front, and he begins the film conflicted about the next step in his ongoing relationship with Priyanka (like Shaun and his commitment problems in SotD. When he makes the decision to \"clean up his act\" and stop smoking (one presumes tobacco AND pot) and drinking to propose to his girl, it ends badly. When Luv and Hardik's far more responsible and slightly more successful roommate Bunny (Anand Tiwari) gets the opportunity to go to a business seminar at a luxurious resort in the West India state of Goa, Hardik exploits the trip as an opportunity to help his friend Luv get over being rejected and... well, to party.\n\nOnce there, Luv encounters Luna (Pooja Gupta), and decides to crash a party (allegedly run by Russian Mafia) on an island off the coast of Goa in an effort to get together with her, dragging his buddies Hardik and Bunny along for the ride (the island party scenario also seems to be a call back to the proto-Bollywood horror, Gumnaan (1966), the movie that the West mainly knows from the song \"Jaan Pehechan Ho,\" which made its' way into 2001's Ghost World, and a beer commercial in 2012).\n\nOf course, this scenario ends up in the film's zombie outbreak, precipitated, in this case, by an experimental combo of drugs disseminated at the party. The guys wake up in different areas of island, eventually finding each other, and hordes of infected/ undead folk with a hunger for the living.\n\nEventually, they run into a couple of folks they take as Russian Mafia types, one of whom, Boris (Saif Ali Khan) has taken rather nicely to his new role as zombie killer (he first turns up, armed to the teeth, and blowing the hordes away, saying \"I kill dead people\" (which, somehow, I can only take as a zombie movie take off on M. Night Shyamalan's line from The Sixth Sense).\n\nPoola Gupta's Luna is appealing and modern enough, though more of a throwback to traditional Bollywood heroines (i.e., it's less than clear that she will end up with any of the film's heroes).\n\nIt does take a while to get to the zombie killing action (a full 40 minutes out of 111), but the movie is not without the requisite inventiveness needed in the zombie action set pieces (as zombies are dispatched by having flashlights shoved sown their throats, and by shotgun blasts to the head, followed in slow motion), and Das, Khemu and Tiwari have comedic chops that are up to the task; Saif Ali Khan's Boris is something like a Desi/ Russian take on Bruce Campbell's Ash, and fulfills that role very well.\n\nRaj and DK offer characters who, like those in SotD and Zombieland, are very aware of the zombies of (Western) pop culture (though Hardik wonders if his Christian cross would be an effective weapon against the zombs). It may be a bit derivative (i.e., the scene where Luv is convinced that they can get around a zombie horde by blending in), and there are some plot points that seem to go nowhere at all, but the film was a welcome diversion, and a reasonably original entry into the zombie horror genre (and this at a time when we seem overloaded with same on TV and in feature films).\n\nAlso welcome were the references to modern office culture (a meme about learning from experience, linked to a poster with Steve Jobs' face on it, gets twisted into a recurring line about survival) and sociopolitical ideas (as when Hardik, less than helpfully, offers that these undead were created by \"globalization\").\n\nI'm not too sure how this film is playing in the Indian movie-going culture, but horror fans of any nationality, particularly fans of horror comedy, will have plenty to enjoy here."

Not those typical Bollywood moments.\n\nBad bits:\n\n1. Terrible acting except Saif and Das.\n\n2. Not much of Violence, Gore and Gun play that you would expect in a Zombie movie.\n\n3.

You will always be giggled by some or the actor by their comic timing.\n\nBut in the end its still the Dierctor's movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "A decent project talking about Zombies(for the first time ever) in an enjoyable comic manner clearly represents the appreciable welcome change sprouting in our Hindi film industry at the present. The new, fresh young minds are here to try something novel, defying all those over-used or corroded subjects and its now the turn of the viewers to express their visible consent for this change through their fair acceptance of such innovations at the box office.\n\nHaving said that its not that GO GOA GONE is a flawless movie with everything falling in the right places throughout like a perfect entertainer. The film does has its big drawbacks and is sure not a masterpiece in any cinematic terms or otherwise. But at the same time, it is a project which largely manages to entertain you despite of having \"a completely foreign plot\", with no history or mention of its premise in our country's literature or tradition. In other words, yes we have seen dead people or evil spirits killing many in our horror films, in the form of walking dead bodies in the past. Yet the word ZOMBIE (representing the similar concept) was never used here earlier till date and that's the reason the attempt falls into the category of being an inventive and courageous one, quite evidently.\n\nFurther, GO GOA GONE can also be easily placed among all those inspired films which are more or less modeled on a western source such as SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) or ZOMBIELAND (2009), particularly aiming at the multiplex audience. But still I am not willing to criticize the movie on the above grounds because it at least breaks the ice and is daring enough to give us something never tried before in Hindi Films, representing the much desired change and an awaited make-over.\n\nThe film begins on an entertaining note as a funny young project and then fairly manages to keep you engaged in its first half mainly through its humorous, raunchy dialogues (mostly) written around sexual references. The concept of zombies (or the comic horror element in it) enters only after a good 40 minutes (in a 110 minutes film), which clearly indicates the apprehensions in the minds of its makers too. Post interval, since the thin plot has nothing else to reveal, the grip is lost and we only have the chase sequences here shot fittingly. The easily predictable climax becomes a spoils sport once again but still the funny expressions & many well written youthful conversations don't let you write it off so easily and the film positively turns out to be an entertaining one time watch in the end.\n\nIn exact words, what actually works in GO GOA GONE is not the zombies or the ongoing chase game played with the horrifying faces. On the contrary it's the fabulous dialogues and the amusing comic timing of Kunal Khemu, which becomes the unexpected winner here right from the word 'Go'. Plus it's the intelligence with which director duo Raj & DK,amalgamate the two conflicting emotions of fear and humour together on the screen with a brilliant ease and conviction. Particularly I really loved the way they introduce or educate the Indian viewers with the concept of Zombies in just 2 minutes without any confusion.\n\nInterestingly, only a few weeks back another film on 'the zombie factor' was released titled RISE OF THE ZOMBIE touted as the first ever Indian Zombie movie. But since it was quite a weak film comparatively, so GO GOA GONE is sure going to be remembered as 'the pioneer one' forgetting the former in the coming years. Apart from its terrific dialogues, GGG also has few appealing songs (including the hugely likable 'Khoon Choos Le' & 'Babaji Ki Booty'), an exciting background score and an eye catching cinematography which together take you on to that lonely beach of Goa right away, without getting tensed or distressed.\n\nHowever since the film is only focused on this one plot only, it does become monotonous and seems to be walking on the same path (sequences) repeatedly towards the end. Also the big name of Saif Ali Khan associated with the project is not there with any worth praising performance as such and his part is more like a lengthy cameo only in his own co-production. Saif is good, but I frankly didn't find him that impressive at all as was being projected in the promos. Out of the three lead performances, Vir Das is great in his underplayed character & Anand Tiwari is a delight to watch as the innocent one. But without any second thoughts, the film entirely belongs to Kunal Khemu and the dialogue writer alone. Especially, Kunal's performance becomes the backbone of the project here and he is sure going to get many more similar offers post GO GOA GONE as it seems. Puja looks beautiful and does fine whereas the rest of the supporting cast has nothing significant to do in the film as they are all mostly playing the walking dead bodies.\n\nIn all, along with its visible drawbacks, GO GOA GONE is based on a novel theme, has got performances and many hilarious moments to enjoy in its less than 2 hours of duration. So you should indeed give it a try as such path breaking attempts need to be encouraged & praised in order to get more (& better) quality products in the future."

You can import a western villain i.e. Zombie easily, but please learn the art of movie making and story telling.\n\nI don't have enough words to describe its miserable level of story\n\nNo twists in the story\n\nComic moments are few and when they are, they fail to tickle your funny bone as you would expect from a comedy movie\n\nWaste of time"

        "review_detailed_main": "For those of you who are big fans of Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil Series, The Walking Dead will surely enjoy this. I was really skeptic to how Bollywood will transition into Zombie Apocalypse, although they approached it in Shaun of the Dead style, the transition was good and it worked.\n\nThis is not for average audiences, so those of you who like romantic crap, or cheesy sadak chap action, then this is completely not for you. Therefore, just turn it off now before going any further.\n\nThe best way to rate a zombie movie is to rate the Zombies itself. I was afraid they'll use some cheesy CGI graphics but instead they used real visual effects, the make-ups on Zombies were done perfectly to give the nice terrifying look. And the storyline was interesting on how the Virus spread on a remote Island.\n\nI say Kudos to the director, producers, and actors. I really hope to see more versions of this or even a sequel now that the virus has spread beyond the Island. Hopefully it will be more darker and gloomier this time. For a actor like Saif Ali Khan to take such a bold step for a movie like this really shows how versatile he really is and how open minded he is towards his audience.\n\nWell Done Bollywood, I am impressed, now time to take this concept further!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Go Goa Gone is a zom/com flick directed by Raj & D.K. starring Saif Ali Khan, Kunal Khemu & Vir Das.\n\nThe film revolves around three guys; two of which need a break from their life which is anyways going nowhere. Bunny, a friend of theirs, tells them that he's going to Goa for a presentation, which they take as an excuse to go to Goa to party, meet girls and live life to the fullest. They go to a rave party organised by the Russian mafia on an island and soon things go wrong when zombies start appearing out of nowhere.\n\nOkay, so the minute I saw the trailer for this film, it looked quite mindless, but I couldn't help but laugh at some of the jokes and the fact that I've never seen an Indian zom/com flick, I had a feeling this would be good. Even Kunal Khemu and Vir Das were there so I was sure that they would put on a good show. The film, ultimately, was what somewhat of my expectations. It was good, yet I feel the second half couldn't sustain the comedy that the first half had. However, the acting is still great, and you can't help but laugh at the jokes Kunal Khemu's character makes.\n\nThe action of this film is pretty good, with quite a lot of headshots and stabs. The acting is really counted since anyone watching this film wouldn't really care about it.\n\nOverall, Go Goa Gone is a really good time. I had a great time just sitting back watching two dope heads and a Russian/Indian guy kill 1399 zombies, which is honestly all that you should expect along with a few laughs. 7/10"

However don't watch with your parents, you'll be embarrassed.\n\nWell the movie is one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen in the past few months. I laughed like hell in the theater Jumped on my seat, threw pop-corn & I wasn't alone, the whole theater went crazy.\n\nSooo just go & enjoy this amazing movie & most of the youths of this generation can relate some of the scenes of the movie with themselves.\n\nP.S-- Don't Buy Cold drinks or eatables because the movie is a complete laughter ride & you might choke yourselves while laughing.

It offers some good laughs, some striking visuals & a terrific performance by Kunal Khemu, working on its advantage.\n\n'Go Goa Gone' Synopsis: A rave party off the coast of Goa, goes horrifyingly and hilariously wrong when the island is overrun with zombies.\n\n'Go Goa Gone' begins well & maintains its momentum until interval. Post interval, the pace dips, the goings-on become repetitive & the culmination is ordinary. In totality, the film appeals in parts, more-so in its first-hour, which is very entertaining. The Screenplay is crisp, but could've been sharper in the latter hour. Raj Nidimoru & Krishna D.K's Direction is stylish. Cinematography captures the stunning locales of Goa strikingly. Editing is fair. Action-Sequences are extremely violent. Music by Sachin-Jigar is memorable.\n\nPerformance-Wise: Kunal Khemu is terrific. The underrated actor makes you laugh at right places, without making morbid faces. He steals the show! Vir Das is energetic, while Anand Tiwari is under-utilized. Saif Ali Khan is okay in an extended special appearance. Puja Gupta looks stunning & delivers ably.\n\nOn the whole, 'Go Goa Gone' can be viewed once."

        "review_title": "Hilariously scary!!!",
        "review_detailed_main": "Long back (actually 2 years back) there was a rumor that Bollywood was on its way to make movies on Zombies. Two unnamed films were heard to be in making. Two years after one movie is already released \"Rise of the Zombie\" (released and flopped) another released today \"GoGoa Gone\". The name is wacky and trailers are not that interesting but the songs...the songs were its USP. Remember \"Delhi Belly\", how its wacky songs created the curiosity around it and turned it into a smash hit?....I hope the same thing clicks for it. Now the main business, the review.\n\nTheme: Three friends goes Goa for different reason. Two guys to just chill out and one for office presentation. They join a rave party and things turn bad there. People suddenly start turning into zombies. What now? (Well Zombie movies were always about two things either its a horror or its a comedy. Its a comedy and that's the maximum you need to know about it)\n\nCharacter Development: There is hardly any chance of any character development. And this being a \"piece-of-life\" movie its unjust to ask any from it too. So, leaving this topic.\n\nDirection: Was going through the filmography of both the directors. A very impressive catalog : \"Shor in the city\", \"99\" to be mentionable. In case of \"Go Goa Gone\" I would say they have nailed it. The big hit that everyone waits for is here, they can enjoy the success. Its not easy to make offbeat movies in India specially if you want to make profits too from ticket sales. But I guess this is gonna be hit among young viewers. The direction is very much to the point, gives very less focus to individual characters so less time to commit mistakes. You would get almost 100% dialogs rather any monologue. This ensures a creative input of comic timing and surprise element to audience. Just imagine you won't be seeing Saif doing overacting! That's an achievement on its own! On second thought, actually Saif actually did over the top acting. And that blends to the tone of the movie. Crazy characters! Every single one was created with utmost care and then was given some intelligent lines. The chemistry between Vir Das and Kunal Khemu to be mentioned here for this. Then the intelligent film-making by including inspired scenes from \"Zombieland\" and \"Shaun of the dead\". Well, you know what is intelligent here? They not only copied scenes but took a dig on it! Bollywood making fun of Hollywood movies is a remarkable scene for sure. Another intelligent aspect is how they handled Clich\u00e9s. They touched every Clich\u00e9 that is related to such zombie flicks and made fun of those. Then they made fun of themselves too. Too many things in a movie?! Yeah and you would enjoy it for these things. Hats off to the director duo. Hope they bring a sequel too.\n\nCinematography: Though the movie takes place in Goa they have cautiously escaped showing the scenery of Goa. That was unnecessary for his movie and it was avoided. Rather collage of a rented room of bachelors, office room and a zombie infested island is well crafted. No special mention here. You get to see just what is there, no artsy-fartsy bullsh1t.\n\nSongs and background score: The songs are already popular. Specially \"Slowly slowly\" and \"Khoon choos le\". Whacky lyrics along with party themed music. Apt to the mood with movie. Two of the songs are used as title credit scene and end credit scene and others are as background score. The dedicated background score is average though.\n\nEditing: The editing is superb till intermission but the movie slows down its pace in the second half and this happens mostly due to lack of ideas in screenplay. Still a very good job.\n\nEntertainment value: After a long time laughed out loud in theatre. Full entertainment (provided profanity does not bother you!). Kunal Khemu and Vir Das runs havoc and Saif's crazy Russian accent is fun...trust me!\n\nVerdict: Since \"Delhi Belly\" this is the only movie which can shake the former's stature of intelligent. tongue-in-cheek comedy movie. Beware of profanity though. IF you have problem with profanity, this movie is not for you. Rest all assured you would enjoy for sure."

But somehow others who went with me asked me to hang on and so saw it till end.\n\nTerribly terribly disappointed.

Watch it for its sheer novelty."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"Go Goa Gone,\" the first Indian zombie movie, brings a refreshing concept to Bollywood. The trio of Kunal Khemu, Anand Tiwari, and Veer Das delivers hilarity, injecting humor into a genre typically known for scares. The film strikes a balance, managing to be both scary and entertaining. The catchy and unique music adds another layer to the experience. Saif Ali Khan, in a pivotal role, delivers a good performance. The movie as a whole is a breath of fresh air in Bollywood, introducing a novel genre and combining elements of horror and humor seamlessly. \"Go Goa Gone\" is a testament to Bollywood's ability to explore new territories and keep the audience entertained with innovative concepts."

With heads getting popped-up, bloods flowing like red wine, flesh getting ripped-off the effects are realistic enough to get audience approval.\n\nSachin-Jigar's music gels with the mood. \"Khoon Chus le\" has already become anthem for majority of us who hates to wake up on Monday morning & slog our body to the workplace.\"Babaji ki Booty\" is another gem of a song that reflects the mind of a person when one is \"high\".\n\nThe second half might give you a feeling of Dejavu but then majority of zombie survival films moves in this set pattern. Being the first zom-com in Indian cinema the director duo aptly chose the basic concept without making a convoluted plot which might have backfired. There is homage given to iconic zombie film \"Night of the Living Dead\" to \"zombieland\" in the second half. The heart of the film reminds you of Edgar Wright's masterpiece \"Shaun of the dead\".\n\nComing to the end there is also a social message against usage of drugs.On the whole Ggg is the perfect torchbearer for the zom-com genre in Hindi cinema. GGG seamlessly merged the two concepts (Zombie & Slacker comedy) & made one hell of a mad ride. Go for it \u2013 you will laugh throughout & get distresses. There is a hint of a sequel & I am looking forward to some more madness in it."

        "review_detailed_main": "I had some concern about watching \"Go Goa Gone\", with it being an Indian movie and all - dreading that it would be filled with singing, dancing and music in the best Bollywood style. But luckily my zombie aficionado instinct got the better of me and I decided to give the movie a go anyway.\n\nAnd with good cause I might add, because \"Go Goa Gone\" was really a nice surprise. And let me just say that this is not a movie full of dancing, singing and music. Quite far from it, actually. \"Go Goa Gone\" really took me by surprise, especially because it is right up there in the league with movies such as \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Lesbian Vampire Killers\" and \"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil\". This is indeed a great zombie horror comedy movie.\n\nThe story is about three friends and roommates, Hardik (played by Kunal Khemu), Luv (played by Vir Das) and Bunny (played by Anand Tiwari) who end up going to Goa for a vacation of partying and hooking up with women - well, at least such was the plan for Hardik and Luv. They end up going to a rave on a remote island, a rave hosted by members of the Russian mafia. A new drug is introduced during this party, but this drug results in the users experiencing the ultimate high and turning into zombies.\n\nThere is a good amount of action and a suitable amount of comedy to the story here. And there is a constant pace to the movie which just keeps the movie going and going, without leaving any dull moments throughout the length of the feature.\n\nAnd on the plus side, then there is a good amount of blood and gore in the movie as well, enough to keep most gorehounds satisfied. And the zombie make-up and effects were actually surprisingly good.\n\nIf you enjoy zombie movies, then \"Go Goa Gone\" is definitely a movie to watch, and with this addition to the zombie library, India have put themselves on the radar."

Actually we did see a shorter version than the one that was released in India. They had a disclaimer at the beginning and if I'm not mistaken during the movie, where some politician was talking about how dangerous some of the things are shown in the movie.\n\nAnd all this about a movie, that is obviously a comedy! And with zombies (who are the target for a lot of jokes) and criminals amongst other things. The jokes work mostly (depending on your sense of humor obviously), but there are a few missteps here and there. There is obviously no nudity, which does not affect the movie, but the graphic violence element is also kept at a minimum."

In short,once it starts,you wont yawn or crib until it ends,because it is precise with just the right amount of songs and background score and it is the actors especially that impress ed me a lot. All the actors were amazing in their respective roles and the characters were tailor made for them. While being a zombie flick,I really liked how it discouraged the youth from adhering to drugs,drinking,etc. All in all,it was a fun little movie I enjoyed with a lot of popcorn and a lot of laughs and I left the movie hall with a smile. Thank you Go Goa gone for the entertainment. :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is extremely astonishing that Indian film-makers are now making movies with entirely different story-lines, hoping to appeal to the audiences with varying tastes in films. This film is surely gonna be loved by many indians, even those who are aversive to such themes when a Hollywood movie is played. Zombie-theme is not a very favorable one to many, believing it to be just another add-on to the sci-fi cult. There have been plenty of such movies made in west, like Zombieland, Resident Evil series, to name but few. Anyone before watching this movie would have definitely thought that such story-themes can NEVER be made in India, by any Indian film maker. Not only Zombie-film, making any sci-fi film in India comes with great risks as audience is not yet ready for such films. Only a handful of people, mainly younger generations would love to watch a sci-fi film.\n\nGo to any theater playing the latest Star Trek movie and you would find few groups of guys sitting here n there in the theater, few loners, most of them wearing specs, and rarely a couple would be seen, and a whole family is rarest to find. Such has been the taste of Indian audience even in current times when sci-fi cult has grown hugely in west. How can one imagine to have a zombie movie then in an Indian theater? But Go Goa Gone has startled everyone's assumptions and imaginations. Purely a Zombie-based theme, a sci-fi element that a drug would damage most part of the brain making the survivors Zombies, and the rest being the similar masala from any such western counterpart. The movie could be a bit predictable to those who have watched many such movies as various scenes and screenplay seemed to be copied from various sources. Originality was lacking in the movie, the characterizations and the similar scenarios are very commonly seen in any such sci-fi movie; whether a group of young adults is stuck at an island surrounded by zombies, or surviving the attack from a monstrous-mutant animal, or survival from the spread of a virus, or escaping from an alien etc etc. But as with western movies, though scenarios are common and predictable, but what attracts the audience in them is a new story-line different from the previous ones, along with new elements of technology.\n\nOut of few sci-fi's made in India, like Koi Mil Gaya.., Ra.One, (also including few non-Hindi films like Robot etc) this definitely provides a very unique story-line and theme, never seen and expected in Bollywood. Indian audience is definitely going to get a surprise in this movie and complete entertainment included. I am sure people from all classes are going to like this movie, despite its first-time presented theme which would be novel to several Indians.\n\nThis movie is definitely going to set a new trend in film-making, and may be we will get to see an Indian version of Species, Aliens, LOTR etc in the near future.\n\nThe film has very nice dialogues, with beautiful cinematography, few of them are gonna become classic scenes. Saif's make-up is very apt for a movie like this, and he has shown mature acting. Kunal's dialogues and his role would become favorite of many, there has been the use of abusive language also. There are no sensuous scenes, but in a movie like this at least 1 or 2 could be added. May be the directors were intending to make it suitable for family watching, and also slang seems more acceptable than a sex-scene. And as a result the girl, Puja, was not shown in a glamorous way, though she is hot and cute. This has made the movie content-focused, and more footage has been given to the survival from zombies. All three young male actors have acted brilliantly.\n\nI have given a rating of 8/10 because of some commonalities with Western movies.\n\nA MUST WATCH, even you would love to watch it the second time."

        "review_detailed_main": "Go Goa Gone is truly one of the most hilarious Hindi films since Delhi Belly. It's a zombie comedy, with lots of blood and gore, so it's in no way for the squeamish, and the humor is quite mature, so it's NOT a child-friendly watch, but, hey, it's the subject matter itself which isn't really kid-suitable.\n\nNevertheless, Go Goa Gone sets out to bring a new genre into Indian cinema with great gusto, and it fails to fail. With rib-tickling lines, great comic acting by Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari, and even Saif Ali Khan as the quirky, macho Boris (soon to be one of the greatest cult characters of all of Hindi cinema), Go Goa Gone FORCES you to laugh effortlessly.\n\nYes, the plot gets a little dragging at the second half, and Puja Gupta's acting isn't very novel (although she looks great), but mostly, Go Goa Gone just always makes you laugh at one point or the other. I was chuckling at every other moment. The zombies are well-made, for a first in Bollywood, and nothing looks cheap. The action is pretty nice, and the songs are quirky and trippy.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good laugh-fest. Except the kids, of course..."

I don't know why Indian cinema thinks that by bringing more sexuality and vulgarity they are going to be more like Hollywood.\n\nI don't know why Saif would even agree to part take in such a childish movie.\n\nMy suggestion: Don't waste your time if you wanna watch something decent. The only good parts are in the trailer, other than that its a boring silly little movie.\n\nDoesn't deserve more than 4 stars."

Looks like a joker with red leather jacket , golden hair and nonsense kids jargon....... I couldn't even tolerate 20 minutes into this movie......... all my brain cells got fried...... and I myself felt like a zombie......There is absolutely no comedy. High school project movies are better than this movie. The background score tries to make the scenes more exciting but when there is no strength in the screen play then how can background music make it better............ The story line is absolutely without any story actually. I am just writing this review to caution you not to waste your hard earned money and precious time going to the movie theater.

After a long time, i laughed a lot after watching a Bollywood comedy. Last was while watching Delhi belly. Attempting to make a movie in completely new genre takes a lot of courage. It was a very risky decision which Illuminati( For all you illuminati fans, This is Saifs home production)films took. And i would not dare say that they did not succeed.Statistically speaking this movie failed to garner the kind of response a 'Saif Ali Khan' movie does. But its NOT a Saif ali khan movie. Though Saif does play an important part in the movie and i must confess that i was in love with his character 'Borris'. But in the end its a story about friends, drugs and Zombies. i don't want to reveal much about the movie but if you still have not seen the movie than grab a DVD or if its still running in nearby theaters then please go for it."

Raj and DK are enthused by Hollywood movies and there's no denying that GO GOA GONE is a film with Hollywood sensibilities. But the best part is that the film never gets dark or depressing. The wit and humor, generously interwoven in the narrative, keeps you smiling all through, despite the blood and gore. On the whole, GO GOA GONE is experimental since something like this has never been attempted earlier. But it's fun, witty, amusing and yes, thoroughly entertaining.

As soon as the first trailer came through, critics compared Go Goa Gone with popular Hollywood zombie flicks; more resonantly, Zombieland. While watching the dual directorial effort, the movie did not resemble Zombieland at all, though some scenes seemed a tad bit familiar to Shaun of the Dead (which itself was a comedic take on Romero's Zombie titles).\n\nThe movie was a breeze to watch and some scenes actually reeked originality with context to humor and wit, along with a previously unseen Grindhouse approach (restricted to zombies) in Indian cinemas. The three leads where effective with Kunal Khemu walking away with the best lines. Vir Das was OK. Anand Tiwari as Bunny was a revelation. Tagging along with the trio, Saif Ali Khan stood on firm ground as Borris (the trailers teased resemblance to Tallahassee of Zombieland).The Zombie concept remained status-quo but some scenes spurned comical twists which seemed fresh and out of the box.\n\nOverall, my preconceptions about this movie being derivative and unoriginal were pleasantly overthrown. Good direction and plenty of laughs more than made up for the reluctance of the script to break new grounds.\n\n8/10 for me."

But the next morning they find themselves not only surrounded and hunted by flesh-eating zombies.\n\nThis is the first zombie comedy film ever made in India and been a magnificently good attempt. The film is adapted very well as per the Indian set up and it's been good that the Indian cinema is trying new genres in film making and is been getting successful.\n\nThe plot of the film is unique and the execution is superb. The acting in the film is top notch with a special mention for Saif Ali Khan and Kunal Khemu.\n\nScreenplay of the film is fast paced and the funny one liners and punches will keep your funny bones tickling. The climax of the film looked little over dramatic but is superb.\n\nThis film is a decent attempt to a new genre and we would like to see many such films in the future."

And the horror strikes a nice balance with the comedy, which is not always the case.\n\nThe characters are likeable, and though they do some stupid things, the stupid thing are believable for their characters, and they do learn from their mistakes.\n\nPlus which... COKE SKEET!!! You don't see THAT in every single other zombie movie, now, DO you?"
