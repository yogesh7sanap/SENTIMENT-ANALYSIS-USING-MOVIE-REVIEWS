        "review_detailed_main": "This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.\n\nFrom the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment.\n\n\"Why is it so bad,\" you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit \"on edge,\" frightened, or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.\n\nI am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else."

He punches women constantly, can't figure out people are lying to him, threatens kids, attacks in a bear suit, and has so many unintentionally funny one-liner quotes its just ridiculous, such as \"HOWDIDITGETBURNED\", \"NO! NOT THE BEES!\", and \"Killing me won't bring back your goddamn honey!\". Hell, even the ending of the movie was funny somehow! I saw this at the cinema too, and the audience were laughing as well! It's totally worth buying on DVD as its dirt cheap now.\n\nIronically though, the \"Director's Cut\" is supposed to make it more horror-like, but it actually makes the movie even funnier! In conclusion, its a 'classic' for the wrong reasons!"

I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.\n\nI'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come the jeers. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me.\n\nNot to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think, \"Yes, people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like\" is beyond me.\n\nDo not go see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD."

        "review_detailed_main": "Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.\n\nI saw the original \"Wicker Man\" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs. This said, I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example, I liked the original 1950's \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is \"The Thing\". The original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like \"The Wicker Man\" re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make.\n\nThis film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.\n\nThe metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient (\"The drone must die!\"), especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. \"The Stepford Wives\" anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.\n\nThe problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fianc\u00e9 and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage \"saves\" ultimately brings him death.\n\nThe dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen \"Law & Order\" and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery.\n\nSo much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that."

        "review_detailed_main": "I managed to get into a screening of the remake of the wicker man the other day, and have to say that i was pretty entertained by it. Being a life time horror movie fan, and having (obviously) seen the original, I was interested to see what this new school would bring to the story. From what I can see on the message boards, it looks like not many of the die-hard wicker fans are too enthused by the idea of a remake, but for the most part their fears can be put to rest (if they will allow). The remake DEFINITELY retains AND even ADDS to the the atmospheric slowly boiling sense of dread and and wonder (I.E. WHAT THE F**K!?!?), leading up to the inevitable ending which left me with a much more haunted feeling that even seeing the original for the first time.\n\nI do have to warn you that if you are not a Nicholas Cage fan, this will not be a role to win you over- there are parts where it is painful to watch him. Everything else is relatively flawless though- if you let yourself get into the movie, you honestly feel as if you are on an isolated island where the \"old ways\" are still very relevant to society, something that even the original couldn't seem to do if you looked closely enough. The story is definitely fleshed out a bit, and if you're open to a new take on the story I think you'll have a great movie-going experience. I think that the important thing to remember here is that it's a movie- a brief distraction from real life whose purpose is to entertain- NOT a commentary on paganism.\n\nThis \"remake\" actually manages to stand on it's own as a new entry into the horror archives. Does it have its problems? of course it does, what movie doesn't? remake or not. It reminded me of the differences between the original Ringu and the Naomi Watts/ Gore Verbinski version- i think both are outstanding entries into the horror world, both offering many different things. Of course there is always the one that came first, but sometimes the \"original\" can be re-tooled and have new life breathed into it.\n\nAs a side-note- even if you HATE what they've done with the story/actors they chose- the cinematography is absolutely otherworldly here, with very little emphasis on special effects, and much more creative uses of natural landscapes and tricks of light- i give THAT a 15!"

The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career."

Even worse, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking \"Is that it?\" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money."

        "review_detailed_main": "This remake deals about a depressed patrolman(Nicolas Cage, role of Edward Woodward)affected by a car accident. He receives a letter from ex-girlfriend(Kate Beaham) asking help for her disappeared daughter. Then he goes to a lonely island, located in state of Washington. There lives a strange matriarchal community, an Amish-alike, whose denizens(Molly Parker,Leelee Sobiesky,Diane Delano, in former version were Diane Cilento,Britt Ekland,Christopher Lee,Lindsay Kemp among others) practice rare pagan rituals and pre-Celtics customs and ruled by a chief sister(Ellen Burstyn).\n\nThis new version from British classic by Robin Hardy contains suspense, mystery, occult terror without gratuitous gore and spectacular outdoors shot in Vancouver. Very persuasively script written by Neal LaBute, differs on the original -by playwright Anthony Shaffer, author of 'Sleuth' -in various issues, previous adaptation is set in a Scottish offshore island with a community practicing bizarre pagan sexual rites, here is in State of Washington with a matriarchal society and without sexual situations. Besides first version the community cultivated apples, while this one are bees with drones represented by men and a Bee Queen well incarnated by Ellen Burstyn. The film displays a very good cinematography by Paul Sarossy and unsettling musical score by Angelo Badalamenti, author of Twin Peaks soundtrack. The motion picture is professionally directed by Neal LaBute, though with no originally. The movie is dedicated to Johnny Ramone memory, recently deceased. Furthermore there is a final alternative, only available in DVD."

Not in the way you would think of it, however, because \"The Wicker Man\" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I would rank it up there with \"Airplane!\" and \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" What's the best part about this? This film is supposed to be a horror movie. I wasn't scared at all. In fact, I couldn't be scared, or even shocked, because there were parts where I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nThe acting is terrible. Nicolas Cage is an incredibly wooden actor, delivering almost all of his lines in the same monotone voice, (although the more memorable parts of this movie are when he gets angry). The plot...? What plot, this movie makes no sense at all. And when the point of the movie is to scare the audience, this movie fails miserably. The music also sometime seems incredibly inappropriate, even laughable.\n\nSo if you can stand the bad parts of this movie, and enjoy it as it should be watched, you may find yourself a \"Wicker Man\" fan. I did."

        "review_detailed_main": "Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist\u0085 really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.\n\n3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clich\u00e9s, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground \"playing Wickerman\".\n\nThe original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.\n\nI think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so."

This is, of late, the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre, unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater. At least, it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome."

        "review_detailed_main": "Despite hearing nothing but negative reviews, I had to see this film for myself. So I waited until the backlash had died down a little and went into it with an open mind. Hell, I might even enjoy it, I thought. What followed was to be quite possibly the dullest 2 hours of my life I have ever spent in front of the TV. It was bad. But unfortunately did not fall within the 'so bad it's good' category.\n\nAt first it was hard to pinpoint exactly where the problems lie. The film looks gorgeous; there's no faulting the cinematography or mise-en-scene. The storyline is essentially the same as the original, which I enjoyed and continue to enjoy, so what exactly is wrong with this 2006 version? WHY is it so dull? The reasons being the following: a flat, dire performance from Cage, and from everyone else involved (including Burstyn, who appears non-committal and uninterested); a slow, pondering narrative that desperately wants to be taken as thoughtful and philosophical; 'action' set pieces that verge on the ridiculously mundane (bee's anyone?); and, maybe more importantly than anything else - Cage rushing around on a bicycle. How very quaint.\n\nUnfortunately, being a remake, comparisons are going to be drawn. Everything that made the original a brilliant film is missing here - the creepy atmosphere, the performances, the songs, the eroticism (Willow's song being a highlight). But at least it's got the same ending, right? Well, yes and no. It has an ending where the same thing happens but, this being the noughties, a little extra has to be added to make it all more 'disturbing'.\n\n********************SPOILERS**************************************\n\nHobbling? Bees? Okay, maybe a nice pair of additions for some, but Cage's cries of 'No, not the bees!' was the only moment of unintentional entertainment for me in this dull, lifeless mockery of a film.\n\nI don't normally vote a score of 1 for anything, as I usually see some merit in everything I see. Yes, the cinematography was excellent, but it is not enough to save this film from being a relentless 2 hours of drudgery.\n\nAvoid."

They may not necessarily be your \"Average\" horror movies, but both are amazingly deep in their subject matter. Looking past whatever arguments other posters have to say about these movies the plot is rich and full and keep the viewer guessing until the end.\n\nThe first one was much better at keeping the viewer guessing because Christopher Lee is such a good actor and movie goers expected to have to think when they went and saw a movie.\n\nThe new movie was \"dumbed down\" quite a bit because modern movie-goers seem to want everything spelled out to them, which is why I think movies in general are going down the tubes. There is no more critical thinking or discussion about movies anymore. Everything is spelled out and explained to the fullest extent so no one has to come up with their own opinions."

My fave scene has to be when he steals the bicycle at gun point. I mean really...really?!! And his knockout fights with the women. Those scenes are so outrageous you have to find it funny. I'm a female and I wasn't offended by the chick fights. It was an enjoyable watch. This pales in comparison to the 1973 version which you HAVE to watch. That one is awesome and creepy.

The original 1973 film is a believable masterpiece with a setting, although a fantasy, that has an authenticity due to it having drawn on a real history. The re-make is a misguided attempt to relocate this historically founded story to a country that isn't old enough to have had such beliefs. The entire symbolism of the original is lost. Blind faith, virginity, ignorance, self-righteousness and temptation lead the original cop through the maze of experience to prove his worthiness. Nicholas Cage has none of these traits and is just a pawn in a ludicrous plot. The only good thing about this film is it has rekindled people's desire to see the original again and experience it's hypnotic charm."

        "review_detailed_main": "I should mention right here that I am not a huge fan of thrillers, but once in a while some thriller surprises me. But there is a part of me - the part of me that wants to see all the bad movies ever made (even the ones from the Bottom 100, and this movie made it to the list thanks to the changes apported in the list since the last summer, and increasing the number of votes caused a strong impact on the list)\n\nIn this movie (a remake of a movie I never saw) Nicolas Cage plays Edward, a cop that is invited by his former girlfriend to go on a island searching for a young girl that disappeared there. But Edward soon finds a large mistery to unsolve, and he also finds out that in that community women are the superior race, and men are treated as slaves for their pagan rites, How Edward will find the disappeared girl and connect the dots?\n\nWatching this movie I didn't find it as bad as its overall score of 3,7 and almost all the negative reviews would suggest. Despite I hadn't hopes for this movie I ended up enjoying it so much because of its many twists and turns and it has also some good cinematography. Nicolas Cage here gives another great performance, but I felt sorry for him at the end. And the supporting cast is all good.\n\nPleasant and interesting thriller, and it doesn't deserve at all the hate it has received. And I know many would be angry at me, but its inclusion in the Bottom 100 is undeserved! Don't buck on conventional wisdom, because I think that this is a nice thriller that fans of the genre will love (and the fact that I liked it as I am not a huge fan of thrillers says a lot!)."

Wicker Man joins the ranks of films such as The Room, Troll 2, and Battlefield Earth as a hilarious accident that is lightning in a bottle. First of all, I don't know why this remake exists. The original is a cult classic that had some genuinely great moments. I guess that made it a prime target for Hollywood, so here it is. All of the dialog in this movie, and I mean EVERY. SINGLE. LINE. is hilariously bad or just awkward, or sometimes both. The acting is just awful. Nick Cage turns the scenery chewing up to eleven, and everyone else is either not talented enough or trying too hard to act. Really the strongest parts of this movie are act one and act three. Most of the classic terrible lines (NOT THE BEES! HOW'D IT GET BURNED? What's in the bag, a shark or something?) are in those acts, and enough is happening to keep you entertained. However, the second act where the actual investigating is occurring is just boring. It is incredibly repetitive and turns into just a generic boring investigation flick. I realize that there isn't a film out there that is hilariously terrible for the entire running time, but this one tries. If you can find it for a dollar, and want to see Hollywood gone oh so wrong, give this a try. If you like bad movies, you've seen this already."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the recent vogue of remaking movies at a fair clip, writer-director Neil Labute has decided to turn his eye to the early 1970s minor cult classic The Wicker Man. The original has developed a following over the years and is generally well regarded. Unfortunately, the remake will probably be held in the same company. While not a terrible film, The Wicker Man is nevertheless not great by any imagination, occasionally sliding into the realm of unintentional self-parody.\n\nThe film opens on police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage), a motorcycle cop who is witness to a horrific traffic accident involving a young girl and her mother. Unable to shake the experience, Malus goes on an extended leave and then ends up receiving a letter from his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Willow (Kate Beahan), that her daughter is missing and she needs his help to locate her. Malus travels to the remote island of Summersisle, a private commune that has developed a matriarchal hierarchy, where men are little better than pack mules. Malus is reunited with Willow and begins his investigation of the island, discovering a number of unusual habits and strange goings-on. None of the inhabitants acknowledge the existence of Rowan, Willow's daughter, even the leader of the group, Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn). After some investigation, Malus becomes more and more convinced that not only is Rowan still on the island, but she may be the eventual subject of a ritualistic sacrifice to the naturalistic gods the people worship.\n\nThe Wicker Man falls apart in a number of different ways, but no more detrimental than in the performance of Nicholas Cage. Cage, an effective actor in other films, has been known for his somewhat unorthodox style at times, and here he turns in what may be one of his worst performances ever. He overacts the role of Edward Malus to the extreme, often bordering on the ridiculous. It is difficult to not hold back giggles at times in some of his more \"emotional\" moments as he pushes the bounds of seriousness almost beyond their breaking point. It is difficult to say whether this is all Cage's fault or if some of the blame lay at the feet of director Labute, but either way, Cage's performance is a serious hindrance to the success of the film.\n\nCage isn't the only one in the film that is not quite up to par in the performance category. Many of the actors overplay their parts, seemingly to increase the \"weirdness\" factor of the film, but again causing little but bewilderment for the audience. The word subtlety is not to be found in the vocabulary of this film. The only semi-decent performance on record is that of Burstyn in the role of Sister Summersisle. She is low-key and effective in the role of the leader who has what appears to be ulterior motives to her actions.\n\nAside from the acting missteps, The Wicker Man lacks much in the way of any real suspense. There is little in the film to raise the hairs on your neck, although the film seems to want to try every so often. A few scenes try to head in this direction, but they almost all fail to pay off. Also, when the twists and turns are finally alluded to, you find yourself questioning some of the significant leaps of logic the script makes. A few of its \"revelations\" are so difficult to swallow that it is hard to even believe the whole of the structure of the film.\n\nEven so, The Wicker Man has a sometimes atmospheric setting , there are some occasional bits of creepiness and the ending will most likely leave you a bit taken aback. If Labute had dealt with some of the performance issues and ironed out some of the logic in The Wicker Man, it may have been a decent little thriller. But, in the end, it just turns out to be just another forgettable remake."

Please take my advice as a Nicholas Cage fan, don't go see it. I really am sorry for the time I spent watching it. I now wonder if the first Wicker Man was as badly ended as this edition. Again try and avoid this if you don't want to be angry. Having second thoughts abut writing this piece because ten lines is way to many to have to explain that the ending of the movie was totally inadequate. In summation I would say don't go see this movie. Summary: Don't see it! How many times do I have to say IN SUMMATION I would not recommend this movie? That is the summation."

I'm a big admirer of the original and have watched it more than once, and found the whole package quite exceptional. Sadly remakes are quite the fashion nowadays and in rare cases they can exceed or match the original. This one doesn't! They have re-written the original from its \"Christian v Pagan\" theme to some extreme feminist cult based in north-west USA. The acting is poor and Nicholas Cage is just annoying in the lead role (very unsuited to the part). The story is surprisingly boring and doesn't have the same creepy factor the original did.\n\nThe settings are undeniably incredibly beautiful, but apart from that there is nothing of note in this film. It's dreadfully poor and even removes a number of the greatest aspects of the original.\n\nI'd tell you to give this a miss, but you might enjoy it for a laugh as one of those so bad it's worth watching for a laugh!!!!"

        "review_detailed_main": "As much as I hate to admit it, this film is one of those that are so good, because they are so bad. A common thing to say about a truly awful film is that you can laugh AT it, but never really mean it, this film however, had me roaring with laughter, and I didn't see it whilst drinking with a room full of friends either, I saw it alone in the middle of the night!\n\nNicholas Cage stars as an unintentionally slow minded, drawling, trundling behemoth of a character who mumbles some things and yells everything else in no particular pattern. The acting in this film, staggers along without confidence or the vaguest amount of skill, it's a sad sight really.\n\nAnyway he plays a copper who pulls over a mother and young daughter to the side of the road, after he steps away from the car and looks back a huge truck comes and smashes into the front of it for no reason (I say no reason because, this truck must've been driving NEXT to the road AND going the wrong way) Cage immediately runs to the back of the car and begins smashing away at the rear window to save the completely unharmed and surprisingly apathetic looking young child. Needless to say the car is soon to explode and chooses to do so as Cage is halfway leaned right inside the car. The car goes BANG obliterating the mother and child and just gently shoves Cage out the back of the car leaving him without a scratch. Well we're told Cage has a hard time coming to terms with this and spends, i dunno, an hour or so off-work to grieve at home. At this point he receives a letter asking him to come to some secluded island to find the whereabouts of his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter. So he goes there, aaaaaand the place is full of strange culty weirdos (run entirely by women, the men are mindless zombies. Wouldn't want to appear misogynistic you see)\n\nThe ferry-ride over contains one of the more funny parts of the film. He sees a little girl out on the deck from inside, and a truck FLIES out of the sky and runs her over! we're even treated to a crushing, splatting sound. Brilliant. Later on he's lying in bed and has a flash-back, but not of the little girl in the car who was killed, but of the same girl in the ferry being killed by his own daydream!\n\nThe original Wicker Man is an incredible film (as are the two songs based on it) and remake really is an abomination. The music of the original is one of it's finest, most important points, to which the director of the remake (whose name I don't care to learn) says is 'poor' music, and the fans of which he doesn't WANT enjoying his remake. In other words, this remake is made by someone who didn't like, or even GET the original.\n\nThey also got rid of the Christian themes (wouldn't want to appear anti-Christian) which was another of the driving forces behind the original The nudity in the original was also something that had a god point to it and made a good impact, which was something else the remake avoided (wouldn't want to appear too liberal) The sensible malice of Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by some frail, dottering old woman, who cares? In short, ALL the originality, ALL the power, ALL the character, ALL the music, ALL the emotion, ALL messages and ALL the interest the original garnered has been replaced by...well, nothing really.\n\nStill, I advise you do rent this and do sit it through for the funny parts, favourites include:\n\nNicholas Cage charging around in a bear suit yelling at people (Imagine if you just walk into the room when this scene starts)\n\nNicholas Cage (the cop) beating up helpless women out of sheer anger and being hailed as a hero for it (so much for no appearing misogynistic)\n\nNicholas Cage fighting his way through loads of bees (\"they're in, my, EYES!\")\n\nNicholas Cage yelling \"how did it get burned!? how did it get burned!? howdiditgetburned!?HOWDIDITGETBURNED!?!?\"\n\n*********SPOILERS AHEAD***********\n\nThought I'd best add this too, probably my favourite scene in any movie ever:\n\nNicholas Cage being caught by the cultists and yelling \"BITCHES!! YOU BITCHES!!\" and \"Killing me won't bring back you're GOD DAMN HONEY!!\"\n\nFinishing with the SIDE-SPLITTINGLY hilarious sounds of him being beaten up, like the Will Ferrel skit from Austin Powers \"I don't want to die! *CRACK* ...I don't believe in your gods!! *CRACK* ......AAaaaarrrggghhhh!! MY LEGS!!!\"\n\nHahaha! He actually yells \"AArrrgghh!!! My legs!!\"\n\n*********END SPOILERS*********\n\nYeah so, I reeeaaally wouldn't bother with this if you're after something of high quality. Go and rent Apocalypse Now or something."

While I've not seen all of the original Anthony Shaffer scripted film starring Christopher Lee (I can't remember it very well, but certain images and the overall manic Scottish-folk aspect stick out in my mind), I could imagine it at least being a somewhat original story. This new version, however, is cluttered with boring procedural business that is made all the more yawn-like (or befuddling, take your pick) by how Nicolas Cage's character- a cop who has no jurisdiction in this enclave of SummerIsle he's at- bungles from one place to the next looking for a little girl.\n\nAnd what does Neil LaBute do to make it more accessible to audience's today, those who might have found the original film too Scottish or weird or done practically as a witch-gazing musical? He amps it up with misogyny, which was not really in the Shaffer script, with Cage as the lone man against an entire colony of brainwashed \"B-words\" who have it coming to them when Cage lays the smack-down on them. Granted, there is something unintentionally hilarious seeing Nicolas Cage- at this stage in his long and lustrous career- punching out a woman while in a bear costume. But a lot of it is just... cruel, kind of, which apparently has been running around in LaBute's catalog of work (while not as strong in Nurse Betty, In the Company of Men has been charged with it).\n\nOne might consider it too ridiculous to seriously critique as nothing more than a below-average Hollywood-ized remake of another movie that fans hold so dear the only way to pay it tribute is to spend millions on a piece of quality, mediocre BS. But it's also from a director of certain prestige like LaBute, starring a bona-fide star like Cage, with supporting parts filled in by the likes of Ellen Burstyn, and it just all adds up to the embarrassment level. So much of this is just procedural crap, stuff of asking boring questions and boring (or just befuddling) scenes of inquiry or 'wacky' peril involving the bees, which by the (alternate) ending becomes the whole reason to see the movie.\n\nCertainly it's not for Cage, who doesn't even have the good graces to make it an awesomely-bad ride like he did with Ghost Rider. He grimaces and does non-emoting better (or worse) than anyone out there, and he's starting to go down peg after peg with his career of total duds (i.e. this, Ghost Rider, Next, Bangkok Dangerous) or safe hits (National Treasure). He needs something else of a challenge, not refashioned and almost worthless stuff like the Wicker Man to chew on, since he isn't untalented. Maybe a trip back to re-work the obvious plastic surgery and the hair-piece would do the trick as a *middle-aged man*."

The plot line was very interestingly done and it was definitely an innovative take on the ideas expressed. The ending was not expected (though left some plot holes) and I could really relate to Cage's character.\n\nThere were a lot of unanswered questions, but that, contrary to what most people say, is not a flaw. The loose plot ends are the beauty of this movie. Sure, it gets a little repetitive but the story is very intensely put together with character development and the emotions expressed throughout truly made this movie.\n\nOf course, it was not without its flaws. As I said, the scenes became a little repetitive, and some bits were unintentionally funny. Some bits you have to be as clever as me to actually understand, and so I would only recommend this film to people who truly appreciate things (which, I'm sorry to say, is not the majority of the movie-going public)."

Unfortunately the wicker man is the worst film I've seen this year. The acting in this movie is awful. For instance many characters have conversations which obviously contain relevant information for the viewers but normally would never be held because they would be totally irrelevant to the characters themselves. This movie is Neil LaBute's first thriller ever and maybe he should leave it this way because this film is at no time at all even the slightest bit thrilling. The few shocking moments the film does contain are rubbish too. It really is a shame that an actor such as Nicolas Cage manages to get himself such a (excuse the language) crappy role. The worst part about this movie is the ending and in addition I would like to award it with my personal \"Worst ending in ages\"-award! Curious he? See for yourself! (or spare yourself the time and money and look for a proper thriller)"

Ye Gods, what a disappointment! To be fair, both the plot (an over-complimentary term in this case) and the dialogue (I've seen better in a Desperate Dan comic) were abysmally bad, but Cage obviously decided to cope with their deficiencies by simply shouting as loud as he could. The rest of the cast didn't do any better, and the direction was formulaic; a *big* mistake in a remake of one of the most original and seminal films of the seventies.\n\nAnthony Shaffer and Robin Hardy can rest easy, this turkey won't be remembered for more than five minutes, and only that long because of how truly awful it is."

        "review_detailed_main": "I imagine that watching this movie is like getting a vodka enema: Largely pointless and quite painful.\n\nQuite honestly it is hard to put into words just how bad this movie is. Nicholas Cage is just about as wooden as it gets. Like Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds, his character is so tedious one can't help but be ambivalent as to their fate.\n\nThe movie trundles from one tedious scene to another in a story that makes very little sense and does nothing to capture the imagination. I was watching the movie at a friends house and it was honestly so bad I changed my mind about being the designated driver just so I could drink more. I had hoped that drinking more wine would make the movie more palatable. Sadly, it did not. Although it did make the movie pass slightly quicker which is a blessing. It's bad enough wasting two hours of your life, but it's far worse when those two hours seem like ten.\n\nBy the time I had started on my second bottle of red wine I began to laugh at some of the ridiculous scenes towards the end of the movie. But I can't help but think that the wine made the scenes more amusing than they really are. In reality the amusement came from caustic remarks from the others who were being subjected to this drivel as opposed to anything specific in the movie.\n\nIf you are planing to watch this movie, I suggest you do so at a friends house. That way you don't have to pay for it. I also strongly suggest a serious amount of alcohol to numb the pain.\n\nThis movie is a raspberry shaped turkey that actually makes Face Off and Battlefield Earth seem like half decent movies. Unless you are really in the mood for a terrible movie and have a sincere desire to squander two hours of your life, give this one a miss."

I mean this was just complete bull. What makes it so low.... Well sit back to read another horror review.\n\nThe whole concept of the Sergeant now being a detective and having an ex-girlfriend who is a resident on the island is ruined. Even the fact that the little girl is his daughter didn't do anything. It made matters worse. They ruined it totally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis film is a waste of time and anyone who watches this will soon get bored easily and not really care for the characters or the film itself. And also what the heck was that scene from the start, where the mother and kid get killed and then he has continuous flash backs!? Silly! I won't be watching this film ever again. I should have listened to IMDb this time, but I had a strong feeling this film would be excellent.\n\nIt's a 3/10 for me. Avoid at all COSTS!!!!"

Nicholas Cage was well cast and did a great job. The no-name actors are very convincing, and were a lot stronger than many female leads in other movies.\n\nThis leaves just one complaint vector -- the remake is not as good as the original (or doesn't slavishly follow the book). Who cares? Why is that an issue? Thomas Crown two is very different from TC1 -- and both are great movies.\n\nBook readers, get over yourself. By your \"logic\", The Shawshank Redemption is unfit for human consumption. Create iBOOKdb.com and be done with it.\n\nThis movie is for people who don't want to watch blood and guts horror movies.

No easy task, to be sure, as I like to think that every movie made has some redeeming quality. Even if a movie has horrible acting, that's not the writer's fault. That would be the fault of those casting the film, or the director. If there are plot holes, that could be the writer's fault, or it could the person doing the editing. However, when the movie makes no sense, has terrible acting, and leaves you feeling angry after watching it, then the question becomes - whose fault is it? Maybe everyone involved in the project royally screwed up. Or maybe it's my fault for watching it.\n\nIt was funny to see that the main review spoke of people being \"angry\" after watching this movie. I'm not sure what it was, but I have never been so infuriated after watching a film. My girlfriend (who slept through it) was surprised by my visceral reaction - but it appears that I was not alone!\n\nThis movie is absolutely terrible. It is made even more so by the fact that it has no reason to be, in that it cannot blame a lack of a budget on such things as bad costumes or acting.\n\n\"The Wicker Man\" very well might be the winner of the \"Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen\" contest. Bravo, Nick Cage, bravo. Bravi, bravi, bravissimi!"

However, it is a cool plot, Nick Cage and Ellen Burstyn seemed suitable for their respected roles, and maybe it would spark an interest in a new audience to check out the original, so I gave this film the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, none of the above was accurate.\n\nThe plot is slightly different, but every actor and actress in this film was mediocre at best. Cage and Burstyn were stale. Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee should be insulted. In fact the whole film looks like it was done in one take! Finally, if Kate Beahan does not win a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress, it shall be deemed the biggest injustice in cinematic history! So for those who are curious to see The Wicker Man, please heed this advice: Avoid the theatre and rent the original (try to find the extended version, though rare to locate). It has a superior cast and, quite simply, is miles upon miles more intense and disturbing than the remake could possibly try to be."

The beginning might leave you a little confused, but the moment you catch that horrible acting delivered by the police buddy you get a hint of what's to come: a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Many lines of dialog are sure to become cult classic, such as \"Phallic symbols, phallic symbols\", \"The bees are in my eyes\", \"How'd it get burned? X 4\", \"Step away from the bike\" and many others.\n\nIt could use a little trimming in the editing, but the slow moments are crucial to enhance the precision with which it walks on the fine line that separates farce from tragedy. Highly recommended to any film fan or to anybody looking for some (many) laughs."

But is really was that bad. The Wicker Man is another remake in a long line of films (Friday The 13, Halloween, and My Blood Valentine which wasn't that bad to name a few) being re-imagined these days. The Wicker Man offers nothing new and is just a weird movie unfortunately not in a good way from start to finish. Nicolas Cage who can show he's a gifted actor even feels like he's on autopilot through the whole movie. The rest of the supporting cast including some wasted cameos are okay in their roles but no one stands out. So I say skip The Wicker Man because it's not that very good. But if you want to see an entertaining horror film instead of a movie that disguises itself as one I suggest you go rent 30 Days Of Night or My Bloody Valentine. At least those are somewhat entertanining movies because The Wicker Man isn't unfortunately. The talents of Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast are wasted in a movie that should never have been remade in the first place. Who's dumb idea was it to make this anyway? Because The Wicker Man is nothing more than a lame attempt at a remake. Save yourself the time and money. Don't see it. You won't be missing much at all."

Lots of them. I've gone through 3-10 new movies a week for the past two years, and I thought I had seen rock bottom a few years back with \"Hostel\". Now, one thing I don't do is write reviews. Despite my passion for movies, this is actually my first one. The Wicker Man is something I was prepared to not only type a review over, but register into IMDb 3AM in the morning, while under influenza. From the bottom of my heart, I promise this is not exxageration, and I mean it to the full extent when I say - it's that bad."

The movie was pretty good until the last 15 minutes or so. It was weird, interesting and also had me on the edge of my seat because, I had no idea (along with the main character) what was going on sometimes because that is the nature of the story. OK... the ending sure seemed like they cut a lot of corners in the story telling and the finale leaves a bitter taste for antagonists in the story.\n\nIt didn't make any statements about Pagans or religion for that matter in my opinion, but did involve a matriarchial cult (meaning made up of women). It was entertaining and I think falls into the psychological thriller genre, that left me sitting in my seat... dumbfounded at the end and saying to myself... \"These women are really evil.\" and \"why do I now fear islands near Washington state?\""

        "review_detailed_main": "Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage), a California highway patrol officer, finds himself on the reclusive island of Summerisle looking for a lost girl after receiving a mysterious letter from a woman from his past (Kate Beahan). Nothing on the island appears to be quite what it seems and as his search hits dead end after dead end he grows more and more desperate.\n\nWhile watching The Wicker Man, I thought it was supposed to be a thriller with some comical elements thrown in since the film attempted to be scary and it was pretty funny. To my infinite amusement, the four genres listed on IMDb are drama, horror, thriller and mystery. I can't believe that a filmmaker (save Uwe Boll and Ed Wood) could fail so horribly at creating a horror film but Neil LaBute does just that. Well, I haven't seen the original but I'm willing to bet that some thought went into that production although I can't say the same thing here. The screenplay was awful, filled with horrible dialog and a bunch of silly sequences that will encourage laughter more than anything else. The story itself was interesting but the way they played it out was just silly and obvious.\n\nAfter a fast introduction of Cage's character, things quickly go downhill when he actually lands on the island. The residents are awful at lying and watching them interact with Cage's character was just annoying. So, the audience spends about an hour watching Cage search the island for clues and it's quite unexciting since it's really just him scaring himself and interacting with badly written characters. I really have no idea what the director was trying to accomplish here. He portrayed the women of Summerisle as all men hating, hard working and distant freaks. He portrayed Cage as a sturdy policeman but he wasn't able to see through them. Neil did have a good filming location and that island was pretty creepy since it had that fear of isolation and being unable to communicate with other people that weren't on the island. Besides for that, Neil pretty much threw in the towel on everything else.\n\nThe acting was awful and the absurdity of the dialog messed up all of the performances. Nicolas Cage was just terrible in the leading role. His facial reactions were over the top and his line delivery was very non convincing. Kate Beahan just had this wide eye look on her face throughout the entire thing and she easily gave the worst performance. Ellen Burstyn was shockingly horrible and this is one film she should not be remembered for. I used to like Leelee Sobieski but her performance here was pretty bad especially during her fight scene with Cage. Everyone else was bad but the previous four stand out as the worst of the bunch. Overall, The Wicker Man failed on many levels and it's not worth watching. Rating 3/10"

I watched a Youtube-video with the \"highlights\" of this train wreck and it sounded like a lot of unintentional fun. Sadly, only a small part of the movie is like that. For the most time you're left with a very boring film and wonder yourself why the hell you decided to watch this movie. (Exception: You're watching it with the rifftrax, because than it is a really hilarious film)\n\nA cop named Edward is traumatized after he couldn't save a little girl from a car accident and as he receives a letter from his ex-girlfriend asking for help, he sees his chance for atonement. So he goes to Summersilse looking for his ex-girlfriend's daughter, but not everything is as it seems...\n\nThe director for this film apparently wanted to give it a melancholy and deep touch, but he fails miserably and instead the movie just seems boring. The dialog isn't doing a lot to grab your interest either and something to lighten the mode only happens very rarely. Nicolas Cage is here at his craziest and even though he isn't very good in this movie, is the only saving grace. His madness was the only thing that kept me watching, because I was sure there would be another mad line of his. The other actors are pretty colorless and will be forgotten soon after.\n\nIt's not the worst film I've ever seen (Manos, Red Zone Cuba & others are way worse), but it's still quiet bad. Nicolas Cage delivers a few hilariously bad lines to save the movie from being rated worse"

How does all this relate to the disappearance and Edward?\n\n1973's \"Wicker Man\" is considered a classic by many folks, so it's quite surprising that a studio would want to remake this picture. Regardless of their motivation for doing so, in hindsight they probably should have considered some other project. Not only did this film lose a lot of money but it also has just managed to make it to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List! Despite this last distinction, I didn't think the film was particularly bad...though if you try to compare it to the original is comes up wanting and I can understand folks hating it.

The illogical, muddled narrative is full of false leads, false scares, red herrings and a twist finish that really isn't. The picture doesn't seem to have much of a point beyond equating power with sadism, or sexual preeminence with the ultimate religious fanaticism, but that lunkhead combination of proto-feminism with pagan worship results in nothing more than a ridiculous bait-and-switch.

It's tacky and unbelievable as a film. The horror of the original was that it played with your mind by luring you into the possibility that the events of the film could happen... The American remake is just stupid, and the only thing that grips you is your hands around your neck as you try to strangle yourself just to get away from Cage's wooden acting.\n\nAs an American, I can fairly say that British classics have to be left alone.

I recommend this only to the die-hard Wicker Man fans and the British, and that's only because it'll give them a chance to throw the heads back and laugh at what a joke Hollywood have made of their beloved British classic.\n\nI salute you, British film makers!

Possibly one of the worst remakes I ever saw, this film shows hardly any new imagination, despite the cast changing to American. I do not criticise people who have seen and enjoyed this movie. Everybody has a different taste in film and this is only one opinion.\n\nOne of the first failings it undertook was the fact that a remake cannot be made if the original is a cult classic. It is only a reason for Hollywood to show that they want to ruin a perfectly good film because they had no part in it being made.\n\nThe second failing was if they were not going to change the plot, to give it a slightly different twist and to make it 'new', what point is there on watching it. People who have seen the original won't have anything to look forward to.\n\nMy advice is, watch the original. Enjoy the original. Then if you are feeling bored, daring and got two hours to kill, see the remake."

It's really too bad - the plot starts off intriguing, but early on you feel as though there's just ... something missing somehow, and that's usually a bad sign. I kept waiting for this movie to save itself somehow, but it all just became too predictable, and there wasn't enough done to paint the 'baddies' of the film in a truly menacing or deeply sinister light, surprising indeed given what the actual plot turns out to be -- I never really felt intimidated by them; I just thought they were odd.\n\nIt wasn't the fault of the actors or actresses who all gave wonderful performances (although Nicolas Cage is somewhat controversial in this regard according to the forums for this film, I have always enjoyed watching him, though this one wasn't one of his best films). Instead, I lay blame to the screenwriter and the editor - sometimes no matter how much talent you have working on a project, if an editor pieces a film together poorly, there's nothing that can save it, and that's what seems to have happened in this case, which also explains why viewers feel much is missing from the film.\n\nIt's worth a look on DVD, perhaps, at least because the plot is somewhat interesting for a good part of the movie. Ultimately, though, save your cash and stay far away from this stinker. Why oh why can't someone make a truly great horror / suspense film anymore??"

Edward travels to the private island of Summerisle, where Willow lives in an odd community that plant fruits, and she reveals that Rowan is actually their daughter. Along his investigation with the hostile and unhelpful dwellers, Edward discloses that the locals are pagans, practicing old rituals to improve their harvest, and Rowan is probably alive and being prepared to be sacrificed. When he locates the girl, he finds also the dark truth about the wicker man.\n\nThe original \"The Wicker Man\" of 1973 is a simple and original dark story with a surprising end that hooks the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. This unnecessary remake is terrible and shameful, and Neil LaBute spoiled the magnificent 1973 screenplay. First, Nicolas Cage is unrecognizable, histrionic, performing an unpleasant and abusive character, punching women, interrupting a class without any education and so on. There are many ridiculous scenes, like for example with Edward Malus digging a grave or diving into the water wearing shirt, tie and jacket. The good cast is wasted in a laughable and boring flick, actually an insult to the wonderful British film. In my opinion, it is better off watching again the original movie and forgets this silly remake. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Sacrif\u00edcio\" (\"The Sacrifice\")"

This one has both.\n\nThe island is believable as a religious cult that is hostile to outsiders. If one would say, cults sacrificing humans aren't believable, I do not sign that. Unfortunately those have been practiced, and still are. Oh yeah, and seen so many horror movies, that are completely unbelievable.\n\nWhat comes to the plot, I did not expect it to turn as unfortunate to the cop (played by Cage), as it did. The conspiracy went deeper than it originally appeared. The end truly was surprising, I was expecting this is about saving the girl. But then a classic ending in horror movies is with the victims really meeting their bloody fate and the monsters surviving."

They were just waiting for their next paycheck. Second gripe I had with it was that the acting is terrible. I've never been much of a Cage fan and the rest of the cast weren't any better either. A good rule of thumb I go by is that if you can tell they are acting they aren't doing a good job. Good actors sell their roles and convince you. Needless to say I wasn't convinced. I'm not a very harsh critic and if a movie entertains me it did its job but when a movie is this blatantly bad it can make anybody a harsh critic. Overall, a poor movie. Just don't see it.

Also there is a constant flashback throughout the movie of the car accident in the first sense of the film but at the end of the flick I couldn't quite see the connection to the other events that go on.\n\nI also find it totally unbelievable that Cage starts the investigation on the island all by himself. He isn't even a detective so he has no jurisdiction to be wandering around, questioning people and sneaking around in their houses.\n\nEven though the ending is quite surprising and might shock the viewer a bit, it still doesn't make up for the 90 minutes of rubbish that already struck you.\n\nSummary: The trailers and posters of the \"The wicker man\" are just like an image of a MC Donalds Big Mac on a billboard.

What I got was a slickly filmed and credibly spooky horror, which was sufficiently different to the original as to hold my attention until the climax.\n\nAs already stated in a review here, the scenery and cinematography is stunning, and although I didn't think the plot was quite as clever as the original, the professional style of the acting and filming more than made up for it. God bless Hollywood!\n\nNot quite as haunting as the original, but is this because I'd seen it before? Well, that can never be known, but whether or not you saw the Edward Woodward version (and as this film makes clear - it is after all Woodward's film when all's said and done) this film is an intriguing way to spend an enjoyable couple of hours without disappointment.

Anyway that is enough, for I am not going to try comparing the film to this dross. Both this and the Psycho remakes were completely unnecessary and awful on their own terms, but if I had to edge out which was worse, Psycho but that is not saying much.\n\nThis remake of The Wicker Man may be glossy, it may be expensive, but guess what? In my opinion, it was completely and utterly pointless as well. It was hilarious but for all the wrong reasons, whether it is the meaningless plot change about Nicolas Cage's character being allergic to bees or the finale, which was way overdone in the sense I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nThe film certainly looks glossy and expensive, but that's the thing, they overdo it with the visuals as well so it all looks flashy with no sense of melancholy or menace underneath. And I can't count the number of scenes that were dumbed or dulled down, even the pagan May Day rituals weren't that convincing, not to mention the plot, dull, thin and meandering. The script is sorely lacking as well the dialogue at worst was absolutely laughable, as is the direction, and I was not impressed by the acting either. Nicolas Cage is an uninspired lead literally sleepwalking through his role, while Kate Beahan and Ellen Burstyn(who was so brilliant in Requiem for a Dream) can't do anything with their characters, no surprise seeing as the script leaves them little to work with.\n\nOverall, a real mess of a remake with next to no redeeming qualities. The bottom line is give it a pass and watch the far superior original instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

There are many youtube videos documenting the badness of the movie showing the various (non- intentionally) hilarious scenes. These scenes which endows the film with a certain quality that is lacking in other bad movies. The fact that it has one of the greatest actors ever (Nicolas Cage) add to the quality of the movie in making the horrible lines of dialogue being delivered with absolute conviction."

Sure aim for a broader audience but you still have all that unused footage and what about the time spent shooting all that footage?\n\nIf you reckon you want a film to have a PG-13 rating, then make the film to suit the standards needed, don't turn it into sushi."

Where was I when the world descended back to the dark ages?!? It seems that as soon as the plot of a movie goes beyond 'random people getting killed by evil monsters for 90 minutes but in the end a man with latex tights, calling himself Superman, will save the day' , people will get bored as in the movie has no potential because YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FOLLOW A STORYLINE IN ORDER TO ENJOY IT! It seems that the only thing that the masses will get off on is complete and utter PORNOGRAPHY because it's the easiest and least resource-demanding product of entertainment. I ask you, what happened??? It has been going on for quite some time now. You can see it in all the new comedies, horror-movies and even action, thriller and (i'm crying when i say this) Drama for gods sake. Wherever you turn it's over-exaggeration of idiotic moments.\n\nI could have accepted a shining 5/10 score on a movie like 'The Hills Have Eyes' which carries absolutely nothing more than OLD NEWS, but for crying out loud, when people start badmouthing movies that are actually not bad at all - ....... I'm at a loss for words! Compared to the utter s*** that's been poring out of the US movie-scene recently this move should win an Oscar.\n\nI was going to give this movie 6/10 points after I had seen it but after I had seen 'The Wicker Man's' score here on IMDb I decided to give it 7/10. One extra for proving a point. Dear god people... read a book!\n\nPS- I'm confident most of you idiots don't even understand what I'm talking about because you're too busy eating Hamburgers..\n\nPPS- I appologise to every single person who shares my beliefs.

        "review_detailed_main": "I admit, I had high hopes for this film. I'm a huge fan of the original and I thought it would be an interesting remake. These days people are more aware of their spirituality and alternative religious beliefs than they were in 1973 when the original came out. Secondly I was excited about Neil Labute directing given that I just saw The Shape of Things and loved it. I wasn't excited but not thrilled about the cast. The first 15 minutes were horrid, everything from the Everything's OK tapes (why did they take them anyways?)to Officer Ed picking up the doll on his speeding bike (I turned to my buddy and we both let out a unanimous 'you got to be *beep* me'). I liked that the film wasn't a scene for scene remake like Psycho, or The Omen. I did like some of the changes that were made, Cage's character having a relationship with Willow, in the original Willow is the landlord's daughter and temptress of the town and has no connection to Sgt. Howie other than her attempt to seduce him. In the original the society is pagan, replaced with a feminist society, female empowerment. Which I thought okay, I see where there going with this. The way I understand the Pentagram in the Pagan beliefs(not the pentacle) is it's shape and points of the stars refer to elements, fire ,water, earth, etc. but also has a strong connotation femininity and strength. I'm not an expert but this is what I've gathered from research and readings. Unfortuanately, a really interesting concept wasn't even explored in the film, the connections were there but poorly explained and vague. Also the bees? Cage's character is allergic and the island happens to be rich in bee hives for it's their main crop and I'm guessing it had something to do with female empowerment, queen bee things like that but once again, really fricking vague! It seems like Niel Labute really hates women and the whole movie is trying to point out how women are manipulating and evil creatures, men are just their minions. It's why I dubbed this film 'The Shape of the Wicker Man', see The Shape of Things and you'll know what I mean. The thing that I hated most about the film was how the entire film is changed and modernized and what not but the ending is still the same as the original! The ending is not at all consistent with the rest of the film! So instead of being shocking, eerie and effective like the classic 73 film, it's just preposterous and riddiculus, not to mention the 6 month later scenario, just absurd. The thing that made the movie as bad as it was is how unintentionaly funny it was, I was laughing so hard which is unfortuanate because the film is supposed to be a drama. Nick Cage wearing a bear suit and decking an old lady has to be the funniest thing I've ever seen, not to mention the line 'Killing me won't bring back your God Damn honey!' I think the whole audience was holding it's side from lauging so hard. I guess I'm glad I saw it just to cure my curiosity but it's an insult to the original film and one of the worst films I saw this summer."

        "review_detailed_main": "Fortunately for me, I didn't see the original 1973 version, so I was not burdened by undue expectations upon entering the theater. I am giving this film a 7, although just barely, perhaps 6.5 would be more fair. Like most films these days, yes, the plot is flimsy and it requires an extra dose of suspended disbelief.\n\nBut I enjoyed it because it held my interest completely for the whole 2 hours. It built up the suspense very nicely. It was a who-dunnit mystery that turned out not to be such a mystery after all. I did see it coming, but not from afar, as is the case in most movies. If you think this plot is transparent, then go see the Illusionist: no illusion there(but I still liked it).\n\nFabulous scenery, good mystery, loads of suspense. AND very, very creepy. Plus lots of good, silly laughs, which I think is a good thing in a mystery/suspense/horror-lite film. Throw in some very sexy performances by Kate Beahan, and Leelee Sobieski and you have a winner as far as I am concerned!!\n\nIt is a very typical Nick Cage performance. He honed his on-screen persona by the time he was in \"Leaving LasVegas,\" and it hasn't varied much since then, which is bad or good depending on how well you like it. As usual, he is manly, impassioned,and valiant, yet confused, full of self-doubt, and vulnerable. I have to say that this wasn't one of his best performances, but the script had a lot to do with that. Very weak dialogue. They should have hired me to brush it up ;) When he delivered the line, \"Step back from the bike!\" I must confess I was taken aback. There are a lot of actors who would have ad-libbed something more appropriate there, or just outright refused to say it. I wonder what Brando would have done? Probably just mumbled something incoherent. At the risk of being arrested as a security threat, I have to say that I, nevertheless, enjoyed this Cage performance far more than his \"World Trade Center\" performance. Now that was really painful!\n\nSo, it was just a beautiful movie to watch,and good escapist entertainment. A pleasant way to pass the time. You really can't expect every film to be a masterpiece.\n\nFor those numerous reviewers, who said \"Worst movie I ever saw,\" I say, check the current theater listings: \"Accepted,\" \"Beerfest,\" \"Material Girls,\" \"Idlewild,\" \"Trust the Man,\" \"Snakes on a Plane,\" \"How to Eat Fried Worms,\" \"Factotum,\" \"Invincible,\" \"The Barnyard,\" and \"Lady in the Water.\" Not a single one in the bunch is better than Wicker Man, and most of them are far worse. Worst movie, ever? Not even the worst this week, not by a long shot! Get real!"

His actor screaming is also incredibly off putting and made me want to laugh.\n\nI really thought that the idea of the film was good hence why I have gave it 3 stars.

        "review_detailed_main": "A lot of people were disappointed with this movie who hadn't actually seen the original film. After all, you have an otherwise good director, Neil Labute, who made other brilliant films such as \"Nurse Betty\" and \"Your Friends and Neighbors\", and you had Academy Award winners Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn. Plus, Burstyn was brilliant in the best horror film of all time, \"The Exorcist\" (1973). With this impressive roster of talent (and that's not even the whole list), this remake should have been really good.\n\nFor people who had seen the original movie, like me, this remake came as an even larger disappointment. After all, the original 1973 film was a brilliant movie. The reason it was so scary was because there could easily have been a separate island like Summerisle in real life, and human sacrifices could, and probably do, still take place in some countries. However, if the original movie had weaknesses, it was in the surprising number of plot holes that could have been explained but weren't. Going into this movie, I thought if the American remake would do anything right, it would at least patch up some of those plot holes.\n\nNeedless to say, for every plot hole the American remake tried to cover up, at least two more opened up in the form of faulty logic and further unexplained events. For instance, why were there twins on the island? And if there was no electricity on the island, how did Summerisle have their own web page? Why didn't the male inhabitants ever talk? And last but not least, what was the significance of the car crash in the beginning of the film which supposedly cost the life of the jaded girl in the car? Those are just a few of the events that remained unexplained even after the film's conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, Nicholas Cage's character didn't seem to be very logical himself. In a failed attempt to make this film into a suspense/action thriller, they had him do stupid things like diving into water to retrieve a body that's obviously dead, or wandering into a dark barn when he thinks he heard someone wandering around. Cage's character lacks both healthy fear and common sense, and it makes this film unintentionally campy.\n\nWithout giving too much away, the ending was surprisingly disappointing as well. All I will say is that it ended in a similar fashion to the original, which is good because I initially thought it would have a happy, cop-out ending. But the #1 thing that made the original Wicker Man ending scary was absolutely ignored in this movie. The original ending to the 1973 movie was made scarier because of the townspeople's reaction to the Wicker Man burning. In this movie, they seem far more jaded, and the scary effect doesn't work at all.\n\nIn fact, this movie was so flawed, that when I went to see it opening weekend at the movie theater, the audience was laughing all the way through it. It's unfortunate too, because you can't take this movie seriously when Cage punches a woman in the face, then steals her bear suit. This movie has proved itself to be more unintentionally funny than \"Mommie Dearest\".\n\nThis version of \"The Wicker Man\" could have been a whole lot better in so many ways. It's unfortunate too, because I really like Nicholas Cage. If you don't want to be too disappointed, see the original \"Wicker Man\" first. The plus side to this movie coming out is that the original is no longer so hard to find on DVD. Now you can find that version in most stores. As for this version, well, I think most of the people involved in making this film know how much better they could have done."

So to explain my 4 stars it was for the cinematography and sound cause they are both great. The digital effects are good but really out of place. Everything else is terrible. The magic of movie making was lost 25 minutes into the film and in the beginning of the \"third act\" LaBute (the director, really?) just gives up trying to keep the viewer scared or emotionally invested at all. BUT IT IS SO DAMN FUNNY SOMETIMES. i don't want to give anything away but it is one of the funniest (clearly unintentional) movies i've seen in a while. Especially when Nick Cage just starts randomly throwing knockout haymakers at every woman he sees. O and he's in a bear suit for that part, for no apparent reason. Overall... pretty bad."

        "review_detailed_main": "I'm fed up of reading comments from people that start 'i left this movie half way through.' If that's true, then you didn't watch the movie properly and your opinion is pretty much useless.\n\nGoing to see this film as a huge fan of the original, I found it in turn original, disappointing, frustrating, clever and sweetly respectful of its source material. Quite a mixed collection of feelings.\n\nThere were enough deviations from the original to make it a valid film in its own right, so I'll completely avoid the ultimately pointless 'why do Hollywood keep doing remakes' argument. There is nothing new under the sun. However, what was a little disappointing:\n\n1) as a film that could make the most of unsettling its audience by focusing on bizarre and unusual pagan rituals and beliefs, it relied too much on bog-standard 'Cage is trapped underwater', 'Cage is falling through loose flooring' action/jump scenes. 2) all elements of the belief/faith and the erotic, and therefore the crucial links between sex, temptation, testing and purity are overshadowed by a fairly shallow feminist pretence. Sex and sexiness are replaced by the red herring of sexual politics. Duff move, especially with such beautiful leading ladies. 3) The wonderful folk soundtrack of the original (which added to its creepy earthiness and ancient tradition) has been replaced by a fairly lacklustre orchestral score, with oddly pointless whispering. While I didn't expect the same songs, here was potential for something far more daring. 4) Nobody, man or woman, was ever going to do a better job of the Lord Summerisle/Lady Summersisle role than Christopher Lee.\n\nThings that were good about it? Well, it may be a remake, but it's not a plot that's been done often, so there's still a sense of surprise, fear and originality to it. I would certainly class it as a thriller rather than a horror, so i guess the lack of tension is slightly disappointing. However, there's loads of recreated shots and subtle in-jokes that will tickle fans of the original. Even more satisfying in some ways are the references to Nic Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' (the original Wicker Man played as the B-Movie to 'DLN' in the UK.) So, cue blind old ladies(with implied psychic powers), red coats, lost little girls running in the shadows etc.\n\nUltimately, enough has been changed to make this film worth watching in its own right. The script is patchy, but Cage is not half as bad as some say - in fact at points, he is excellent). It honours the original's startling climax (although dumbs it down rather by setting up for a sequel) and while it won't ever be regarded as a classic, it will hopefully enable a new generation to discover the horror and comedy and beauty of the true original."

The set up for it was ridiculous, Nic wonders through a large open expanse looking up into the sky for no apparent reason and bumps directly into a bee hive, but he's in the middle of 100's of hive. Oh noes !! Seriously, c'mon - he must have really been looking at the sky very intently to get into that situation.\n\nThe female lead was also woeful - how can you not pick up on her suspicious behaviour or her paper-thin attempts at lying.\n\nAwful.. that said I saw the score on IMDb and wanted to watch it to see if it was that bad.

Don't put yourself or your friends through the torture of what will put you in a bad mood for days.\n\nMy reasons for this are the following; the storyline is poor, acting was mediocre, had potential but was wasted with the poorest of endings.\n\nAnd by poor I mean really poor, this is what put the nail in the coffin.\n\nI haven't actually seen the original, but from the other reviews I think that may be worth watching, so looking forward to getting that.\n\nI pray to God though, that it is infinitely better than this version.\n\nOnce more, please keep your distance."

        "review_detailed_main": "I have been an avid fan of the original for years. I was one of the people who petitioned Anchor Bay to release it on DVD. That being said, Nicholas Cage has single-handedly done the biggest blasphemy to any film I've ever witnessed.\n\nSPOILERS I walked out of this \"remake\" last night so utterly appalled that I nearly demanded my money back. Everything about it was terrible. Cage's acting couldn't have been worse. Here's my rant about the story and characters: The original: Willow McGregor is the Landlord's Daughter (the man who runs the Green Man Inn) who is seen as a goddess (portrayed by Britt Eckland). The remake: Willow Woodward (I'm assuming the last name is an homage to Edward Woodward who portrayed Neil Howie, the police officer in the original) is somehow the ex-love of Cage's police officer character who now has a daughter who is missing that he must find. The original character is somehow taken over by a less-than-enthusiastic Leelee Sobiesky. The original: Rowan Morrison is the girl who is missing, she is the daughter of May Morrison who runs the local sweet shop/post office. The remake: it's the bees/honey crop that fails. The original: it's the apple crop that fails. The remake: set on an island off Pugit Sound called Summersisle (they added an \"s), a neo-pagan \"sisterhood\" of women rules. Sister Summersisle is played by Ellen Burstyn. The original: set on a small Scottish island of Summerisle, a neo-pagan community rules. Lord Summerisle is played by Christopher Lee. The remake: the maypole outside the school is shown but not used, and the teacher is a complete b****. The original: the maypole has a whole song and dance dedicated to it and the teacher offers a lot of information on their society. The remake: Ellen Burstyn is a whispy ruler who is almost too nice at times and lives in a weird bee mansion. The original: Chrisopher Lee is pleasant but rules with an iron fist and lives in a classic Scottish/British mansion. The remake: Nicholas Cage turns in a horrid performance as an out-of-luck police officer who tries to find his daughter and ends up in a trap in which he becomes the sacrifice. The original: Edward Woodward turns in a tour-de-force performance as a Christian officer dealing with Pagans and genuinely interested in helping the girl who has supposedly been kidnapped. He suffers the same fate, burned alive in the Wicker Man. The remake: the whole community is in on the plot, but they are more into creeping Cage out than offering him any real insight into their culture. The original: the whole community is in on the plot, but they're doing it as a classic festival in celebration of the Celtic god of the orchard and goddess of the field. The original ends with the Wicker Man crumbling and the villagers singing the folk song \"Summer Is A-Cumin' In.\" The remake ends after the Wicker Man tumbles and then Leelee Sobiesky and Willow end up recruiting more men for their little plot. There are many more, but I don't feel like going on an even bigger tirade.\n\nThis is a testament of why movies should NOT be remade. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of himself."

Besides the acting they threw in some stupid plot lines that I don't recall being in the original.Then I get to my biggest problem, why in gods name is Nick Cage still being hired to star in movies. Nick Cage is the same character in every single movie the only actor in my eyes that is worse then Cage is Megan Fox and at least she is attractive and not a 40 something year old actor with fading talent. All in all I would not recommend this film to anyone unless your the kind of person who enjoys crappy re-makes of good movies and I know there are some of you out there. -S.o.t93"

        "review_title": "The Wicker Man: Demoralisingly Hideous",
        "review_detailed_main": "The horror genre, at least in modern times, seems primarily hinged upon a number of fundamental tendencies. Of these, perhaps the most prevalent is the remake mentality, spawning an apparently incessant flow of reboots and rehashes of the successful horrors of times gone by. Many will argue for the justification of such remakes on the basis that the original films are now little known to the public en masse, a criterion arguably well-applied to The Wicker Man, its combined statuses as Scottish, cult, and from the 1970s making it ripe for a modern updating.\n\nSummoned by his ex-fianc\u00e9 to the remote Washington island of Summersisle in order to search for her missing daughter, Edward Malus finds the task complicated by the unhelpful villagers, their unusual beliefs in a feministic paganism angling them against his intrusive inquisitions.\n\nAn argument frequently put forward against the remake culture which dominates contemporary mainstream horror is that it is only films which originally failed that should be remade, their flaws addressed and remedied through new ideas and technologies. The term classic is employed for a reason, the films therewith identified revered precisely for their few problems, leaving little to improve upon. This is certainly the side of the argument which grows ever more convincing when watching the 2006 take on The Wicker Man. Where in 1973 we were met with the ardent fervour of Edward Woodward, here we are given instead the errant histrionics of Nicolas Cage, a man now almost unanimously accepted to be poisonous to the good name of cinema. Apparently unsure of which of his two stock personalities to call upon\u2014those being his dull, near-comatose \"dramatic\" and his absurd over-the-top action persona\u2014Cage flitters blindingly between both, producing a performance that is staggering in its lunacy. Whether commandeering a bicycle at gunpoint or punching a woman in the face whilst masquerading as a bear, every moment we are subjected to his untamed hysteria is wince- inducingly awful. It should come as no surprise, considering the above described events in the film's narrative, that the script is little better than the efforts of those hired to interpret it. In its original form, The Wicker Man was a wonderfully strange and hypnotic exploration of the despotism and oppressiveness of religiously-oriented society expressed primarily through the interactions of the Christian policeman and the pagan lord. Interestingly, much of these characters' dialogue is preserved for the remake, though in the mouths of Cage and Ellen Burstyn \u2014Christopher Lee's counterpart, bizarrely\u2014it has none of the wit or dramatic resonance. What is uninteresting, and the final disheartening straw, is that the description \"Christian policeman\" no longer applies, Malus' religion never discussed whatsoever, leaving the clash of cultures and ideologies absent entirely, and thereby adding theme, purpose, and any kind of meaning to the list of items in which this film lacks. Without subtext, and with a notably fatuous and feeble plot, what remains in this story? Here's a hint: it starts with \"no\", and ends with \"thing\".\n\nLacking in even the cheap scares many of its fellow horror remakes offer, The Wicker Man is simply dreadful in every way imaginable. A film this demoralisingly hideous is one thing, but to be so in attempting to recreate the magisterial splendour of a true genre great is a cinematic atrocity. If ever there was proof of the foolishness of remaking classics, this is it: definitive evidence that there is no facet as great as originality."

Even if you're not familiar with the original Wicker Man, this is poor stuff.\n\nI don't think Nicholas Cage is much of an actor at the best of times, but here he is really plumbing the depths. (I don't want to be rude to the man - but isn't he beginning to look like Frankie Howerd just before he started wearing a hairpiece?) Kate Beahan is even worse than him, and Ellen Burstyn can't save anything from the carnage. La Bute's buddy Aaron Eckhart does the best thing he can in the circumstances - he says his one line... and then vanishes, never to reappear.\n\nThe film has no real mystery or tension about it; the opening scene (Nicholas Cage on a wretched motorbike yet again!) involving the car crash is never properly explained. The 'community' is unconvincing in the extreme, much less so than in, for instance, 'The Village.' Cage blundering through a field full of beehives batting off a bunch of angry bees is truly risible; by the time he's donning a bear costume, you'll be laughing your head off.\n\nOne question: does Neil La Bute have a thing against men? He shows 1) how crass and sexist they are (In The Company of Men) 2) how easily they can be tricked and made fools of by women (The Shape Of Things) and 3) come to their just rewards in a world where women call all the shots.\n\nConclusion: a bore, and a misconceived project in the first place. Watch the original first."

        "review_detailed_main": "Well I have to be honest and say that this needless remake wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Of course, we really didn't need a new version of The Wicker Man, but in it's own right; this 2006 version is an ineptly hilarious take on Robin Hardy's original and if nothing else, I'm sure that even die hard fans of the original would have to admit that seeing Nicholas Cage running around in a bear suit beating women up is funny. Of course, it would have been a lot funnier if he wasn't doing it under the title of The Wicker Man. Naturally, the film has been Americanized and the action has moved from a Scottish island to one in the Pacific. Nicholas Cage's copper, Edward Malus, witnesses a horrific traffic accident and is then invited to the island after finding out that he has a daughter on there and she has gone missing. However, when he gets there it would seem that things aren't quite right with the island. All the authority figures are women for a start, and everyone pretends not to have heard of the girl, despite evidence to the contrary...\n\nThere were two principal things that made the original great; the character of Sergeant Howie and the mysterious atmosphere. This film lacks both elements, as Cage's copper is too ridiculous and pathetic to be likable, while the atmosphere is replaced by a series of odd events that don't really hold much interest. Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle has been replaced by Ellen Burstyn's Sister Summersisle, and somehow we don't get the same effect. There is a whole load of ridiculous dialogue and stupid goings on in this film, and its great fun to watch. Seeing Cage go round forcing all the children to take off their masks and kicking one of the sisters in the face really is hilarious, and it's hard to believe that the people involved in this film were really taking it seriously. This is the first film I've seen from Neil LaBute, but I've heard he's a credible director so I'm guessing he got paid well. Cage also has a producer's credit for this film, however, so it would seem that this remake is more his show than LaBute's. The ending is intact, but rather than being horrifying as it was in the original; this time it's just a way for the film to end. The Wicker Man remake is not a good film, but I actually had fun watching it. Recommended if you want a good laugh!"

While I found Cage's delivery of his lines more akin to an American action movie than to the original Wickerman, such heavy use of the original script meant I could compare lines to the original film which I enjoyed doing.\n\nThe impact of the 1973 Wickerman, for me, came from 3 elements within the movie:\n\nFirstly, the islanders religious beliefs. There is a complete lack of exploration into the islanders beliefs instead portraying them as a 2 dimensional cult. Without understanding their religious motivations the realism of the film is lost.\n\nSecondly the outward 'normalness' of the original islanders and their lives outwith religious beliefs and practices. I felt their portrayal in the remake leant somewhat on slightly modified cultural tropes, in particular mainstream understandings of the Amish community in so much as islanders all wore similar clothing and seemed to shun modern technology in their lives. It was easy to imagine the original islanders coming across to the mainland and blending in with the society around them, in the remake this isn't so.\n\nFinally the main characters. The original's Sergeant Howie, while a somewhat aloof character, is unique and believable. He is a model of Scottish Presbyterian attitudes which influence his outlook and interactions. Anyone of a certain age living in Scotland has met a Howie type character in their lives. Unfortunately in their efforts to make Nicolas Cage's character more vulnerable and approachable, 'Edward Malus' becomes instantly forgettable. Some of the acting felt out of place at times, for instance towards the end Nicolas Cage indulges in some violent and aggressive outbursts, several young women in white dresses get punched in the face without any real reason. Ellen Burstyn's Sister Summersisle is fine but, given Christopher Lee's masterful portrayal of Lord Summerisle in the original, his star outshines hers.\n\nOverall, as a remake I've judged largely against the light of the original rather than in its own right. That being said, the 2006 Wickerman certainly lacks the impact and authentic feel of the 1970s version. For those watching the remake without having seen the original, I'm sure it comes across as a reasonably entertaining, if standard, American thriller. There are some nice hat tips to the original, particularly through the naming of some characters. I did wonder towards the end if it would have been better for the film makers to have made a more original Wickerman inspired piece rather than a direct remake. Overall, as film it is ok. As a remake it is poor."

Did he owe Lucifer something? This is BAD. REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD. So bad I almost died laughing at the absurdity of the the trainwreck on the screen. Good God Nicolas, come on!!! Take some time off and remember the days where your talent actually won you a well deserved Oscar. Please do not EVER utter these phrases on screen: \"How did it get burned? How did it get burneddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd?\" and the immortal \"Not he beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!\" Finally, what the hell is Ellen Burstyn doing in this, one of the finest actresses of all time? Did she kill scads of bees and had to atone for it by appearing in this mess?"

Nicolas Cage is an excellent actor but he could not bring this one off.\n\nMy advice to all would be to save your time and your money and get a copy on VHS or DVD. The original cut is on an old VHS cassette. There are various DVD versions ranging from a butchered 88 minute version to a 102 minute. Go for the 95 min or 102 min versions if you can.\n\nBy the way, the original soundtrack is great."

Perhaps the dialogue of the original version was more intelligent. Or perhaps I was somewhat in love with Diane Cilento back then. Not sure.

I mean, you get to see Nic Cage do a bunch of wacky stuff like wear a bear suit. I mean, what more do you need? Nicolas Cage shows that he can portray really any role, from something like The Wickerman, to serious roles such as Leaving Las Vegas. People say that Cage's career went down with roles like this, but in reality, it shows how capable of an actor he is. He can be serious in some scenes, to absolutely crazy in another. This is shown best in this movie. From a serious conversation, to the outrageous, infamous \"bee scene.\" It shows the Cage's skill as an actor, and he can really portray any kind of character."

        "review_detailed_main": "Negative reviewers make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of \"The Wicker Man\" out to be an incredulous turkey on the level of \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and \"American Beauty,\" but it's simply not the case.\n\nFirst of all, let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes, it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths, including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like \"How Do\" song & dance is a definite highlight), but it's not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing, the protagonist, Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward), is annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a Pharasaical tighty-righty (which is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition, Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in \"Wicker Man\" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull manner; the plot itself is interesting, but the delivery isn't.\n\nWoodward is so unlikable and annoying that, on some subconscious level, I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be, but somehow it wasn't.\n\nOne last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it.\n\nTHE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fianc\u00e9's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards, pagan and matriarchal; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses, Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.\n\nWHAT WORKS: Unlike Woodward, Cage is likable as the protagonist (or, at least, we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women we understand what has driven him to such actions.\n\nThe British Columbian locations are good, pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.\n\nEllen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until an hour into the film and she comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.\n\nMolly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly, in particular, has a very unique allure. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original, but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.\n\nThe story is generally entertaining, sometimes fun and, at times, unintentionally amusing. For instance, the scene where Cage talks with the \"barmaid\" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: \"STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!\", running around in a bear costume, the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock, numerous hilarious lines like \"OH NO, NOT THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!!\", etc.). Despite this, the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original, by contrast, was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.\n\nThe ending is horrifying (more so than the original), even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes, the bees would've killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.\n\nIn the theatrical version there's a \"6 months later\" coda tacked on, which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story, \"When you leave, take me with you.\" This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.\n\nWHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless, but adds to the mounting mystery. Also, the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nSome people may look down on the film because of the unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THIS REVIEW!\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of \"The Wicker Man\" are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are, of course, a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like \"Psycho\" people complain, and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade, and this is a quality updating. It's worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy elements. On top of this, there are amusing elements. And, thankfully, the protagonist isn't some irritating legalist with a corncob stuck up his arse.\n\nThe film runs 102 minutes.\n\nGRADE: B"

        "review_detailed_main": "It is a real shame that this disaster will likely play a part in the downfall of potentially intelligent and interesting horror films coming out of the Hollywood wasteland.\n\nThe acting is nothing, the plot is not in the least intriguing (the original was suspenseful and a disorientating roller-coaster on first viewing), and there emerges simply no point or reason for this film to exist. I was angry sitting in the theatre, a Cage fan (though now nearly a former fan) wondering why in the world he did this? Obviously I had seen the original, and just this afternoon bought a DVD of the original and watched it. And you know what? These people were crazy to remake it! Some remakes make sense. Really, they do. But here? It's completely out of context this new one! The original is timeless.\n\nThe new WICKER MAN is poorly done -- the mystery doesn't exist, the director is a \"smack you in the face with contemporary issues kind of guy\" with no nuance, and he's completely wrong for this film. He did well with IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, but how in the world, by any bizarre stretch, can that be connected to THE WICKER MAN? It is ludicrous! Others have made that point in a variety of ways, please read their reviews for elaboration.\n\nCage should make a PUBLIC APOLOGY to any fans he has left at this point. You know, people who appreciate that he got behind cool movies like, say, SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE. He should hold it at that castle he bought, dressed in his best Elvis style leather jacket, and simply apologize for what stupid idea this was. He'd win back a lot of good will that way.\n\nAre you reading this, Nicholas? Do the right thing and gain some respect back! Nobody cares about the crappy Bruckheimer movies, you took the money and that's cool, but this is something that requires a public apology."

Full of misogyny, lines that are completely unintentional howlers, every horror movie clich\u00e9 you can imagine, and a performance by Ellen Burstyn so awful that you'll wonder how she was ever nominated for an Oscar, let alone allowed to be in films. When the ending of your movie has your character punching out a giant fat woman, stealing her bear costume from her, and prancing along to save a little girl from a bunch of other people dressed up in animal costumes, you know you've got a stinker. Not only that, but it's from everyones favorite woman hater, Neil Labute. Hey, Neil, still scared of girls? That's too bad, maybe some day you will no longer fear the cooties. The original Wicker Man was an absolute laugh riot as well (the art school crowd will tell you it's really, really DEEP, but don't listen to them), but at least it sort of knew it was bad...I think. So, I guess I can recommend this film as an evening of laughs, but don't go in expecting anything scary."

        "review_detailed_main": "First The Ring, then The Italian Job, then The Grudge... now The Wicker Man! When I first saw the trailer for this film, I honestly thought it was a joke. I mean, who would be so stupid as to try and remake a brilliant classic horror like The Wicker Man? Well, it turns out they really weren't joking, but I wish they had have been!\n\nThere are certain films that no one should ever remake. The Wicker Man is one of them. I thought, however, this film would be much like The Omen remake and would be a word for word replica of the original, which would not be as bad, but may just invite a new generation of younger cinema goers to watch the original film, which in 99% of the time, is better than the remake. Wrong! They changed almost the entire story, with the island mainly being run by women, under the leadership of Sister Summersisle. Where did Christopher Lee's character go? Everybody knows that Lord Summerisle is the best character in the original!\n\nAnd what were they thinking casting Nicolas Cage in the part that is unbelievably similar to Edward Woodward's? Nicolas, you're not a great actor at the best of times. Maybe you should just keep to films where you can just pout and display no discernible acting skills whatsoever? I think that would be best for all.\n\nI've heard some people describe this as a sequel, rather than a remake. To those of you that are thinking that, why make a film that is similar to the original in far too many ways to be distinguishable from it? If this is indeed what the filmmakers where thinking, they should step aside, and allow writers with actual talent to write screenplays from now on.\n\nHonestly, this film is just a 100 minute waste of your life, and if you are a true fan of the original, you'll just leave the cinema feeling cheated and sick to you stomach.\n\nAnd just a quick suggestion to the people who made this film, and indeed, to Hollywood in general, if you have run out of ideas, stop making films. Don't just take other people's films and remake them into horrible monstrosities and try to pass them off as films. Its not working!"

        "review_detailed_main": "I absolutely hated the original version of THE WICKER MAN down to the absolute ridiculous plot holes but to give Neil LaBute credit he does at least try to bring credibility to this remake by setting up the story via a policeman receiving a letter from a woman he knew at the community he grew up in many years ago . Compare this to the completely idiotic way the story is set up in the original and some respect to also trying to rid the original screenplay of its other plot holes like confining the number of crop failures to a mere one in this version\n\nI'm afraid that there will be no more praise for LaBute in this short review because managing to salvage something out of a remake of a very poor film is like trying to find something bad to say about Adolph Hitler because this is still a very tedious , poor thriller . It's maybe not as bad as many people have said but that's hardly strong praise from me is it ? Nicholas Cage seems to have appeared in many films spliffed out of his mind and this is the worst performance of his idiosyncratic style . No offence but if you're casting a film is it not essential that your leading man is fully conscious in a starring role ? Honestly Cage gives a whole new meaning to sleepwalking . Having said that the painfully overlong shot length hasn't helped proceedings and I could hardly stay awake watching this because everything is written and shot at a snail's pace and while LaBute has written out many plot holes he has clumsily introduced some of his own like a mobile phone failing to work when the story demands it . Wouldn't it have been better to have set the story in a region where mobile's don't work due to their remote location instead of the hero suddenly getting a phone call on his mobile ?\n\nNo doubt many of the more critical reviewers will scream \" IGNORE THIS RUBBISH AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL \" My advice to the neutral observer would be ignore both versions and do something more interesting like watching paint dry or grass grow instead"

        "review_detailed_main": "The new Wicker Man movie is getting trashed left and right but that didn't deter me from seeing it last night. I wanted to share my thoughts on it.\n\nThe original Wicker Man has a loyal cult following of which I am a card carrying member. What's special about the film is that it's so original - I can't think of another movie to compare it to. The fact that it's so different means that it does not have universal appeal. I know of two people who tried to watch it but lost interest in the first act.\n\nAs a big fan of the 1973 version (especially the extended version), I was excited to see the remake despite the reviews. I really enjoyed it because you can tell that the screenwriter/director had respect and affection for the original film. What the new director accomplished was a tribute to the original with many of the same scenes re-shot. At the same time, he inserted his own ideas and twists which worked for me. The remake by no means challenges the original's greatness. Rather, it has its flaws and silly scenes. I understand how anyone who hasn't seen the original may not be impressed by the remake because they don't have the context to appreciate the redone scenes.\n\nRecent remakes that I hated were King Kong and Planet of the Apes. Granted, I'm loyal to the 1976 King Kong and Peter Jackson was remaking the 1933 version. But with all the technical effects of the 2005 version, it failed to make you sympathize with the beast that the 1976 version did for me.\n\nAs for Planet of The Apes, Tim Burton (who is great) spoofed the original film if anything. I felt that he did not have any respect for the 1968 version as a sci-fi classic.\n\nBack to The Wicker Man, I broke down and bought the wooden box edition on eBay. The extended version is so much better I thought. The story makes more sense taking place over two nights instead of one and the additional scenes really help the story line.\n\nAnyways, I think fans of the original will enjoy the remake of The Wicker Man like I did."

In the original Howie is shown as the Battle of religion, he is the Christian - Pure with virginity and Marital Values where as Willow is shown to represent the Pagan traditions of Freedom of Sexuality and Celebration.\n\nFrom the first time I heard that The Wickerman was being re-made I was open minded, Although remembering how badly recent Re-makes of films have been (Texas Chainsaw Masscre Anyone?) I was still Very uncertain.\n\nLast night me and My girlfriend went to watch the Remake of the Wickerman And i can honestly say it is One of the Worst films i Have ever seen.\n\nWatching Nic Cage strut around the screen playing his Usual Good Cop/Bad Cop droopy role nearly made me throw my popcorn up back into my mouth. I cannot believe the Legeacy of the film has been completely (excuse my french) Shat on by this remake. The first thing that is annoying is the American Setting. WTF?!?! Since when was a Remote Scottish Island an American Island in the state of Washington.\n\nThere are no good points to this film. The acting is at best Woodern by all parties - Willow's character played by Kate Beahanis one of the worst on-screen roles i have ever watched. I cannot believe that someone with the Calibre of Ellen Burstyn even signed up for this project The film manages to metaphorically rape away the magic and suspense of the original and turn it into a hollow below average film. This is one film you should avoid this summer"

Even worse they added a bunch of crap that didn't improve anything. Lord Summerside was a chick in this instead of Christopher Lee. They raise bees for no reason. They changed the back story i.e. Rowan's dad just so they could add the last pointless scene. The original ending was great, this was lame. Mr Cage is terrible as usual. He punches several women which was disturbing. If you were waiting for a chance to see him kick Leelee Sobeski (sp) in the head I guess this is your chance. The highlight is the \"step away from the bike\" line, although at this point you are clearly laughing at a movie that is not a comedy. To sum it up the original one was a masterpiece of film making and this one was a stupid and pointless bore. Nothing good about it, I would never watch this again. The real Wicker Man I have seen several times and watch it again and again on a regular basis. This is one the worst remakes I have ever seen, almost spitting in the face of all the people who think the original was a classic. 2/10 from me, I thought going in the current score on here was probably going to be overly harsh.

Those responsible for this execrable remake, which is an absolute disservice to the original, should be placed inside of the Wicker Man as it is being kindled. The worst part, and there are many, of this filmic abortion is Nic Cage. Remember a time when this dude could act? Raising Arizona, Leaving Las Vegas, and Joe all come to mind as prime examples. Now Nic has transmogrified into a drunken, demented Pacino-like man/turkey hybrid that runs around in a crapulous state and yells at women and scares small children. Pathetic and bathetic. He still gets marquee roles, but only because of the Coppola bloodline. Even the great Ellen Burstyn couldn't salvage this one. Her mere presence merits that 1 star though."

However thank you for pissing so fiendishly like a 12 year old boy who's just found his daddy's playboy and is nervous on one of the finest films I've ever seen. You changed the story, you changed the Scottish theme. You pussied out on a story about a man dying for his religion, at conflict with another. You pussied out on plot development for the sake of cheap, and I mean crack whore cheap thrills, and red herrings (I'm not even sure you knew the purpose for those devices used with supposed care in even the most thoughtless mystery story.) that went no where near the plot. It was nothing but random, and had the feel of a really bad student film. Student films are where you screw up to learn. You should not do this at the professional level. No offense, but MY student film was better. Though I shouldn't compare it to student films because that is offensive to student films!!! I don't even want to know how much money all what 20 studios that tried to get their hands on this you ruined. But at least the trailer was decent, so maybe many people will go see it. And even though it will more than likely never be a fan success, maybe it won't lose money, though at this point it deserves too.\n\nAnd for all obvious reasons a MAY POLL represents the penis. Not man you douche, but you thought you were being clever I guess changing the meaning of an actual religious pagan tradition.\n\nIt was however worth my 5.00$ Because I spent the majority of the time laughing with my friend Rachel, we couldn't even keep a strait face after the film had finished. And I did get to see the trailer for The Fountain which looks good.\n\nI'm giving you a three, because I didn't leave, and or vomit."

True enough, the scene with Nic Cage's character repeatedly yells \"How'd it get burned!\" cracked me up, but then I also forgot one other thing everyone hated about the movie: It was tedious.\n\nTHE WICKER MAN might have been an unintentional comedy, but seeing that the film was supposed to be scary and taken seriously, the film is still slow and tedious, with not an ounce of scares or tension. The original material it was based on (which was also adapted into a popular 1973 film) was interesting and completely original. This 2006 adaptation is just ludicrous, laughable even with Cage giving the most over-the-top performance of his career as Edward Malus, a detective sent on the lonely island of Summersisle, which thrives upon harvesting honey and ruled upon by Queen bee-like Sister Summerslsle (Ellen Burstyn). He's in search of his daughter from his ex-wife (Kate Beahan) who has gone missing, and discovers something deeper behind it all. What is it? That this film was intended as a comedy.\n\nUnless you can stand much of the film's running time to see Nic Cage at the edge of losing his career to a scene where he runs around in a bear suit, THE WICKER MAN is a remake that proves that all is well when you leave well enough alone.\n\nRating: *1/2 out of 5."

There are bad movies that are still good because you can make fun of them, or appreciate them for what they are,(i.e., Evil Dead) then there are movies like the Wicker Man, that take you down a dramatic path into absolute terrible storytelling, and a waste of film. I honestly felt insulted as a viewer to watch this crap. I've never seen a movie so disloyal to it's main character. Why on earth was this film made? Nicholas Cage used to be one of my favorite actors, now he's on a downward spiral doing Shiite like this, Next,and Ghost Rider. Nicholas Cage, we all miss the cool version of you.

        "review_detailed_main": "I have to admit I rather enjoyed this movie, although I knew walking out of the cinema a lot of people were going to tear it to pieces. This is indeed what has happened, and the movie has been predictably compared in an unfavourable light to the original.\n\nThe updated story sees a trauma-stricken traffic cop (Nicholas Cage) summoned to a distant island, Summersisle, by a letter from his ex. She needs him to help her search for their missing daughter whom the rest of the islanders, devout pagan-worshippers, may be hiding in preparation for a ritual sacrifice...\n\nThe problems are neither in the production or the performances but in the plot. Whilst the central character (Nicholas Cage's Edward Malus standing in for Edward Woodward's Sergeant Howie) has been updated in an interesting way, this was not handled to the best effect and any emotional impact it could have registered was completely lost. The second half of the movie played far too quickly. More patience and care with this, particularly the climax, could have significantly heightened the overall effect. Furthermore, the addition of a coda at the end to suggest the possibility for sequels was completely pointless.\n\nGiven the religious zealotry which seems to occupy both Western and Middle East politics these days, I would have enjoyed seeing an updating of the religious conflict (Christianity versus Paganism) of the original, placing this conflict in a contemporary light. The gender-reversed society depicted in the remake, with dominant women subjugating the males, did not hold water. Plot threads from the prologue, with Malus the traffic cop failing to rescue a woman and child from burning in a car crash, were never really followed through, leaving their inclusion in the story questionable. The fate of the unfortunate pilot who takes Malus to the island leaves another gaping plot hole.\n\nAll this said, the movie certainly looks good. The production is well-shot by director Neil LaBute and the surroundings of the islanders make for sunny, heavenly contrast to their sinister intentions. Some night time sequences with Malus searching for his daughter in the dark or underwater are also of note. I quite liked the new look of the briefly seen Wicker Man, with its human occupant snared inside its head this time.\n\nThe performances, while not outstanding, are more or less satisfactory given the obstacles faced by the actors in the script. Nicholas Cage had my sympathies, until towards the end when he started to turn violent and manic. This move did not seem wholly logical or grow out of what had gone before. Ellen Burstyn does fine in the role of Sister Summersisle but sounds a bit embarrassed when she has to repeat lines spoken by Christopher Lee in the original. But her quiet-seeming passivity belies her enormous power, and this worked well in the performance.\n\nAlthough worth a look for its production values and efforts of the principal performers, I am afraid I would still recommend the 1973 original above this brave but misguided effort."

When compared to the folks at Warner Brothers who actually chose to release this steaming pile of nonsense, Flushy The Fish was a freaky genius.\n\nWithin 10 minutes of Ed's arrival on Corny Thespian Isle everyone in the theatre knew exactly how the movie would end. Okay, to be fair, the roaches crawling around on last week's popcorn may have been surprised by the final \"twist\" of the plot. But I assure you, they were the only ones. The rest of us were left suffering through the next 88 minutes of Ed doofily running around the island and wondering why the background noise was that of a Louisiana swamp when we were supposed to be in the Pacific northwest.\n\nMaybe the DVD's alternate endings will feature demon zombie ninjas from hell rising from the earth to devour Sister Sumersisle's spleen and drink martinis from her skull."

Generally speaking, Cage is a good actor, however, the story ought to be the principal draw with the actors fleshing out characters and making the screenplay believable. And, because the original was so effective the remake begins with the handicap of having to live-up to an original story and genuinely thoughtful horror story. The original has a quality of complexity not evident in this version. It also seems rather odd to develop a film with the same conclusion - but for some reason reversing the order of sexual procreative domination (from the original)while pretty much emasculating males beyond their value as a tool for impregnating the women. The saving grace was the beautiful British Columbia scenery."

This just isn't based in reality.\n\nIt feels almost like the film was supposed to be absurd (think fly kicking bar maids in the face), but this wasn't communicated to the actors, who tried to play it deadly seriously. The result is a disjointed failure at either.\n\nI haven't seen the original, but I felt that there could be a decent story beneath it, it would have just required a lot more thought, characterisation and acting. Watching this felt really did feel like reading pre-teen fan fiction. Yes you might have some good themes there, its poorly developed but given to someone competent it could really be something."

It apparently resonated with the group when I said \"I like HIM a lot more than I like his movies\". Cage is good in this. When I say \"good\" I mean just forget he is supposed to be some big manly copper trying to save the innocent from evil and just treat him like the clown he is in this movie.\n\nIf there's something to like in this movie it is just how it backed itself. It really went for it and even if it crashed and burned (or even because of that) at the very least was a lively experience even if it dragged in many parts.\n\nIt's a movie brave enough to have little girls talking about phallic symbols and has Nick punching a woman. I know that sounds misogynistic but he would do the same to a man in the same context. In the fight against heteropatriarchy we need to learn to maybe love them less, respect them more.\n\nA penpal I had (wow, I miss her...) told me she loved \"Not the bees!\".

        "review_detailed_main": "Robin Hardy's 1973 cult film, \"The Wicker Man\", is definitely one of the most interesting films ever made, and one of the best horror movies in cinema history. Written by Anthony Shaffer, it is a film that through a thrilling story of mystery and suspense, raised interesting questions about faith, philosophy and human psychology. The clashes between extreme ideologies and its disastrous consequences were the main theme of the film, and its eerie atmosphere, ambiguous subject and original score turned the movie into a revered cult classic. To remake a movie like \"The Wicker Man\" is definitely not an easy task, but certainly a very interesting project to make, as the source offered countless possibilities to explore. Director and writer Neil LaBute, famed for the interesting takes on human nature he makes in his films and plays, seemed like an ideal choice to make a reinvention of a classic, but sadly, I must say that this project ended up as another wasted opportunity.\n\nIn this version, Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is a Californian patrolman taking some days off as he is recovering from the shock of a tragic accident on the road. While recovering, Malus receives a letter from his former fiance\u00e9 Willow (Kate Beahan), telling him that her daughter has disappeared and asking him for help. Confused about the fact that Willow has contacted him after she left him many years ago, Malus decides to travel to the private island of Summersisle, where Willow lives now as a member of a community dedicated to the production of honey. In the island, Malus starts the investigations, but the population is suspiciously very uncooperative and of a very strange behavior. Soon Edward discovers that Rowan is kept hidden in the island and that there is something bigger going on in Summersile.\n\nNeil LaBute's take on the original is certainly a bold spin on the themes: instead of religion being the main theme, LaBute makes extreme sexism the focus of the movie. Under this theme, Summersile is now a matriarchy where females rule and males are oppressed, and the film's \"hero\" is an unbalanced man with a deep disdain for females. In all fairness, it is an interesting and ambitious spin, and it's clear that LaBute really understood that \"The Wicker Man\" was more than the tale of a missing kid; however, he fails to develop this subtext through the story and ends up with a very weak background to the core plot, leaving his \"Wicker Man\" as just another typical thriller. While on previous occasions LaBute has successfully pulled off interesting takes on the many forms of sexism, his work on \"The Wicker Man\" feels really weak, and ultimately disappointing.\n\nUnlike his writing, his direction of the movie is effective and during the first part of the movie, almost matches the original in terms of atmospheric horror and overall eeriness. Sadly, it takes an enormous effort to transform a lousy script into a good movie, and LaBute simply can't make it this time. While the movie moves at a nice pace and has some very good cinematography, the problems of the script become quickly too apparent and by the second half the movie becomes a series of well-directed scenes that have not logic or serve no purpose. LaBute is a good director, but the badly developed script finally damages the whole movie and good talent gets wasted with lousy dialogs and silly situations.\n\nNicholas Cage's performance as Edward Malus is probably one of the worst roles of his career, and not really because his performance is completely bad, but because the character is horribly written. Ellen Burstyn is another wasted talent as Sister Summersile, the matriarch of the island and main \"antagonist\" of the film. Burstyn delivers her lines with dignity, but as Cage, can't do much to save a script doomed since its conception. Kate Beahan is definitely the worst actress of the cast, making her character look even worse than what it is (an accomplishment in itself, as Willow is one of the worst written ones). Leelee Sobieski appears in a completely unnecessary (and underused) role and definitely only Molly Parker escapes untainted by the film.\n\nIn the end, the debacle of \"The Wicker Man\" can be summarized in two words: bad script. LaBute's idea of using sexism as main theme is good and quite original, but he betrays the original's spirit (and in many ways LaBute's own ideas) by the oversimplification of the characters. While Sister Summersile becomes the embodiment of evil, officer Malus appears as a weak and naive man, taking out the whole clash of believes from the picture in favor of cheap sympathies for the character. This change proves to be a mistake as Malus victimization becomes a joke that in the end makes the whole finale feel utterly pointless. The many plot holes and silly lines of dialog are just the tip of the iceberg of a doomed screenplay.\n\nIn the end, \"The Wicker Man\" is a horrible disappointment, not only to fans of the original, but also to fans of Neil LaBute, as the movie is nowhere near his previous success and feels as a cheap made for TV thriller. I'm not against remakes, as I like to see different versions of a story, but this update to \"The Wicker Man\" is a movie to be left forgotten as soon as possible. True, it's good looking trash, but trash after all. 8/10"

I saw the original and loved it, in spite of some silliness and a dose of 70s naivety. This remake has some slightly greater faults, but nothing's anywhere near as bad as the haters want you to believe. The current rating of 3,6 is absolutely ridiculous, especially when compared to the 7,5+ ratings that cheap exercises in vulgarity like Saw get. It just shows what a refined movie lover the average IMDb user can be.\n\nI started watching TWM expecting to give up on it in less than 20 minutes, but an hour later I still couldn't find anything seriously wrong with it. It doesn't follow the typical thriller formula, it's much more subdued and creepy, with a handful of shocks thrown into the mix. If you're in the mood for something more down to earth, that for the most part is exotic and mysterious, AND you're willing to overlook a couple of tiny moments of unintentional hilarity, you won't regret having seen it.\n\nThe cinematography's gorgeous, Angelo Badalamenti's music needs no introduction, and Nick Cage creates a sympathetic character that's completely out of his element and is forced to adapt to a world where nobody cares about the rules he's used to. There are no car chases here, no shootouts, there's hardly any violence, but a sense of loneliness and desperation that personally I found intriguing. It's not often that you watch a cop main character being the most helpless guy in the movie, but here it's done plausibly and I enjoyed the atypical situation. There's more to be said, but I think you'd be better off watching TWM with as fresh a perspective as possible.\n\nSo, expect a flawed minimalist thriller, but one in which the good far outweighs the bad. See it in the best available quality because the visuals are the movie's greatest strength.\n\n7,5/10"

Never the less, here goes...\n\nI really liked the Wicker Man remake. There I said it. Let's make a few things clear to begin with: I'm not a fan of remakes of classic films, nor am I fond of Nicholas Cage as an actor. Also, I don't think that anyone would argue that the original Wicker Man is not a colossus of British film making. It is indeed an excellent film, and one of my personal favourites.\n\nSo let's imagine for a moment that this film isn't a remake at all, try to divorce it in our minds from the original, what do we have left? The answer is a handsome and well made film that stands in its own right. Nicholas Cage spends every moment of his screen time mercilessly chewing on the scenery, in the special way that only he can. The film moves along at a swift pace trasporting the viewer from one twist to another. The cinematography is beautiful and the supporting cast are a talented bunch, who do a fine job of hoodwinking Cage at every turn, and inviting the viewer to sympathise with the world that they live in.\n\nOK, we didn't need a remake. Everyone can agree on that. The plot makes no sense at all: what exactly is the religion of these people? Where did it come from? None of this is ever explored, because of course, the plot's logic is tissue paper thin and would instantly evaporate with the slightest poke of enquiry applied to it. Yet despite myself, I couldn't help but love it. I was engaged, and entertained. And honestly at the very least , what else can we expect from any film? So let's forget that it's a butchering of a beloved classic and enjoy it as a film in it's own right. If you're looking of an enjoyable piece of nonsense escapism, you could do a lot worse."

        "review_detailed_main": "It is unfortunate that I review this movie after just seeing Crank. I still think I am seeing spots and I am definitely coming down. Solipsist and Oscar winning master thespian, Nicholas Cage, stars in either a farcical story of cross-cultural misunderstanding or in a unintended B-movie-like-comedy, complete with over-the-top, Shatner-like acting. I think it is the latter, but I leave it up to history and the experts to decide.\n\nSo the Cage, as I like to call him, is doing his best impersonation of Erik Estrada in Chips. He gets a note from his fianc\u00e9e, which states that her daughter is missing and if he could help. Mind you, this is the woman who disappeared from his life, years before. She lives on an isolated island in the Northwest part of the country. An island that is mostly populated by a female Amish/Quaker-like commune. The rest is relatively meaningless. If you want meaning, you might as well check out the original movie. This movie is just there for the laughs.\n\nThe Cage is not a very good actor. As one of my comrades one said of him - \"He's the same in every movie.\" He is an actor playing himself and not doing it very well. The Cage has been in some good movies, however, those were built around his \"particular idiom\" (Lord of War is a great example of this). On the other end, when you try to get him to act or make him feel emotion, you get this Botox coma or perhaps City of Angels. His performance in this movie can simple described as mind-numbingly-nuked. He is part angry octogenarian, part whiny, part drunk, all high-school production quality with 1/2 a bottle of pain killers. I mean the scenes in the bear suit are priceless, not to mention all the cheap shots he dishes out. Unfortunately, the hilarity mostly ensues well past the 60 minute mark. Prior to this, feel free to snicker and laugh at the lame, lame dialog. I can definitely say skip the theatrical version (go straight for the unrated version) of this movie, as you will be getting a slow motion montage-like procession scene with sound overlay instead of the actual scene. I actually was scratching my head, wondering, the first time I saw/heard it. Oh well. Highly recommended for a laugh. If you want to skip the movie all together, check out Youtube for a compilation of the best and funniest scenes in the movie. I think it's a fair trade - 3 minutes in the Cage or 90. ........................\n\nWise choice."

Nicolas Cage is not good in this film despite all his performances during last 20 years.he seems to be confused in such a bad made movie. whole the film is full of stupid sequences.there is no Horror / Mystery / Thriller thing in the film. i wonder why such a talented cast & crew like this have made such a bad movie.1 out of 10."

The film is driven by fear and resentment. It tries to make us believe in imaginings that would embarrass any but the dullest and meanest of adolescent boys. A few plot ideas and images that might have turned interesting are simply dropped without any development. The closing credits brought groans, loud complaints, and scornful laughter. Although this is not the plot of the movie, I was reminded, while watching, of cartoon mysteries in which crooks dress up as monsters to frighten \"meddling kids.\" That's the level of cheesy implausibility we're dealing with here.

I watched the entire thing hoping that it would improve. It didn't. Every time I would get remotely interested in a character, they would no longer be developed, or would do exactly what I expected of them. Also, to me, there seemed to be so many props that were just there for show, and had nothing at all to do with plot development. In addition to this, the musical score was annoying. I believe that a suspense film cannot be made or ruined by it's musical score, but it can be made better or worse by it's score. This one was certainly made worse. Sadly, there is nothing good at all I can say about this film. I have no idea how someone of Ellen Burstyn's caliber became involved in this project. Pathetic."

I went with an open mind, despite the fact that I had read the reviews on this site which overwhelmingly rubbish the film. I'm afraid that very quickly I realised how true the comments/opinions were. This truly is a dreadful film. I was never a fan of Nicholas Cage, who has made a good living from movies, despite being particularly unattractive and having absolutely NO acting talent whatsoever. This turkey reinforces my opinions of him. I don't know what's happened to the man's face, but I just couldn't take my eyes off his peculiar appearance and it detracted from the film. The idea that an attractive young woman would be overcome by attraction to this weird looking individual is ludicrous. He looked more like the child's grandad than her father, as well as looking like Miss. Gulch from the Wizard of Oz as he rode his bike!!! His 'perfomance' is deeply embarrassing, as is that of the supporting cast. Ellen Burstyn really is diabolical - and I don't mean in the threatening sense!!! She appears to have taken actinglessons at the Nic Cage school of wooden!!!! I'm at a loss for words as to say how bad this film is. Anyone could be forgiven for wondering whether or not this film is meant to be tongue in cheek, with all the unintentional laughs. All copies of it and its negatives should be burned and the ashes scattered to the wind. A genuinely awful movie."

It starts off well with swift pace and introduction but veers off course slightly time passes. Howevever good ol' Nic Cage managed to keep my attention focused on the screen and not my nuts (peanuts.. not the other... never mind). He puts in a performance that is significantly better than the rest of the cast whom i thought were rather bland, or maybe that was the point.\n\nSo, things to consider when watching The Wicker Man:\n\n1) Don't make comparisons to the original or rate the new against the old.\n\n2)Stick with it during the dull moments and savour the moments of tension.\n\nOverall an average movie thats definitely worth a watch because of Cage. It'll pass the time but not a memorable film.\n\n7/10"

I just seen this randomly with some friends, I thought it was going to be scarier, but I ended up loving the weird and creepy tones, it reminded me of that used-to-be show on Disney Channel where that girl would go around to different towns and inspect weird supernatural things, that show that was way too creepy for modern Disney standards. And this movie has the exact same feel, although it's definitely more adult. It keeps you on edge, and it also freaks you out a bit.\n\nI mean, good things about it: Nicholas Cage, good imagery, stuff that's to weird to get, weird twists and turns, and a decent ending. I honestly can't find a 'bad' thing about it, other than the fact it's not my favorite movie. Everyone's saying the acting was lame, I loved the characters! I think the acting was perfect for what the film was trying to portray. It's a weird movie, geez. It's not supposed to be Batman. One of the best movies Cage has been in, and I think this is the type of film he likes to be in. I'd say see it! And it's not like this is the first weird movie I've seen, I'm a huge fan of the weird, horror, supernatural, and whatever else, and I've seen way worse. The Unborn comes to mind there. And I'd watch Wicker Man even a second time! I say it's pretty good!(With all this in mind though, I have not seen the original.)"

Cage's character is totally unrealistic. Highway patrol officers simply do not investigate child abductions on their own, especially across state borders. And no one seems to be concerned by the end of the film that he's missing... Cage's acting is stilted with lines seemingly cobbed from a MAD TV takeoff of \"Cops!\" I don't think it was intended to be a comedy, was it? Perhaps it was Cage's total embarrassment for having accepted the role without reading the script. At least Burstyn developed her character well, as I would have expected.\n\nUnfortunately the film has a much worse flaw. It is religious bigotry disguised as a horror tale. It unforgivably perpetuates a centuries-old blood libel against Pagan Witches. Many of the characters are clearly identified as such with references to their Celtic religious roots, their negative experiences in Salem, and their Goddess-centered worship of nature. The libel that Witches murder unborn children and seduce witless men into being sacrificed in their unholy rites is one straight out of the Dark Ages and the Holy Inquisition. There is no credible evidence that the events at the end of the film ever were practiced by Celtic Pagans with a living person. Sadly, it is on historical record that was a common event with another well-known religious body. The bigotry can not be more blatant.\n\nNot worth watching. Ask for your money back."

Obviously, Nic Cage and Neil LaBute were too well known to go missing, so I have to presume that it was some minor studio exec or unknown extra that went up in flames to atone for this complete abomination.\n\nThe original film was a masterpiece of suspense, brooding atmosphere, and absolute horror; viewers of director Neil LaBute's version are most likely to experience mounting rage or a fit of uncontrollable laughter, but never a sense of dread or unease. The performances are uniformly awful, the dialogue atrocious (and eminently quote-worthy as a result) and LaBute's sacrilegious screenplay alters far too many key plot elements: the action is moved from Scotland, where the story makes sense, to a small island community in the Puget Sound; the lead character is now an L.A. motorcycle cop; Lord Summerisle becomes Sister Summerisle; and Rowan, the missing girl, is the protagonist's daughter. Worst of all, LeeLee Sobieski doesn't even do a naked dance, which I would have reckoned was a no-brainer.\n\nPart of me is tempted to give The Wicker Man a high rating, just because I found it so bloody funny, but I fear that if I did, I could be next in line as a sacrifice from those who didn't find it such a laughing matter. Just to be safe, I give this one a rating of 3/10."

Surely she will deserve a nod. I did enjoy the retention of the \"wicker\" icon. Also noteworthy was the timeliness with the Burning Man festival, held the same as the opening weekend.

The plot is silly, nonsensical and labyrinthine; Mr. LaBute employs shock techniques which a ten year old could see coming; and the final scene lacks punch. This is doubly so because the explanation of the importance of the Malus character is so trite, lacking the poetic quality of the original.\n\nI must give credit for casting though, especially Ms. Burstyn, who has a pleasantly commanding presence in conversation with Mr. Cage. In spite of the fact that the social structure of the community is left somewhat undefined, (something that might have been very interesting to pursue further), it is clear that Sister Summersisle belongs in charge.\n\nIn short, this film lacks all the things that made the original entertaining or frightening, while retaining all that made the original so bad."

This is not a thriller, more so even a serious one at times, this is a very funny movie, although unintentional. The laughs I got were unforgettable, especially with the usually-good Nic Cage hamming it up with his superb overacting that makes the film look comedic. The bad supporting actors, horrible music score and atrocious subplots all make this a hilariously bad movie.\n\nThe cinematography and set pieces are good, but even them cannot save the movie from what it is - an abysmal, horrendous train wreck that, instead of leaving audiences terrified for months, left us howling in laughter, unintentionally of course. The director, LaBute seriously needs to get help, fast. His commentary on the DVD proves that there's something wrong with him. He's telling us the hardships and determination the cast and crew took while trying to make this a serious picture, but what we see on the screen is an exact opposite of what he is trying to vision. Neil, come on! You are better than this!! Aside from unintentionally (there's that word again) funny lines, this movie is a must to avoid - especially if you are a fan of the original. If you like comedies, bad movies or simply unintentionally funny movies, then give this a try.\n\nHad this been a comedy, I would have given this an 8.4/10, but seeing this as a serious movie gone horribly wrong, I give this a 1.2/10, showing it as it is. IMDb users, I know some of you voted it a 10/10 as a funny film, but please, this movie deserves its place in the Bottom 100, alongside Battlefield Earth and Baby ''shudder'' Geniuses. Please, if you are reading this, change your votes to 1 so that it is listed in its rightful place as a piece of rubbish.\n\nThank God Cage came back with National Treasure: Book of Secrets!!\n\n1.2/10\n\nDelton"

What more wooden than Edward Woodward? Yes folks take a bow Nicolas Cage! Why is it that we continue with these lame remakes of films best fogotten?

Most of the negative reviews come from people who compare this to the \"classic\" and \"perfect\" original, from which they can't shake their bias.\n\nI usually like the original of a movie much better than its remake. I also prefer older movies over current ones. But this one is no contest. Some say Nic Cage over-acts in this film, but I find his performance far more relatable than that in the original. The story itself is more interesting, minus some predictable cliches among the changes.\n\nThe second half of the original is mostly just the main character repeatedly being chocked that the island inhabitants aren't Christian, and saying \"What about Jebus?!\".\n\nIgnore the other reviews and watch this. Also the alternate/expanded ending, which I find to be better."

That last sentence will be the last time I ever mention Mr. LaBute's name without warning someone to NEVER see another of his films. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst made films I have seen in YEARS! Trying to capture the camp of the cheesy flicks from the 70's that usually starred David Soul and/or Roddy McDowell, this captures nothing but boredom and stupidity. Bad sets, shoddy photography, a joke of a script and apparently no rehearsals deliver exactly what one would expect ... an embarrassment for all involved.\n\nLet's talk Nicolas Cage for a moment. I am certain he was being fed his lines just as the camera began to roll. He sleepwalks through this \"performance\" and I assume agreed to this as some last minute favor for a friend ... or possibly for easy money. By far his worst performance ever!! The rest of the cast is almost as bad as Cage. The usually great Ellen Burstyn can't possibly be this desperate for work. Leelee Sobieski, who showed such promise in \"Joy Ride\" and \"Glass House\" and then took two years off, acts like she has never been in front of a camera before. Three confusing near-cameos are provided by Aaron Eckhart, James Franco and Jason Ritter.\n\nThere is no redeeming value in this one. It is not even FUN BAD. It is quite simply BAD."

Sensitively observed and carefully crafted, this is a film that is breathtaking in its imagery and quite disturbing in its haunting surrealism. An outstanding cast is uniformly excellent and the characters in this story are as gripping as they are fantastical. Nicolas Cage gives one of his finest performances in a role fashioned originally by the great Edward Woodward and Cage manages to make that iconic character uniquely his own. LaBute's depiction of a sinister alien culture is accentuated by his creation of a heavy atmosphere of fear, dread, and ultimately overwhelming terror. He takes tremendous risks with his reinterpretation of the classic film and they pay off spectacularly. Courageous artistic choices and creative vision make this Wicker Man a stunning motion picture experience."

How often do you get to see a man be good and women be evil? Granted we might see an evil guy punch a woman in the face but I don't know if I have ever seen a good guy kick an evil woman's ass. It is about time. I don't ever remember seeing a man punch a woman and cheering rather than cringing.\n\nThese women were truly evil and I think it is a taboo to show an entire female culture as truly evil, even though that does not reflect real life. It is especially taboo to create a single white American male character who fights that evil. It was so cool to see when he started to uncover the evil plot and the possible murder of babies that he would get in their face and confront them and even hit them if necessary. They seemed intimidated. Very rare in Hollywood.\n\nmale = good? female = evil?\n\nVery rare indeed.\n\nWas the evil doctor aborting/sacrificing male babies? Why were all those babies in jars in the lab?\n\nIt's somewhat of a break through for the anti-misandry crowd and those of us who notice the real double standards in the industry.\n\nIt gets points for being politically incorrect."

The film is hypnotic and grabs you until its very disappointing conclusion. It's somehow what one expects, but the final piece somehow lands with something of a thud.\n\nEveryone in the film is relatively good. Ellen Burstyn never makes a false move in a role that could have been quite cheesy. She recreates a character and makes it mysterious, intelligent, almost Machiavellian and walks away with another triumph. Nicholas Cage does wonders with a part that it's overburdened by some stupid dialog, and expressions like \"Step away from that bicycle...\", no comments here.\n\nThe music and photography complement this production that dares to explore worlds that were left behind with the 70's, and the results are spooky for the most part. Sadly, the ending is to be kind, weak. I'd say go and enjoy what it's there, and let's hope the next time, this one works again."

It was so sad that it wasn't.\n\nHow fabulous that the stellar female cast seemed to bank on the apparently original script which clearly had the potential needed for everyone to sign on. Let's face it, these are the actresses of our time. How unfortunate, however, that the editors, producers, or whoever butchered this piece of cinema were allowed access.

The tagline: \"Do you dare to pay the fare?\" But again, the movie itself \u0096 very good. Go rent it.\n\nHere lies the problem:\n\nNot every film fits into a nice, little box. Not every film can be summed up. Drama. Horror. Comedy. Romance. Some films walk the line. Other's eschew it altogether. Such is the case with The Wickerman. A strange, almost Lynchian film about a man who receives a letter from a long lost love begging his help in recovering her missing daughter. Sound like an interesting premise? It is.\n\nHe goes to the island and is confronted by a strange matriarchal society of strong women and mute men and searches for the girl who everyone else claims either never existed or is dead. The mystery doubles upon itself as he suffers hallucinations, vivid nightmares, and scorn from the estrogen empowered populace. Anyone familiar with Labute's previous work will understand and revel in the battle-of-the-sexes subtext. What it means exactly is up to the viewer to decide. Women are evil? Men are being castrated by an increasingly PC society? Pick your poison and drink it. Because ultimately what we have here is not the dime-a-dozen horror flick the studio machine seems to want us to think it is. Instead Labute and company have crafted an enjoyably creepy, diabolically clever forum for debate while keeping tongue firmly planted in cheek and never losing track of their source material.\n\nThis is a movie highly recommended for thinking viewers and those looking for something more than a few forgettable scares."

This may have been what they were hoping for, but I couldn't tell if I not following it. The whole movie was very vague. I may be worth watching on video. It was not worth watching in the theater."

What this film should've been is Midsommar-esq weirdness filmed with modern tech not available during the original film. The problem wasn't Nick Cage, I actually think Cage could've been great in the role, but the film direction is all wrong, trying to turn Wicker Man into a Disney action adventure film or something. It should be dark, disturbing, confusing (but with a payoff), and leave audiences confounded. This movie took the only good elements of the original film and dumbed them down so much as to be offensively bad. Corporate gutter trash shot out by some executives trying to boost numbers, completely soulless movie detached from any originality."

I avoided seeing the remake because I just knew it couldn't improve on the first one. I ended up with nothing to do one night and someone had rented the remake. I put it in the player and spent the next two hours grimacing and cringing with each lame clich\u00e9 and unsubtle piece of acting. I began to wonder if it was an attempt to make the original look that much better in comparison. Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this one. It's terrible, and everything about it is about as ham-fisted and crudely done as it gets."

        "review_detailed_main": "What an odd and puzzling film. I genuinely think I've sacrificed some of my brain cells by choosing to watch this but in a weirdly good way. I'm not sure whether Nicolas Cage's involvement in a film has the writer(s) change it accordingly to fit him or if his choice of movies is always ones that seem so original.\n\nStill, it's impressive how both films of his I've seen so far, Vampire's Kiss and this one, have such a peculiar identity and feel to them that you're not going to get elsewhere, not even films you've never heard of with barely a budget. Yet, at the same time, it's hard to tell whether that's because of his involvement (subtly, as he's not the director or writer) or if his film choices are genius. And that's so fascinating.\n\nThank God for Nicolas Cage for caring about acting instead of caring (more) about his image/reputation like mostly every other actor, especially those highly regarded. Thanks to that, he's pumping out all kinds of roles in all types of films while other actors micromanage their acting careers and the roles/films they choose. So what if most of his movies don't have super high budgets with highly regarded directors and writers? He's keeping cinema alive, regardless of how you feel about most of his films, and everyone is oblivious.\n\nBased on this film's consensus, most people hated it, thinking it was one of the worst films ever, and I'm at a loss. I guess that it's mainly due to how it's a remake, especially of a well-received film. That has to be at least 90% of it, as aspects of the film were good.\n\nFor example, the budget wasn't that low, so the overall production value was solid. Quite solid, even: the island locations looked great. As an extension of that, the cinematography by Paul Sarossy was good. The score by Angelo Badalamenti was even better; by far one of the best aspects of the film and reminiscent of Brian Tyler's score for Law Abiding Citizen with an eldritch-esque twist. The themes of isolation and indoctrination, as well as the general eerie and sinister tone, were quite effective. And, of course, Nicolas Cage's performance was good: there were also a few signature moments of Nicolas Cage-esque outbursts that he does so well, which is probably intentionally included in his films now, akin to Tom Cruise and his efficiency at running; the other acting performances, particularly by Molly Parker and Kate Beahan, as well as Ellen Burstyn, were good as well.\n\nWhen it comes down to this film and Vampire's Kiss, the only Nicolas Cage films I've seen, both are pretty much the same, more or less, regarding objectivity. Based on audience reception, they're not even comparable. Most people detest this film, while the reception toward Vampire's Kiss was more evened out or mostly enjoyed, to an extent. My outlook is that I found the latter significantly more enjoyable. However, I also found this film enjoyable. I think its hate is excessive. I don't think this was a bad film."

        "review_detailed_main": "I saw this film last weekend as part of a triple feature at my local drive-in. I did not pay attention to the TV commercials and I am so glad. Not having read any reviews or even knowing what it was about was an advantage for me. The only thing I knew about WickerMan was that it was a thriller with Nicholas Cage. Since I like most of his movies I gave it a try. My mind (for this movie) was a clean slate and really soaked up the eerie world of Summersisle. I enjoy Cage's acting and certainly felt for the plight of his character. IMO, the acting highlight of Wickerman was Leelee Sobieski. I hadn't even heard of her before seeing the credits for this film. Her performance stood out and commanded my attention whenever she was on the screen. I'll certainly be looking for her work in the future.\n\nIf the point of the story is to creep you out and cover you with an eerie and disturbing mood- then it worked on me! The entire presentation gave me a bad dream kind of feeling. The entire film held my attention from the opening scene to the epilogue. IMO it is a very well told story. I don't know if this version tops the original but it is certainly on top of my 'creepy movie' list. If you like weird, scary, creepy tales- this one is for you."
