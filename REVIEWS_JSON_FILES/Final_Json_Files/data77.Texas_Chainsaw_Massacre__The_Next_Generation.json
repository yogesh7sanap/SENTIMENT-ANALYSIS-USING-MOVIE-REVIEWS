        "review_detailed_main": "Well said, Rothman. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it fails on every level. It's not scary, it's not disturbing, it's not entertaining, it's only funny periodically when you can't believe how stupid it is, and it essentially killed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later.\n\nThe only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads - Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey - who were young and naive back then, but they did they best they could with the material they had. Renee played a fine damsel in distress and McConaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath. You can tell he was having fun with the part, and the fun he has is contagious sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since.\n\nThe movie itself is downright horrendous. It starts off as a typical slasher: a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods, then they encounter strange characters, and from then it devolves into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone. Literally there are scenes in this movie where the only lines are \"AHHHH!\" Leatherface has gone full transvestite for this installment. They also end the movie with some sort of conspiracy that these cannibals have been around for thousands of years and there are men in suits that check up on them or something. It makes absolutely no sense and trying to piece it together will ensure a loss of brain cells.\n\nThis is the worst of the pre-millennial TCMs by a long shot. Only watch if you're a die-hard TCM completist or you want to watch McConaughey yell like crazy for a while. Either way, you're bound to be disappointed."

To me, this is just one of those films where you know it's bad while you're watching it, but you're just never bored and you're having fun. You got two leads who were very young at the time, who would later become Oscar winning A list actors.... that's pretty shocking to see in a film like this lol. I loved Renee Zellweger here, I actually think she and Matthew are the only good actors here, the rest are pretty laughable. But ya know this film really doesn't take itself very seriously at all, so it's fun to laugh at the atrocious acting, mainly given by the actress that plays Heather. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely bonkers here, like sometimes he's just crazy to be crazy. That's one of the many reasons this film is never boring... it's entertaining as hell to watch Matthew play this crazy over the top character. I had fun with the chainsaw chase scenes and actually did get kinda tense while Leatherface was chasing Jenny. I have absolutely no clue why Leatherface is a transvestite in this film, that's just one of the weird things they put in here, like the mechanical leg and the weird government thing. But overall, I think this film knows what it is and it just goes completely off the rails crazy. It's a guilty pleasure for me, I'm not saying this film is good, but I can't deny that I did have fun watching it."

Running time: 86 minutes. Rated R (for bizarre violent and sexual content, and for strong language).\n\nBy Blake French:\n\n\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" is so bad it is virtually mind numbing. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Even the most horrible of bad movies tower far above this romp that wonders between insipid concepts and horror free events. I have a real hard time excepting the fact that such badness can actually qualify as a mainstream film production. This picture is disturbing, bizarre, and god awful. I wish I could provide you with a more thought out opening paragraph, but what else can I say?\n\nThere is absolutely zero character development in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation.\" Due to this, we really couldn't care less about what happens to the main characters. The film's logic free story consists of several high school students becoming lost in the depth of a wooded area where they stumble upon a sickening family of psychopaths that put new meaning to the word dysfunctional.\n\nThere are two deaths in the film, both of side characters. One is run over with a truck. The other has his neck broken. In a movie titled \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation,\" one would expect gory murders a plenty--though that is far from reality in this case. There is no blood, no guts, and no chainsaw killings. The Leatherface character does absolutely nothing in the film. Excuse me. He does do something. He dresses up like a woman and shrieks his chainsaw above his head while screaming wildly.\n\nWho are the villains? What do they want? What conceivable reasons do they have for living the lifestyle they inhabit? There are no answers provided. I am not necessarily stating that the majority of viewers will even care enough about the plot to even ask any questions. I am just backing up my theory of the terrible qualities this production contains.\n\nIt is quite the surprise to witness some big names in the film's cast list, such as Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey. Neither of the two are capable of rescuing the movie, nor are they able to perform with fine dramatic tension. What a complete waste of talent director and writer Kim Henkel constructs with this piece of trash.\n\nAfter screening \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I love movies so much, but this so-called movie is a disgrace to all film's associated with. It is so hard to understand what the individual's intentions were when they produced this heap of garbage. Did the filmmakers desire to give movies a bad name? Or did they actually believe \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" was worth a penny? After seeing this movie's poster, and seeing the tagline \"Still Buzzing After All These Years,\" I had a question for it. Why is the series still buzzing when it ran out of fuel long before this film was made?"

When filmmakers aim for camp and miss by so wide a margin, the result is boring ugliness. The part of the film that wasn't (supposed to be) campy, was just sadism and psychopathy.

However, Barry and Heather run after a car to hitchhike and separate from Jenny. They stumble upon a farmhouse where Leatherface (Robert Jacks) and W. E. (Joe Stevens) \"welcome\" them. Meanwhile the deranged Vilmer finds Sean and the wounded driver and kills them. When Jenny gets a ride from Vilmer on the desert road, she learns how crazy he is and leaves him, meeting Leatherface in the woods in an insane night.\n\n\"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", a.k.a. \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\"), is a forgettable slasher of the franchise. The greatest attraction are the unknown Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey in 1995, and they have good performances.

Literally every other character in the film exists to support his performance in some way.\n\nAnd there's the problem: A big chunk of the film takes place before Vilmer shows up, and it just follows extremely generic teens who spend too much time 1) whining and 2) wandering around the woods while nothing happens. There are some funny lines, but they're too few and far between; it's a big problem when the original TCM was made by amateurs in the 1970s yet had way better pacing & more interesting characters.\n\nThe pacing is the number 1 problem with this film. It drags and drags one-note scenes out for way too long; some of them are boring, while others are supposed to be tense (like the chase scenes) but just feel stupid because they're so dull.\n\nAnd it's a shame, because this movie's heart is in the right place. As mentioned, the bonkers character of Vilmer is a treat, but the ironic twists in the film have a lot of potential too. I loved the moments where the victims say something really understated in the middle of being menaced. I loved the scene where Vilmer's girlfriend meekly hits a victim with a stick before politely giving up. I loved the scene where a teen locks himself in the villains' house and thinks he's outsmarted his captors; it would have been great to see that wiseass character deal with the situation some more, but he's killed off way too fast--And that's a perfect example of the movie's problems.\n\nIt has a few really good ideas, but it needed another rewrite to really expand on them and use them well. Everything is just half-baked and never really delivers; there's no satisfaction or punchline to anything. For instance, Vilmer talks about how much he loves scaring people, so why are his first 2 kills so incredibly boring & lame?\n\nOn top of that, the execution is just incompetent, with terrible lighting and really drab, dull scenes of characters bumbling around in extremely boring locations. There's absolutely no atmosphere or spookiness to the woods, and everything just looks really bland. And there's really no reason for Leatherface to be in this movie; he's just there because the director thought a \"creepy transvestite\" would be a novel, mind-blowing concept... which it isn't.\n\nIt's a movie that had potential and could've been really good. But Kim Henkel simply wasn't competent enough to make it work, and the result is a mess that's just boring too much of the time. All the same, I definitely enjoyed this more than the 1986 TCM 2; while this movie had its heart in the right place and was botched by bad execution, TCM 2 was just an embarrassingly campy & stupid concept even if it had a competent execution. I can respect this film for what it attempted to be, at the least. If you're patient or if you fast-forward through the dull scenes, I would honestly recommend this film for its creative aspects."

OK, I admit, I love a cheesy, dumb movie as much as the next person, but why does a film with such legendary status have to have its reputation spoilt by pointless sequels? TCM may not be the only film with a load of crap follow-ups ( the Elm Street series, The Howling series - I could continue...)but surely it's one of the only films (not just horror) that just doesn't need a sequel. The original was so groundbreaking in many ways that it was almost perfect film making, a film that 'does exactly what it says on the tin', so to speak. Alright, TCM 2 had its moments, but was really just a cash-in without any of the style of the original. TCM 3 was pointless, but at least it had a bit of a nasty edge to it. This is just like a 'made-for-tv' style movie (remember how 'Freddy's Nightmares' compared to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'?). Anyway, basic plot for those who can be bothered - a group of kids get stranded in the woods and run into a family of maniacs. Sounds familiar? A bloke in a mask called Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen, your rightfully legendary place in cinema history is very safe!)wielding a chainsaw does not necessarily make a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie.\n\nLOOK AWAY NOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE PLOT TO BE SPOILT!\n\nThere's no actual massacre involved in this film, and any killings that do take place do not involve a chainsaw! What you do get is a confusing story about people who shout a lot and run around in the woods. There's also some rubbish about the Illuminati, but I won't even bother going into that. If you want pure, gritty horror then you could do worse than watch the original TCM. If you want edge-of-your-seat tension and shocks, then watch the very classy 2003 re-make. Just don't even bother with this, as you'll only get disappointed."

        "review_detailed_main": "Many popular actors appeared in a lot of crap up until they had a breakthrough film that made them stars. Sylvester Stallone made porn as well as \"Death Race 2000\" before making it big with \"Rocky\". George Clooney made \"Grizzly II: The Concert\". Johnny Depp starred in \"A Nightmare on Elmstreet\". And, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey both starred in \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"...a film that is currently #45 on the IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 worst rated major release movies of all time.\n\nIn this film, the normally cute and very pretty Zellweger plays a ridiculous nerd. How do you know she's a nerd? She never washes her hair and wears dorky glasses. Why she would hang out on prom night with the vacuous and nasty 'popular couple' makes little sense....and everyone seemed more like caricatures than real people. Plus, anyone...even a super-dork...would wash their hair when going to prom. As for McConaughey, he plays a redneck serial killer...and actually is much more believable than the rest. Little do any of them know that far worse awaits them.\n\nSo is the film any good despite being on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List? No. Many of the characters make no sense (such as the lady who flashes her breasts out the window and whose dialog was written by a groundhog) and the film seems like it was made for folks who find the \"Friday the 13th\" franchise too intellectually taxing. Bad acting, bad direction, ultra-violence and a script that simply is an excuse to see teens butchered...this one is simply a bad film from start to finish. But it's also proof that being in a terrible film like this does not necessarily destroy your career. You can, over time and with better scripts, overcome the embarrassment of being in \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"."

What a pile of complete and utter rubbish.\n\nAt one point of the movie, a rich mafia-looking fellow opens his expensive shirt to reveal tribal scarification and what appear to be several superfluous nipples; all pierced, and pronounces he wants \"them\" (I'll assume he meant the audience) to experience true horror. Well..mission accomplished, I've never been so terrified. Terrified that someone went to the effort to press this to DVD, terrified that someone approved the script \"Please Mister, you're scaring me!\"(Even though I just saw you break someone neck, I seem only marginally frightened) TERRIFIED THAT I HANDED OVER MY PRESCIOUS MONEY TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS SLUDGE! Scary, huh? In fact, this movie was bad in so many ways, I'm not going to able to list them all in the detail I would like, because you may expire from dehydration and hunger before you got to the end. Allow me to simplify in point form 1. The script. Welcome to confusion 3 minutes into the film. Who are these people? Why did four people who seem to hate each other drive away from the prom, and then keep driving? Why then did they complain there's nowhere to turn around on an unbarricaded country road? Why bother making character development when it serves only to confuse the storyline further? 2. The characters. Who cares if they die. Who cares why they kill. Why does the crazy tow truck guy have a hydraulic mechanical leg that works with any remote control? Why does leatherface suddenly want to be a woman? What's the goddamn deal with the slutty woman and the pizzas? 3. Run woman, run! How man times can you escape and be recaptured? How is it you can be in the middle of the woods one minute then be chased by leatherface the next? It suggests leatherface and his family communicate via mobile phone to inform each other of the whereabouts of potential victims. Mmmm, unexplained murders.\n\n4. The conspiracy theory. Utterly pointless addition to the movie, suggesting that the crazy family of skin fetish, cross dressing, semi cyborg taxidermists are somehow at the whim of a secret organisation responsible for killing JFK and scaring girls on prom night.\n\nAs you can see, this movie explains none of its ridiculous actions, characters or general happenings. You're left with an hour and a half worth of questions! Please, I beg of you, ignore anyone who says this movie is half way decent. This film is BAD BAD BAD. 1/10."

Certainly, it represented an original point-of-view that is rare enough for these types of movies.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Renee Zelwegger give charismatic performances, which makes their later stardom understandable.\n\nAs for the dumb dialogue and over-the-top performances, it was obviously intended to be campy, and, in many instances was funny and effective. Even the incredibly ditzy, wooden, female victim was obviously directed to perform in that manner. I highly doubt it was just a case of merely bad acting.\n\nTo the movie's credit, though it is brutal (and somewhat misogynistic) in spots, there is an absence of true gore. When a man gets repeatedly run over by a vehicle, or another character gets their head crushed underfoot, the actual gore is kept off the screen. This makes the deaths seem more horrific.\n\nI was not enamored with the idea of Leatherface as being transgendered. That's been overdone in similar films and is rather unnecessary. In fact, one tends to feel sorry for Leatherface, more than anything else.\n\nThe film was atmospheric, though not especially scary. It reminded me of a live-action cartoon. Similar in style to the \"Tales From The Crypt\" series.\n\nMy main gripe, and the reason for just giving it a 6 (out of 10) was for some of the brutal sadism. For example, one of the characters is repeatedly poked and stunned with a cattle prod. It happens over and over again until you just want to scream at the director \"Enough.\" A little too much relish went into terrorizing the females in the movie (not the men). Unfortunately, all that does is make you question the director's motives, which is not a good thing."

And again Ren\u00e9e isn't super entertaining in here so you really have no one to root for. Also that final act is so crazy. Where did that plane come from and why?!?! Why are we not talking about that?!!! Overall this is not a great movie at all, but it does have some entertaining scenes which gives it a bit of a bump up."

Overall, it was mediocre with a plot that was somewhat removed from the other films in the series but did borrow a lot from them as well. The acting was spotty throughout by Renee Zellweger as she seemed truly terrified one second and then delivered a very stale line the next. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as the psychotic head of the deranged family. Leatherface is given somewhat of a facelift (no pun intended)and gets into drag late in the film. For anybody who is a fan of the series it`s worth watching but if you`ve never seen a TCM film, don`t start with this one."

        "review_detailed_main": "I recently rewatched Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994) on Peacock. The storyline follows a group of teenagers who are on the way to the prom when their car crashes. An insane tow truck driver pulls up, kills one of their friends, and sends them scurrying for help...right into the hands of Leatherface himself. Will anyone survive?\n\nThis picture is directed by Kim Henkel, in his only directed project, and stars Matthew McConaughey (Wolf of Wall Street), Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (Chicago), Robert Jacks (Scary Movie), Tonie Perensky (Varsity Blues) and John Harrison (Just Sue Me).\n\nThis film had the potential for greatness with its various elements. Unfortunately, it feels like a mishmash of concepts that don't quite fit together seamlessly. Matthew McConaughey delivers a solid, albeit over-the-top, performance that's intense but occasionally awkward, as if he's trying too hard at times. The inclusion of his mechanical leg didn't seem to add much to the movie. While the cross-dressing aspects are intriguing, they don't quite reach the levels of films like \"The Silence of the Lambs\" or \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\" The random appearance of business men towards the end, while the licking scene is the creepiest part of the film, feels somewhat out of place. Even the kills aren't as good as I expected. The film's ending, which closely mirrors the first film in the series, was disappointing.\n\nIn conclusion, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a messy film with a few redeeming elements. I would rate this a 5/10 and recommend giving it a single viewing."

        "review_detailed_main": "Huh? Was this a joke? This is awful! Originally made as a bad sequel, now thought of as a bad comedy, this 4th entry in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the worst films of all time. It's one of the few movies that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The acting is just awful! Young Renee Zellwegger and Matthew McConaughey star in this in some of their earliest roles. The direction....what direction? Leatherface chases people around like he's blind. He misses people right in front of him. Also noted, this was written and directed by a woman, so they have Leatherface dressed like in drag through most of the film, which is just ridiculous. The writing makes no sense and consists of nonstop cussing and yelling and grunting.\n\nAs for the plot, heck, like the direction there is none. These 4 kids get lost from their prom and end up getting attacked by a crazed family led by Vilmer (McConaughey). First off, why would these stupid kids get lost from prom? Do they not know where their houses are from the school? The characters are so dumb and unlikeable that you'll be rooting for the family to kill them. Unfortunately, there is no gore at all, and that is not an exaggeration. There is not one drip of blood on the screen. The climax of the film involves a helicopter that manages to hit one person but misses someone else 3 feet in front of them. The very end is not explained at all and will have everyone scratching their heads. Plus Leatherface has no point. They shouldn't have made this a sequel considering Leatherface has absolutely nothing to do and is mostly just sitting down.\n\nThis movie will leave a sour taste in anyones mouth. My rating: BOMB/****. 83 mins. R for language"

Here's a sequel that manages to get all the little details wrong and all the BIG details wrong, too. You know you're in trouble when the Sawyer house looks messy rather than menacing and Leatherface looks like the third-runner-up in a drag-queen beauty contest for geriatrics. (NOTE TO FILMMAKERS: when your main \"monster\" looks this bad, the solution is to *never* let the audience have a good look at him. Keep him at the edge of the frame or in the background, you nitwits, not front and center!)\n\nTCM4 manages to do the impossible: it makes the appalling TCM2 look good by comparison. Nearly everyone has commented on the moronic \"X-Files\" subplot already, so I won't bother. There is NO explanation whatsoever of how Leatherface got involved with this new \"family.\" Who _are_ these people, anyway?\n\nThe ending makes no sense. NO SENSE! It seems specifically designed to enrage moviegoers. This movie will make you want to pull an Elvis and shoot out the TV screen.\n\nThis is one of the biggest stinkbombs of all time. Avoid it."

        "review_detailed_main": "This sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is only scary because it is just so f(_)cked up.The good points in this movie lie within the characters particularly the cannibal family as Matthew MaConahagh gives an amazing performance along with everyone else in the family minus Leatherface.The best part of this movie is that the relentless torture is bloodless but more violent and sadistic than any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films not to mention very realistic.This movie certainly portrays insanity, cruelty, and disgust to perfection due to the number of scenes where characters are being slapped around, violated, and mocked.The villains tend to always give the victims a glimmer of hope even though they know full well there's no chance of their prey escaping their clutches.The acting in terms of the victims is half good and half bad Renee Zellwegger is fantastic she plays a very helpless but brave young woman, the character who is the typical narcissistic jerk is also a good actor but the ditsy blonde and the very early murdered Shawn are absolutely horrible and you're glad they die.Besides the clich\u00e9d characters the meat that holds the bun together in these movies is always and will always be Leatherface but in this movie the actor cannot make Leatherface seem even remotely as scary and scarred as the original played by Gunnar Hansen or the remake's Andrew Bryniarski who at least strike fear into you simply by looking and appearing menacing.This leatherface has a ridiculous mask that looks as if it was made of play doh or thin plaster and really isn't scary or even cool.The worst thing is that this movie is almost an exact double of the first one except with a ton of errors and bad acting.The kill's are all the same as the first film and they even through in the scene where Sally jumps through the window to escape Leatherface cutting through the door.This movie delivered a more warped and bizarre dinner table scene but this dinner scene you knew it was a movie versus the shockingly realistic one that took place in the original Tobe Hooper film.The ending is exactly the same as well minus one little extra scene with Renee Zellwegger in the hospital.The storyline goes from a simple slasher to an unrealistic government conspiracy which i thought was moronic but at least they waited until the last 10 minutes or so to spring that plot twist on us.To sum it up the movie gets a 5 from me 3 points for the scariness, 2 points for most of the acting.\n\nThe Good: -Realistic torture compliments the scariness\n\n-The actors portray lunacy and dysfunction perfectly\n\n-Good dialogue for the villain characters\n\nThe Bad: -Unbelievable overall concept\n\n-Repetitive to the point that it seems like a bad remake\n\n-Bad make up effects particularly on Leatherface\n\n-Plot line wanders aimlessly without explanation\n\n-Bad dialogue for the victim characters\n\nOverall: 5/10"

Its as if the makers wanted to make the most illogical horror movie but its really an insult to even the intelligence of an idiot. And what the Hell was the point of the Fast Food restaurant!?!

Nothing in this film works, absolutely NOTHING. I'm not exaggerating when i'm saying watching paint dry would be a more enjoyable and entertaining experience than watching a second of this movie ever again. Besides the horrendous acting and cheap set pieces, this film somehow manages to be the longest 85 minutes of my life. Its chase scenes go on for what feels like hours, and I am just left there puzzling in my chair how something like this ever even made it to the editing room- let alone see this fit as a final outgoing product. Besides its tedious and poorly edited nature- the film's acting is also absolutely horrendous- even from the likes of future Hollywood stars Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. I have to give MCConaughey some props, he seems to be the only person trying in this film, but man does it just not work, and his overacted violent redneck character feels as half baked as it was the last 3 times around. In the end, TCM The Next Generation does nothing new or notable for its long running franchise, in fact, it only tarnishes its reputation further. Its sloppy, poorly made, poorly produced, and just an absolute dumpster fire to watch- and not in a good way.\n\nMy Rating: 1/10."

Even for TCM, this is truly abysmal and even fans of the franchise will find it near on impossible to get through this.\n\nAlthough TCM as a franchise tends to have it's more comedic/wacky movies and the more serious/scary ones, Next Generation takes it much too far to the wacky side of the spectrum. I'm all for wackiness and my enjoyment fo the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Child's Play' franchises serves as proof of that, but this is just TOO absurd to the point that it's not even remotely funny. Everything is over the top, irrational and nonsensical. The plot was non-existent with no coherent or obvious story present.\n\nDespite well known names such as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey starring, this movie is shockingly awful. McConaughy's over the top acting seems to become even more dramatic and is practically unwatchable. The overall acting from all the cast is dreadful, with no redeeming qualities. What else do you expect when they're playing a bunch of psychotic freaks with no humanistic qualities at all?\n\nAlthough screaming and yelling is to be expected in a horror movie, this takes it to a new and ridiculous level. 90% of the movie consists of high pitched squealing and frantic screams to the point that I was forced to mute the TV. The dialogue was actually out-done by the screaming.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I didn't manage to get to the end of this movie and don't feel I missed out on anything. In fact, I think I saved myself from wasting any more of my life watching this atrocity. Save yourselves the torture and skip this movie on your watch of the TCM franchise."

        "review_detailed_main": "People have criticised the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as being a weak film compared to its ancestor. Those who have defended it say, among other things, that compared to The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is a masterpiece. This argument is invalidated by the fact that compared to The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, ninety-five minutes of Anna Paquin burping and farting in tune should be considered a masterpiece. In case I haven't made it clear yet, my comments refer to the 1997 reissued cut.\n\nHave you ever encountered a story, a film, or some other piece of art that is so utterly stupid it is brilliant? The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw is so stupid it becomes brilliant then painful within minutes of each other. A film critic once wrote that the lengthier a title is, the worse the film will often be. He also wrote that when a film changes title for a rerelease or international release, that is a bad sign. This film has had two titles, these being The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. If the length of these two titles doesn't set off alarm bells, then the list of plot stupidities in this film will.\n\nI won't go into every idiotic point of this film. My personal favourite is the hick with a mechanically-enhanced leg that can be controlled by remote. Yes, you read that right. Zellweger's character defeats him by stealing his remote and making his leg thrash about. Yes, you read that right, too. One of the other victims is put up on a hook that goes through the back of her shoulder. Mere hours in the continuity of the film pass by before she is found crawling on a dirt road. Then a millionaire comes by, and it is revealed that this millionaire is paying the family to behave in this manner, for reasons that are not even given a pretense of explanation.\n\nMind you, those are just the stand-out examples of the film's idiocy. What Tobe Hooper brought to the original TCM was apparently things like plot cohesion, or even characters doing things that make sense. The only reason to watch this cinematic abortion, put simply, is to see big-name stars at their lowest point. Zellweger and McConaughey, quite simply, must have agents whose farts smell like Chanel No. 5, and whose urine tastes like champagne. James Gale sums it up best: \"This...all of this...it's been an abomination. You really must accept my sincere apologies. It was supposed to be a spiritual experience. I can't tell you how disappointed I am\". I think he was inserted as a proxy for Kim Henkel.\n\nIf I had to give The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a score, it would be a big one out of ten. It excels alright, at failure. Like Howling: New Moon Rising, it proves that no matter how low a franchise sinks, there is always somewhere lower it can go. People who thought Friday The 13th Part VIII or Freddy's Dead were rock bottom have absolutely no idea."

Seeing star Matthew McCounahey totally embarrass himself. I was really disgusted with this film , as opposed to the mere disappointment I had with TCM \"part three\"."

        "review_title": "A postmodern dismemberment of Hooper's film (and I mean that in the best possible way)",
        "review_detailed_main": "\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" follows a group of dimwitted Texas teenagers who take a wrong turn on prom night and end up in the hands of Leatherface, his psychotic brothers, and one of their slightly-mad girlfriends.\n\nWidely derided by many and loved by a small few, I count myself as one of this film's admirers. Perhaps it's because I saw it at an impressionable age, or maybe it's just because I love a good atmospheric horror flick (and this one does have loads of atmosphere). In the end, though, I've always found this film to be a lot of fun. It's not scary--it's certainly strange, sometimes even hilarious (both inadvertently and advertently)--but it's never boring.\n\nMany people have criticized the film for its meek (and feminine) depiction of Leatherface, the fact that it lacks a chainsaw killing, and that it recreates the original film's dinner scene with pizza instead of human meat, among other things. While these are all elements of note, the detractors are missing the point: \"The Next Generation\" is a self-aware deconstruction of Hooper's original film. Power up the chainsaw? Leatherface can barely do anything but apply lipstick and run around screaming. Barbecue human meat? Takeout requires so much less effort. Effectively terrorize group of teenagers and push the limits of terror? These villains can hardly keep it together: One of them does more quote-spitting than killing, another can't even walk without a remote control to power his animatronic leg, and the girlfriend struggles but fails to muster up her own malfeasance (she can't even bring herself to tap a victim with a stick). And best of all? The demented family's operations are all overseen by a mysterious illuminati figure: a \"Man in Black\". Why? Nobody quite knows. Even the family doesn't seem to. They are simply ineffectual avatars of villains, stumbling through the motions of their designated roles.\n\nWhile Henkel's overall vision is at times still murky, what remains evident is that he aspired to create a degenerated rendition of the 1974 film, one in which all of the core elements have been twisted into a state of fruitlessness and decay. Perhaps it's a meta commentary on gen-X culture, or of horror films at the time; but irrespective of its subtext, \"The Next Generation\" is a recklessly amusing and unabashedly campy horror film that never ceases to leave your jaw on the floor for a myriad of reasons. It's gone down in history for being the major debut of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, who play the mousey final girl and Leatherface's psychotic brother/ringleader, respectively, and both are reasonably good here. Even the supporting cast handle the material well enough, and the majority of the film's corniness is a result of Henkel's sometimes hammy dialogue.\n\nFans of the series should note that this film is closer in spirit to something like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,\" but I think \"The Next Generation\" manages to hit on the elements of dark comedy and self-parody with even more success. While perhaps not a conventionally \"good\" film, \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" is a genuinely weird and fascinating dismemberment of Tobe Hooper's original masterwork. Depending on how you look at it, Henkel's experiment here may or may not have failed, but the result stands as a surreal slasher fever dream, and one of the most perplexing horror films of the 1990s."

As a fan of the first 3 films (unlike a lot of fanboys, I actually enjoyed pt3) I was eager to see this, adamant that it couldn't be as bad as people made out. But it was worse. Upon it's release, it was marketed as \"the true sequel\", but to compare it to the original in any positive manner is insulting. poorly acted, conceived, written and just bad in every way, there is nothing to recommend. I don't understand how Kim Henkel, after brilliantly writing the original, could possibly sink so low with this garbage. If I were Tobe Hooper, I'd probably still wake up in the middle of thew night every now and then, screaming in anguish. Avoid like a plague."

        "review_detailed_main": "What the hell was going on when the writers penned this mess and the director filmed it? They must have either been drunk or stoned. In fact, that may be the state required to enjoy this travesty.\n\nOkay, so the story isn't that bad - it's just your usual regurgitated 90's horror tale. A group of teens go to prom. Though on their way home they get lost and end up being in an accident. Three of the four decide to go and find help while the remaining teen stays behind with the injured driver of the other car. What could go wrong? Well, they do try to get help from the Slaughter family...\n\nIt's here that things start to fall apart and everything collapses in on itself. The worst thing with the story are the characters. These range from believable to the truly ridiculous. All the teenagers are truthfully represented. Even Darla Slaughter is a reasonable character... up to a point. I even like the strange relationship she has with Vilmer. However, Vilmer is the most terrible and implausible character I've ever seen. Then you have W E Slaughter who likes to recite quotes; though you have to wonder where these references come from as you never see him reading - though it is a good hook. As for good old Leatherface, you're not afraid of him. You may feel sorry for him as he's bullied by everybody else in the family and is usually running around in fright... having this family I'd be sprinting about too.\n\nSpeaking of running, Rene Zellweger should have tried out for the Olympics. This beautiful lady can run like she's got wings on her feet. It's worth watching the film for... almost.\n\nThe performers do great jobs with their characters. Zellweger is the strongest in the cast. This is because she has the broadest personality and range of actions. She's a shy girl who has to come out of her shell and get ultra-tough so she can survive the night. Matthew McConaughey is insane... he is so over the top as Vilmer that scenes with him in are nearly unwatchable. Not only do you need to keep your finger over the volume button for his temper tantrums but also Leatherface's screams. Robert Jacks who portrays him can hit notes that can shatter eyeballs. All this does is add to the unwatchability of the movie.\n\nHalfway through your wondering what's happening. By the conclusion, that question is still there but you'll have added, why did I just watch this? This is the second time I've watched this rubbish and I have to say I still cannot answer those concerns.\n\nThough I will admit there is one scene I love, not because it's good though. Vilmer is having a rant in the kitchen and Darla starts to argue with her so he throws her headfirst into the fridge door. He kicks her a couple of times and then stands on her windpipe. This is a really violent segment and looks nasty. But then you get a distance shot and though Darla is fighting to breathe she still has time to straighten her skirt so you cannot see her panties. This is a woman who regularly flashes her boobs at passing teenage boys as they buzz her place of work. It unintentionally made me smile as I thought of all the wrestling matches where they did the same sort of thing...\n\nAnyway, I've given this bad piece of filmmaking too many words and too much time. Only thing I have left to say is... If this hasn't warned you off the movie let me put it in more concise form - Do Not Watch This Film.\n\nIt's just not a good waste of your time.\n\nFeel free to come on over and check my lists for other possible viewing pleasures and you can see where this flick landed in my Killer Thriller Chillers list come chart."

        "review_detailed_main": "Oh boy, it's time to review Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994) and it sucks. I am baffled by everything that happened in this movie, especially given that Kim Henkel wrote and directed this movie. Although this movie shows us that Toby Hooper was the one doing all the hardwork.\n\nPositives for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994): The best thing about this movie is Matthew McConaughey's hilariously enjoyable over-the-top performance as Vilmer in this movie. And finally, Renee Zellweger is okay as the main character of this movie.\n\nNegatives for Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994): Aside from Renee Zellweger's Jenny, all of the other main characters who die in this movie suck. Jenny's boyfriend Shawn is a complete nothing character. Barry and Heather are some of the most obnoxious characters I've seen in any horror movie to where Heather is a big crybaby and Barry is the type of guy who would anything to get his penis wet and say stupid stuff. This movie has by far the worst portrayal of Leatherface to where he's dressing up like a woman and he's screaming all the time like a little girl. There's even a point in the movie where Renee Zellweger tells him to sit down and shut up and he listened to her thus losing all credibility. That's not what you want from the main villain of the franchise and yet the movie expects us to be scared of this guy. The Sawyer Family don't eat people in this movie, but instead they eat pizza. There's a subplot involving the illuminati working with the Sawyer Family and yet it goes nowhere. And finally, there's a pointless cameo from both Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty and Paul A. Partain at the end of the movie and it's completely pointless.\n\nOverall, I am completely baffled that this movie exists and that it was released in theaters back in 1994. Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994) is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life and unfortunately it's not the worst movie in this franchise. God help me please!"

Perhaps we were all a bit TO harsh on this awful movie.I'm a Texas chainsaw freak (especially hoopers' 74 version) so i think it gives me the right to talk about it.FIRST the bad things..The character 'Heather' is kind of dumb and annoying how she plays the role and also the 'Barry' character BUT ..sometimes it's fun to watch these people act,or try to act.and trust me,there are much much worse actors and actresses in the world.and not only in ass and tit movies. and i think that's about it that bothered me. Don't see it as a true horror movie.See it as a comedy or black comedy.Cause sometimes 'Vilmer'(McConaughy) reminds me of a Patrick Bateman or something.He plays it pretty darn good.The quotes are cool and Zellweger i never liked actually in any movie except this one. maybe i liked it because my friend and myself were finished watching John Woo's The killer and than this movie was very late on Television.It was perfect.we had a good time,good laugh,and both liked the Vilmer character,the rest as well. So man,the score here is 2.6/10 which is ridiculous.There are movies like 'the worm eaters','XXX'(with Vin Diesel),'Psycho'(the remake!) and other shitty comedies nowadays that are MUCH worse in my honest opinion. So really,give it a chance,it's not THAT bad.. for fans of:American Psycho,Killing Zoe(not for the action scenes),some old Wes Craven films,nothing really Italian horror-like to be found here.. and another thing..I think Mr.Hooper didn't really cared for this movie cause it doesn't really need to be compared with the first one,but people still do.so see this one with an open mind and don't care about what's been made in the past.Hooper(in my opinion) bothered with the real 'good' remakes from the Texas chainsaw with Jessica Biel and the prequel movie sort of speak.cause that wasn't necessary cause the first one already WAS a true success.They were good but personally i didn't cared for them that much. This movie is different.It's not my all time favorite horror movie,not by a long shot BUT i think there's plenty of entertainment to be found here. Enjoy people and sorry about the spelling(from Belgium you see)\n\nMy Rate:6/10"

All the good bits from this movie were already done better in the first movie. The absence of blood maybe satisfied the BBFC and the MPAA, but was a real slap in the face for the fans of the first movie. Why would anyone want to see this blood-free movie when the gorey and bloody original movie is available? A sequel must break new ground to justify its existence, not paddle backward.\n\nThe most outrageous thing that really p****d me off was the fact that in this movie there is NO chainsaw massacre. The bodycount is very low and no one is either killed or wounded by a chainsaw.\n\nThe previous movies in the series were really bloody and inventive, and therefore shocking. This movie is like Chainsaw-light or \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for dummies\". A real shame.\n\nEven good actors like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey can't save this movie. Zellweger's performance felt fake as hell and McConaughey's psycho also seemed fake and over the top.\n\nYet another problem is the lack of realism. Zellweger's character jumps from panicky mode to action hero mode to can't-really-act-scared mode. McConaughey's character cuts himself with his knife, but doesn't seem to bleed at all except for a thin strip of blood.\n\nAll in all, you can watch this movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "The fourth film in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, The Next Generation, receives a lot of flack from many fans of all things Leatherface, but although I can appreciate why (it rarely takes matters seriously and doesn't make much sense), I still manage to get a kick out of the movie. Writer/director Kim Henkel's totally bonkers style, the chaotic storyline, and gleeful over-acting from almost everyone involved ensures that, although it might not be 'classic' Chainsaw, part four can still be plenty of fun!\n\nA pre-fame Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays nerdy teenager Jenny (apparantly, wearing a pair of glasses magically transforms her instantly from hot Hollywood starlet to frumpy geek), one of a group of teenagers who become stranded in the Texas woods after a car crash and fall prey to a clan of cannibals (led by Vilmer, a psycho with a remote-controlled leg, played enthusiastically by rising star Matthew McConaughey).\n\nWatching The Next Generation expecting anything remotely resembling logic or narrative cohesion is a completely pointless exercise, 'cos there isn't any; the best approach to take with Henkel's crazy concoction is to just go with the flow\u0097revel in its sheer lunacy, bask in its stupidity, but never question what is happening or why. That way, transvestite Leatherface won't come as such a shock, the Illuminati-style millionaire with belly piercings won't keep you awake at night questioning his relevance, and sudden attacks from airplanes will seem perfectly reasonable."

        "review_detailed_main": "This is the third sequel to the 1974 horror classic \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", and is probably of most interest for showcasing early appearances from future Hollywood stars Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger.\n\nWritten and directed by the producer and co-writer of the original, Kim Henkel, this is film is essentially a retread of the first. Four Texan teenagers, heading back from their senior prom, are involved in a car crash, in the middle of nowhere (but only minutes away from their school, seemingly) and are attacked by a family of sadistic cannibals, led by Vilmer (McConaughey), who has a mechanical, remote controlled leg.\n\nThe film falls down on many levels, for one thing the kids are so endlessly irritating they deserve everything they get, the movie has many inconsistencies (I don't know whether or not this might be due to heavy cutting) and there is a bizarre, drawn-out conclusion.\n\nThe main saving grace is a hilariously over-the-top performance from McConaughey. In fact the whole thing works better as a kind of demented screwball comedy, rather than a true horror film."

I found that the character of Vilmer to be the best \"not Leatherface\" psycho of the series. Just edging out Bill Moseley as Chop-Top. Its popcorn horror, plain and simple. This movie scratches that part of me that also enjoys Cannibal Holocaust and Toxic Avenger. I recommend giving it a shot. You might hate it, or then again it might become one of your favorites."

        "review_title": "The fourth part is a total mess, it tries to bring new elements to Leatherface's story and make some references to the '74 classic, but it only let the viewer more confused",
        "review_detailed_main": "After the fiasco of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 was released in film and video completely shredded, displeasing most viewers (the uncut version was only released on DVD in 2001 over 10 years later), excellent news sparked great anticipation among viewers. Fans of the series: a fourth The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would be made, with the direct participation of Kim Henkel, the screenwriter of the original classic. To improve, Henkel would not only be an executive producer, but also the screenwriter and director of this new sequel, which, moreover, would be done independently, so as not to suffer the same censorship of part 3. Could it be better? Of course! That's why it's strange that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre- Return has been the worst movie in the franchise so far.\n\nIt is possible to say that nothing is saved in this repetitive and bland plot. Kim Henkel, screenwriter of the first film, returns as director (and also takes over the script) in this film that is basically a retelling of the 1974 classic: a group of young people have a minor car accident while leaving graduation festivities. When looking for help in the surroundings, which means going through a stretch of forest to get in touch with a house/establishment, the young people come across the family of \"degenerates\" and the bloodbath enters Leatherface's agenda... In this beginning, the prom isn't even shown, as Jenny's friend Heather fights with her boyfriend Barry and the four young men hit the road. The characters are so ridiculous that Henkel doesn't even try to write interesting dialogue for them in the first ten minutes of the film, when we should at least get to know the young people better. What presents itself is the traditional conversation about sex, and nothing more. Soon, there is an unlikely car accident on a country road, and the inevitable separation of the group: Jenny, Barry, and Heather go for help while Sean stays with the driver of the other car, who is injured. The trio meets Darla, a tow truck attendant, who calls her brother Vilmer to pick up the cars. Vilmer is Matthew McCaughey, another who is in an awkward start to his career (this is his fourth film).\n\nAt the same time, Jenny returns in search of her boyfriend while Heather and Barry find a home in the middle of the forest. There's Leatherface (Robert Jacks, horrible!), with a mask that doesn't even convince. Leatherface kills Barry with a sledgehammer to the head (identical to one of the young men in the original film), traps Heather in a freezer (ditto) and then hangs her on a meat hook (identical to the first movie!!!!!). The difference is that, in the original, the girl hanging from the hook showed pain and fear, while here the terrible actress doesn't even scream convincingly, and we don't even see blood dripping from the wound (she has a hook stuck in her back!!!!).\n\nThat leaves Jenny, who spends the other 50 minutes running around, running from the killers, being arrested, running away again, being arrested, fighting with them, getting beaten up, being tortured, mistreated, and so on. Some of these chases are good, like the one on the roof, others not so good - until we get to the messy end. Any normal person would be horrified, traumatized by half of what Jenny goes through in the movie, but she keeps her sanity, not screaming, not even showing fear and horror, as Marilyn Burns did so well in the original movie. Since the beginning of the so-called \"tension and horror\" that the director wanted to rescue from the original, we see that the trip will be long - and not pleasant. The weak script gives us the worst characters in the franchise, a kind of stereotypes from the original movie - and with incredibly stupid dialogue. Some chase scenes are pretty silly, and most of them are done by Vilmer, like the one where he chases Sean or Jenny in the car.\n\nAnd the quotes from the first film don't stop there: at one-point Jenny is chased by Leatherface through the woods, with the chainsaw buzzing incessantly, until she finds shelter in the towing service, where she thinks Darla is a friend, but she, in fact, she is part of the psychopath family (exactly what happens in the first movie, when Sally is helped by Cook Dreyton Sawyer!!!!). As we all know, it's never good to trust Texas people, especially in a Chainsaw Massacre movie. Jenny is then tied up (as with Marilyn Burns in the original), bagged (ditto) and taken back to the house (ditto), placed on the dinner table (as in the first movie) for another screaming and torture session.... It's impossible not to mention that on the way to the house, inside Darla's car, Jenny screams, cries and kicks, then the villain threatens her: Stop screaming immediately! For the imprisoned girl not only stops crying and complaining at the same moment, but also speaks, totally dismayed: Okay, but I'm not able to breathe, with the greatest calm in the world, as if I were a crying child who just got a Mom's ear poke! And she doesn't scream anymore, even when Darla is approached by a police officer - and a scream from Jenny could betray that the woman was a kidnapping psychopath.\n\nDespite several passages identical to the original, this fourth chapter doesn't even come close to the first. In addition to not having a minimum of violence and horror (no one is butchered for dinner, for example, nor is there any mention of cannibalism; what it seems is that everyone is crazy, and that's it), the film becomes ridiculous and comical in several moments, especially in the bad characterization of Leatherface, who spends most of the film dressed as a woman (with dress and makeup), screaming and even taking orders from Jenny (who, at one point, yells at him to sit down and shut up. Mouth, and that's exactly what old Leatherface does!!!).\n\nIn fact, Leatherface doesn't do anything else in the movie. He appears as a transvestite, visibly overweight and dressed as a woman, and is totally overshadowed by Vilmer, who suddenly becomes the film's biggest villain. Then, just when we think it can't get any worse, Jenny is tied to a chair at the family dinner table and a man in a limousine appears out of nowhere, dressed like an executive, with a refined English accent. And he goes into the psychopath's house as if he were a member of the family. Jenny thinks he went to save her, but actually he's crazy too; Rothman then starts grabbing her and licking her, and his chest is slashed with scars and piercings!!!! The mysterious character approaches Vilmer and says: You know why you are here.... I want these people to go through the truest horror. Did you understand? Well, neither do I! Nobody bothers to explain, either, what kind of family relationship those completely different misfits have - do Leatherface, Vilmer and Darla have any kinship, for example? And what happened to the original's family, if The Return would be a direct continuation of the first movie? The only members of the original family present are Leatherface and Grandpa (of course!).\n\nIf Renee Zellweger never comes across as a helpless, life-threatening young girl, the worst interpretation by far is McCaughey, who plays a hysterical type, always screaming and wanting to be badass and scary, when in fact is the most caricatured and unfunny villain in recent times. When he wants to look scary, he widens his eyes and starts screaming. But the worst is when he has a tantrum and starts mutilating himself with a knife (just like Hitchhiker does in the original movie).\n\nLacking in rhythm, The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is weak, tasteless and presents us with a psychopath without any impact, armed with his chainsaw, but unable to act because of producers concerned with censorship. All in all, this fourth part is a total mess, it tries to bring new elements to Leatherface's story and make some references to the '74 classic, but it only let the viewer more confused. The script doesn't even try to give a greater sense of clarity. Everything ends up in a disastrous ending, full of holes and meaningless theories. Every 10 minutes, the story introduces new elements, without any fuss, which leaves everything messy and poorly done. Presenting us with a mob bow and a Leatherface drag queen, this movie is completely unnecessary, comical, offensive and bad, but really bad. No wonder the franchise hit rock bottom after this movie and only reinvented itself after the remake, in 2003."

The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre seems to think it's a clever dark comedy, but it's actually just an exercise in pure tedium and homage that goes on for far too long.\n\nWe should have been warned within the first 10 minutes once we meet what passes as our characters and they're as boring and unrealistic as any teen slasher film I've ever seen. One girl won't shut up about her philandering boyfriend and constantly tries to pull a Scream and talk about how many bad decisions they're making and how they'd be dead if this was a horror film. Our heroine is blatantly obvious, because they make fun of her glasses and her virginity (and because she's played by future Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger).\n\nThe rest feels like a scene by scene homage to the original film. Girl runs through woods from Leatherface, finds shelter and realizes that person is in on it as well, returns back to the house, jumps through a window, etc. It's all accounted for. Watch the original instead."

        "review_detailed_main": "Soft-spoken introvert Jenny (Renee Zellwegger) along with her friends Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer), Sean (John Harrison), and Heather's boyfriend Barry (Tyler Cone) attend their high school Prom and soon after a Heather finds Barry making out with a random girl find themselves driving on the Texas backroads until another car crashes into them leaving them stranded. As they search for help, a tow truck driver named Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) arrives at the scene and is but only the first of several escalating instances of insane violence that will befall the group over the night.\n\nFollowing failed attempts by studios Cannon Films and New Line Cinema to successfully exploit the legacy of the 1974 horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with the sequels Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III respectively, the rights reverted to the original film's co-writer Kim Henkel who produced the low budget follow up in The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (later retitled Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation) which like the original was produced on location in the state of Texas using local actors and resources. Eventually procured for distribution by Columbia only for the film to become buried at the insistence of parties with vested interests in the careers of Renee Zellwegger and Mathew McConaughey putting pressure on Columbia to bury the film in a limited release of only about 20 theaters where it fell into relative obscurity and received negative reviews from whatever critics saw it (with the exception of Joe Bob Briggs who was one of the film's few Champions). Over time the movie has become cult favorite thanks to its absolutely bonkers take on the franchise as well as the early appearances by McConaughey and Zellwegger, and there is entertainment value to be had, but that by no means makes it \"good\".\n\nAside from Zellwegger's Jenny, the rest of the teens are very broad stereotypes you've seen before who fall in line with brainless airhead, jock jerk, and stoner and are basically just there to pad out the body count. The impetus that brings them to the backroads of Texas as a group no less is pretty contrived even by the standards of slasher films that need to find ways of isolating a group of characters from the rest of the world so they can be picked off by whatever monster or killer is lurking around. But there's a strange awkward charm that comes from the interactions in our group as their written to be such braindead kill fodder that it's almost like it's trying to be parody of this type of movie but never quite crossing that line into full on parody.\n\nMcConaughey plays, Vilmer, the de facto patriarch of the family this time around (I'm honestly not sure if they're still the Sawyer family) and regardless of the quality of the movie around him, he is not pulling punches with his performance as he chews his way through the scene arguably decimating more of it than Leatherface's chainsaw. The rest of the family all have their quirk with Leatherface now a crossdresser (which is explained by him adopting the identity of whoever's face he wears), Joe Stevens' W. E. playing a guntoting psycho who's basically this movie's equivalent of Chop Top or the Hitchhiker down to his similar movements except his quirk is randomly quoting different people ranging from Ulysses S. Grant to Voltaire, and lastly we have Tonie Perensky's Darla who's Vilmer's (I think) girlfriend whose relationship shifts on a dime from violent pummeling to ravenous sex and believes Vilmer to be ingrained in some \"secret society\".\n\nThe movie follows many of the same beats as in the original 1974 film with characters being locked in a deep freeze, a character gets stuck in the back with a meathook, Leatherface even once again destroys the front door of the house though admittedly it does lead to a pretty impressive set piece with Leatherface chasing Jenny on the roof with some pretty impressive stunt work. And once again we have yet another rendition of the famous \"Dinner table scene\" which again has grandpa sawyer (I think, I could've sworn he was killed in one of the sequels but who knows) and it strikes all the expected beats with the exception of the addition of a plot point that I think is supposed to be self-referential commentary but I'm not even sure the movie knows at this point.\n\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a rehash of the 1974 original but its such an odd rehash with a multitude of awkward scenes and WTH sequences that any description I give of it can't possibly do it justice. From the surrealness of seeing early appearances by Renee Zellwegger and Mathew McConaughey to the tone that never lets you know whether it's in on the joke or not, I'm not going to forget TCM: The Next Generation. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was self-aware in its insanity, but Next Generation definitely falls into that \"So bad, it's good\" camp and will make a welcome addition to the collection and repertoire of riffers in need of schlock to play on the TV with their friends as beer and pizza boxes adorn the coffee table."

If it wasn't for the release of Jerry Maguire and A Time To Kill I think it's safe to say this pile of dung would have went strait to video. This film really makes me sad because the original TCM is a horror classic and one of my all time favorites. Leatherface: TCM III is the best of the terrible sequels and that is really sad. To make matters worse this film makes no sense at all. At least the other films fallowed a basic story. This one has a mysterious airplane attacking Vilmer, an old couple touring through rural Texas in an RV and a bizarre man who rides in a limo that has large rings pierced all over his stomach. The impression is left that this man is actually a sadist who employs Leatherface and company to terrorize and kill people. The one upside to this film is that Renee Zellweger actually opens her eyes. This flick is badder than bad. I give it 1/10."

Their car gets hit by another car. The driver of the other car is injured, so a couple of the teens go looking for help. They arrive at an old country house. Unfortunately for them they've stumbled onto Leatherface and his family.\n\nThis entry in the series boosts a couple of names, whom would go on to bigger and better things. Renee Zellweger (Bridget Jones) and Matthew McConaughey (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days), as well as Tongue Perensky (Varsity Blues).\n\nI can't say that this film is worth viewing. I think it sat unreleased for a couple of years. They probably released it once McConaughey and Zellweger started to become big names."

The acting is horrible , horrible but its so funny, so anyway they are driving after prom i forget want happens after that but some how then they are walking around ...blah blah and then they are hunted and killed in anyway but of course not killed by the chainsaw..i don't know why they weren't killed by a chainsaw but they weren't.. So Matt had a crazy leg ..the one guy knew history quotes ..the women got hit a lot..and leatherface screamed like a women with a bad 90s mullet( so bad)there's the normal chasing, table scene, weird business guy with hooks on his chest?Sally from the first one makes an cameo at the end , please make sense of this...i own this movies and its my second favorite in by far the best series every made"

Those that are unfamiliar with R.A.W.'s books can only guess @ where the \"Scarified, multiply pierced dude with the bad hair cut\" could possibly fit in. The fact is, he doesn't, despite Darla's best efforts to lay some kind of ground work. I don't even know if Toby could have done for this what he did for Poltergeist. @ the same time, The concept of plot is a hang-up to the off the hook action TCM demands - cause and effect - time and distance - right and wrong - need to go right out the window if your going to make it work. Rothman walks in and they all freeze-up like some bad stage play. Say what you want to about Bob Altman but he keeps everything going all over the place and picks out bits here and there to create something massive. But the action never stops.\n\nOne last thing: the multiple off screen crushings were great, but the snapping of the neck on screen cheapened it. If Vilmer had been arguing with Barry and working the kids neck over and then the camera had zoomed on his exprssion and all's we'd have heard was snapping \u0085 that would have been an oH WoW \u0085 right up there with Orville already being awake when Alan walks in in \"Children shouldn't play with dead things.\""

I also am a fan of the series and realized that I hadn't seen this one yet and am also currently playing the video game recently released in 2023. I assumed most of the negative reviews was from a generation who just didn't understand movies from my time growing up. To my astonishment after about 20 minutes I was already annoyed. It gave me the vibe of the original with the beginning narration that I love, followed by the old 90s scene of teenage kids that makes you think of Scream and I know What You Did Last Summer. After that, the ideas become absolute ridiculous. I don't like giving spoilers so I'll just say that I saw it......."

This film is very very very bad,, i dont mind a cheesy horror film but this is just awful. avoid at all costs,, if your a tcm fan and want to see this disgracefull piece of garbage wait for it to come on tv ( which i doubt will ever happen ) or wait for a friend to buy it or something,, dont waste 1 pence on this,, tobe hooper should give kim a bit of a kicking for making this film, i would. my advice is STAY AWAY."

Most people would say yes, yes it is. Or, is a movie an audio/visual spectacle whose primary purpose is to thrill, shock or terrorize its audience? Others would embrace this crude but satisfying description, perhaps those among us who are more entertained by more visceral, more primal, more base forms of stimulation. So, if your tastes run more towards the crude and primitive, the unrefined and irrational, the dumb and dopey, then you'll very likely get a kick out of this silly weird freak of a film. I know I did.\n\nIt's just plain insane. Don't ask me to explain or justify my, um, acceptance of this demented deranged devolved bit of theatrical nonsense, but there ya have it: It's one fuggin wacky wild ride. Maybe it's the offbeat, compelling, convincing performances by as-yet-still-relatively unknowns Renee Zellweger and Matt McConaughey? Or maybe it's the surprisingly well paced if awkward action that seems to be consciously gauged to wind us up with some disturbingly understated foreshadowing and then set us off with sudden outbursts of confusingly callous hysterics that struck me as genuinely bizarre and creepy.\n\nIt's not as if the threadbare, nearly non-existent narrative cares one way or another if we're invested in arriving at any sort of reasonable explanation for what we're witnessing. On the contrary, this nasty, naughty little scamp of a movie is obviously relishing its audience's inevitable bewilderment. I also got the feeling that the oddly obnoxious cinematic creation fully approves of my increasingly genuine amusement. This is a comedy?! Oh, well why didn't you tell me!!\n\nI chuckled and snickered all the way through. Thank you very much, you weird, wacky, near-worthless movie experience."

Until last night, I hadn't seen the movie in at least 10 years. I sat down hoping I was wrong and it would work this time. If anything, TCM:TNG is worse than I remembered.\n\nThere are scores of problems I could write about, but the main one is the film's plot - or more precisely, the lack of a plot. There's really not much here that resembles a coherent story. It's a mish-mash of recycled ideas, attempts at humor, story elements involving a secret governmental-whatever that come out of nowhere, and generally poor filmmaking. Add it all up and it's one big disaster. It's amazing to sit and watch a film with the words Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the title and not find one scary or suspenseful moment. Take McConaughey's introduction as Vilmer as an example. The movie sees fit to leave the viewer in suspense about Vilmer's intentions for no more than 10 seconds before he's revealed to be a bad guy. Why not let the character be something of a mystery for a while so that when he makes his murderous tendencies known, it's a surprise? But no, that might have made for an interesting plot twist and you can't have anything like that in TCM:TNG.\n\nA well deserved 3/10 from me."

The 2nd and the 3rd parts were not very good, but watchable. But this? An abomination! Most of the dialogues are just plain bad, characters are bad and just doesn't fit the franchise acting is pretty bad maybe except for McCounaghey, but even he overacted. Leatherface becoming a transsexual or whatever it was? Since when? And that screaming... horrible. And now he's destroying brick chimneys with his chainsaw. Even the Leatherface's hairstyle is horrendous. One of the genre's listed on IMDb for this movie is \"comedy\". I didn't see any. If there was comedy, it was awful. Story is also a bold \"what the f*ck\". More importantly - there was no gore! A Texas chain saw massacre movie and no gore. Something doesn't quite go together, does it? What was up with the \"don't hit me\" scene? It was like a 90yr old woman hitting a mentally retarded kid. Thank god that Kim Henkel understood that he is not a good director and didn't continue to work as a director.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and skip this part of the franchise."

Finally about a month later I was determined to get through this movie and I finally did and it totally scarred my outlook on the TCM series. I had to watch part 1 and 2 again to bring myself back from this horrible display of acting and directing crap in part 4. It's hard to believe that Renee and Matthew are A list stars now. Even though I must admit Matthew plays his role pretty good as the villain in this movie. If the movie would have been taken more seriously then Mathew's role would have been perfect. It's the fact that this movie was NOT scary, creepy or original in any way whatsoever. I recommend watching part 2 and observing Chop Top's character played by Bill Moseley. More directors need to get people like him in their movies. Dog will Hunt. Get that bitch Leatherface, get that bitch. Dog will hunt.\""

We see Leatherface and his family kidnapping people and killing them and mostly chasing them around.

Rumor holds that both McConaughey and Zellweger have tried to acquire the rights so they can burn it, but to no avail. The script is rotten to be sure, but considering the material they had to work with, both did fine jobs; McConaughey especially so. His quirky character is done quite well in almost every scene. (Unfortunately, it falters in what is supposed to be a climactic point). Many story elements are blanket re-shoots of the original, which those 'in the know' will immediately recognize. The attempts to add Hellraiser-type elements are less than stupid. I still can't understand why Leatherface can't seem to work his chainsaw. It's on, it's jetting, but he uses it as a hammer to beat down a door, instead of cutting through it. Ummm .. ok. Paul Partain (Franklin from the original) has a cameo in it. Fun to watch once, after that; most guys will simply cue up the part where Tonie Perensky flashes her bustline. And they're not reason enough to own this film."

It's mindless horror, it's meant to be fun and it manages to be scary, hilarious and disturbing. The first hour or so is definitely the best and contains some genuinely frightening scenes as well as two classic chase sequences between Leatherface and the two heroines. Lisa Marie Newmeyer puts in a memorable role as the mindless Prom queen and has some of the funniest lines since \"Clueless\" and Renee Zellweger is great as the mousey Jenny who goes from classroom geek to feisty survivor and gives the cannibal clan a good run for their money. It's all very purposely retro, a film that would have been top notch in the 70's slasher era...when the characters sprout lines like..\"My flashlight's dead\" or \"Hello? Is someone there\", walk into old houses in the middle of the woods and split up to get help, you know that the director Kim Henkel wanted to capture the innocent horror of pre \"Scream\" times. It's a pity that he got lost somewhere after the first hour and added the senseless Rothman character...instead of staying classic and ending with a great chase scene he tried to make the story a little bit different. He should have stuck with the formula we've trusted for so long and one he'd delivered so far...still not a bad sequel...better than 2, much better!!!"

Now I will admit that I didn't rate 1,2,or 3 on my top 10 list of favorite movies in the first place, but this movie was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I've seen some pretty bad movies (say, Gods and Monsters?) but this beats all. First, there is no plot. I sat there the entire time wondering what in the hell the point of the movie was. In the original (the second and third as well), you understood why these people were running around slaughtering people with chainsaws. The crazy family, though REALLY crazy, made sense. This installment failed to let the viewers in on this little secret. So I sat for 2 hours and still have no idea why the freaks in the woods were freaks in the woods, nor do I understand what in the hell Matthew McConnehey was supposed to be and he was the main character. Second, what in god's name happened to Leatherface? That's not Leatherface - I don't know what the hell he was either. The original made your skin crawl-he was creepy, disgusting and a helluva lot scarier than some freak transvestite who does nothing more than scream like a little girl. And what's with the Warren act from \"There's Something About Mary\"? And finally, where was the ending? I must have missed something because all I saw for an ending was Zellweger in the limo with that weirdo (who or what he was supposed to be is also extremely and irritatingly elusive) and that thing that was supposed to be Leatherface spinning around with a chainsaw. Then she's all the sudden at the hospital staring at this bloody chick that wasn't even in the movie, as though she had something to do with any of it. But I feel the worst insult to the TCM movie series was the fact that the \"C\" and \"M\" were completely missing from the movie. You cannot name a movie Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE if there is NO CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Not a damn person was killed by a chainsaw, nor was there any kind of bloody massacre like that nastiness in the second one with all the bloody hacked up body parts falling out of the wall or Leatherface putting L.J.'s face on Stretch's face. The only blood I saw came from Vilmer, and that was a sorry disappointment.\n\nTo sum this up, if you have any regard at all to the orginal Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, or any regard for the film industry whatsoever, bypass this wretched movie. And if somehow you end up being held hostage and forced at gun point to watch this movie, I recommend telling them to pull the trigger. Seriously."

Girl has friends with her, girl and company run into Leatherface, friends die, girl runs up stairs and jumps out of window, girl is saved, and somewhere along the line they thrown in the government or FBI or something, i dont remember, and does it matter? of course not, because if this movie is a remake, its by FAR, the worst remake ive ever seen, and if its a sequel, then its gotta be the worst sequel to a classic horror movie that ive ever seen (not counting Halloween 3, but that movie had a reason to be a bad Halloween sequel)\n\nIf you love Leatherface, please, please, dont see this movie, youll still have some respect for one of the original Leatherface creators.."

About a month later I bought the special edition LD of the original one. On it I saw a trailer for Return of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and thought that it had looked pretty cool. At this point I knew that the movie had in fact been made. I got my hands on a Japanese LD catalog and found it for sale in there. I bought it immediatly. When it arrived in the mail I was so happy. I sat down and started to watch. When I was done I realized why the movie hadn't been released in the theaters or on video. The movie was pure garbage. The acting was terrible and the story was just a total ripoff of the original. A few years later It got released in the theaters after the Rene Zelweger's success in Jerry Maguire. A bunch of my friends wanted to go see it in the theater. I told them to save their money and gave a little show at my house. They agreed with me as did most of the people who saw this movie.

To say its bad would be a gross understatement, and to say its funny in even a bad, campy way would be an outright lie. So lets see... Fans who saw part 3 will understand this: Tex=Vilmer. I cant say I think much of Matthew McConaughey, but he did at least outdo Viggo Mortensen from part 3 in stinking up the film. In fact the Film should have been called \"Vilmer\", since afterall the most integral character of the whole series Leatherface is now a cowering drag queen that sits in only as a comic foil. Did also mention he looks like a horrific combo of Rosie O'Donnel and Roseanne Barr??? That alone should be reason enough to stay far away from this atrocity! Ren\u00e9e Zellweger may be cute, but she sure cant play a scream queen... in some scenes you can actually see her giggling aloud at the pathetic situations she is placed in! The Family is in no way comparable to even the pathetic one from part 3, in fact they are so laughable you might think this is a local film school getting their first taste of being shot on film. Lastly, where the hell is the CHAINSAW MASSACRE the film so portrays in its title? I mean not one death was result of its namesake...\n\nGod, now I feel cheap that I even reviewed this drivel. Avoid at all costs..."

        "review_detailed_main": "In the mid-1970s, Tobe Hooper had unleashed horror in a new way to moviegoers with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). It was a film that had so much going for it. It may have been outrageously controversial for its depiction of sadistic violence but it served its purpose in being a scary film. It relied on simplicity and minimalism in order to drive its viewers crazy. Then Hooper created the long awaited sequel that confused his original fans by attempting to keep continuity while simultaneously changing everything else. It turned out being more of spoof of itself than being a sequel. When the franchise finally released its second sequel, it was even more mixed in reception due to its further lack of connection to the last two movies even though its title said otherwise. At that point, it would've been thought that maybe the franchise was suffering from lack of attention. Apparently the next sequel (this one) shockingly was neglected even further. It by far is the most confusing and disappointing to say the least.\n\nThe overall idea behind the story is no different from that of the other movies before it. A group of teens end up crossing paths with Leatherface and his notorious family of cannibals. This sequel was written and directed Kim Henkel, the original co-writer to the original film that blew everyone away. According to Hinkel it was supposed to be the official sequel to the original film. As to what he thought consisted of making it the official sequel is barely visible. The writing is all over the place and the continuity is very unfaithful. Like the films before it, it begins with a monologue recounting the past events, yet it was supposed to ignore them too. So how does that work? There's also a subplot about Leatherface's family having some kind of government connection or something along those lines. Allegedly they report to a higher authority and their motives go higher than their personal needs? The most painful part of the writing belongs to the dialog and the actors don't make it any better.\n\nAlmost the entire cast essentially is an over the top exaggeration of some horror trope but worse. Starring as the heroine is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger best known for her breakout role in Jerry Maguire (1996). She's also accompanied by Lisa Marie Newmyer as Heather, who constantly spouts out useless sentences that don't add anything to develop her role. There's also Tyler Shea Cone playing Heather's boyfriend Barry who is none the more likable. They also come across a local who tries to help them played by Tonie Perensky. All of which can't deliver a line that sounds the least bit believable. The only thing that really keeps a viewers' attention is because of how bad the actors are. The only actor who has some saving grace (for himself) is now esteemed actor Matthew McConaughey playing Vilmer, a member of Leatherface's family. McConaughey just hams it up playing his role as psychotic as possible. Playing Leatherface is Robert Jacks who is annoyingly bad because all he does is scream nonstop.\n\nThe only other positives worth mentioning are the practical and makeup effects. There's not an abundance of practical effects but the fact that it was used shows effort. The same could be said for the makeup. McConaughey's character is part robotic with a hydraulic leg and that does make it interesting to see. How he got that way and as to where he came from, if this is the \"official sequel\" to the original, is never explained either. What a surprise. This is it though for pluses. Even though there are practical effects, there is almost no gore to this movie. It makes the previous film to this franchise look bloodthirsty. It's actually very surprising. With all the inhumane and off putting scenes that involve grotesque acts, there's hardly a drop of blood shown throughout the running time to this movie. Sure, minimalism works to an extent but if nothing else is really working in the overall product, at least give the audience something visual.\n\nThat also goes for background elements. The director of photography to this project was Levie Isaacks. Isaacks is best known for being the DP to movies of Guyver (1991) and the infamous horror movie Leprechaun (1993). The work that Isaacks presents here isn't much to talk about. Much of the shots throughout the film consist of turning away from anything gory and refusing to place any establishing shots. Viewers will see the disarray of the cannibal house but there's no real setup. The films before it at least had some kind of arrangement. Here it's just everything everywhere with no real order and it's boring. For music, Wayne Bell from the original film returns and his composition is uneventful too. There are moments where he creates a tune or two that establish a nice sense of dread but other than that there's nothing memorable about it. Much of the instruments involved are synthesizers and since it is not used properly, the audio is rarely effective. So sad it got this bad.\n\nIt's a shocking film all right. It's shocking that people who were involved with the original returned and had completely forgotten what made it so unique. Matthew McConaughey is possibly the only actor who tries (somewhat) and there are some okay looking effects. The rest isn't good. It makes the other sequels before it look like it they had better writers. Not even a gorehound would enjoy this."

Kim Henkel decided to make a quasi-sequel to the first film. A very odd but pleasing results make this one a must see for fans.\n\nThe story revolves around a high school student (Renee Zellweger) and her friends who's traveling the back roads toward their school prom. Along the way their car breaks down and the bump into a very bizarre individual named Vilmer (Matthew Mc Conaughey playing himself) who decides to have fun with his new found friends. One of the clues that are very important to this movie can be found on the side of Vilmer's tow truck. Vilmer also has a hobby that he shares with his dinner companions.\n\nI don't know why so many people hate this movie. I found it to be very unique and intelligent. Nothing is spoon fed and the performances are up to snuff. Renee Zellweger and Matthew Mc Conaughy are excellent as the wall flower lead and Vilmer respectfully. When this movie was finally released it was badly edited and it had a virtually non-existent release. It's a shame that people have to slam this movie. I found it quite entertaining. If you like the original then you'll love this follow up to the first film.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nKeep an eye out for a special surprise at the end. Those who have watched the first movie will enjoy it. You'll be in for a pleasant treat"

A character who would fit right in at a Donald Trump rally. He never does explain why he hates all these prom-swagged early 90s teens. Maybe he had abusive parents, maybe he's never had the opportunity to be educated and he is jealous of the kids, we may never know. There are moments when he is physically quite rough with the women in this film. Surprisingly there isn't actually much gore for a movie about a massacre. There is however a lot of abuse. I give this movie 5 bags of popcorn. For a truly immersive experience watch this movie on prom night!"

I'd have to say out of all the movies (including the remake and it's prequel), this is the black sheep of the family. Even parts 2 and 3 had their fun moments. I don't even know where to start with what is wrong with this flick at all, well I'll just say I didn't like the angle of why the family did what they did. Hint: they're not a cannibalistic group like the rest of the series portrays them, and I can't even believe they chose to go down that path! And Leatherface is a total wussy in this film. So sad they let the face of the franchise do so little to nothing at all in this movie. The major thing about this film is it being the debut of Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. You do notice that most of the major stars today seemed to do their big debuts in horror movies a lot, but this movie is the stain of their careers. I'd be so embarrassed if I were them. I admire Matthew as an actor, but he just overacts too much in this movie and not the \"Overacting so much it's funny\" point either. I'd so watch How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days over this one any day.\n\nSo if you ever plan a Texas Chainsaw movie marathon, please forget this movie. Like I said, it's the black sheep of the franchise. Where's the 0 out of 10 option when you need it?"

Matthew's charismatic presence is the only thing this movie has going for it, though I found his girlfriend rather attractive and interesting in her routine acceptance of this family as being normal. There is some overlap with the original but that 1974 film was very frightening because of its low-budget documentary style (was it black and white?, I can't remember). I didn't see any reference to cannibalism in this one; they eat pizza here.\n\nOne continuity glitch: In a homage to the original, a female character is hung up on a meathook alive and we hear the hook go into her back. However, 20 minutes later she is still alive and lying on her stomach in the road and we see that the skin on her back has no marks or insertion points at all. A terrible oversight and sloppy filmmaking."

From start to finish, this thing is a complete load of nonsense and extremely irritating crap! Not ONE line that is spoken by anyone of the performers makes even a tad bit of sense. In fact, your ears start to hurt after a while from listening to all that useless and dumb chatting. You cannot believe what they dare to bring to the screen here. The dialogs and one-liners without a doubt belong to the crappiest that were ever written. Give a typewriter to a 5-year-old child and he'll do a better job than Kim Henkel did. And they don't have to start claiming it's meant to be like this and that it's supposed to be a comical spoof.because it's too idiotic to be a comedy and too painfully amateurish to be a spoof. There's another name for it.rubbish!\n\nIn every possible way, this pile of garbage is a disgrace to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and blasphemy to the genre of horror. There's no structure to be found whatsoever! Characters are disappearing all of a sudden and they don't get mentioned anymore thorough the whole movie, while other, newly introduced types are supposed to fit in right away. The members of the maniacal family are stupid, empty and utterly annoying. Especially the image of Leatherface is messed up badly. All of a sudden, he suffers from a serious identity crisis got really lame. Even when he's appearing in his most 'scary' form, he's only a glimpse of the portrayal Gunnar Hansen once gave. I guess the local and ambitious wannabe stars Zellweger and McConaughey would have done anything at that point of their careers to be noticed.I'm surprised they grew out to be famous after this anyhow! They should be pointed at and laughed for being part of this piece of junk. Writer-director Kim Henkel had her 15 minutes of fame when she co-wrote the original, along with Tobe Hooper. She now turned into a complete joke herself. TCM: The Next Generation isn't even bad enough to be good.it's bad, period."

This is film-making at it's lowest. It has no respect for the series or it's themes and it's reprisal of several key scenes from the original comes as an insult cause they're in such a crappy movie. None of the scenes worked for me, like the scene where Jenny is on the rooftop had potential until she started climbing across the wire, I mean come on as if. Surprisingly though 2 of the actors became major movie stars years after this was released Matthew McConaughey and Rennee Zellweger who are both probably embassed that they ever starred in this rubbish and they couldn't make the most of the rubbish material that they got, Matthew wasn't very good a playing a psycho path I mean he just wasn't menacing or scary and Rennee wasn't very appealing as the main heroine Jenny, she was just plain dumb and look at that rooftop scene.\n\nAll in all, The first one was a classic, the 2nd one was rubbish, the third one was great and the 4th one, well why was it called The Texas Chainsaw Massace I mean he didn't even kill anyone with a chainsaw in this one."

There are supposedly thousands more like him all over the country that the government is hiding and protecting, but why they're doing this is never explained. Frivolous details, right?

In addition to being an alien, Leatherface is now also a transvestite, in a Liz Taylor mask, with an electronic leg that he operates with the remote control from a television set. There's even a village idiot running around through the entire movie reciting poetry ............ What?\n\nOne guy, after being chased by another guy with a shotgun runs into the guy's house, locks the door behind him and then calls the shotgun totin' killer redneck a \"dumbass\", from INSIDE THE GUY'S HOUSE? Then he stops to use the john (that, in and of itself, is stupid enough) but then he walks right by a rotting corpse in the bathtub TWICE and doesn't even notice it until the second time? And then Ma and Pa Kettle come in to save the day by driving their camper over one of the killers, and a crop duster comes in to deal with the other killer. The end scene in the hospital, with cameos by John Dugan and Marilyn Burns from the first movie, is so obscure and barely even noticeable that you can't tell it's them until someone tells you who they are.\n\nAt the beginning of this movie, the title reads: \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Next Generation\", at the end the title reads: \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". The filmmakers couldn't even agree on a title?\n\nEven for a zero budget, unreleased fourth chapter, more than twenty years after the first one, this is still just pathetic. It was filmed in 1994 and abandoned, not released until 1997, after two of the cast members became famous in other movies. and it shows why they didn't release this one sooner. (I saw this one in a theatre when it was finally released, and there was only one other person sitting in the entire movie theatre about 20 rows in front of me!) And now supposedly they're remaking the first movie? Again? Why?"

In that one Leatherface was an important character...here he is a cross dresser. Matthew who is playing the hitchhiker role from the first one is the main attraction and it just doesn't equal all that much terror this time around. I don't think a single person was killed with a chainsaw, unless it happened within the first 10 or so minutes that I missed before tuning in. My advice is skip this one and don't even watch it until you have seen the first one. If you want to see it after that it is up to you cause there are some positive reviews to be found for this one.

The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book. If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented \"Week End\".\n\nRotTCM should have gotten a 1. In fact I felt like I was disappointing moviegoers everywhere when I gave it a 2, but the extra point is the ever crafty curiosity value. Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-\"A Time to Kill\") and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (pre-\"Jerry Maguire\") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes). Texas Chain Saw fans will, of course, feel the completist need to see this, the death knell of the series. And finally, I think just the concept of Leatherface as a shrieking cross-dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers. But believe me folks, this still doesn't answer the ultimate question: Why?

Nothing will ever come close to TCM1, so I just sat back and enjoyed the sequels for the goofy horror films that they were. Tried to do that with this one, but I couldn't do it.\n\nLeatherface as a crossdresser seems to be the most controversial topic. I actually thought that this was more true to the the original character that portrayed in the sequels, because he wore a wig and makeup for the dinner sequences in TCM 1. Vilmer was a highlight too.\n\nBut that script! I just don't get it? What was the deal with that weird guy in the suit? Was he a govt agent, alien, member of the family? Then if you noticed, theres NO cannibalism in the family at all, which doesn't make sense in a TCM film. Rene Zellweger didn't seem to be particularly afraid or in any hurry to get away.\n\nI don't even remember if anyone got killed with a chainsaw at all in this movie. Lets see: Run over by a car, lit on fire, clubbed over the head, nope. I don't think anyone got the saw. Which shows how horrible this film really is to it's premise. No chainsaw killings in a film titled \"Texas CHAINSAW Massacre\"??? That's like, having the title but not having it take place in TEXAS.\n\nI really tried to like this film, but couldn't. I gave it a couple of chances, hoping it might be better the second time around or improve with age (Part 3 certainly has) It was awful, and even it's few good scenes don't make it worth watching even once. It's obvious Hooper was the reason TCM1 was as great as it was, not Henkel."

But There is a raw primal intensity that rules the film making the overly comical feel like true horror especially with the insane twist. Now I'm not saying it's believable by any means but theres a twisted theology that resonates through the proceedings. Written and directed by Kim Henkel of the original film it definitely has a weird retro feel to it all. Both Zellweger and the sexy and twisted McConaughey come out on top of the film. Both of their performances are solid and definitely leave the promise of their future cinematic endeavors and Oscar wins. All in all there's nothing like it. It's flawed and nowhere near perfect but its original and wild.

Teens get involved in a car crash and seek help from the wrong people. You get to see Leatherface, armed with a chainsaw, chase Rene Zellweger. Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) breaks necks with his bare hands, runs people down with his truck. There's an intriguing subplot about a secret society organising assassinations and inspiring terror but sadly it goes nowhere. The film was shelved for a few years and only re-released when Zellweger and McConaughey became stars. Written and Directed by Kim Henkel. 4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Two Prom Night couples find themselves stranded out in the backwoods at night after a motor accident and gradually become terrorized by a crazy, murderous family. Similar plot as the original movie, this fourth installment is pretty much a loose remake. I can remember being very disappointed with TCMNG years ago when I rented it out on VHS, now long overdue a re-watch, this time on DVD. Sadly my opinion has not changed. It does have some merits. Renee Zellweger, Matthew McConaughey & Tonie Perensky do put in some decent performances. The first half of the movie has an effectively creepy look about it And it does have a good balance of humour and horror for much of its course. Sadly though there are several things that let it down. Badly. For a start the Sawyer family here are the worst in the franchise. That's not to say that it is down to bad acting, rather the characters are just poor in comparison. Cross dressing Leatherface looks creepy but not so much threatening. Vilmer is too over the top, and W.E. is constantly spouting famous quotes, which rapidly becomes rather tiresome. Darla, the sole female member, was my favourite loony. There is a minor sub plot about an educated guy in a suit, something to do with a secret society but totally pointless. The first half of the film is quite good but I felt that it just fell apart during the second, and was quite relieved to see the end credits. There are a few cameo roles, actors from the original TCM - a nice touch - but that is not enough to help. Worst installment in the franchise in my opinion."

        "review_detailed_main": "I don't care much for horror flicks so I can't really form an opinion on this, except that I think it probably fell short of what was intended. I can however say that the man Leatherface was originally based on, the \"True Story\", was Ed Gein, a serial killer who wore a mask of human flesh and killed women at his remote home. The characters of Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill (Silence of The Lambs) were both also based on him and were, by all accounts, more accurate. Ed Gein also wore a suit of human flesh, including breasts, in an attempt to be more female, which accounts for Leatherface wearing a dress in this film. However, a lot more characterization should have been put into explaining this. For the record, Ed Gein worked alone, no family members helping him and certainly no grand family traditions of cannibalism, and the only two bodies ever found were killed with a pistol; no evidence ever pointed to him using a chainsaw on any of his victims. He was just another Jeffrey Dahmer-esq serial killer with a highly dysfunctional sense of eroticism."

Other than that, the film is pretty much unwatchable. The acting is horrible, The scares are laughable, and the end leaves you glad the 95 minute run time is over.

I really tried to watch the movie knowing that it could be very bad, but this is beyond any critic I or anybody can do (I\u00b4m feeling a very big stupid commenting on it).\n\nWorst film in years and what I\u00b4m really sure is that is far the worst horror or horror/comedy one ever.\n\nI rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 (There is always something lower!)"

The film starts off like an episode of the o.c. but it soon turns ugly, the youngsters get involved in a car accident and that's when you know the mayhem will begin and the group get split up. This film is very much like the original (even though kim henkel the director teaches film studies at a texan university) you would at least think that he could produce or help produce a script which would be original and keep viewers on the edge of there seats. some of the similarities in this film to the original are when jenny is escaping from leatherface she runs into another human being who could possible help her but is actually a member of the leatherface family another similarity is the fact that the kids are basically 2 couples just like the original all the needed then was to have a disabled brother and the characters would be exactly the same as the original. in this film I don't know whether it is intentionally done but the ending is very confusing like who was that British man with his chauffeur and who was in the plane which shot wilmer(matthew mccounahey) and also right at the end when jenny is at the hospital with the police men and he is reassuring her and sally(marliyn burns) is pushed past on a hospital bed by a hospital worker (paul 'franklin' partain)when i say intentionally done maybe in 1994 when the film was made they were hoping to make a sequel with the characters sally and jenny but because renee zellweger got really famous in jerry maguire and reality bites she would never return to the series and why did matthew mccounahey try to have this film stricken from the records and have it vaulted?"

She and her friends fall prey to the secret cannibals and murderous tow truck driver Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey).\n\nThis is a few months after Dazed and Confused. Both Zellweger and McConaughey would go from that indie darling to this forgotten horror comedy and eventually onwards to becoming Academy Awards winning stars. It's amazing to see the two Texans doing an iconic Texas horror franchise. Strict franchise fanatics would hate this Leatherface. There's no way any cinema snobs would like this. At the time, these future stars were nobodies. I can understand its dismissal at the time of its release. I myself am watching it for the first time. It is pure joy to watch McConaughey go full crazy and Zellweger finding her inner scream queen. This is also a little fun. Darla is a little funny but the drive-thru takes it too far. This movie has probably improved markedly due to the performances of its famous stars."

How is it done? Is it the constant screaming and whining, the transvestite element, the mullet, or the army jacket? Actually, it's all of the above, although the first two are certainly the worst. Leatherface doesn't instill any fear. You're only left wondering how they could have ruined him so badly.\n\nThe opening of four \"teens\" ending up stranded in the woods may not be the strongest opening, but it seems downright great compared to the climax. Don't expect a heart- pounding climax. It just reaches the absolute low at that point.\n\nTo be fair, there are some good scenes, but most of those are due to the performance of McConaughey or because they're basically rehashes from the original."

I mean, I suppose you could call Renee Zellweger is captured and runs away and is captured again and runs away again a plot, but you'd have to be in a pretty good mood. The original didn't have an exceptional screenplay, but it was enough to work with. This stuff is just embarrassing. But it's like a train wreck, it's difficult to look away. You're just so curious how much worse things can get. Things get all the more painful because even though it's crap, this movie actually looks like Kim Henkel (who used to be Tobe Hooper's co-writer) really tried to keep the spirit of the series alive. There's even a decent chase in there near the beginning, making me hesitate to give this the absolute lowest rating.

Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a monumental disaster, a crime against cinema, and possibly against anyone who dares to watch it. It's so incompetent that even the word \"terrible\" feels insulted by the association.\n\nThe most unbelievable part? The cast includes big names like Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, two future Oscar winners. But in 1994, it seems they just needed to pay the bills. Zellweger tries to salvage some dignity, but her character is so poorly written that it's impossible to make her iconic. And McConaughey? He seems to have turned every scene into a personal competition to see how over-the-top he could go. Spoiler: he wins every time.\n\nOne of the worst aspects of this mess is the pacing, which feels like medieval torture. The film drags on, with the magical ability to make ten minutes feel like fifty. It's an endless stream of absurd moments that lack the charisma and madness that define the franchise. And then there's Leatherface. He's not scary anymore - not even close. Honestly, it's hard to tell whether you should laugh or cry. This once-terrifying icon is now a pitiful character who just screams and wanders around aimlessly. It's like they hired Leatherface's distant cousin with cheap makeup because the real deal refused to show up.\n\nAnd the story? Oh, it's there, but it doesn't matter. Generic teenagers getting chased? Check. Random conspiracy theories that go nowhere? Check. A final act so ridiculous it almost erased itself from my memory out of sheer embarrassment? Double check. The movie leaves so many unanswered questions, it's as if the director was trolling us.\n\nThe funniest part? Sometimes the movie actually gets a few laughs - not because it's trying to be funny, but because it's so ridiculously bad that you can't help it.\n\nAt the end of the day, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation isn't just a bad movie. It's an endurance test for your patience and sanity. If you want to laugh and cringe at the same time, give it a watch. If not, do something more productive with your time - like assembling IKEA furniture. I promise, it's far more exciting."

It isn't long until they find out they are being toyed with by a degenerate, crazy family with cannibalistic roots and chainsaw wielding tendencies.\n\nWhen first viewing TCM: The Next Generation with no prior knowledge of the film, it's hard to believe how bad the movie would end up being. It's obvious when watching the opening five minutes that the film worked with an extremely low budget for a big-named sequel and a first time director. The film is filled with pointless dialogue and head-scratching scenes that don't belong at any point. There isn't any chainsaw related deaths and very few chainsaw scenes in general. Not to mention, they made Leatherface into an unlikable sissy figure from the traditional menacing maniac that he should be.\n\nThe film isn't completely trash though because there are a few times that are pretty laughable, and it can be entertaining to watch on the standpoint of it being a really bad movie. If the viewer can get past the terrible acting and writing, then give Next Generation a shot. Especially, if the viewer is a fan of Matthew McConaughey or Renee Zellweger, being Next Generation is one of their first films and they are the stars of the movie. It really isn't necessary to search out this film after watching the original trilogy and looking to move on to the newer modern day Texas Chainsaw films. Yes, Next Generation is that bad"

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, I know everyone's opinion is that the original movie is always better than the remake, and there is truth to that, but some movies have exceptions, like this one. I really thought the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was really cheesy, and it really didn't entertain me. I know what your gonna say, this movie was very entertaining, scary, and was anything but cheesy back in 1974, but it isn't 1974! To me a remake is just updating the film, but keeping it at it's original levels, in which most cases in remaking films, they just completely change the story and switch things back and forth, until youv'e got a whole different movie. This movie pretty much stuck to it's basic lines of the original film. Now with the acting in this film, it wasn't all too bad, although I've seen WAY better from Renee Zellweger. Matthew McConaughey's acting is always usually pretty good, so his acting level was the same. I also think a good thing about the movie is that the producer of the original film (Kim Henkel) directed this remake. I think that's good because she helped make the original, and should have the experience of dealing with this kind of movie. So, what I guess I'm trying to say here is that I really did enjoy this movie. Also, you can visit my site on it: www.texaschainsawmassacrethenextgeneration.freeservers.com\n\nAnyways, I loved this movie. I give Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation a 10 out of 10!! :)"

        "review_detailed_main": "I was fairly late to the \"Chainsaw Massacre\" movies, being only 20 years old. I remember one day walking in to Wal-Mart and finding this movie for $3 on VHS and I was intrigued: I wasn't alive to experience the \"shocking\" first film, and I barely remembered the second film from when I was a child, so I figured I might as well take a chance and purchase this. This was from years ago -- before I discovered ultra-gory movies, before I really had much knowledge of horror movies in general, and... wow. Then and now, this movie holds up.\n\nThe biggest thing about this film is that people seem to suggest that it doesn't live up to the legacy of the Chainsaw series. Having watched all the films in the series now, I can say that this is EASILY the best of the lot. The most entertaining, the most hilarious, and the most memorable. Sure, it doesn't \"shock\" and \"awe\" like the other (overrated) entries supposedly do, but it does have its merits: Matthew McCoughnahay is just hilarious in his role as truck driver with a robot leg. \"First I'm gonna kill ya... it ain't no f***ing biggy.\" You'll be quoting him for weeks.\n\nRenee Zellwegger, in her best role ever, actually looks pretty good as an abused daughter and proceeds to run away from Leatherface barefooted, sees all her friends get killed, and gets her face licked by some businessman with weird tattoos and piercings on his chest.\n\nThere seems to be no point to this entire film. I guess Leatherface killed JFK. And is a transvestite now. And is somehow affiliated with the government, and people need to learn the true meaning of \"horror. Horror.\" And what's with the ending? The man and the woman in the trailer have a different person dubbing their voices for them? Why? And what about the airplane flying around and then suddenly hitting a character in the head and oil comes out of their brain? What? ... I'm not going to say that this is a serious film by any means, but it is definitely the most memorable. Ten out of ten."

It's exhausting to watch and helps tremendously to the films benefit. It's punishing and nightmarish and never lets up for a second. Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger provide star power to spare and they act circles around everyone else, both giving 280% from the get go. This films Leatherface is an unhinged, screaming force of nature. Truly disturbing and scary. Someone you DO NOT want chasing after you with a revving chainsaw. And the Illuminati angle? Just go with it. After the first film this is the best part of the series, closely followed by the Marcus Nispel remake starring Jessica Biel. TCM 4 is a truly underrated intentional schlocksterpiece."

I think that would be the reason. This a very scary movie. I keep hearing that the fifth part to the original series Chainsaw massacre 3.D is better. This a great movie. And Chainsaw massacre 3.D is just awful. I The Texas chainsaw massacre remake from 2003 is not better then is movie. It is just boring crape. I can't believe people think Texas chainsaw massacre the beginning is better. That movie is producible and boring. In this movie you don't know what is going to happen still you see it. The fist three The Texas chainsaw massacre movies are better but only by a little bite. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. I consider this horror fantasy because the killer in this movie are ghouls. This movie is a must see."

        "review_detailed_main": "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation\" is far better than it's reputation has given it.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nAfter a disastrous night at their prom, students Jenny, (Renee Zellweger) Sean, (John Harrison) Barry, (Tyler Cone) and Heather, (Lisa Marie Newmeyer) get stranded on a dirt road and ask local Darla, (Tonie Perensky) for help. Making their way through the woods back to wait for Vilmer, (Matthew McConaughey) they wind up lost in the surrounding woods. When they're taken back to their house, they are eventually captured by Leatherface, (Robert Jacks) and W.E., (Joe Stevens) and the rest of their family. Gathering up her strength and courage, the dwindling group is forced to fight off the family before they are all killed.\n\nThe Good News: There is an incredible amount to like here. Perhaps one of the best features is that it's a loving tribute to the original but changes them around enough to really get a sense of it being something new. The opening twist is pretty nice, changing the funeral trip to a prom night disaster, which is pretty nice. The chainsaw chase is still the highlight here, and while not being as intense as before, it's still a real spectacular action set-piece, taking a generally similar approach while altering events to a degree to be a winking nod to the ones before while also being new in it's own right. The dinner table sequence makes a nice come-back, and is, if not as psychologically disturbing, just as edgy and confronting. It's still a must-see experience in the film. Also quite impressive is the sequence where the victims are dragged to the kitchen to be stored away for later. It's an incredibly long, drawn-out sequence that is as disturbing as it gets, and it should rightfully be so in that situation. It's played for what it should've been, a really intense unflinching experience and it's all the better for it for having done so in that fashion. The film is incredibly suspenseful, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the opening stages. The forest setting given to the action is enormously menacing, almost from the start. The very low light, the constant fog that drapes the ground, and the fact that they just pop up in there out of nowhere really warps the mind. The sequence where they encounter a truck driving down the road and chase off into the darkness after it while only one stays on the normal path is full of tension and dread. Along the chase, this was the real highlight scene, and a strong contender is the opening murder. Having the victim chased down the road by a huge monster truck with blaring lights shining up the location and what eventually happens is quite a breathtaking action scene that really sticks out in the movie. Even more impressive is the gang-banger pace to the film. It rushes along from one even to another in a heartbeat, with the eventual capture around the fifty minute mark, allowing for plenty of time to be tortured in the house, and that also leaves the beginning to be a completely whirlwind experience. Add these together, and this has the makings of an underrated gem.\n\nThe Bad News: While it's a true hidden gem, there are a couple of nagging problems in this one. The most obvious one is that Leatherface has been severely diminished in status for the film. He's barely in the film at all, and when he is on-screen, he's really ineffective. The sequence of him taking the two friends out to be killed is twice as long as it should've been, as they keep escaping and getting recaptured. The mask itself is a real disappointment from the clever and original one in the previous film, and the sad fact that he had to wear a mask and outfit that made it seem like he was a drag queen isn't all that frightening. As is common practice for the series, there's really no body count here, and this in turn really reduces the gore in here. It's got some suspenseful scenes to help out, but the lack of gore on display is really frightening. The new family doesn't do much to help out, and at times they're not at all that edge to them that previous ones had. As such, the fact that it also changes some of the original's magic is a big misstep, and depending on how far an individual's perspective of that is, it's quite damaging to the original. The ending is also pretty hard to figure out and really doesn't do much to help with the explanations of anything. These work against it, but it's nowhere near as bad as it could've been.\n\nThe Final Verdict: A fun, if unoriginal romp through familiar territory, this is a really wrongly maligned film that deserves to be viewed objectively. It's not the best film in the genre, and it really wasn't pretending to be. If you can view films in that manner, give it a shot, but steer clear if that doesn't sound like you.\n\nRated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity"

Realistically it's probably a 6.\n\nAlso worth noting - Matthew McConnaughy is hot as hell in this.\n\nRepeating again for the stupid character count minimum: Matthew McConnaughy is hot as hell in this. Spicy hot. A horrible psychotic bad boy murderer but still hot."

And unlike other Texas Chainsaw movies that mainly focus on Leatherface the most, it's perfect how this one shares a fair amount of camera time to the rest of the deranged family members as well. Another thing I love is the splash of Comedy they add to the movie. It's a perfect mixture with all the Chaos happening between everyone in it. So yeah, a great film all around. The actors did a fantastic job playing psychotic maniacs. A Great movie overall, entire cast was amazing."
