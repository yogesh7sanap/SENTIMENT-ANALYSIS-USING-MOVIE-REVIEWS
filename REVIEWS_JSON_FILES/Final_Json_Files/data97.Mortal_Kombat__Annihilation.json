The fight scenes are pathetic and the choreography is even worse than its predecessor. The special effects are terrible and worse than you can possibly imagine. The storyline is nonexistent. There are a lot of scenes and parts which make no sense whatsoever. But at no point is it ever boring. So it is highly watchable despite being a piece of crap. If you be a fan of the MK franchise or are expecting a good movie, watch it to see how bad a movie can get, just for education. It does however take a special kind of talent to ruin a franchise and movie which already has a good plot in place (refer to the MK video games). This movie's entire cast and crew have that talent and so does a retard called Paul Anderson."

The problem is the HUGE let down in the martial arts and special effects scenes. MK had some terrific fight scenes, such as the brilliant Cage/Scorpion fight in the forest, the great Liu Kang/SubZero fight, and the cool finale with Shang Tsung. Annihilation didn't have any fight scenes up to the quality of those three, many of the fight scenes made no sense, and the finale was horrible.

Now, I thought the first MK was an OK film, great soundtrack, OK acting and plenty of fighting. A good no-brainer actioner. But this....this....defies belief.\n\nHow on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings? It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson! The actors playing the bad guys overacted so awfully it was painful to watch, expecially the centaur guy. He exuded ham to a level I've not seen before.\n\nThe special effects were truly special, but only in a \"special needs\" kind of way. Looks like they were lifted straight from the video game itself. Laugh as you watch something resembling a dragon perform martial arts very badly. Laugh as Brian Thompson turns into a......thing. Laugh at the terrible lack of detail in it all. Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh and laugh again, right up until they slap the straightjacket on you and cart you off to the loony bin. Because only someone truly demented would want to sit through this terrible, terrible film.\n\nEh? What's that Doc? Yes, I know I sat through it. But it was all in the name of science, you see. I was doing research. By the way, you couldn't loosen this jacket a bit, could you?\n\nAnyway, as I say, the best actor was Brian Thompson. Only he saved it from getting a 1, but even then, the rest prevented it from getting any more than a 2.\n\nAvoid it if you value your sanity!"

The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.\n\nWeak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.\n\nThe actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).\n\nSame could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).\n\nWhat was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.\n\nLine example: Kitana: \"My mother is dead.\" Sindel: \"As will be her daughter!\" Gimmie a break!

Mortal Kombat 2 is a real roller coaster. Fast and, yes it's unpredictable in some ways. Everybody say - CGI is bad. Yes, it is. But practical effects are good. Some sets are very beautiful. The rythm of fight scenes is on top with original Kang vs Reptile battle. Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn is kind of funny, but there is something about humorous Shao Kahn)) New Sonya looks like a legit fighter to me. New Raiden is miscast. James Remar is fantastic as always, but it's not Raiden. I don't mind. I was video games fan in the 90s, and I know what pain is. No movie based on video games was \"right\" then. Street fighter, Mario Brothers, MK - all good movies, but not right in terms of video game lore. Anyway, Mortal Kombat Annihilation was interesting and bold project that wasn't quite right. Give it a try if you like old martial arts films with a B sci-fi vibes."

I was a big fan of Mortal Kombat video game when i was a kid, especially MK3 and its charachters like Noob Saibot, Smoke, Ermac. I have watched Mortal Kombat movie few times, it was never a good flick but it was a solid homage to original video game. Years have passed and somehow i have never watched this one, i had a feeling that it is really bad and i was right, but still after 20 and more years i wanted to see it myself. Recently i had a marathon of watching bad movies only, i really enjoy some campy and cheese movie for brainless fun, mostly from the 80s, and Annihaliton found its place on that list. And i am sad that i gave it opportunity, this was utterly bad experience from start to finish. The direction is awful, fights are short and stupid, acting is beyond any level and CGI is the worst i have ever seen in any movie. Some mentioned that the only good part is Shao Khan played by Brian Thompson, but his acting is ridicilous like everything in this movie. There are too many charachters in this sequel and i think the main goal of this movie was to intorduce all the characters from the game to better sell it in the market. This movie is utter disaster and i dont recommend even to the fans of Mortal Kombat franchise. Stay further away from this one, only if you want to annihilate your own brain cells watched it but be careful, mortal kombat for your brain awaits you."

We get to see basically all of the important MK characters (except,sadly, the return of shang and goro) all fulfilling their roles which they had in the game, which of coarse leads to them being rushed in and eventually under used. I like the general colour and fun atmosphere of it though,Emacs red,scorpions yellow,and of coarse liu kang being decimated by smoke for some reason in a very good fight scene.\n\nBut forget all of this,enjoy the movie for what its supposed to be, a colourful action packed pop corn flick So go out,grab an 8 pack and a friend,spark up and ENJOY!"

        "review_detailed_main": "Having won the battle of the realms in the first film, Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and others enjoy a short period of peace on Earth. Then one day leader of the outer realm Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) opens up a portal between the two realms and announces that he intends to merge the two realms in six days. With time ticking away, can Liu Kang and his crew stop Shao Kahn in time?\n\nI didn't care much for the first film, but curiosity got the better of me so I decided that I'd give the sequel a shot (really just to see if it's as bad as its rating suggests, and sadly it is).\n\nThe first film had a storyline that was quite poorly developed, but it wasn't totally ridiculous. Here we basically have a 'world domination' storyline in place because the outer realm lost the battle with the Earth Realm. If you take away all the pretence then it boils down to the outer realm being sore losers. Playing this sequel as a straight forward revenge film would have been a better move.\n\nI'm probably giving this film too much credit by discussing the story because it seemed like the writers didn't care much for the story themselves. It seemed that any time there was an attempt at character interaction or plot development that we would have a ridiculous fight sequence coupled with the over-bearing soundtrack that we saw in the first film. The first film was directed MTV Style, but this film looks as though it was directed by someone on acid - the fight sequences were much more over the top, the editing was choppy and the choreography was laughable. It's almost like the director went for the bigger is better approach, but it just doesn't quite work here.\n\nThe dialogue between the characters was laughable and painful. One of the worst examples of this is when Kahn is looking for a new general. This scene gives us some of the most cringe inducing exchanges of dialogue that I've ever heard. We're also handed some laughable plot twists, villains that are more cartoonish than anything else and don't even start me on the final fight scene between Liu Kang and Kahn sigh....\n\nThe only thing that made this film very slightly tolerable was Jax. He provided the film with the occasional moment of comic relief, but this aspect alone is not enough to save this utter shambles. The only other minor positive that I took from watching this sequel is that it made me appreciate the first film more. Yes the first film was quite a bad film with a multitude of problems, but it was nowhere near as embarrassing or laughable as this sequel."

Then there is the story and acting. While the former movie got the right balance of seriousness and taking itself not too serious, this movie fails. There are a lot of scenes / stuff that should be engaging. But it is pointless, an under-performance or unintentionally hilarious. I don't blame the actors. Even the best actors /actress cant get much out of an awful script or a bad role. What troubles me the most are the sparks of good ideas in this movie. With adaptations and improvements you could make a better or even good movie out of the setting and some ideas. Then there are the fights. While I admit that the final confrontation is engaging the total performance is disappointing. It is sadly not even \"So bad that it is good\". That would at least improve the rating. Overall I would not rewatch and forget that this movie exist. The best I got out of it was the idea to let Dirk Nowitzki play Basketball against Bernie Sanders (and his team?).

With an exception of Lui Kang and Kitana, EVERY character is replaced. and not for the better.. Personally, I think Sonya Blade is hotter in this one than the first but she's a worse actor so that pretty much cancels out.\n\nThe story is garbage! It doesn't even follow the game! It's clearly noticeable that the ONLY goal as far as the story, was for it to include as many characters and their 'in-game moves' as they could regardless of their back stories. For example, Jax is a character that lost his arms in the game and replaces them with robotic ones. In the movie, he has his arms but they are 'muscle enhancers'... doesn't even make much sense to me.\n\nI honestly can't tell if the script is god-awful or the acting. Was it a great script that was poorly performed or great performances that had to be executed the way they were due to how it was written? I take that back. I can tell. It's both a terrible script with god awful performances.\n\nSets, costumes, and stunts were all pretty bad as well. The costumes make you feel like you're in a college Halloween party while the sets look like they were cheaply made at my mom's house.\n\nThe stunts/fight scenes are all executed in a way that made them seem like they were trying to be the deleted fight scene of a power rangers episode.\n\nThe soundtrack from the first movie went platinum! In 10 days!! This time? It sounded like a 10 year old kid's Zumba class...\n\nOverall, this movie ONLY to be watched as a joke. It is the epitome of the thought that a video game should STAY a video game! I gave it 3 stars because I'm a huge fan of the game so seeing some of my favorite characters was cool (even if I had to be some form of intoxicated to enjoy it) and also, this movie helped guide me to know what NOT to have made my scorpion Halloween costume look like."

The only fault is the untimely death of Johnny Cage, masterfully played by Chris Conrad this go around. Brian Thompson is also very impressive as Shao Khan.

        "review_detailed_main": "Well, let me tell you...it's a real let down. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still \"ok\" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation has no substance, form, direction or anything remotely resembling a competent cast of actors. The director must have been a coffee machine or something, I really can't see why they decided to make a sequel. The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK: Annihilation...\n\nA dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MK:Annihilation. So I was like...\"Damn, this is a glorified power rangers...\" I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit. RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do? They give us a Doogie Howser lookalike who is in need of orthodontic work. Every time we see him he's through a brick wall or falling off something high. He's like a piece of ham, but with less acting ability. All his words of 'wisdom' are like \"We have to work as a team, courage...courage...look within yourself at your...courage.\" Jax is just a token black guy, Sonya is admittedly hot, but not as hot and/or as kick ass as the original Sonya. Johnny Cage gets instantly killed by some 'thug' in a skull (the final 'boss') at the very beginning. Kitana and Liu Kang are just like the 'sexually' tense element of the film. They have the funniest (not meant to be funny) part of the movie, where the \"hardcore\" Sheeva, with 4 arms, having spent the entire movie looking fearsome and generally like a big, brutal beast...runs in and says \"The date is over.\" In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks. 10 seconds of pure \"Why was she even in the movie?\" goodness.\n\nThere isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are \"misty\" and \"firey/smokey\" and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.\n\nOK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use \"We needed to make money\" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.\n\nAh well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like \"I have to see MK annihilation\" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something \"good\". Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct. At least not anything past Power Rangers or something? Anyhow, thats just how I felt about this movie. T_T"

        "review_title": "One of the more infamous sequels of the past twenty years, \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" is a fundamental mess, though it is certainly good for plenty of unintentional laughs.",
        "review_detailed_main": "One thing all 90's kids can agree on is that 1995 brought us one of the most kick-butt movies of the decade with the release of the movie adaptation of \"Mortal Kombat\"- based of course on the popular arcade games of the same name.\n\nIt was a huge hit, coming out at the perfect time to thrill audiences in a market that hadn't yet suffered martial arts and CGI overload. It boasted a fun storyline with mayhem and magic, had that amazing techno-song, was populated with likable actors and was filled to burst with tons of awesome moments. Who doesn't remember the hilarious intro to Johnny Cage, or the amazing puppetry on Goro, or the sweet Liu Kang VS Sub-Zero match?\n\nWith the game series ever-growing and expanding the mythology and the first film being such a pleasant surprise, we just knew that the inevitable sequel was gonna be bigger and better! There's no way it couldn't!\n\n...right?\n\nThen reality slapped us in the face with 1997's \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\" A film that has gone on to join the ranks of \"Batman & Robin\" and \"Speed 2\" as one of the most infamous sequels of not only the 90's, but arguably of all time. A failure that squanders all potential and destroys virtually all left-over good-will from the first movie and instead replaces it with laughable writing, strangely over-the-top performances, bizarrely dated effects even at the time and mind- blowingly bad visual direction.\n\nPicking up immediately after the original ends, the evil emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal from Outworld and begins a process that will merge it with the Earth in six-days time, giving him total power. Now, our Earth-heroes Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Jax and Raiden must find a way to stop this devious scheme or else the Earth will be lost forever.\n\nThat may sound like a solid enough foundation to build a movie off of, but trust me... it doesn't work. The film is beyond fractured and frankly every single scene just lumps on more plot-holes, unanswered questions and contrived pseudo-explanations in order to justify the proceedings... mainly so it can tenuously connect the constant onslaught of bad fight scenes that make up a majority of the screen time.\n\nDirector John R. Leonetti seems in over his head with this film- his directorial debut, taking over for original director Paul WS Anderson. Leonetti and his army of screenwriters are never able to find any real sort-of balance with tone, pace or style. Scenes come and go are strange intervals, humor and drama never quite gel together, and sub-plots and characters are constantly jarringly introduced and dropped without consequence or reason. The visuals are also a marked step- down from the original, with many shots being poorly thought- out and unable to be cut together competently.\n\nThere's also the issue of padding and choreography in many of the fights that lends to it all feeling very dull and forced. While the first film's action does have a slight air of feeling \"fake\" in retrospect, it can be forgiven as it was one of the first truly hit martial-arts-based films in the US. But this one just ramps up that problem, with so many unneeded flips and tricks that are thrown in to be \"cool\" and \"the bomb\", that it just feels tacky and false. By the time you see the thirtieth random backflip, you'll feel like doing some flipping yourself... flipping the channel to something else.\n\nThe performances are among some of the hammiest I've seen in a major blockbuster. The only person who really emerges unscathed is the criminally underrated Robin Shou returning to his role of Liu Kang. He's great. Everyone else? A caricature. Lynn \"Red\" Williams as Jax is a giant goofball who throws around unfunny one-liners like its nobody's business. Reiner Sch\u00f6ne chews the scenery as Kahn's evil father. Brian Thompson constantly SHOUTS his lines at RANDOM in an attempt to sound THREATENING as our lead villain. But of course Musetta Vander steals the show with her legendarily bad take on Princess Kitana's mother Sindel, spouting some of the worst dialog ever written with the glee of a 12-year-old on a sugar-high. It's outlandish watching her twirl and cackle and wave her arms about in her scenes... What did she think she was even doing? Was she trying to channel Ace Ventura for her role?\n\nAdd to that...\n\n-Lowered production values (Gag-worthy green-screens and clearly rubber \"metal\" on the costumes and sets galore!)\n\n-Shoddy costume design that looks like the actors are dressed in the Wal-Mart Halloween costumes based on the movie rather than in real movie costumes\n\n-Wildly dated effects that looked bad even in 1997 (We're talking \"Tron\" quality CGI at times... except this was made 15 years later)\n\n...and more and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nThat being said, I do have to make a somewhat startling admission...\n\n...I kinda like this movie. Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. But it's so bad, that it springs right back up as one of those unintentional \"so bad, it's kinda good\" camp classics. There's no way to hear lines of dialog like those you hear in this film (\"You're alive!\" \"...too bad YOU WILL DIE!\") without howling with laughter. There's no way to see the incompetent fight sequences where people are flipping through the air like helium-filled balloons without chuckling and shaking your head. There's no way to see the awful, 80's quality digital creatures flying about without a big-old smirk coming across your face.\n\nSo, if you like so-bad-they're-good flicks... This is one for the ages!\n\nI give \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" a 3 out of 10. It's an awful sequel that effectively killed a franchise. But with some friends and maybe some booze, you'll still have a grand time tearing it apart and laughing at its sheer ineptitude."

Yeah I know that the budget's not too big, 40$ millions, but that's not the point, the point that the director tried to transcribe the game universe on the screen. And did it successful, there a lot of encounters, special effects, cool-techno-music and all this makes it very interesting Mortal Kombat: Annihilation movie. I like the game and I admire low-budget movies with their cheap effects. But if you don't, simply DON'T WATCH IT. First play the MK games series and THEN compare with the movie."

That means no more spectacular Raiden performance from Christopher Lambert, which was very disappointing.\n\nThe story was all over the place and all I could think while watching was 'What did I just see?' 'Why did that happen?' 'Wait, did someone just turn 2D and get folded up like paper Mario?' Seriously, the plot was bafflingly random and nonsensical.\n\nI will say though, it is a very funny movie with a lot of memorable moments and quotable lines, although maybe for all the wrong reasons. But still, I can't say I didn't have some fun while watching, but it would definitely have been more fun if they kept the original cast. Especially Raiden. 2.9/10."

The film is not amazing, the acting isn't amazing, the plot isn't amazing, the directing isn't amazing etc. However to anyone who enjoys martial arts there are real talented people in this film and a few nice martial arts moves to see. Sandra Hess European karate champion as Sonya Blade, Robin Shou Wu Shu gold medal winner in various competitions in China, JJ Perry 5th degree taekwando and 2nd degree hapkido blackbelt etc.. There are not as many good martial arts moments as a good deal of other martial arts films, the film could have gotten a lot more out of all of this talent that's for sure, however there are still talented martial artists in this film and there are one or two nice moves to sit and watch for any true martial arts fan."

Anyways, yes, this movie has crappy CGI, horrible acting, a brain-dead story, piss poor dialogue and some of the characters look retarded. Guess what? I love this movie for the all these reasons.

        "review_detailed_main": "Traditionally, movies made from videogames are crap...at best. While you might have a very hard time thinking of any good ones, horrible films like \"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" quickly come to mind. Why? Well, because videogames don't need to be deep, have much plot or even make sense if the game play is good. Here, however, as a passive observer, all the lack of substance in the game plots are obvious as you sit and watch the silliness. Think about it....this is based on a game whose only plot is people punch and kill each other!\n\nI ahve not seen the first \"Mortal Kombat\" and the only reason I saw this one is that it's on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list...the lowest rated 100 films which have received at least 10,000 votes. This means independent and almost forgotten films aren't on the list...just the bigger named, widely distributed crappy movies.\n\nFrom what I gathered, humans winning the first movie guaranteed that the Earth would be safe for like 100 or a bazillion years. However, here, the baddies from another world are back only two years later. So much for continuity. In the initial portion of the movie, they tried to explain this away to all the human characters, as they also realized the plot problem! That's clumsy. So, the rest of the film consist of some human warriors somehow overcoming Shao Kahn's evil gang of fighters.\n\nSo is this any good? Of course not...10,000+ voters aren't wrong in this case. But there are some good things about the film. For 1997, the special effects are very nice--which is important since the story is essentially ALL special effects and crazy costumes. Also, they captured the look of the game quite well. But, no the other hand, the film is simply one insane fight after another after another after another. Not much plot...and it all makes your brain very numb very quickly. In fact, after about 20 minutes of this, my brain was screaming for a break! Overall, a pretty dull film despite its almost constant action and nutty fight scenes. I simply didn't care about any of these characters and just wanted it all to stop! My verdict...just go play a videogame yourself...you're bound to have more fun."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation could have easily made the franchise into a successful trilogy of movies, but as the tagline implies, this movie destroyed all expectations.\n\nEverything that worked in the first movie is absent here. The majority of returning characters are portrayed by new actors (with the exceptions of Robin Shou as Liu Kang, and Talisa Soto as Kitana). It also doesn't help that the acting this time around is terrible as everyone's performances range from stale (James Remar as Rayden) to over the top (Brian Thompson as Shao Kahn).\n\nThe script is riddled with plot holes, and comes off as nonsensical. The movie also follows a simple pattern; fighting, running, talking, and it goes on throughout the entire run time of the movie.\n\nThere is a lack of character development as the movie attempts to cram in as many characters from the more popular games in the Mortal Kombat franchise (mainly Mortal Kombat II and MK3), and the majority of them have limited screen-time as they either get killed off, or disappear after their 1 scene.\n\nOf course, we have to take a look at the action, but the fight scenes are pretty lackluster this time around. We had some impressive stuff choreography-wise in the first movie, but all of the fight scenes here feel rushed.\n\nThere's an overabundance of special effects in the movie, and yet, every single one of them look terrible, even for 1997. Supposedly, this movie had a bigger budget than the first movie, and yet, it looks nowhere near as impressive. Production and cinematography- wise, the whole movie looks and feels like a cheap straight-to-video sequel rushed out to capitalize on the success of the first movie.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation suffers the same problems as the majority of the other movies based on video games, it didn't feel like they tried to make a proper movie based on the game, but instead a product that tries shoehorning references to said game in a way that feels gimmicky, but as far as the genre goes, this stands as the worst film of the genre for being a colossal disappointment following its entertaining and well made predecessor, and a prime example of shoddy filmmaking (so much that it almost rivals anything directed by Uwe Boll).\n\nDo yourself a favor, stick to the first movie and the video games, avoid this stinker."

I mean video games had better visuals then this film has all together.\n\nAs a fan of the first Mortal Kombat movie I will say yes that film wasn't perfect but it had at least try to make itself a hit and it was.\n\nI consider the first Mortal Kombat to have been done right. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does not.\n\nThe acting in the film is simply awful the cast seem that they were trying to make a bad video game and also the writing in the film is just plain bad. Also the story is really weak.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about the film is that if you don't watch it you'll be better off because this film really don't do anything to award the viewer\n\nI give Mortal Kombat: Annihilation an 2 out of 10"

        "review_detailed_main": "The Mortal Kombat franchise has become a massive hit among gamers around the world, despite the overwhelming controversy surrounding its portrayal of graphic violence. This sparked a film adaptation which was crafted in the hands of Paul W. S. Anderson. Although the original was far from reaching a classic status and fell short of its cinematic potential in terms of writing and visuals, there was at least some level of competence to be endured. This sequel on the other hand, is an abhorrent disaster. Stripping away from the proper ingredients of a competent fantasy epic, this film operates at an significantly low level of proficiency, a level that makes its predecessor look like an Oscar flick. Sustaining a hodgepodge of a thinly written plot, painfully inept visuals, and paper-thin characters, this film is a cinematic inert slog that slips into the cracks of unintentional comedy. Picking up where the last film left off, Shao Kahn (played by Brian Thompson), an evil emperor from a realm known as Outworld has invaded Earth and set it wipe out the human race with his sadistic extermination squad made up of characters only the fans of the video game would be familiar with. With the rules of the Mortal Kombat broken and the fate of humanity at stake, Liu Kang (played by Robin Shou), Sonya (played by Sandra Hess, replacing Bridgette Wilson), Raiden (played by James Remar), Kitana (played by Talisa Soto), and half-human, half-robot Jax (played by Lynn Red Williams) become the last line of defense against Shao Kahn's tyranny.\n\nThe conductor behind this cinematic misfit is John R. Leonetti who replaces original director Paul W. S. Anderson who went to work on the science-fiction horror thriller 'Event Horizon'. If there is anything that Leonetti successfully accomplishes throughout this picture, it would be staying faithful to the source material. Everything else though, is a simply a disaster. While the story kicks off a passable premise, it is not long before the plot melts into a generic slog. The story advances at a brisk pace with multiple fight sequences punctuating at every turn. This would be account to some excitement if these sequences were actually fun, or even visually appealing. Unfortunately, the action is sloppily decorated with laughable CGI and poor blue/green screen effects that render them thrill-less. And like the original, they shed away from the M-rated graphic violence that the video game franchise is widely known for. The biggest eyesore comes in the final battle sequence in which Robin Shou's Liu Kang morphs into a giant dragon resembling an abysmal paper cutout of Godzilla. As for the acting department, very few of the cast turn in competent performances. With the character pitted with cheesy dialogue that is more likely to provoke unintentional chuckles than emotional impact, it is genuinely difficult to connect with these characters even when the fate of the universe at the stake, unless you have grown a fandom of them from playing the video games.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation is the epitome of a cinematic sequel gone wrong, and is one that should strongly be avoided, unless you are looking for something in the \"so bad it's good\" category. The film is horribly crafted in terms of narrative and visual compulsion. In a good of advice, you would probably making better use of your time by sticking with the original."

Take a look at Son of the Mask or Blade III for examples of poor sequels. Mortal Kombat Annihilation is iron-clad proof-positive that video games with NEVER, EVER, EVER make good movies. I don't understand why they keep trying.\n\nThe first Mortal Kombat movie was FAR from brilliance. But it still had great energy, a (rather dumb) sense of humor and a really cool score by George S. Clinton crammed full of techno and trance tunes. And the fight scenes, while not graphic or breathtaking, were pure eye-candy.\n\nThis sequel is cheaper, has a different cast of no-name actors, has poor, badly shot, cut and lit fight scenes, really shoddy sets and rubbish effects. The dialogue is gut-churningly horrible and the story will make you laugh out loud with it's stupidness. Seriously, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a definite contender for Mystery Science Theatre 3000.\n\nAbsolute horses balls from beginning to end. Everyone involved in making this film should be blacklisted and never allowed to work in Hollywood again."

The movie is nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed fight sequences that mix live-action foregrounds with complexly layered digital effects and are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements. The sequel to a bad movie is quite serious, charmless and bad in every sense of the word."

        "review_detailed_main": "We begin where the first left off with the earth being saved for another generation by those chosen humans to defend it in martial arts tournament. But the Mortal Kombat rules are broken when the malicious emperor of the outworld, Shao Khan, plans to bring together his realm with that of the earth within seven days. If that happens, mankind shall no longer exist. So it's up to a couple of martial arts warriors led by the Lord Rayden to stop that from happening.\n\nMy, my, my. Why did I waste such precious time on this? Even I'm confused. I guess that's one of lives many mysteries that cannot be explained. The first film, which was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, was rubbish too, but at least it was enjoyable in that aspect and the time flew by quick enough that you didn't have many moments to nick-pick over the inconsistencies. 'Mortal Kombat' also captured some of the visual power of the game, which 'Annihilation' fell incredibly short of. This sequel picks right up where the first left off but instead it goes for a grand epic (but derivative) story then that off the first film's basic premise. So, soon before it begins, the film has already run out of steam and turns into one banal and convoluted mess. I couldn't stop thinking that I was watching a long-winded episode of 'Days of our Lives' with a fantasy twist involved. I say that because of the corny dialog and melodramatic speeches and conversations that had me flinching. Also throw in some moralistic jargon and a script that takes itself far TOO seriously. The whole we're a family now and feel good drivel drove me crazy. It threw in everything, but the kitchen sink. After all that you just want to break out the tissues! The underlining humour in the first is all but forgotten in the follow-up and makes for one colourless viewing. The performances treaded the same path as well. Flimsy characters that bore you to death because they're so uninteresting and limp. Some just disappeared without a trace to never be heard off again. Those who stood around would rather pose most of the time. The shapeless bad guys follow the standard traits and intentions that you can see the writers really stretched their minds to come up with. Gee even the gimmicky (Halloween) costumes they wore were inferior. Although Sandra Hess as Sonya Blade was nice to look at, but the acting from all involved left a lot to be desired. No wonder why the likes of Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson kept clear of this massive stink bomb.\n\nI wouldn't put it pass it being one of Uwe Boll's (House of the dead, Alone in the dark) favourite flicks. Surely the filming techniques here were an inspiration for Boll. There are some uncanny similarities from the techno soundtrack kicking right in with the bland action scenes. Hectic editing mixed with some slow motion. While the phony set designs are plain pitiful. It was all artificially void. Boll would be right at home here, that's for sure. But then again I wonder just how much of a budget this flick had compared to Boll's flicks. This one tries to look all-snazzy and throws in a lot colour in the cartoon background and unconvincing effects. But it lacks the sharp grace and the bit of style and charm that made the original entertaining. This flick's fights seemed pointless and without merit, with one lethargically repetitive one after another. The direction is poorly executed and the pacing is somewhat too slow. Simply put, this sequel that drains the life out of you, was just uncalled for.\n\nWake me up from this bad dream. Well, it can actually put you asleep with its insipid output. Overall, it doesn't do any justice to the already awfully weak sub-genre of video game turned movie. Listen to the majority, avoid like hell!"

Of course they did appear only for a couple of minutes but still it was worth seeing them in this. In this movie Liu Kang has to fight Shao Khan Raiden's brother in order to save the world and all other realms. With the help of Sonya, Jax, Katana and Raiden they defeat Shao Khan and the world is saved. As for Raiden he becomes one of the Elder Gods.

The characters came off as overly stereotypical and two-dimensional. This movie might have been more enjoyable sans dialogue, as at least the action sequences were intense and well choreographed. I really wish that the producers of this stinker would have put a little bit more thought into the actual plot rather than just money into the special effects budget.

But, seeing as how I enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat as a young adolescent male, I figured I'd give it a try, it would only cost me 3$ and barely 1 & \u00bd hours if every instinct I had proved to be right. Well, after trying to watch this film (I guess you can call it a film since it is barely feature length. but even that was too much for me since I turned it off after 20 minutes) for the first time on home video, I can truly say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The sample (thank God I had the sense to turn it off when I did) was enough for me to rate it as `almost' one of my least favourite films, garnering a 2/10. Some might say 2/10 was gracious, however I've seen some truly wretched films (Not another teen movie, Batman & Robin, Caligula etc.) and I felt I couldn't give it worse since I only managed to stomach 20 minutes. I took the hit, kissed my three bucks goodbye, rated it and forgot about it as quickly as I could.\n\nUnluckily, as fate would have it, I recently decided to make a compilation of some of my least favourite movies and rate them anew, and although Mortal Kombat: Annihilation did not make the cut it was somehow in the back of my mind. Like the memory of the aftermath of a night of binge drinking, I couldn't shake the ghastly feeling of sickness any time I though of the first viewing of the film. So when the film happened to show up on TV (who knows what the station directors were thinking when they OK'd that programming), I thought to myself `I should watch it to see if it truly does deserve to be on my list' and that `it couldn't have been that bad'. Plus I had to kill 2 hours before going out so I thought `why not?' For some reason I must have repressed more than I thought, or I just didn't get a good enough sample the first time, but in any case the full viewing of this utter waste of celluloid will haunt me for the rest of my days. I won't go into detail as to why the film is so putrid, I believe many here have already accurately recounted the many shortcomings, however I did want to mention that the film is now firmly enshrined in my top 10 worst list, having been revised down to a 1/10 (and now that's being gracious). If there's one recommendation I can make it's to not see the film, save yourself 91 minutes of pain (or if you're into S&M, pleasure), or if you absolutely have to see it (ie. you have a death wish) then bear in mind that you're in for a movie that should really have been directed by Alan Smithee, and then even he would have wanted to change his name before it was released."

Perhaps my expectations were too high. That's not the only problem.\n\nThis is a very bad movie. One notable mention is the fact that only two actors from the first movie reprised their roles. That's a very bad sign alone. Christopher Lambert is not back as Raiden sucks. Lambert was good as the Raiden and the schmuck that played Raiden here looked and acted like a total flake. He cannot fill the shoes of Lambert at all. This movie also has some silly to lame action sequences. Another problem is despite the many characters here, many of them are just cameos. We only see Nightwolf for a minute and that's that. The likeness of the Kombat characters here is the only redeeming quality MK:Annihlation has got.\n\nThis movie is also unintentionally hilarious. There is a lot of cheese to fly around and lots of campy acting to be the ultimate \"B\" movie, just without the fun.\n\nThe first installment is worlds better than this. It featured a fine cast, a good story, interesting characters and a fantastic villain. Shao Khan here comes of as a club bouncer in a costume.\n\nNow I know why many of the actors did not reprise their roles, after reading the script, would you blame them?\n\nThe Last Word: Total disaster. Mortal Kombat had the potential to be the next big movie franchise. With this, those dreams were destroyed. Pity. I would like to find the director and Finish Him! Jerk."

Other than that, there is so much low budget acting, action, directing and effects that it is impossible to believe this movie was theatrically released."

There are more characters , Robin Shou's acting is way better then the first movie .\n\nWhat more can you expect of a movie !! it had it's ups and downs i agree , but it sticks to the video game right , the video game never killed Johnny Cage , because the video game never had a storyline !!

        "review_detailed_main": "This feels one of those really bad cosplays you see on the internet where people just barely look like the characters and embrace it at a convention. From the atrocious script, the questionable actors and horrible CGI this movie has. There is about as much complexity in the store as an adult movie.\n\nI have no idea why Raiden cuts his hair half way into the movie. He has the right voice to be the \"god of thunder\" but when he cuts his hair he has this almost Neil Patrick Harris look to him and I cannot take him seriously.\n\nYes this movie is about a video game with nothing but fighting but the script is atrocious, it's like a movie called \"Fighting ace\" where 80-85% of the movie is fighting. I feel if the script is good or there was a balance we'd keep seeing them instead of cramming everyones favorite characters that the they played as in the rigged arcade machines in the 90s (this has been proven).\n\nI love the fact Johnny Cage is hardly in this movie as he was horrible. The worst actor in this has to be Jax. They made him way too ghetto. I don't know how else to describe him.\n\nThe dialogue between everyone to Jade half way into the movie was it written by a 12 year old or was someone really into that woman who can barely act as if they got their girlfriend or someone in the movie just so they would sleep with them.\n\nThe actor who plays Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) is another hilariously awful actor in this movie. Yet for some reason. Sindel played by Musetta Vander everyone considers the worst in this movie for her iconic \"too bad.... YOU ... will die\". To that I say there are far worst lines out there. The only role I liked Brian in was the 1980s cult classic Cobra with Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe awful rave sounding techno rock music sounds awful, the CGI can get hilariously bad. Yes this movie is almost 30 years old but then again look at Terminator 2 and others from years prior.\n\nAlthough this movie had somewhat of a plot otherwise this would get a 1 star. I tried 3 times to finish it. I love so bad they are good movies but this was so terrible it should never have came out."

        "review_detailed_main": "Yep this horrible piece of garbage was not only the worst sequel and video game based movie; it was probably the worst movie ever made. I can give out hundreds of reasons why this was a terrible movie. But to save space I'm not gonna give all of them.\n\nAfter the success of the original Mortal Kombat film the sequel was highly anticipated among fans. When most saw it, the film was a total disaster and a box office flop. Viewers not familiar with the games knew it was terrible b/c the recasting was horrifying, the direction was bad, the dialogue was wooden, the acting was lame, the script was poorly written, the special effects were cartoonish and the fights looked more like carefully choreographed dance routines. I think the actors were in this for just one reason, the $$$$$. I think this movie flopped because the characters were played by unknowns. I didn't know who any of them were before I saw it. Well Except for Robin Shou and Talisa Soto because they were the only actors from the original that came back for this one. Not only did they come back Shou looked like he had forgotten how to act and Soto looked like she had forgotten how to fight.\n\nOverall the movie looked like an 85 minute Power Ranger ripoff! Most of the outfits looked like cheap costumes bought out of some Halloween shop. Most of the characters were just thrown in there for (3 minutes) no reason. It looked like their only goal was to fit in as many characters as possible without developing them. Even though they did that it felt like there weren't enough characters in the film. The fights were way too short; they were less than 2 minutes long. What was the point of going underground in those metal balls??? They looked like an American Gladiator ripoff! Sheeva and Motaro looked more like humans in costumes rather than vicious-threatening creatures. Shao Kahn looked more like a human bully without his mask. The annoying techno/dance music made it look more like a trashy music video.\n\nThe recasting on the same characters was a disaster. You got these new actors that were so not talented like the original actors. The new Rayden (James Remar) and the new Sonya (Sandra Hess) failed to bring out the appearance and portrayal Christopher Lambert and Bridgette Wilson brought into them. Sandra Hess made Sonya look more like a sluty model rather than a military woman. Lynn `Red' Williams sucked as Jax; he was a military general who talked like a street thug from the hood. Give me a break, black men in the military/army do not talk like gangsters from the hood. Rayden looked more like Sting when he gave himself that cheesy make-over.\n\nI can go on and on about why this horrible adventure film looked more like some poor excuse to make money. For now I think you all get the point of my review.\n\n0/5 I give a big fat 0 because I saw no effort put into this. I saw laziness and selfishness put into it."

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation rolled around and whatever worked in Mortal Kombat failed to work here. Everything about it was bad. The plot, the acting, and the screenplay filled with lame lines. It goes without saying that Mortal Kombat: Annihilation suffered a fatality at the box office, consigning it to one of the worst movies of 1997.\n\nAdapting most of the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 which was a huge hit on video consoles worldwide, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation sees the return of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess), Johnny Cage (Chris Conrad) and Raiden (James Remar). Interestingly Bridgette Wilson, Linden Ashby, and Christopher Lambert wisely chose not to return for the sequel. Aided by Kitana (Talisa Soto), the warriors must battle Shao Khan (Brian Thompson) to prevent the takeover of Earth.\n\nTaking over the director's chair from Paul W.S. Anderson who wisely moved on is John R. Leonetti who is responsible for this mess of a movie.\n\nMortal Kombat: Annihilation was just atrocious, and an example of one of the worst sequels. Stick with the first movie, in fact stick with the video games.\n\nGame over for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\n\n1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the \"long journey\" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!"

It was disappointing that there haven\u00b4t been any bloody fatalities like in the game. For all that it\u00b4s an absolute \"must-seeing-movie\" for all Mortal Kombat fans.

In fact, \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" just continued on with the same pointless tirade of having characters from an arcade fighting game beat each other up in a soup of very weak storyline.\n\nThe CGI effects in this 1997 sequel was every bit as horrible as it was in the 1995 movie. It was gut wrenching to witness those demons and the dragon duel on the screen, because the CGI animation was just atrocious, and the textures looked like they were borrowed directly from the PC game version of Mortal Kombat.\n\nAs for the acting, well some people were doing good enough jobs here, despite the fact of having nothing to work with in terms of script and storyline. However, why they opted for Brian Thompson as the main villain was just simply beyond my comprehension.\n\nIf you enjoyed the 1995 \"Mortal Kombat\" movie then you will also like the 1997 sequel \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\". However, unless you are a fan, then there is very little to get from this movie."

It has great music, sets, fights and actors. It adds in more of the MK lore and characters--which I love. That being said, there are definitely parts where the writing gets sloppy, especially with new entries and prior characterization established in the 1st movie. Also, a lot of people will say that the effects have aged badly and that the tone of this one is very cheesy. It's a Mortal Kombat movie--it's supposed to be a good time, not a masterpice. It's a fun romp that ups the stakes while engaging the audeince. I like it a lot. You can feel the love in it."

This movie is SO horrible...you want a review...OK.. people jump around a lot..and everything look ridiculous and fake and what else...the lighting is probably the worst ever devised in any movie..so thats probably not easy to pull off..good work.

All that makes me not turn it off, is curiosity, what level of stupidity can achieve a single movie. I just wonder and really interesting, will it become worse or it will stop regressing at some point.\n\nTime is about 21:00: My mom is back home, she wakes me up and turns off TV...

Not a lot to say about it really, other than the whole thing is a giant plot hole! It makes no sense what-so-ever, as it makes the entire first movie completely pointless. Even if it did make sense, it still isn't much of a plot. They have 6 days to save the word from total destruction. OK, whatever, not as bad as you might think, right? Wrng. The majority of the film could take place in less than a day, so I really wonder what the hell they were doing for the other 5. Stupid plot.\n\nMoving on, I'll mention the actors. Oh God, the actors. Most of the returning characters from the first movie are replaced by new, even worse actors. I'm really glad that they killed off Johnny Cage within the first couple minutes, as that actor seemed to be the worst of the bunch. Sonja Blade's replacement was pretty awful as well, and saw fit to completely change the character.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be so hard on the actors. I mean, look at the script. This movie could have had Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson, but even they would have looked terrible having to say some of these pathetically cheesy lines.\n\nOne thing that I'll give this film is that it has some half decent fight scenes. Nothing spectacular, and the CGI is really bad, but at least they were mildly entertaining.\n\nIn all honesty this isn't a whole lot worse than the first film, but it is really, really bad. Id avoid it.\n\n4/10"

Anderson being the director). This sequel picks right up where its 1995 predecessor left off and sort of goes downhill from that point on.\n\n\"MK\" cameos abound in this sequel, almost none of which are given their fair share of screen time or character development. You know who I'm talking about; I'm talking about Cyrax, Smoke, Kabal and Stryker (who are mentioned but never seen), Mileena, Nightwolf, Rain, Ermac, Baraka, Sub-Zero (unmasked), Scorpion, Noob Saibot, and Reptile.\n\nAll these characters are seen (or talked about) in this movie but are barely given the time they were so kindly awarded in the video games. Most of these characters had made their debuts in \"Mortal Kombat 2\" or \"3\" but we barely see them or know who they are (this is especially troubling for those that may have never played the games).\n\nThe acting is way out there, the script tried to be something more than it was (apparently a lot more was filmed but dropped from the finished product - damn execs) and the fights are sub-par.\n\nThe reason for my disdain is the fact that I loved Anderson's first movie and I found it difficult to sit through this entry.\n\nI only hope \"3\" redeems the series.\n\n3/10"

For no reason at all, Liu Kang spontaneously transforms into a giant dragon and fights Shao Kahn who also spontaneously transforms into a giant dragon. This scene was the most ridiculous display of cinema I have ever witnessed in my life. The rest of the movie was only terrible, but the ending topped of the movie so perfectly to the point of wanting to slam my head in the T.V. to stop watching. The bad acting and pointless martial arts wasn't enough. They had to bring a couple of massive dragons to fight as though they were from a much earlier Godzilla movie to finish off a terrible movie.\n\nI know that this does not seem much like a review, in fact it is much closer to just a ramble of my warnings but it is near impossible to give a review for a movie that I could very well consider one of the worst movies of all time. Do not see the pointless, incoherent, garbage.\n\nI do not recommend this movie to anyone other than John Leonetti, who made it so he can wallow in his own crap for a good couple hours.

In this movie Liu Kang is the hero in white, without the personal demons he had to face in the first. The fights are spectacular and quite enjoyable. The movie is great-especially if viewed directly following the original MK movie."

Please. I've seen better stuff out of old \"Gamera\" movies. This movie introduced almost every character from Mortal Kombat Trilogy only to kill them off five seconds after their debut. What's the point of that other than to say that \"this character\" was in the movie? All it accomplished was bogging down what little plot there is. The story itself (based off MK3 and MK4), was shaky, the techno music was nowhere near as good as the first film, and the whole movie seemed uneven and a waste of film. It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a \"film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes.\"\n\nI've talked to more than a fair share of people who have said this movie is \"wonderful\". Of course, all of these people were die-hard MK fans who feel that anything with the famous dragon logo can do no wrong.\n\nWant a Mortal Kombat movie to watch? Watch the first film. At least that one is a fun movie to sit through and enjoy. Too bad MK:A didn't live up to the first one. The line \"Pretty cool, huh? That's my Animality\" made me absolutely groan in agony that I actually spent money to see this. Avoid this movie."

        "review_detailed_main": "The follow up sequel to the 1995 Mortal Kombat film sees a lesser version in about every aspect. Considered the original film to not be great but having some entertainment value. Annihilation is easily worse for many reasons.\n\nFirst the special effects look cheaper, the graphics and overall costumes of the characters look cheap and resemble that of parodies. The acting is lowered and at times embarrassing. The dialogue feels amateurish.\n\nThe characters are worse. People may have found Johnny Cage to be annoying in the original but he was a better character than Jax in this film. The recast of Sonya was a slight upgrade. Kitana is essentially the same. Liu Kang is worse here, more annoying and \"in the way\" (the acting by Robin Shou seems uninspired). The recast of Raiden is also downgrade. None of the villains really stand out. Sub-zero and Scorpion have brief scenes.\n\nThis film tried craming in too many characters without given them much to do. The fight scenes are just as tame and even though there may be more overall in this sequel, they aren't memorable. A lot of the fight scenes just feel randomly placed. The finale battle drags on and feels bland. Predictable and without any gore or strong violence, it just doesn't work well.\n\nOverall the plot is sort of a rehash of the original but this here feels less inspired and more rushed."

        "review_detailed_main": "While I didn't think the first film was fantastic, it was enjoyable and seemed to go at a more decent pace and a plot that at least was able to hold itself together through the whole way. The good thing was that it focused on three main central characters.\n\nIn MKA, it puts too many characters altogether, some making appearances then getting wiped out with no dramatic effect. Take Sheeva for example who is one of the most intriguing characters in the game - her demise was so laughable and stupid there was really no point putting her in the film. What a waste!\n\nI thought Sindel wasn't too bad, but with her bad dialogue, it was quite ridiculous in many ways. She didn't feel much like a fighter, especially with the fight with Kitana at the end - Kitana could have knocked her down in a second - horrible choreography.\n\nWhy did they make Jade a traitor? I thought she was one of the good characters in the game, not a traitor. And what's more - why didn't they make her character black? She is not Asian! I think they just wanted to bring some chemistry between her and Liu Kang but hey it didn't work!\n\nThe visual effects seemed more obvious and cheesy than in the first and a lot of the cast are replaced by new actors. James Remar does not make an interesting Raiden nor a worthy one that is worthy of being feared or respected as the Thunder God. I didn't mind the new actress who played Sonja but the original had more toughness and attitude in her performance. The way Sonja was portrayed made her a bit more softer than fierce - Bridgett Wilson just kicked ass all the way.\n\nActing wise, it's pretty flat and it doesn't help with some corny lines. Kitana and Sindel get some of the funniest lines 'My mother's dead....'as soon will be her daughter!' Overall, the film feels like it's going in too many directions, introducing new characters out of nowhere and not really drawing you into this world. Talisa Soto seems to have the same expression on her face most of the time and really fell flat in this one whereas in the original she seems like she was enjoying herself a bit more.\n\nOh and the ending was so cheesy - how they all walk off hand in hand arms around each other. I think they could have made it a bit more...dramatic. I mean the first one's ending was similar but it seemed to have more of a punch.\n\nIf you can overlook a lot of its faults, you'll have a fairly amusing time with this but in the end you'll be wondering how they managed to make this really uninspiring or suspenseful for a story that is meant to be about saving the world."

It's not like the first Mortal Kombat was a truly good film, but they still understood what a Mortal Kombat movie should deliver, techno music and cool fight scenes. Annihilation felt like a complete parody of the first film, with bad acting, bad dialogue, bad writing, bad visual effects, bad green screens and stock footage, bad fight choreography, bad costumes, etc. It was just bad from start to finish, in a way that truly makes it so bad that it's good because of the amount of unintentional comedy gold."

I, however, enjoy watching really bad movies, and am an MK fan. I also saw this movie when I was nine, and proceeded to think it was the greatest movie of all time. Nostalgia can be pretty fun sometimes.\n\nThe story is, well, non-existent. Shao Kahn has violated the rules of the tournament and has invaded Earth using the resurrection of the previously-deceased Queen Sindel, Kitana's mother. This, of course, is briefly mentioned once or twice in the movie and no explanation is given. I only knew it because it's the premise of MK3. Anyway, our heroes Liu Kang, Kitana, Raiden, Sonya and Jax proceed on a seven-day long quest to save Earth, which is miraculously completed in about 90 minutes. Fight scenes are alright...just gotta remember it's pyre-Matrix and Hollywood. They'd be better if the direction wasn't so bad. Sometimes they can go at a nice, fast pace and then slow down for no reason, just to draw out the impact. The result is cheesy.\n\nIf it's on Spike TV some night (and it is, a lot), don't be afraid to tune in for a few minutes. Even if you're completely new to the material, you may laugh yourself silly.

This movie is directed by John Leonetti (Annabelle) and stars James Remar (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Brian Thompson (Cobra), Talisa Soto (Spy Hard) and Robin Shou (Death Race). The storyline for this, like the previous film, was kind of blah. The script and acting was also dreadful and why couldn't they find a good Raiden for either film? However, the fight scenes, while inconsistent, was much better than the first film. Some of the CGI fight sequences worked and some of them didn't, like the entire opening scene (which was dreadful). The use of characters in this was so much better than the first film, loved the addition of the robots. There wasn't really a worthwhile villain to get excited about, unfortunately. They really struggled putting together a worthwhile movie about Mortal Kombat until recently. This is only worth watching for diehard fans of the series or for nostalgia purposes. I'd score this a 5.5/10."

Admittedly Peck Prior didn't have much to work with but there are several points during the fight scenes where you can't even tell what's going on.\n\nWhile the sets of the original had a cool expressionist look, these had the look of a Power Rangers movie.

        "review_detailed_main": "So the new Mortal Kombat film finally makes its way to The UK tomorrow which means I have just watched the last Mortal Kombat film made Annihilation and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the warriors of Earthrealm attempt to stop Shao Kahn's invasion.\n\nMain Character Robin Shou as Liu Kang and Talisa Soto as Kitana were the only actors who reprised their role from the previous film and after watching this train wreck it is easy to see why. Neither of them are very good in the film and it seems like they were the only ones who signed a 2 film contract so they were forced to be here. The characters are so bland and you won't care about them or anybody that appears on screen.\n\nSupporting Characters James Remar takes up the role of Raiden and he is so dull and poor. At least Christopher Lambert is so over the top its ridiculous but Raiden is given way more to do in this film and the character just isn't very interesting with Rear clearly not enjoying himself at all. Sandra Hess and Lynn Williams take up the roles of Sonya and Jax respectively and they offer very little and Jax actually became really annoying and I was wishing he had as much screen time as he did in the first film. At least the new guy they cast as Johnny Cage realised he only wanted a small role and doesn't barely appear here. Shao Khan is finally here as the villain and he is so clich\u00e9, the awesome character from the game is gone and replaced by this bloke who isn't actually that intimidating. There are more characters from the games here but they are used so poorly that I just wish they hadn't bothered.\n\nStory The story is all over the place. It's like the film wants to get through the majority of the stories in the game but it rushes all of the without explanation and it makes fans like me incredibly frustrated. The whole plot is absurd and there is one element of the film that breaks all kinds of lore and makes the film laughably stupid with a really stupid ending.\n\nScript The script of the first film had some charm, yes it was cheesy but it kind of worked. This one is just so bad, with a mix of terrible acting and terrible acting it is just terrible and left me shaking my head as to how somebody got paid to write this mess.\n\nStyle Now the most important part of Mortal Kombat - the fights. They are terrible, the overuse of slow mo is obvious because the cast just weren't particularly great at fight choreography or at least making them. Then you get the effects, they are so bad, maybe some of the worst I have ever seen. I know people will say it had a small budget, then they shouldn't have tried this rubbish.\n\nOverall Overall, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is no redeeming qualities to this film and no wonder it has taken nearly 25 years for a big budget reboot, avoid this film at all costs.\n\nRating - 1/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Okay, it's confession time. There's a part of me that really enjoys these movies. Like many of my generation, I grew up playing the games, and they were definitely among my favourites. I saw the first \"Mortal Kombat\" when I was about twelve or so, and at the time really I enjoyed it. And now, many years later, I've finally got round to watching the sequel.\n\nThe first \"Mortal Kombat\" at least tries to pass itself off as a film ... but there's none of that here. This movie is a feature length, non-interactive computer game. Only most computer games have better scripts. Okay, that's a little harsh ... some computer games have better scripts. I was prepared enjoy this movie, but that wasn't helped by the fact that Johnny Cage, the most interesting character from the original, is killed off in the first five minutes. The little kid in me screamed \"How dare they!\" when that happened.\n\nWe have a few new characters introduced ... there's a black guy with steel arms, some Chinese chick, another girl with four arms, and scorpion and sub zero's brothers pop in for quick visit too. The big baddie, Khan, is played by Brian Thompson who you'll probably recognised as the alien bounty hunter from the X-files, various roles on Buffy, a role on the TV series \"Werewolf\", or various other cult appearances. He along with the rest of the cast give the appropriate over-the-top performances. I mean, what else could they do? Ten to twelve year old boys might enjoy this movie, and I know I probably would have at that age. But it's far too silly for everyone else."

        "review_detailed_main": "Too many actor/actress changes take away from the first film and it never really recovers. The story is pretty weak, but it serves its purpose. It was never meant to be a masterpiece, just released close enough to the first to make a bit of money. But elements in it were hella forced and didn't need to be there. Others were just like......meh. I still enjoy it for what it is, a memory from childhood."

Personally the story didn't bother me that much, in fact it was on track with the storyline in the MK3 video game, (except for the relationship between Rayden and Shao Kahn). Overall it was a real let down.\n\nI gave this a 4/10."

        "review_detailed_main": "Mortal Kombat was a fine film, and one of the few films based on a video game to get it right. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation fails miserably. Where MK1 took the time to introduce you to the characters and submerge you in the world, MKA picks up from the end of the first movie and just throws a whole bunch of stuff against the wall.\n\nRain, Sheeva, Noob Saibot, Mileena, Smoke, Cyrax, Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Baraka all make completely unnecessary cameos that cripple their ability to actually play out their storylines in any future sequels. Raynor Scheine is a weak Shinnok, another character who just seems forced into the story. Nightwolf is a character with promise, and indeed, he does- promises to teach Liu Kang three things. Instead, he chucks an axe at Liu's head and teaches him nothing.\n\nSandra Hess takes over Bridgette Wilson's role as Sonya, but fails to give the requisite attitude needed to win over the audience. We don't believe her connection to Cage, who is not only replaced by another actor, but killed off altogether within the first five minutes completely unceremoniously.\n\nJames Remar is laughably weak as Raiden, a role which veteran actor Christopher Lambert previously completely owned. His performance is bland and uninspired, and the jokes seem forced. Brian Thompson gives a cringingly bad interpretation of Shao Kahn, the \"super villain\" who's afraid of his own father and leaves the audience wondering if he was really suppoed to be all that bad. John Medlen's Ermac is silent and unimportant, and Deron McBee's Motaro is a completely two dimensional character.\n\nMeanwhile, original cast members Robin Shou and Talisa Soto act emotionlessly and without gusto, something definitely not lacking in their earlier performance.\n\nSome of the bright spots in the film come courtesy of newcomers Lynn Williams, Musetta Vander, and Irina Pantaeva, who do surprisingly good jobs as Jax, Sindel, and Jade, respectively, though Pantaeva's character is disposed of at completely the wrong time.\n\nThe movie is cheap, and cut corners, including Baraka's supposed death scene, which is just a repeat of Rain being knocked into the fire, and the cheap animalities that closed the movie, which are infamously the worst feature of an awful movie. Overall, one is left with the sense that the producers didn't care about the characters of the Mortal Kombat universe, which the first movie definitely left you satisfied.\n\nSo, overall, I give it an 8/10. Why?\n\nIt's so bad, it's good.\n\nIt's the kind of movie you sit down and laugh your ass off at. Not because it's a comedy, but because it's so bad, that it's genuinely entertaining.\n\nSo, if you can put aside the fact that the premise for a possibly good sequel was butchered by bad acting, bad effects, too many characters, needless deaths, and cheap production, it's a fantastic flick to watch with your friends if you're in the mood for what will soon be a cult classic."

        "review_detailed_main": "This movie wasn't that bad actually. It's got a lot of colourful special effects, and good music. But when so many people worked on the story/screenplay (I think there are 5 people credited, including John Tobias, one of the creators of the game), I expected something better. Anyway, I give it 6/10."

One villain after another would come on by and there would hardly be an explanation. They didn't even explain Mileena. Had a lot to live up to from the first movie but didn't deliver, with the exception of the Rayden character. He was decent."
